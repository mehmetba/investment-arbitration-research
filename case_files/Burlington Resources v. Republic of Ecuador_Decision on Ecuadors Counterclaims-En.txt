THE PARTIES
A. The Counter-Claimant

The Counter-Claimant is the Republic of Ecuador (“Ecuador” or the “Counter-Claimant”
or the “Respondent”).

The Counter-Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Dr. Diego Garcia
Carrién, Procurador General del Estado, Dr. Blanca Gémez de la Torre, Directora de
Asuntos Internacionales y Arbitraje, Dr. Christel Gaibor, and Dr. Diana Moya at the

Manuel Garcia Represa, Mr. Philip Dunham, Mr. Alvaro Galindo, Ms. Maria Claudia
Procopiak, Ms. Audrey Caminades and Ms. Gabriela Gonzalez Giraldez of the law firm
DECHERT (Paris) LLP; and by Professor Pierre Mayer who left DECHERT (Paris) LLP on
1 June 2015.

B. The Counter-Respondent

The Counter-Respondent is Burlington Resources Inc. (“Burlington” or the “Counter-
Respondent” or the “Claimant”), a corporation created under the laws of the State of
Delaware, United States of America, in 1988 and active in the exploitation of natural
resources. On 31 March 2006, Burlington was acquired by ConocoPhillips, a
multinational energy company with headquarters in the State of Texas, United States of
America.

The Counter-Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Nigel Blackaby,
Ms. Noiana Marigo, Ms. Lauren Friedman, Mr. Leon Skornicki and Ms. Giulia Previti of

Ms. Sara McBrearty of the law firm KING & SPALDING; and by Mr. Javier Robalino-

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The counterclaims addressed in this decision (the “Decision”) were filed as part of
ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, which has already given rise to decisions on jurisdiction and
liability and which will end by the notification of an Award shortly following this Decision.

A. Initial Phase

Pursuant to Rule 40(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Ecuador asserted two
counterclaims in its Counter-Memorial on Liability of 17 January 2011. Although
Burlington initially stated that it would challenge the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Parties
later executed an agreement dated 26 May 2011 by which Burlington accepted the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the counterclaims.’

B. Written Phase

After having consulted with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 on
21 July 2011 (Procedural Orders are referred to herein as “PO” followed by their
respective numbers; for example, Procedural Order No. 8 is “PO8”), which referred to
and annexed the Parties’ jurisdictional agreement and contained the calendar for the
written phase of the counterclaims proceedings.

In accordance with this calendar as later amended on the Parties’ request, Ecuador
filed a Supplemental Memorial on Counter-Claims on 30 September 2011 and a
Second Supplemental Memorial on Counter-Claims on 24 April 2012. Burlington then
filed its Counter-Memorial on Counter-Claims on 29 September 2012. Ecuador filed its
Reply on 18 March 2013 and Burlington its Rejoinder on 8 July 2013.

On 6 July 2012, the Tribunal issued PO9 with regards to Burlington’s request for
production of documents. On 14 December 2012, the Tribunal issued PO10 with regard
to Ecuador's request for production of documents. On 22 May 2013, the Tribunal issued
PO13 with regard to Burlington’s additional requests for production of documents.

On 8 April 2014, the Tribunal issued PO16 with regard to Ecuador's request to add new
evidence to the record. On 16 April 2014, the Tribunal issued PO17 with regard to
Burlington’s request to add new evidence to the record. On 16 May 2014, the Tribunal
issued PO20 with regard to Burlington’s request to add new evidence in response to
exhibits admitted by the Tribunal in PO16.

Agreement between Burlington et al. and Ecuador dated 26 May 2011 (Exh. E-251).

14

C. Hearing on Counterclaims

Pursuant to PO14 dated 16 July 2013, the hearing on counterclaims (the “Hearing”)
was initially set to take place from 26 August to 31 August 2013. Due to the Proposal
for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufa submitted on 25 July 2013,
the proceedings were suspended in accordance with Rule 9(6) of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules. The proceeding was resumed on 10 January 2014 following the disqualification
of Professor Orrego Vicufia and the appointment of Mr. Stephen Drymer as arbitrator.
The Hearing was thus rescheduled and, in accordance with PO19 dated 16 May 2014,
took take place from 1 to 7 June 2014.

The Hearing was held at the World Bank offices in Paris. The following persons
attended the Hearing:

Post-Hearing Briefs on 3 October 2014.

On 22 December 2014, the Tribunal issued PO24 with regard to Burlington’s requests
for production of documents, of which one request partially related to the counterclaims
proceedings.

E. Site Visit

Having secured the Parties’ consent at the Hearing, the Tribunal proceeded with the
inspection of a number of sites within Blocks 7 and 21 (the “Site Visit”). The Tribunal
informed the Parties by letter of 23 July 2014 that the main objective of the Site Visit
was to focus on (i) soil contamination, including issues of topography and groundwater
and (ii) land use, including the Sumaco Biosphere Reserve.” Upon the invitation and
with the guidance of the Tribunal, the Parties drew up a Joint Site Visit Protocol (the
“Protocol”). For this purpose, the Parties and the Tribunal held two telephone
conferences, respectively on 8 October 2014 and 4 November 2014. The Protocol was
executed by the Parties on 20 January 2015.

The Protocol was incorporated into PO30 dated 25 March 2015. It set out the scope of
the Site Visit, provided for the preparation of joint site information packets (“Joint Site
Packets”), addressed pre-Site Visit inspections, detailed the Site Visit itinerary and
schedule, provided for a confidentiality regime as well as immunities, and touched on
miscellaneous other issues, such as transportation and security, accommodation, food,
safety and health.

Up to 12 representatives per Party were permitted to attend at each visited site.*

Counsel for the Parties were invited to make oral presentations at each site and to
respond to the Tribunal’s questions. The Tribunal also addressed questions to the
group of experts and to the fact witness designated by each Party for a given site.*
Follow-up questions by the Parties were not allowed, subject to the Tribunal’s
permission under certain circumstances (such as the particular relevance of the topic
and available time), which was in fact granted on many occasions.°

Under the Protocol, Party presentations were considered to be in the nature of
submissions and expert and witness responses to Tribunal questions were deemed to
be evidence. Accordingly, the experts and witnesses who participated in the Site Visit
made the declaration provided in Rule 35(2) or (3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules at the
outset of the Site Visit.®

The Protocol further specified that any objection regarding the conduct of the Site Visit
had to be raised immediately whenever possible and at the latest at dinner time on the
day when the incident complained of occurred.” In fact, informal debriefing meetings
were held each day before dinner to discuss the conduct of the Site Visit that day and to
seek to agree on possible improvements.

The Joint Site Packets included information relating to the specific sites to be visited (for
instance, excerpts from expert reports, pleadings, photographs, maps and/or historical
records), their content being limited to evidence already in the record.® The Parties
agreed that no sampling was to be undertaken and that no media would be disturbed

F. Post Site Visit Phase

Pursuant to paragraph 31 of the Protocol and paragraph 2 of PO31 dated 21 April 2015,
the ICSID Secretariat made copies of the unedited audio/video recording available to
the Parties on 21 April 2015. It also provided the Parties with the “floor” transcripts on
19 May 2015 and circulated the translated transcripts on a rolling basis from 31 May
2015 to 6 June 2015.

Burlington objected to Ecuador’s wish to make public use of the audio/video recording.
The Tribunal decided that absent the consent of both Parties, under the Protocol and
Regulation 22(2) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, the audio/video
recording and its transcript could not be made available to the public or used outside
the present proceedings. However, in light of Ecuador's insistence on its duty of
transparency within its domestic legal framework, the Tribunal indicated that if Ecuador
wished to use the audio/video recording and/or transcript, it could apply for leave from
the Tribunal by (i) identifying with precision the excerpts which it wished to use, (ii)
describing the specific purpose for which the identified excerpts would be put to use,
and (iii) explaining the reasons why such publication is deemed necessary."® Ecuador
did not seek leave from the Tribunal thereafter.

In accordance with PO31, the Parties filed Post-Site Visit Briefs on 15 July 2015. In
PO31, the Tribunal had asked the Parties to jointly file certain depth-integrated maps for
the sites inspected during the Site Visit so as to enable the Tribunal to more easily
compare the Parties’ respective delineations of the alleged contamination and of the
areas to be remediated as a result. This request raised difficulties for the parties in
terms of the data required to generate these maps and the potential use of data and
maps not previously filed in the record. As a result, after a lengthy series of
correspondence, the Tribunal advised the Parties on 12 August 2015 that, in light of
such unexpected difficulties, it preferred not to receive these maps.

Following the issuance on 14 August 2015 of the Interim Decision on Ecuador's
Environmental Counterclaim in ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Perenco Ecuador Limited v.
the Republic of Ecuador (“Perenco v. Ecuador’), the Tribunal invited the Parties to
provide their comments on that decision, which they did on 18 September 2015.

In the course of its deliberations, the Tribunal provided the Parties with status reports
on its progress on 13 November 2015, on 25 February 2016, on 27 July 2016 and on
29 November 2016. Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Parties filed their cost
submissions on 2 May 2016, and their reply submissions on 23 May 2016.

By letter of 18 January 2017, Ecuador requested leave from the Tribunal to submit the
audio and video recording of the site visit to Blocks 7 and 21 conducted in Perenco v.
Ecuador. By letter of 20 January 2017, Burlington objected to Ecuador's request. After
due deliberation, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that the submission of the audio
and video recording of the site visit in Perenco v. Ecuador would not assist the
resolution of the counterclaims in these proceedings. Accordingly, by letter of
25 January 2017, the Tribunal denied Ecuador's request to file the audio and video
recording of the Perenco site visit into the record of this arbitration. Further, by means
of the same letter, the Tribunal, declared the proceedings closed as of 25 January 2017
in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).

GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING BLOCKS 7 AND 21

To the extent relevant for purposes of the counterclaims, the descriptions of fact
contained in decisions previously rendered in this arbitration, i.e. the Decision on
Jurisdiction and the Decision on Liability, are incorporated into the present Decision.
Similarly, terms and abbreviations used there are used here with the same meaning.

This section addresses various characteristics of Blocks 7 and 21 not previously
discussed, in particular as regards their geography and the oilfield operations that have
been conducted in the Blocks, including by Petroamazonas after July 2009. It is based
on allegations of facts that were not disputed or on facts that the Tribunal considers
established. Where a fact referred to has been disputed it is noted as such.

Blocks 7 and 21 are located in the provinces of Francisco de Orellana, Napo and
Pastaza, in the Amazon region of the Ecuadorian Oriente.’ Situated east of the
Andean mountains in North-Eastern Ecuador, the Oriente is located in a slightly

Other than some exploratory wells, such as Zorro and Céndor, which were drilled by
Texaco in the 1970s, Block 7 was first developed by British Petroleum Development
Limited (“British Petroleum” or “BP”) under a Service Contract concluded in December
1985 (“Service Contract”) with the then Ecuadorian State Petroleum Corporation
(Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana; “CEPE”).”° At that time, Block 7 did not
include the Coca field or the portion of the Payamino field that extended to the north of
Block 7 and that were operated by CEPE.”’ Following BP’s 1986 discovery of oil in the
Payamino field, in the northeastern corner of Block 7, CEPE’s drilling of the Payamino
2 well in 1987 and the drilling by CEPE’s upstream subsidiary Petroproduccion of the
Coca 4 and Coca 7 wells, the conclusion was reached in 1989 that the oil reservoir from
the Payamino field extended beyond the borders of Block 7 into the Coca field, thus
forming a “common oil deposit”.”°

As a result, negotiations began for a Unified Exploitation Operating Agreement for the
Common Oil Deposits of Basal Tena, Napo “U”, and Hollin Superior and Hollin Principal
of the CPUF (“Unitization Agreement’).°° On 11 October 1990, Oryx (which had
acquired 100% of BP’s rights under the Service Contract in September 1990) and
Petroecuador (which had replaced CEPE in September 1989) executed the Unitization
Agreement, providing for alternate operatorship of the CPUF between Oryx and the
State-owned enterprise Petroproduccién (which exercised Petroecuador’s rights under
the Unitization Agreement).*' Accordingly, Petroproduccién operated the CPUF
between February 1991 and February 1994. Oryx operated the CPUF between

On 18 December 1985, the Ecuador State Petroleum Corporation (“CEPE”) and BP entered into
a Services Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block Seven of the

As shown in the maps at paragraphs 38 and 412 above, Block 7 (including the CPUF)
features seven active oil fields: Payamino, Coca, Lobo, Mono, Jaguar, Oso, Gacela,
and Céndor.* As noted above, Oryx acquired British Petroleum’s interest in the Block 7
Service Contract in 1990. In 1993, Santa Fe Minerales del Ecuador, S.A. (“Santa Fe”),
Sociedad Internacional Petrolera (“Sipetrol”) and Sigdoil, S.A. (later renamed Compafia
Latinoamericana Petrolera Numero Dos, S.A. or “Clapsa II”) acquired interests in the
Service Contract. In 1995, Santa Fe transferred its rights to Preussag Energie GmbH
(‘Preussag”).°°

In 1999, Oryx became Kerr McGee Ecuador Energy Corporation (“Kerr McGee” or
“KmG’).*” In March 2000, an amendment to the Service Contract was executed and the
contractual framework was migrated into a Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”), which
was entered into between Petroecuador on the one hand, and Kerr McGee, Preussag,
Sipetrol and Clapsa II on the other hand, for the joint operation of Block 7 and the Coca-
Payamino Unified Field.** As a result of that transaction, Kerr McGee became the joint
operator of Block 7 and the Coca-Payamino Unified Field, and the two areas have been
jointly administered ever since.*° Under the Participation Contract, the Contractor
companies were to invest in the Block at their own risk in exchange for a share of the
crude oil produced.*°

In the course of 2001, Perenco Ecuador Limited (“Perenco”) and Burlington both
acquired interests in the Block 7 PSC, Perenco holding 45%"' and Burlington 42.5%.“?

Perenco became the operator of the block on 12 December 2002. The Perenco-
Burlington Consortium (the “Consortium”) then became the 100% operator of Block 7 in
September 2005.

By the time the Consortium ceased operating the Blocks in July 2009, Block 7 included
six CPFs; multiple platforms — 7 in Gacela, 11 in Mono, 7 in Jaguar, 16 in Coca, 10 in
Oso, 17 in Payamino, 4 in Lobo, and a platform in the Céndor field (a field where no oil
was found); fluid lines and pipelines connecting these facilities with each other and
beyond; three camps for employees; and a waste management area.** With Perenco as
operator, the production in Block 7 increased from approximately 13,000 barrels a day
in February 2003 to approximately 19,000 barrels a day in February 2009.“

 

With respect to Block 7, Burlington Oriente acquired a 25% interest on 25 September 2001, a
5% interest on 13 December 2001, and a 12.5% interest in September, each transaction being
duly approved and registered by the Government.

Several indigenous communities reside in Block 21, including fourteen Kichwa and
three Huaorani communities.*” Block 21 partly overlaps with the Sumaco Biosphere
Reserve, the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve, as well as with the Huaorani Indigenous
Reserve located in the eastern part of the Block.*®

Prior to 1995, Block 21 had been explored by Texaco and Exxon, each drilling a single
well in 1972 and 1987 respectively.“° On 20 March 1995 Oryx and Ecuador entered into
a Participation Contract for Block 21.°° Burlington acquired a 37.5% interest in the Block
in late 2001 and a further 8.75% in 2005 (for a total of 46.25%). Perenco owned the
remaining share and was the operator of the Block.

Although exploitation of the Block began on 8 June 2001," as late as 2002 Block 21
remained sparsely developed® with only a small number of wells and no CPF.® Actual
production in the Block began only in 2003 and it was largely developed by the
Consortium. By July 2009, the Consortium had increased the number of wells from 3
to 31° and Block 21 contained a total of 6 platforms in the Yuralpa field, 2 platforms in

Until 1999, Oryx had conducted three environmental impact studies for seismic operations, four
environmental impact studies for exploratory drilling, and one environmental impact study for the
construction of the Yuralpa-Puerto Napo pipeline. In November 1999, Oryx conducted an
environmental impact study for the Development and Production Program of the Yuralpa Field,
contemplating the construction of a CPF in Yuralpa, flow lines, two platforms, a base camp, as
well as the reactivation of two existing platforms. CMCC, 9 99-101.

Burlington highlights the fact that, in contrast to Block 7 which had already been

developed by prior operators, Block 21 only accounts for 8.3% of Ecuador’s soil

remediation claims and 16.7% of the total cost for groundwater remediation.*”

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

A.

Ecuador’s Position and Request for Relief

Ecuador's case on the counterclaims can essentially be summarized as follows:

Under Ecuadorian law, Burlington is strictly liable for any environmental damage
found in Blocks 7 and 21. There is environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21 in
the form of significant soil and groundwater pollution. IEMS, Ecuador’s
environmental experts, discovered that close to 2.5 million cubic meters of soil
and all groundwater locations tested (18) are polluted with hydrocarbons, heavy
metals or both. Burlington is liable for this damage.

Under the PSCs and Ecuadorian law, Burlington was bound to maintain the
infrastructure, and return it to Ecuador, in good working condition in accordance
with industry standards. Burlington breached this obligation and is thus liable.

As a result of these breaches, Burlington must pay damages to Ecuador in the
total amount of USD 2,797,007,091.42 composed of USD 2,507,107,626 for soil
remediation and USD 265,601,700 for groundwater remediation, USD 3,380,000
to complete groundwater studies, USD 3,500,000 for the abandonment of wells in
Block 7, and USD 17,417,765.42 for infrastructure damage,™ plus interest and

Burlington’s Position and Request for Relief

In essence, Burlington makes the following submissions:

Ecuador's multi-billion environmental claim is no more than tactical retaliation
fabricated after Burlington lodged its ICSID claim, with the objective of offsetting
the significant damages that are owed to Burlington by Ecuador for its unlawful
seizure of the Blocks.®' Similarly, the infrastructure claim is opportunistic and
lacks merit. It was fabricated to provide additional support for Ecuador’s
environmental claim. Not satisfied in having cashed in over USD 4 billion in
“unanticipated” oil revenues from the seizure of the Blocks, Ecuador now seeks
USD 2.6 billion for an alleged “tremendous environmental harm” caused by a
“series of small incidents’, and an additional USD 17 million to upgrade
infrastructure it took from the Consortium.

Ecuador in fact seeks to impose on Burlington responsibility for environmental
conditions preexisting the Consortium’s operation of Blocks 7 and 21, and even
preexisting any human activity on the Blocks. Moreover, whatever environmental
damage may be present in the Blocks today is the result of, or has been severely
exacerbated by, Ecuador's own operation and indeed expansion of oilfield
operations.

Ecuador's claims must be rejected in toto, since Ecuador relies on invented legal
tests that have never been applied in practice and are scientifically unsupported.
Alternatively, the Tribunal should evaluate the reasonable costs of remediating
“the pockets of exceedances at the two sites that are possibly attributable to the
Consortium, as would have occurred in a normal orderly handover, absent
Ecuador's unlawful actions’.°* These costs amount to USD 1.09 million and
include the remediation of Yuralpa Pad A and Jaguar 1 Area 3T.

Accordingly, in its Post-Hearing Brief, Burlington requests the Tribunal to grant the
following relief:

(a) DISMISS with prejudice Ecuador's environmental counterclaims
in their entirety;

(b) In the alternative, determine that the reasonable cost of
remediating the exceedances possibly attributable to the
Consortium, including the costs of closing four pits and
abandoning seven wells is no more than USD 1.09 million;

(c) DECLARE that, beyond the exceedances assessed by the
Tribunal, Burlington has no further liability for environmental harm
in Blocks 7 and 21;

(d) DISMISS with prejudice Ecuador’s infrastructure counterclaims in
their entirety;

(e) ORDER Ecuador to pay all of the costs and expenses of this
arbitration, including Burlington’s legal and expert fees, the fees
and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, and
ICSID’s other costs;

(f) | ORDER Ecuador to pay compound interest on the sum awarded
in (e) above, until the date of effective and complete payment, at
a rate of 4 percent compounded annually, or at such a rate and
for such a period of compounding as the Tribunal considers just
and appropriate in the circumstances; and

(g) AWARD such further and other relief as the Tribunal considers
appropriate.

The Post-Site Visit Brief did not change these requests for relief.

ANALYSIS

Having considered the Parties’ extensive submissions as well as the very extensive
evidentiary record, including the evidence gathered during the Site Visit, the Tribunal
now proceeds with its analysis of the counterclaims. It will first address various
preliminary matters (Section A). Thereafter, it will review Ecuador's environmental
counterclaims (Section B) and then turn to the infrastructure counterclaims (Section C)
before concluding on the counterclaims, including on the avoidance of double recovery

Id., 4277.

37

60.

61.

in connection with the counterclaims pending against Burlington’s consortium partner
Perenco (D). Finally, the Tribunal will discuss interest (VI) and costs (VII) before setting
out its decision (VIII).

A. Preliminary Matters

The present section deals with (1) the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the counterclaims, (2)
the scope of this Decision, (3) the relation between this arbitration and the Perenco
arbitration, (4) the law applicable to the merits of Ecuador's counterclaims, and (5)
certain evidentiary matters.

1. Jurisdiction

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction in respect of Ecuador’s counterclaims is not challenged, and
rightly so. As noted in PO8, it derives from an agreement entered into by the Parties on
26 May 2011.% In this agreement, Burlington and Ecuador expressed their agreement
and consent that this arbitration is the “appropriate forum for the final resolution of the
Counterclaims arising out of the investments made by Burlington Resources and its
affiliates in Blocks 7 and 21, so as to ensure maximum judicial economy and
consistency”.©”

Burlington committed not to raise any jurisdictional objections. The Parties further
agreed that (i) the Tribunal’s decision would be final and binding,® (ii) Ecuador
(including its emanations, agencies, instrumentalities, subdivisions and controlled
corporations) waived its right to file the counterclaims against Burlington, its
subsidiaries or any other corporation in the ConocoPhillips Group before “any
jurisdiction whatsoever whether arbitral or judicial, national or international except for
this Arbitration”.”°

Since the agreement just described deals with jurisdiction over counterclaims, one must
in addition refer to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention. Article 46 allows for
counterclaims “arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they
are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the
jurisdiction of the Centre”.”' These conditions are met here: (i) the counterclaims arise
directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, namely Burlington’s investment in
Blocks 7 and 21; (ii) they are within the scope of the Parties’ consent to ICSID
arbitration which is manifested in the agreement just referred to; and (iii) they also fall
within the jurisdiction of the Centre as circumscribed by Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention (legal dispute arising out of an investment, and nationality requirement).

2. Scope of this Decision

This Decision resolves one part of the dispute which forms the subject matter of this
arbitration, namely Ecuador’s environmental and infrastructure counterclaims raised in
the course of the proceedings over Burlington’s claims against Ecuador. Burlington’s
claims, which form the other part of this dispute, have been dealt with in part in the
Decision on Jurisdiction of 31 May 2010 and the Decision on Liability of 14 December
2012. Ecuador's request for reconsideration of the latter decision as well as the
quantification of Burlington’s claims will be settled in the forthcoming Award.

3. Relation with the Perenco arbitration

In the separate ICSID arbitration initiated by Burlington’s Consortium partner, Perenco,
Ecuador has raised counterclaims essentially resting upon the same facts and legal
arguments as those before this Tribunal. On 11 August 2015, the Perenco tribunal
issued an Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim (the “Perenco
Decision’), in which it ruled on certain issues of fact and law with a view to narrowing its
analysis of the counterclaims.”

ICSID Convention, Article 46.

Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador (“Perenco v. Ecuador’), |\CSID Case
No. ARB/08/6, Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim of 11 August 2015. The
Perenco tribunal also addressed a number of subsidiary issues.

67.

While the evidence gathered in the two proceedings was not identical, among other
things, in terms of the witnesses heard,” it remains that the two arbitrations essentially
deal with the same alleged damages. Not surprisingly, questions thus arose during the
arbitration on the relation between these two parallel proceedings, in particular in
respect of (i) their potential consolidation or other “coordination” between the two
tribunals, (ii) the admissibility in these proceedings of submissions and testimony
presented in the Perenco arbitration (including transcripts from that arbitration), (iii) the
impact of the Perenco Decision on this Tribunal’s decision-making, and (iv) the risk of
double recovery.

With respect to item (i), Ecuador opposed the possibility of a consolidation of the
counterclaim proceedings.” While acknowledging that the two arbitrations were
“parallel”, Ecuador disagreed with Burlington that they were “nearly identical”.”° At the
end of the Hearing, the Tribunal enquired whether the Parties would accept some level
of coordination between the two tribunals.” Subject to consulting with Perenco,
Burlington was in favor of such coordination if it could reduce the risk of contradictory
decisions.”’ By contrast, Ecuador maintained its opposition to consolidation and stated
that it was “too late” for a coordination between the two tribunals.”® Lacking the consent
of the Parties, the Tribunal had no choice but to refrain from any coordination with the
Perenco tribunal.

In connection with item (ii) above, the issue arose whether the Parties could rely on the
transcripts of the Perenco hearing. Ecuador opposed the introduction into the record of

Ecuador's Letter of 10 April 2014 to the Tribunal, p. 3 (mentioning that witnesses Mr. Gilberto
Martinez, Mr. Courteaud and Mr. Hoffman were heard in the Perenco arbitration but not in this
arbitration).

Letter of 10 April 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 3, citing the letter of 6 June 2012 from
Ecuador to the Perenco tribunal (Exh. E-520). The Tribunal notes that, even if the Parties had
agreed to consolidation or coordination, it would still have remained necessary to approach both
Perenco and the Perenco tribunal.

Letter of 10 April 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 3. See also: Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2357:13-
20 (Tribunal, Silva Romero): “The first comment is that these cases, Perenco and Burlington on
the counterclaims have evolved very differently. The arguments are not exactly the same in both
cases. The evidence is not exactly the same. Both tribunals have made decisions as to new
documents. There are documents that were admitted by the Perenco Tribunal that were not
admitted by this Tribunal’.

the Perenco transcripts on the grounds that it “would threaten the structural integrity of
the [present arbitration, as well as] violate the separate identity of the proceedings and
create an unacceptable risk of pre-judgment’.” Following various exchanges, the
Parties agreed to admit the Perenco transcripts, but only for impeachment purposes
during cross-examination of each other’s witnesses. Accordingly, except for a few
instances where specific passages of the Perenco transcript were used for this purpose
at the Hearing, the Perenco transcripts are not part of this record.®'

The Parties were asked to comment on the third issue, concerning the impact of the
Perenco Decision on this case, after that decision was rendered. In its comments dated
18 September 2015, Ecuador reiterated that the two sets of proceedings are separate
and invited the Tribunal to consider only the arguments and evidence before it in this
present arbitration.” For its part, Burlington commented that the Perenco Decision
“substantially narrowed the disputed issues” and therefore invited the Tribunal to
carefully assess that decision’s conclusions.* Burlington further stated that the Site
Visit effectively eliminated the need to appoint an independent expert or to engage in
further fact-finding.

The Tribunal is mindful of the separate nature of the two arbitrations and of its duty to
resolve the dispute before it solely on its own record and merits. This said, the Tribunal
is also mindful of the risk of double recovery, to which it will revert, and of the potential
risk of contradictory decisions. For reasons linked to the value of coherence of the legal
system, it considers that contradictory decisions on identical issues should be avoided

from Ecuador to the Tribunal, pp. 2-3; Letter of 21 March 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p.
2; Letter of 14 March 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 4. Ecuador further specified that the
introduction into the record of a letter of 3 June 2009 from counsel to Perenco to counsel to
Ecuador relating to the so-called “Suspension Plan” (Exh. E-311) and other documents obtained
through document productions in the Perenco arbitration (Exhs. E-433, E-434, E-464, E-467, E-

468, E-469, E-470 and E-471) “should not constitute a basis for the introduction” of the Perenco
transcripts. Letter of 10 April 2014 from Ecuador to the Tribunal, p. 4.

Letter of 28 April 2014 from the Tribunal to the Parties. On this issue, see for instance, the
discussions during the Hearing: Tr. (Day 2) (ENG), 348:16-352:14.

This said, the Tribunal notes that certain decisions, witness statements, expert reports and other
documents from the Perenco proceedings have been filed in this arbitration, especially in the
context of the phases dealing with Burlington's claims.

to the degree possible without sacrificing any party's rights of due process or fairness.
While ruling on the basis of the record in this case exclusively, the Tribunal will refer to
the Perenco Decision in those instances where, in spite of the desire to avoid
contradictions, it reaches a conclusion different from that of the Perenco tribunal.

As regards the risk of double recovery (item (iv) above), Ecuador does not dispute that
it seeks what Burlington calls “identical overlapping compensation with regard to the
same alleged damage” in both proceedings.® It also agrees that there is a risk of
double recovery.® This being so, at the end of the Hearing, Ecuador explained that it
does not intend to recover its claimed damages twice, but that it will rely on whichever
decision proves to be more favorable to its position.®” Burlington, on its part, requested
that the Tribunal expressly address the risk of double recovery, such that “if the
dispositive part of either of the awards on counterclaims provides for any compensation,
Ecuador would be prevented from enforcing the second award to the extent that it has
already been compensated by the first’.°° The Tribunal addresses double recovery
below (Section D).

4. Applicable Law

The law governing the conduct of the procedure on the counterclaims is addressed in
the rules of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the Tribunal’s
procedural orders, in particular PO8 (Proceedings on Counterclaims), PO14 (Hearing
on Counterclaims), PO21 (Post-Hearing Matters), PO30 (Site Visit), and PO31 (Post
Site Visit Matters).

As regards the substance of the dispute, it is undisputed that Ecuadorian law applies to
both the environmental and the infrastructure counterclaims. This being so, there is no
common ground between the Parties with respect to the applicability to the
environmental counterclaims of the Block 7 and Block 21 PSCs and the relevance of
international law.

With respect to the environmental counterclaims, Ecuador affirmed throughout the
proceedings that its action is solely based on Ecuadorian tort law, as opposed to
contract law, although it relies on several provisions of the PSCs to support its
interpretation of the strict liability regime under Ecuadorian law.®?

According to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal shall decide the dispute
“in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties”, absent which
“the Tribunal shall apply the law of the [host State] ... and such rules of international law
as may be applicable”.°° Here, Ecuador brings a tort action, and neither Party has
argued that the choice of (Ecuadorian) law in the PSCs encompasses torts. Therefore,
the Tribunal will apply Ecuadorian tort law, not as the law chosen by the Parties under
the first leg of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, but as the law of the host State
under the second leg of that provision. The relevance of this distinction is that, under
the second leg, international law also “may be applicable”. According to prevailing case
law,’ it is left to the Tribunal's discretion to apply either municipal or international law
depending on the type of issue to be resolved. Subject to any particular matter that may
call for the application of international law, which will be discussed if and when it arises
in the analysis, the Tribunal will thus apply Ecuadorian law to the environmental
counterclaims. The fact that the dispute is governed by tort law does not mean,
however, that the Tribunal may not look to the PSCs to inform its understanding of the
obligations assumed by the Consortium in terms of environmental stewardship.

With respect to the infrastructure counterclaims, Ecuador argues that Burlington's
liability for the poor condition of the infrastructure arises both under the Block 7 and 21
PSCs and under Ecuadorian law.” In this regard, the PSCs contain a choice of
Ecuadorian law and, accordingly, the Tribunal will apply such law (under the first leg of
Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention) as well as any relevant contractual provisions of
the PSCs.

5. Assessment of evidence

At the Hearing, in accordance with its powers in evidentiary matters, the Tribunal
suggested to the Parties that an inspection of various sites would assist its
understanding of several key issues connected to the environmental counterclaims,
such as soil and groundwater contamination, the experts’ sampling programs, land use,
the topography of the Blocks and specific sites, and the extensive modelling and
delineation employed by the Parties’ respective experts. As discussed above, both
Parties having given their consent prior to the close of the Hearing, the Tribunal decided
to conduct a Site Visit in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2)(b).°°

Further, in light of the technical nature of many of the factual issues at stake in the
environmental counterclaims, including issues explored during the Site Visit, the
Tribunal put to the Parties whether, in their view, it should seek the assistance of a
Tribunal-appointed expert in addition to the experts offered by the Parties. The Tribunal
ultimately concluded in the negative, because (i) neither Party requested the
appointment of a Tribunal expert (for example, Burlington stated that with the benefit of
the Site Visit it considered that the Tribunal was fully equipped to decide the
environmental counterclaims “without the need for an independent expert or additional
fact finding”),* (ii) it had before it extensive evidence from qualified experts, (iii) it also
had detailed evidence from fact witnesses, including persons with long-time familiarity
with the fields, (iv) it had visited relevant sites and had thus acquired a further, first-
hand, visual understanding of the physical environment in which the oil exploration and
production operations were conducted, of the situation of the platforms and the other
installations, and of the terrain and areas modelled and delineated by the experts. In
addition, (v) developing and engaging in a process involving a Tribunal-appointed
expert would have caused delays and costs which the Tribunal considered would be

See above paragraph 18.

Letter of 18 September 2015 from Burlington to the Tribunal, p. 2. At the Hearing, Burlington
indicated that the appointment of an independent expert would fall within the discretion of the
Tribunal, but that with the benefit of a site visit the Tribunal could further obtain evidence from
the Parties’ experts. The appointment of an independent expert might only become necessary
once the Tribunal decided the legal framework and some technical questions would still remain
unclear. Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2362:5-2363:7 (Tribunal, Blackaby). For its part, Ecuador stated at
the Hearing that the decision to appoint an independent expert fell within the discretionary
powers of the Tribunal, and in its letter of 18 September 2015, Ecuador did not opine on the
appointment of an independent expert. Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2367:10-13 (Tribunal, Silva Romero);

disproportionate to the possible usefulness of such an exercise in the circumstances,
and contrary to the Tribunal’s duty of efficiency.

Several issues also arose in the context of the document production exercise, which will
be addressed if and to the extent relevant to the Tribunal’s analysis of particular claims
or submissions discussed later in this Decision.

B. Environmental Counterclaims

In a nutshell, Ecuador claims that the Consortium abandoned Blocks 7 and 21 leaving
behind a massive environmental catastrophe, a claim which Burlington strongly denies
(save for an admission of liability in an amount of approximately USD 1.09 million). The
Parties are in sharp disagreement on nearly all issues of fact and law raised by these
counterclaims. To untangle this disagreement, the Tribunal will first set out the Parties’
positions on matters of law (Section 1). It will then review the regulatory framework
applicable to oilfield operations in Ecuador, in particular as it relates to environmental
protection and stewardship (Section 2). This will then allow the Tribunal to assess the
legal positions advocated by the Parties (Section 3). In the light of this assessment of
the law, the Tribunal will thereafter summarize the Parties’ positions on the facts and
proceed to analyze such facts on soil contamination (Section 4), mud pits (Section 5),
groundwater (Section 6), and well site abandonment (Section 7).

1. Parties’ positions
1.1 Ecuador’s position

1.1.1. Burlington is liable for all environmental harm in Blocks
7 and 21
According to Ecuador, Burlington is incorrect when alleging, and in any event it fails to
establish, that Ecuador's counterclaims are a mere set-off strategy. As Professor
Crespo explained at the Hearing, Ecuador's position in and approach to these
proceedings are proof that Ecuador is pursuing its constitutional obligation to vindicate
any environmental harm caused by the Consortium in Blocks 7 and 21.°° Furthermore,
Burlington's novel theory on sustainable development does not withstand scrutiny.

Tr. (Day 2) (ENG), 343:10-15 (Cross, Crespo): “Well, not only through sanctions, but also

through demanding that actions be taken completely restoring an environmental harm or
imposing administrative penalties to dissuade the economic activities so as to prevent
environmental harm’.

45

81.

82.

Sustainable development cannot amount to a “license to pollute”.°° Quite to the
contrary, this principle encompasses the polluter-pays principle, and Ecuador only
allowed oil operations to be carried out because such operations are highly regulated
and any environmental harm must be fully restored under the maxim ubi emolumentum,
ibi onus.°” If one were to accept Burlington’s permissible limits theory, it would signify
that “the Ecuadorian environment and the society at large will be forced to assume part
of the costs of Burlington’s oil activities [...]”; an unacceptable position.®* As stated by
Professor Crespo, sustainable development implies that operators internalize
environmental costs.°°

1.1.2 Burlington is strictly liable for any environmental harm
found in Blocks 7 and 21
According to Ecuador, under the 2008 Constitution, oil operators bear strict liability for
environmental harm. Strict liability means that oil operators are liable upon a mere
showing of environmental harm in the areas where they performed oil operations. The
State need not prove that the oil operator is at fault, nor that there is a causal nexus
between a breach of the duty of care and the environmental damage.'”

Under the strict liability regime, the State must only prove the existence of an economic
activity in the relevant area entailing serious risks to the environment and a negative
impact on the environment of the type that comes with such perilous economic activity.
For Ecuador, Burlington is wrong in seeking to downplay the significance of the impact
of its operations on the environment. Indeed, Burlington’s “significant admission” of
liability to restore soils in the amount to USD 10 million is itself a manifestation of a

“significant impact”.'*

activities”.

1.1.3 The 2008 Constitution applies to damage discovered
after its entry into force

In terms of temporal application, Ecuador submits that the 2008 Constitution applies to
any environmental harm discovered after its entry into force, no matter when the harm
actually occurred. Burlington did not contradict Ecuador's legal experts, Professors
Crespo and Andrade, who stated that the 2008 Constitution applies, at the very least, to
all environmental harm that occurred after its entry into force. This follows from
Articles 11.3 (direct application)’ and 396 of the 2008 Constitution (strict liability for
environmental torts), the latter providing for full reparation of any environmental harm
(“todo dafio al ambiente’).

Professor Bedon, Burlington’s expert, also did not deny that the 2008 Constitution could
apply to environmental harm preceding the entry into force of the Constitution if a
particular norm dictated its application.'° Such norm does exist, so argues Ecuador, as
the court confirmed in Nelson Alcivar in reliance on the principle in dubio pro natura
(enshrined in Article 395(4) of the 2008 Constitution),'® in the following terms:

“It is important that we highlight that the constitutional principal [sic] that
states that in doubt, the rule that most favors environmental protection
shall apply, as it is a standard that generates ample protection, the
matters contemplated by the current Constitution will apply, as it is a
standard that creates a broad protection to the environment, above the
matters outlined by the Environmental Management Law or the 1998
Constitution. The provisions of the current Constitution as it relates to
environmental issues and its protection is also preferably applied, since,
in procedural matters, the rules in force at the time of filing the action
apply, and not those that were in force when the legal situation was
created”."°°

On the notion of direct application, Ecuador refers to Doyen Roubier’s distinction between
dynamic situations and static situations. “A new law cannot govern a situation or phase that has
ended. Conversely, a new law can govern a situation that started before its enactment but which
is not yet ended. Environmental harm, i.e. continuing harm, is precisely an example of a dynamic
situation”. R-PHB, § 52, note 63.

See R-PHB, 4 54, referring to: Tr. (Day 2) (ESP), 624:18-625:3 (Cross, Bed6n), corresponding
to Tr. (Day 2) (ENG), 599:14-21 (Cross, Bed6n).

Article 395(4) of the 2008 Constitution (Exh. P-12): “In case of doubt as to the scope of legal
provisions on environmental matters, these shall be applied within the meaning most favorable
to nature's protection” (Translation by the Tribunal).

1.1.4 Environmental claims are imprescriptible

The Respondent further emphasizes that in Nelson Alcivar the court also held that,
under Article 396(4) of the 2008 Constitution, environmental claims are
“imprescriptibles’, that is subject to no statute of limitation, and that the Constitution
applies to all environmental claims filed after its entry into force.'°° Accordingly, since
Ecuador filed its environmental counterclaims in January 2011, i.e. after the entry into
force of the 2008 Constitution, Burlington cannot rely on Article 2235 of the Ecuadorian
Civil Code (the “Civil Code” or “CC”) to argue that claims relating to environmental harm
caused prior to January 2007 are prescribed, i.e. time-barred.

Burlington's argument that Ecuador's claims are time-barred with regard to harm
resulting from acts prior to January 2007, i.e. four years before Ecuador first filed its
counterclaims, is also misplaced. Burlington ignores that Article 2235 of Ecuador's Civil
Code exclusively governs fault-based liability. The present environmental claims are for
strict liability and are not subject to a statute of limitation according to Article 396(4) of
the 2008 Constitution, as acknowledged by the Claimant's expert Professor Bedon at
the Hearing.'”” Even if Article 2235 of the Civil Code were to apply, the time period for
prescription (the “clock”) would only start running upon discovery of the harm, which in
this case was after the Consortium abandoned the Blocks in July 2009.'®

This understanding of Ecuadorian law is reinforced by Burlington’s policy of concealing
and failing to report environmental harm,'®® which incidentally also does away with
Burlington’s “utterly misplaced” argument that environmental impact studies approved

by Ecuador would somehow allow Burlington to evade liability. '"°

of the liability, holding that “[lJiability for environmental harm is always strict, regardless

of whether a legal provision exists that establishes so”.''”

1.1.5. Burlington bears the burden to prove the inexistence of
harm

As regards the burden of proof, Ecuador notes that Burlington “conveniently remained
silent” on Article 397(1) of the 2008 Constitution, which places the burden of proving the
inexistence of potential or real environmental damage on the operator. Its expert
Professor Andrade explained that Ecuador must only establish the existence of a
“negative impact’, that is an “alteration of the natural environment” (something far less
than “harm”) for the burden of proof to shift to Burlington:'®

“[W]hat the Constitution did in relation to these two components — harm

on the one hand and quantum on the other, the quantum of

environmental harm — what it did it was transfer the burden of proof to

the person carrying out the activity or the defendant. So, the only

modification of the 2008 Constitution in connection with this matter is

that what must be shown, the evidence that must be given by the

Claimant, is the negative impact, obviously the impact, negative impact

upon nature. This is as far as he has to go”.'"®
More specifically, Ecuador argues that it only needs to establish that the Blocks have
been “adversely impacted”, upon which the burden shifts to Burlington to show that this
negative impact is “not significant within the meaning of the Ley de Gestidn
Ambientar’.'*° It is sufficient for it to establish that Burlington performed environmentally
risky activities in a certain area and that an adverse environmental impact of the kind
that may be caused by such activities is present in that area.'*' Finally, Professor

Andrade confirmed without being contradicted, that pursuant to Article 2217 of the Civil

Code, even if the harm to the Blocks were caused by several persons, including prior
operators, Burlington remains jointly liable with all third parties for all such harm."

1.1.6 | Under strict liability, causation is presumed

Ecuador argues primarily that under the strict liability regime, causation is presumed
and Burlington can only escape liability if it shows that force majeure, Ecuador, or a
third party caused the environmental harm.'® Burlington cannot, however, escape
liability for the actions or omissions of prior operators since the PSCs require the
operator to restore the Blocks so as to “allow the potential return to environmental
conditions similar to those encountered at the beginning of the operations”.'** In other
words, Burlington contractually agreed to repair any environmental harm found in the
Blocks that may have been caused by prior operators.'?° Nor can Burlington escape
liability by showing that it took appropriate measures to prevent damage during its
tenure as operator.'?°

More specifically, the Respondent cites to Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution under
which ‘“[lJiability for environmental harm is strict”.'*” It also refers to Article 397(1)
pursuant to which the burden to prove the inexistence of potential or real environmental
harm falls on the operator.’ In addition, in its Final Report on Natural Resources and
Biodiversity, the Constituent Assembly of Ecuador indicated that it is not for the
claimant to prove causation, but for the respondent to disprove its existence.'” This

approach was first applied in Delfina Torres’*° and again in Aguinda where the National
Court of Justice confirmed that strict liability presumes causation.'*'

Once the existence of harm in the area of oil operations is proven, the oil operator is
liable, unless it can show that the harm results from force majeure, the actions or
omissions of the victim, or a third party. As Professor Crespo explained, the rationale
for such a regime is that in most instances it is very difficult or impossible to establish
that the operator’s fault caused the environmental damage. '*

Ecuador concludes that, in the present case, there is environmental harm in Blocks 7
and 21. Since the Consortium has not demonstrated that the damage is due to force
majeure, a third party, or the victim, the Consortium is strictly liable for the harm and
must fully restore the ecosystems or pay damages to allow the State to proceed with
such restoration.'

Furthermore, Ecuador argues that, contrary to Burlington’s assertion, the presumption
of causation applies not only to entities operating simultaneously in the Blocks but also
to successive operators. Article 2217 of the Civil Code reinforces this view by providing
for joint liability “where a single harm has been caused by several tortfeasors”.'** Joint
liability in environmental law precisely addresses the issue of contamination resulting
from years of environmentally risky operations. In any event, according to the
Respondent, Burlington failed to establish that Petroamazonas caused any harm in
Blocks 7 and 21.'°

Finally, Ecuador argues that it has proven that Blocks 7 and 21 have suffered
widespread environmental harm and must be fully restored to background values, or, in

Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador, p. 48, § 20 (Exh. EL-160): “However, since the burden of proof
of such fault is almost impossible or very difficult to be borne by the victim, shifting the burden of
proof was considered necessary, in the sense that, he who uses the risky thing and takes
advantage of it must show that the harmful act was caused either by force majeure or act of
God, or the fault of a third party or the exclusive fault of the victim itself’ (Translation by the
Tribunal). See also: Ecuador's Opening Statement, Slide 48.

the alternative, to the sensitive ecosystem standard set out in Reglamento Ambiental

that that Burlington must bear the full costs of restoration.

1.1.7 Burlington must fully restore the damaged environment
to background values or, in the alternative, to the
sensitive ecosystems standard

a. Environmental harm is distinct from violations of regulatory permissible
limits

In reliance on the 2008 Constitution, Ecuador argues that Burlington is under an

obligation to repair the harm “found in the Blocks” and to restore the environment to its

original condition (restitutio in pristinum).'*® Ecuador also points to Burlington’s identical

obligation in Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 PSC and Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21

Psc.'*7

As Ecuador’s expert Professor Crespo explains, the notion of “environmental harm”
under the Constitution was intentionally left undefined in order to cover as many types
of environmental harm as possible. The notion includes the loss of biodiversity as well
as impacts on air quality, health of local populations, cultural heritage, and the local
economy. '**

According to the Respondent, Burlington’s reliance on the regulatory permissible limits
is misplaced. As Ecuador puts it, “[b]elow the numerical permissible limits, pollution is
not simply dirt that can be swept under the carpet”.'°° While a harmful activity may be

Crespo ER, § 8, item 7 and § 76; SMCC, 9 29-38. Professor Crespo indicated that the notion of

well as various types of environmental threats such as: impact on bodies of water, loss of
vegetation, loss of air quality, loss of environmental quality due to increased noise levels, loss of
wildlife, impacts on the health of local population, impact on local economies, socio-
environmental conflicts, and tangible and intangible impact on cultural heritage. Crespo ER,

conducted lawfully, it still gives rise to an obligation to repair where harm occurs. The
Claimant confuses fault and harm, which are independent from each other.

In reliance on decisions of the Colombian Constitutional Court and on scholarly writings,
specifically Betancor Rodriguez and Pefia Chacon, Ecuador submits that RAOHE and
the Texto Unificado de Legislacién Ambiental Secundaria (“TULAS”) do not define
compensable environmental harm. That definition is found in the Environmental
Management Law of Ecuador (Ley de Gestién Ambiental) (“EML”). The EML defines
environmental harm as “all loss, reduction, detriment or significant damage to the
preexisting conditions in the environment or one of its components. It affects the
functioning of the ecosystem or the renewal of its resources”.'“°

Therefore, under the EML, “the significance of the harm depends exclusively on the
magnitude of the impact on the environment”, whereas RAOHE and TULAS make
environmental harm dependent on the economic use of the land affected."“’ In other
words, the significant harm standard under the EML “is perfectly operational, without
the need for numerical standards”,"** which is reinforced by the fact that the EML
makes no reference to limits." In addition, asserts the Respondent, Article 396 of the
2008 Constitution mandates that al/ environmental damage is to be fully repaired, and
Article 397 similarly mentions full restoration. In any event, TULAS also requires that
contaminated soils be restored to their “prior condition”.'“* This “prior condition” is
represented by the background values established by IEMS.

b. Burlington must remediate contaminated soils back to background values

What Ecuador refers to as its “main case” is its claim that full restoration under Article
396(2) in conjunction with Article 71 of the 2008 Constitution requires remediation of all

Id., § 242. Ecuador further points to the EU Directive on Environmental Liability and various

significant than naturally-occurring negative fluctuations.

environmental harm to the level of the so-called background values, i.e. restoration of
the environment to a condition equivalment to its condition prior to the initiation of oil

9145,

operations. In Ecuador’s submission, any “alteration to the natural state”’”” qualifies as

contamination or harm and must be fully remedied back to so-called background
values. There is no “right to freely pollute up to the permissible limits”.'“°

This approach is consistent with case law of the highest court in Ecuador'*” and was
endorsed by Professor Andrade’s oral evidence.'“® From a scientific point of view, IEMS
also testified that the regulatory criteria are insufficient to fully protect the environment
or the health of the population. In IEMS’s opinion, there is contamination whenever a
contaminant exceeds the background values triggering the duty of the operator to
“remediate the affected area so as to return it to its natural state”. '°

Ecuador argues six grounds for its background values case. First, the Parties’ experts
agree that the 2008 Constitution requires full restoration. Since the permissible limits
set forth in RAOHE and in TULAS do not represent full restoration, the Tribunal should
disregard them and apply the background values established by IEMS.

Second, as stated above, RAOHE and TULAS do not define compensable
environmental harm. They merely set limits within which hazardous activities may be
lawfully conducted in a manner so as to prevent to the extent possible the occurrence of
harm."

Third, the Hearing confirmed that RAOHE and TULAS do not purport to define
environmental harm, but that their purpose is to regulate the activities of operators.'®'
The “hollow theory of tolerable and intolerable impact” put forward by the Claimant's
expert Professor Bedén was put to rest when, confronted with Professor Pefia
Chacén’s comprehensive quote, he had to admit that the strict liability regime excluded

a requirement of fault. For Ecuador, “[i]f the fault element disappears with strict liability,
then infringing regulations such as those contained in RAOHE and TULAS regulations
becomes irrelevant to assessing the existence and extent of environmental harm’”.'%
Fourth, RAOHE and TULAS are merely risk management tools. They seek to prevent
environmental harm and therefore apply ex ante.'®> Compliance with administrative
regulations is no shield against environmental harm. For instance, harm can occur as a
result of the “cumulative effect of certain emissions [...] where no permissible limits
have been infringed”.'®

Fifth, as Professor Crespo confirmed, RAOHE and TULAS govern administrative
liability, not civil liability for environmental harm. While the administrative liability regime
aims at preventing the occurrence of environmental harm, the civil liability regime
provides for full restoration. "°°

Sixth and last, environmental harm cannot be determined in the abstract by ‘blindly’
applying the permissible limits provided in RAOHE and TULAS. It must be assessed on
the facts specific to each case.'®° Referring to Professor Andrade's evidence, Ecuador
submits that the permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS are irrelevant “because any

harm must be assessed on site”’®”

and because “ex ante empirical data cannot
determine, in advance, whether the renewability of a specific ecosystem has been
impaired, let alone significantly impaired”."®® More importantly, RAOHE and TULAS do
not distinguish between “types and characteristics of lands (deserts, forest, rainforest,
mountains, islands...)”, making them unsuitable for the sensitive ecosystem of the

Amazon rainforest.'®? Finally, while the limits set in RAOHE and TULAS are bound to

vary over time, thus making them unreliable, the notion of environmental harm in the
EML will not change over time.'®°

In sum, it is Ecuador's submission that remediation to background values is no
extraordinary requirement. Comparative law corroborates this approach."®' Burlington’s
argument that it has the right to pollute up to the permissible limits is incompatible with
“two of the most fundamental principles of environmental law’.'® The first is the
polluter-pays principle according to which operators must internalize the environmental
costs of their economic activities, as enshrined in the 2008 Constitution, general tort
law, and the Rio Declaration. The second fundamental principle is that nature itself is a
bearer of rights entitled to protection and reparation in the event of environmental harm
under Article 71 of the Constitution." According to Ecuador, the 2008 Constitution also
establishes that, in case of doubt, “environmental regulations should be interpreted in
the sense most favourable to the protection of Nature” (in dubio pro natura).'** Hence,
absent proof to the contrary, any damage found must be considered significant and
thus compensable.

c. In the alternative, Burlington must remediate contaminated soils back to the
sensitive ecosystems standard
Alternatively, if the Tribunal were to discard the background values approach and refer
to RAOHE and TULAS as the basis for defining environmental harm, it should apply the
permissible limits for sensitive ecosystems in those laws,'® for the two following
reasons. First, the future land use, taken into account under RAOHE to determine the
applicable limits, must be taken to refer to the time “when oil operations will end”, as
opposed to the end of a given operator's activities, as was clarified at the Hearing.’ Oil

operations are temporary and the oilfields in Blocks 7 and 21 are “destined to be
absorbed again by rainforest’.""’ As a result, the sensitive ecosystem standard must
apply, which implies restoration to the state of pristine rainforest.

Second, the oilfields were “carved out” of the sensitive ecosystems of the Amazonian
rainforest, an area of “significant ecological importance” vulnerable to change and in
need of protection."® According to Ecuador, Block 7 is situated in a “fragile and diverse
ecosystem” with numerous rivers and streams, such as the Napo River crossing the
entire Block, the Suno River crossing the Oso field, and the Payamino River in the
northern part of Block 7.‘ Similarly, Block 21 is an ecologically rich but vulnerable
area, characterized by rainforest and drained by several rivers, of which the most
important is the Napo River.'” Burlington’s argument that Blocks 7 and 21 do not
qualify as sensitive ecosystems under RAOHE and TULAS, because they are not so-
called “designated protected areas” under Ecuadorian law, is ill-founded. According to
Ecuador, by devising a distinction in RAOHE between industrial use, agricultural use
and sensitive ecosystem, “the Ecuadorian legislator obviously intended for the
Amazonian rainforest, which does not fulfill any industrial or agricultural use, to be
included in the latter category”.'”'

In this respect, Ecuador stresses that the map showing the ‘Sistema nacional de areas
protegidas’ (“SNAP”), filed by Burlington — disproves the latter’s position that would
imply that all non-colored areas of the map would be industrial or agricultural land.'”?

Ecuador, that some sites within Blocks 7 and 21 were “sensitive ecosystems”.'”° More
significantly, Burlington’s position is contradicted by the wording of RAOHE, which
defines sensitive ecosystems in a non-exhaustive way by referring to areas “such as
the National Heritage of Natural Areas and others identified in the corresponding
Environmental Study (tales como Patrimonio Nacional de Areas Naturales y otros
identificados en el correspondiente Estudio Ambiental)”.'”*

Ecuador further emphasizes that Blocks 7 and 21 are located in the Napo River basin,
which is “one of the most bio-diverse regions in the world”.'” Similarly, it notes that the
“greater part of the Blocks is entirely within the Sumaco and Yasuni Biosphere
Reserves”, while a significant portion of Block 21 lies additionally in the Huaorani
indigenous reserve."

For Ecuador, the “mega-diversity” of the area is further supported by environmental
impact studies carried out in 2010 as well as by IEMS, which note the high diversity of
the area and the fact that some species are endangered.'”’ More importantly, in various
environmental impact studies, the Consortium itself concluded “that the characteristics
of the Blocks 7 and 21 area were those of a sensitive ecosystem’.'” In addition,
Burlington’s witness Mr. Wilfrido Saltos also recognized the dynamic nature of the
ecosystem around the platforms.’

1.2 Burlington’s position

In brief, Burlington’s submission is that Ecuador's USD 2.6 billion environmental claim is
a “work of fiction’, unsupported by the facts and ill-founded as a matter of law.'®°
Essentially, to succeed with its claim, the Respondent must show that (i) the
Consortium acted in breach of its duty of care; (ii) Ecuador suffered harm; and (iii) there
is a causal nexus between the act and the harm. Ecuador has not established any of
these elements.

In support of its defense, Burlington contends that (i) the Consortium was a responsible
operator; (ii) Ecuador misstates the applicable legal standards; (iii) it uses the wrong
definition of harm; (iv) it erroneously relies on background values; (v) it applies the
wrong standards when it alternatively refers to regulatory criteria; (vi) it does not prove
causation; and (vii) it raises a claim that is time-barred.

1.2.1. The Consortium was a responsible and environmentally
conscientious operator

Ecuador’s attempt to depict the Consortium as a careless operator is contradicted by
Ecuador’s own data. Indeed, there were no material oil spills during the Consortium’s
operations and there are only limited pockets of regulatory exceedances in the
Blocks."®' In reality, the Consortium “was a responsible operator and good corporate
citizen that prioritized environmental conditions, complied with government regulations,
promptly reported and remediated spills and invested in the neighboring
communities”.'°? In particular, the environmental audits attested to the Consortium’s
“overall regulatory compliance and sound stewardship of the Blocks”.'®° In any event,
Burlington asserts that there can be no liability so long as the Consortium acted as a
bonus pater familias or a reasonably prudent operator.'®
As a responsible member of the Consortium, Burlington is willing to accept
responsibility for exceedances above regulatory criteria for two sites “at which it cannot

definitively link harm to non-Consortium activities (Yuralpa Pad A and Jaguar 1 Area

3T)’ and to bear the costs to close four open pits and abandon seven wells. '®

1.2.2 Ecuador misstates the applicable legal standards

First, fault-based and not strict liability governs Ecuador's environmental claim.
Ecuadorian law imposed strict liability in October 2008. Under Article 7 of the Civil
Code, “the law provides only for the future; it has no retroactive effect [...]” (Translation
by the Tribunal). Hence, the strict liability regime of the 2008 Constitution does not
govern Ecuador's claim in respect of harm that predates the entry into force of the
Constitution in October 2008.'*° Accordingly, Burlington cannot be held liable unless it
is proven that the Consortium breached its duty of care."®’ No such proof has been
addressed.

Burlington further notes that, as Professor Bedén explains, the relevant date to
determine the applicable legal regime is the date of the occurrence of the act. This date
is consistent with the statute of limitation for torts in the Civil Code, which runs from the
date on which the harmful act occurred."® As a result, it rejects Ecuador’s argument
that strict liability governs because that regime was only in place at the time of IEMS’s
inspection in 2011. Similarly, it discards Ecuador’s view that the Ecuadorian Supreme
Court imposed strict liability as early as 2002. Indeed, in Delfina Torres, the Supreme
Court merely discussed strict liability in dicta, and in fact applied fault-based liability with
a reversal of the burden of proof."®° In any event, Burlington reiterates that whatever
changes were made in 2008, the new Constitution “cannot have any retroactive

effect’,'®° since the applicable legal regime is the one in force at the time of the

allegedly harmful act.'®' Accordingly, the 2008 regime only applies to acts that postdate
192

the Constitution’s entry into force.
The Claimant identifies a second misstatement of the law argued by Ecuador, relating
to the burden of proof. For Burlington, Ecuador has the burden of proving environmental
harm.'® Proof of harm is an essential element of tortious liability. Ecuador's position
that any effect on the environment is an environmental harm and that it only needs to
make a showing of a “negative impact” defies common sense. An effect on the
environment in compliance with environmental regulations cannot constitute
recoverable “harm”. Otherwise, there would be no purpose in regulations and
government authorizations.'** Astonishingly, Professor Crespo erroneously believes
that Ecuador need only “allege” or “point out the probability of harm”.'® If that were true,
Ecuador’s theory would imply that “any participant in human activity in Ecuador is
presumptively liable for an environmental damage figure chosen by any plaintiff’, since
any human activity causes some impact to the environment.'%
Third, contrary to Ecuador’s contention, Ecuadorian law requires causation even for
strict liability. The Supreme Court of Ecuador held so and Article 396 of the 2008
Ecuadorian Constitution expressly provides that persons are strictly liabile for damages
which they have “caused”. Thus, Ecuador is wrong to argue that it “need only establish
that environmental harm exists”.'*” In addition, it must prove that Burlington and
Perenco caused such harm.’

1.2.3 Ecuador’s definition of environmental harm is baseless,
since a significant impact requires an exceedance of
permissible limits

According to Burlington, Ecuador's allegation of widespread environmental harm in the
Blocks is a “fantasy”'®? based on novel and unsupported theories about the definition of
environmental harm and on flawed reports from its expert IEMS. Among other things,
IEMS applied incorrect legal standards, analyzed the soil in mud pits as though it were
regular soil, overestimated the volume of contaminated soil through unreliable
modelling, and failed to properly filter groundwater samples.

Burlington notes that it is common ground that the EML defines harm under Ecuadorian
law and that the 2008 Constitution left this definition untouched. Ecuador is wrong to
deny that the notion of harm is further specified in RAOHE and TULAS, and to make
artificial distinctions between the notion of harm and the idea of setting limits to prevent
harm. Ecuador's first argument in its Second Supplemental Memorial that its own
regulations were “arbitrary” is just as erroneous as its second argument that RAOHE
and TULAS do not define harm but merely seek to set limits on dangerous activities.°°

In conformity with the EML, “harm” requires a “significant negative impact”. As the
Respondent's experts Professors Andrade and Crespo acknowledged, this wording
implies that some negative impacts are significant, while others are not.” If all types of
negative impacts were prohibited, there could be no development at all.°? While the
EML defines “harm”, it does not set specific permissible limits for each contaminant.
Burlington therefore considers it necessary to resort to Ecuador's implementing
regulations, specifically RAOHE and TULAS, where the notion of “harm” is further
specified.°°°

Burlington also asserts that reliance on the limits set in RAOHE and TULAS conforms
with the “constitutional right of legal certainty”.2% In other words, “there must be a clear

dividing line determining the point at which environmental impacts become significant —
am 205,

a dividing line between ‘insignificant impacts’ and ‘harm
The Claimant further points to Ecuador's practice after 2008, which shows that it refers
to permissible limits, not to background values, when it defines “harm”. For instance,
the Ministerial Accord 169 provides that environmental harm must be restored to the
conditions “determined by the environmental authority’, and the Ministerial Resolution
No. 1 refers to “harm” by reference to permissible limits.7°° Ecuadorian case law and the
practice of Ecuador’s regulatory agencies equally demonstrate that harm is always
defined by reference to permissible limits. With respect to case law, Professor Andrade,
the Respondent's expert, conceded at the Hearing that no Ecuadorian court had ever
applied background values.”°” The Los Vencedores and the Municipality of Orellana
decisions support the proposition that there is no harm if there is no exceedance of
permissible limits. In respect of Aguinda, Professor Andrade admitted that the court
speaks of “full reparation”, but does not once make reference to — let alone apply —
background values.”

In connection with regulatory practice, Ecuador's agencies have never applied
background values either.”'° In support, Burlington cites the following elements:
(i) Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment applies Ministerial Resolution No. 1, i.e.
permissible limits, when a spill occurs; (ii) Petroamazonas remediates spills by
reference to permissible limits; (iii) Professor Andrade acknowledged that if a spill
occurs, agencies apply permissible limits; (iv) an agency of the Ministry of the
Environment called PRAS issued operational policies and norms explicitly based on
RAOHE; (v) IEMS applied regulatory criteria in their first expert report before being
instructed by Ecuador to discard them; and (vi) Professor Bedon testified that he had

never seen background values applied.?"' In conclusion, Ecuador has provided no
evidence of even a single instance where background values have been applied,
whereas Burlington has shown that in fact Ecuador applies permissible limits in

determining the existence of environmental harm.?'?

1.2.4 Ecuador uses background values to falsely portray and
inflate alleged environmental harm

Burlington opposes Ecuador’s use of background values, including IEMS’s position that
only background values are sufficiently protective of the public health. Burlington
highlights that IEMS was instructed by Ecuador to employ background values and
never actually analyzed whether the ecosystem was in fact affected.?'* IEMS’s first
expert report actually referred to permissible limits as applicable standard.?'*
“Astonishingly — argues Burlington — IEMS admitted that if the Consortium were
operating today [...], it would be subject to RAOHE and TULAS regulations, not
‘background values”.*'° Thus, had Burlington not been expropriated, it would be subject
to the regulatory standards. Having been expropriated, it is somehow subject to
background values “resulting in billions of dollars of bogus damages”.?"°
In support of its argumentation, the Claimant also relies on the purpose of RAOHE,
which in the regulation’s words, is to set “[p]Jermissible limits for the identification and
remediation of contaminated soils in all phases of the hydrocarbon industry”.?"” Should
background values govern, as Ecuador claims, RAOHE would serve no apparent
purpose. Further, IEMS itself acknowledged, in its first report and in the City Oriente v.
Ecuador arbitration, that RAOHE establishes the criteria to define the scope of

environmental harm.?"® If background values were relevant, then active oil fields would
have to be restored to a pristine state of nature even as the oil fields continue to be in
operation. This is absurd, especially considering Ecuador's aggressive expansion of oil
production.

In refutation of Ecuador's reliance on RAOHE Table 6, Burlington remarks that Table 6
states that background values may be used to increase permissible limits, not to
decrease them. Thus, if the natural concentration of a given element in the soil is higher
than its regulatory limit, the permissible limit may be increased to that naturally
occurring level — the reverse is not true.?"?

Burlington also rebuts Ecuador's further argument according to which background
values alone comport with the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution. First, the 2008
Constitution cannot apply retroactively and thus would cover at most a 10-month period
(between its coming into force in October 2008 and Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks in
July 2009). Second, Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution only comes into play in the
event of “harm”, which is defined in environmental regulations and in particular
RAOHE.””?

Burlington further disputes IEMS’s assertion that the Ecuadorian regulatory criteria
“might not be enough to protect the health of the local population [...]’.' On the
contrary, says Burlington, “Ecuador’s regulatory limits are remarkably stringent”.”°?
Ecuador is more protective than other oil producing regions such as Venezuela, Texas
and Louisiana. Its regulations are also more stringent than the Risk-Based Corrective
Action (“RBCA”) methodology widely adopted in European countries, the United States,
and other parts of the world. In a nutshell, RAOHE criteria are highly protective of
human health and no public health rationale warrants the application of a more stringent

standard.”

Burlington moreover criticizes IEMS’s methodology in calculating the background
values that it employs, which resulted in labeling clean samples as contaminated ones.
When aggregated across contaminants, Ecuador's background values result in 84% of
clean samples being labeled as contaminated.

Finally, according to Burlington, Ecuador's reliance on background values, as opposed
to RAOHE criteria, has enormous consequences for its counterclaims. An amount of
damages of approximately USD 1.3 billion of Ecuador's claim depends on the
application of background values. If the background values are discarded, Ecuador's
claims shrink from USD 2.2 billion to USD 895 million.

1.2.5 IEMS’s “regulatory case” based on sensitive ecosystems
is likewise incorrect

Burlington also challenges Ecuador's alternative submission based on regulatory
criteria because it exclusively relies on the sensitive ecosystem standard, which is
inapposite in most cases. Burlington disagrees with Ecuador’s assertion that the
entirety of the Blocks is situated in a “sensitive” region or that they are located in a
biosphere reserve, noting that only a very limited number of areas are designated by
Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment as “sensitive ecosystem”.?*°
Burlington further argues that, according to RAOHE Table 6, the permissible levels of
contamination depend on the “use” of the land, which is classified by RAOHE as
industrial, agricultural or sensitive ecosystem, the first being the most permissive and
the last the least permissive. IEMS’s calculation of contamination levels based on the
sensitive ecosystem threshold is unwarranted as only a small number of sites in the
Blocks intersect with designated “sensitive ecosystems” areas.”° Most of the areas
where the Consortium’s active operations take place are a “quintessential example” of
land use for industrial purposes, with the surrounding areas being used mostly for
agriculture.”””

143.

For Burlington, Ecuador’s argument that the Blocks are to be considered as sensitive
ecosystem in their entirety is inconsistent with RAOHE and with Ecuador's own
application of RAOHE other than in this arbitration.” Under RAOHE, the “posterior use
that will be given to the remediated soil” determines the land use. Posterior use is
“immediate subsequent use to the seizure”, and not use when the oil operations are
completed as advocated by Ecuador.” The areas within the oilfields, such as platforms
and drilling equipment, are used to conduct hydrocarbon operations — an industrial use.
This is the sole purpose, present and foreseeable, of these areas. The lands
surrounding the oilfields, in turn, are used mostly for pastures, crops, or wood
gathering, that is, for agricultural purposes. According to GSI, “95% of the areas
surrounding the inspected platforms constitute agricultural areas or secondary
forests”.2%°

Burlington also considers that Ecuador’s exclusive reliance on the sensitive ecosystem
standard is contrary to its own practice. According to Burlington, that practice confirms
that most of the land in the Blocks is destined for either “industrial” or “agricultural” use.
On multiple occasions, Ecuador approved, or did not object to, plans where the land in
the Blocks was classified as either “industrial” or “agricultural”.?3* For instance, IEMS
conceded at the Hearing that the ex-post studies on the environmental condition of the
Blocks after Ecuador's takeover applied the agricultural use standard.” In application
of RAOHE, the “posterior use” of any soil remediated will continue to be either
“industrial” or “agricultural”. In short, the “sensitive ecosystems” classification bears no
relationship to the actual use of the land and must be rejected.?%°

IEMS also incorrectly relies on Table 2 of Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS. For the
Claimant, this table only establishes pre-estimated background values for substances
not included in RAOHE Table 6 (such as barium and vanadium). It does not express
remediation criteria, which are found in Table 3 of Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS, entitled
“Criteria for Remediation and Restoration of Soils”. TULAS expressly states that the

standards for remediation or restoration “are included in Table 3”,2** a fact that IEMS
itself has acknowledged in the City Oriente arbitration. Hence, Burlington views TULAS
Table 3 as the appropriate table to determine soil remediation standards.”

As a final point, Burlington stresses that the land use designations in RAOHE are
sufficiently protective of the human health and the environment, since Ecuador's
standards are amongst the most stringent worldwide.”°°

As noted above, for Burlington, applying the proper regulatory criteria has an enormous
impact on Ecuador's damages claim. In particular, GSI found that 74% of the soil
samples analyzed by IEMS that show exceedances of the “sensitive ecosystems” limits
are in reality compliant with Ecuadorian regulations for industrial and agricultural
land.”°” Applying correct regulatory criteria, Ecuador's alleged damages are further
reduced by USD 885 million to a total of approximately USD 10 million, for which
Burlington accepts liability in the amount of USD 1.09 million.2%%

1.2.6 Ecuador entirely ignores its duty to prove causation

Burlington opposes Ecuador's view that Ecuadorian law imposes a_ rebuttable
presumption of causation. For Burlington, the 2008 Constitution imposes the burden to
prove causation on Ecuador and Burlington is only liable for harm caused during its
tenure of the Blocks, not for the one caused by Ecuador itself or prior operators.

a. _ Ecuador bears the burden to prove causation

Burlington’s submission is that causation is not presumed, and that Ecuador must prove
causation. Professor Bedén gave clear evidence to this effect at the Hearing and even
Professor Crespo acknowledged that environmental harm must “be caused by the
operator's activity’.2°° Ecuadorian courts consistently require plaintiffs to prove

causation, including in strict liability cases.™° For instance, in Medardo Luna, the
Ecuadorian Supreme Court held that the injured party must prove (i) the fact, (ii) the
damage, and (iii) the causal nexus. The same conclusion was reached by the re-named
National Court of Justice in Aguinda, where it held that in the post-2008 strict liability
regime the plaintiff must only “corroborate the risky activity and the relation of

causality’ "'

b. Burlington is only liable for harm caused during its tenure of the Blocks

The Claimant further submits that it is only liable for damage caused while the
Consortium operated the Blocks. Causation must be proven because each operator is
responsible for the damage which it has caused, not for harm caused by someone
else. Since Professor Crespo testified that Ecuador must prove that the damage was
caused “during the time of the Consortium’s operations”, it follows that Petroamazonas,
who is presently operating the Blocks, is presumptively liable for any harm that occurred
after July 2009. In this context, Professor Andrade’s explanations that Petroamazonas
somehow plays by different rules must be rejected.“

Consequently, Burlington also disputes that it is jointly liable for harm caused by prior
operators.*“* Joint and several liability can only result from “the same tort or wrongful
act, not successive ones”.*“° Hence, Burlington is only liable for the conduct of Perenco,
as operator for the Consortium, and not for the conduct of previous or subsequent
operators.“

c. Contamination in Coca-Payamino was caused by Ecuador itself

Burlington submits that the environmental harm in Coca-Payamino, which constitutes
more than half of Ecuador’s claim, was “almost certainly” caused by CEPE and

Petroproduccién when they operated the fields in the 1980s and during the latter's
247

alternate operatorship with Oryx of the CPUF in the 1990s.
Indeed, there is abundant evidence of oil spills, problems with mud pits, lack of
remediation, and continuous discharges into the environment during CEPE and
Petroproduccién’s tenures of the Blocks. For instance, an environmental audit in 1999
found Petroproduccién’s operating practices to be “reactive and not proactive”.*“®
Furthermore, Burlington notes that, notwithstanding the express order of the Tribunal,
Ecuador failed to produce any spill report or remediation program from that period.” In
support of its allegations, Burlington cites the following facts: (i) in Coca CPF,
Petroproduccién “permanently discharged production water” into the environment prior
to 1994; (ii) in Payamino 2 and 8, the crude oil and heavy metals found in the Jungal
swamp originate from a pre-1992 rupture of the mud and production test pits built by
CEPE in 1987;7*' (iii) in Coca 6, a serious spill was recorded by Oryx in 1999 and the pit
in the northern part of the platform was built by Petroproduccién in 1989, while the 2007
spill was fully remediated;** (iv) in Payamino 4, CEPE built pits in 1988 without using

253

liners and filled them with oil-based drilling muds;° and (v) in Coca 4, drilling was

undertaken by CEPE in 1989 which explains the presence of barium in that area.?°*

d. Ecuador fails to account for environmental harm caused by Petroamazonas
after July 2009

Burlington calls attention to the fact that Ecuador's claim ignores that the latter took

over the Blocks in July 2009 and aggressively expanded operations. In this context,

CMCC, § 441. Petroproduccién assumed operations of the CPUF, from April 1991 through

February 1994, and from June 1997 through March 2000. Oryx operated the field from February

1994 through June 1997. The CPUF was continuously operated by the Block 7 Contractor after
March 2000. /d., $9 95-96.

156.

Ecuador's insistence on the sensitive ecosystem standard is “absurd” when one
considers that Ecuador itself has actively increased the industrial use of the Blocks.”°
According to Burlington, Ecuador’s expansion of the fields has obviated the need for

any remediation, as is shown by three illustrations.

First, the Coca 13 site has been expanded by over 40,000 square meters, 11 new
wells, four new mud pits and a new CPF. Doing so, Ecuador has subsumed and “wiped
out” the alleged zone of contamination for which it claims that Burlington is liable. Yet, it
claims USD 26.5 million in damages under its background values case and USD
7.4 million under its sensitive ecosystem case for this site.?°

Second, Oso A has also been dramatically expanded, with Ecuador drilling 14 new
wells. As with Coca 13, “Petroamazonas’s extensive development of Oso A since July
2009 has obviated the need for any remediation and rendered IEMS’s conclusions
obsolete — if contamination even existed in the first place”.*°”

Third, Burlington argues that Ecuador failed to mention or account for the occurrence of
a spill in Mono CPF that occurred in 2010 or 2011. In this context, Burlington highlights
that IEMS’s first report identified this spill as a recognized environmental condition
(“REC”), but “curiously” did not include it in its third report “despite the fact that Mono
CPF represents one of the single largest claims by dollar amount in all of Ecuador's
counterclaims”.° Therefore, Ecuador’s claims for over USD 100 million must fail
because it cannot show that the alleged contamination is attributable to the
Consortium.”

e. The PSCs exonerate the Consortium for harm caused by others

Burlington notes that Ecuador relies on the PSCs to absolve it from having to prove
causation, the Consortium being allegedly liable for environmental harm caused by prior
operators. Not only is Ecuador's reference to the PSCs barred by the tortious nature of

158.

its counterclaim, it is also wrong in and of itself. Indeed, the PSCs “expressly exonerate
» 260

the Consortium from responsibility for harm caused by others’
In this context, Burlington further observes that the limited exceedances above
regulatory criteria found at 17 sites were not caused by the Consortium, but by prior
operators, including State-owned operators. For instance, there is ample proof that the
contamination of the Jungal swamp in Payamino 2 and 8 was caused by CEPE
between 1988 and 1992. In fact, Burlington produced evidence linking the
contamination found at all but two of the 17 sites to the activities of parties other than
the Consortium. As a responsible member of the Consortium, Burlington is “willing to
accept liability for the two sites at which it cannot definitely link harm to non-Consortium
activities” for a total cost of USD 1.09 million.?°"

1.2.7. Ecuador’s claims are time-barred under Ecuadorian law

Burlington's last defense is that the counterclaim is time-barred. Article 2235 of the Civil
Code enshrines a four-year limitation period. Ecuador’s reliance on the so-called
‘discovery rule’, which it borrows from other jurisdictions, is ill-founded. Indeed, Ecuador
fails to cite a single case in support of this rule. Even if such a discovery rule were to
exist, the period would start to run only when Ecuador knew or should have known
(“constructive knowledge”) about the alleged environmental harm.’ In light of the fact
that the Consortium was strictly supervised by Ecuadorian regulatory authorities, that
Ecuador consistently approved the Consortium’s environmental impact studies, that the
Consortium regularly filed reports and audits, and that regular inspections were carried
out, Ecuador must be deemed to have had constructive knowledge of any alleged harm
throughout the Consortium’s operations.” Thus, even if Ecuador had legitimate claims,
they are now time-barred under Article 2235 of the Civil Code.

2. Applicable legal framework

Since the 1970s, Ecuador has incorporated environmental norms into its legal order,
including with respect to hydrocarbons activities, at the constitutional, legislative and
regulatory levels, as discussed below.” After setting out the relevant provisions of the
Hydrocarbons Law (2.1), the Tribunal will review the evolution of Ecuador's
environmental framework for oilfield operations, including the Law on the Prevention
and Control of Environmental Contamination (2.2), the 1978 and 1998 Constitutions
(2.3), the Law on Environmental Management (2.4), the Substitute Environmental
Regulation for Hydrocarbon Operations in Ecuador (2.5), the Unified Text of Secondary
Environmental Legislation (2.6), and the 2008 Constitution (2.7). Finally, it will set out
relevant provisions of the PSCs (2.8).

2.1. The Hydrocarbons Law and regulation of hydrocarbons industry

The Hydrocarbons Law (Ley de Hidrocarburos (“HL”)) was enacted in 1971.7 It
contained the first expression of the State’s general duty to ensure that the oil industry
“does not cause harm to people, property or the environment’, obligating the State to
conduct periodical socio-environmental audits. The Ecuadorian legislature
progressively imposed environmental obligations on oilfield operators, such as the 1982
amendment of the HL providing for the obligation of operators to comply with applicable
environmental laws and regulations*®” and to conduct environmental impact studies and
prepare environmental management plans.” In 2002, the Regulation of Hydrocarbon
Operations (Reglamento de Operaciones Hidrocarburiferas (“ROH”) was enacted.”* It

contains rules applicable to all phases of the hydrocarbon operations, exploration,
drilling and exploitation, as well as an annex with definitions of terms.””° Article 7
prescribes that oilfield operators must comply with applicable laws and regulations

relating to the protection of the environment.*”'

2.2 The Law on the Prevention and Control of Environmental
Contamination
In 1976, Ecuador adopted the Law on the Prevention and Control of Environmental
Contamination, establishing for the first time rules to prevent soil, water and air
contamination, without however specifying any parameters.?”

As regards water, for instance, Article 16 prohibited the dumping of waste water
containing contaminants harmful to human health, fauna or property “into the sewage
network, or into streams, irrigation channels, rivers, natural or artificial lakes, or in the
ocean, or to let it infiltrate onto land”.?” In connection with soils, Article 20 prohibited the
discharge of “any type of contaminants that could alter the quality of the soil and affect
human health, flora, fauna, natural resources and other goods” without complying with

applicable technical and regulatory standards.?”

2.3 The 1978 and 1998 Constitutions

Protection of the environment was enshrined in the constitution for the first time in the
1978 Constitution.’ Article 19 of such Constitution enshrined the fundamental right to
live in an environment free of contamination, specifying that environmental protection

would require laws restricting the “exercise of certain rights or liberties’.””° In 1996, a
constitutional reform instituted the collective right to a healthy environment and declared
the following to be of public interest: (i) the protection of the environment and the
conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, (ii) the principles of prevention and
sustainable exploitation of natural resources, and (iii) the establishment of a system of
protected areas.*””

The 1998 Constitution further elaborated the environmental regime by enshrining the
principles of sustainable development, prevention, precaution, rehabilitation, and
participation.” Furthermore, Article 91 provided for the State’s liability, including that of
its “delegates and concessionaires”, for environmental harm.?”°

2.4 The 1999 Environmental Management Law (EML)

In order to implement the environmental provisions of the 1998 Constitution, Ecuador
adopted in 1999 the EML.”° The EML established the principles and guidelines of
Ecuador’s environmental policy, determining the obligations, responsibilities and levels
of participation of the public and private sectors in environmental management and
indicating “the permissible limits, controls and sanctions” in such matters.”*' It set out

1978 Constitution, codified in 1984, and published in Official Register No. 763 of 12 June 1984,
Article 19(2) (Exh. CA-CC-09; Crespo ER, Annex 3): “Notwithstanding other rights necessary
for the full moral and material development arising from the very nature of a person, the State
guarantees: [...] 2. The right to live in an environment free of contamination. The State has a
duty to ensure that this right is not curtailed, as well as to safeguard nature preservation. The
law shall establish the restrictions to the exercise of certain rights or liberties so as to protect the
environment” (Translation by the Tribunal). Article 50 further provided for police powers allowing
municipalities to render environmental protection effective: “In furtherance of the right to housing
and the conservation of the environment, municipalities may expropriate, reserve and control
areas for future development pursuant to law”. It is to be noted that in 1985, the Ministry of
Energy and Mines published a Guide for the Preparation of Environmental Impact Studies
(Instructivo para la Preparacién de Informes y Estudios de Impacto Ambiental), Ministerial
Accord No. 764 of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, published in Official Register No. 330 of 9

the scope and principles of environmental management; the institutional regime
underlying environmental management; the various instruments of environmental
management; financial mechanisms; as well as provisions on information and
participation, and the protection of environmental rights.

With respect to the instruments of environmental management, the EML provided for
the assessment of environmental impacts and environmental controls. For instance,
Article 21 EML provides that licenses for economic activities may only be granted if
environmental management systems are drawn up, which must include “base line
studies; an environmental impact assessment; risk assessment; management plans;
risk management plans; monitoring systems; contingency and mitigation plans;
environmental hearings and plans for withdrawal”. The EML also defines many
relevant terms, such as contamination, environmental harm, and environmental
impact.28

2.5 The Environmental Regulation for Hydrocarbon Operations in
Ecuador (RAOHE)

In 1992, Ecuador enacted RAOHE,”™* which was amended in 1995”° and replaced in

2001 by an expanded and updated version.”®° RAOHE contains various chapters and

7

annexes that apply to all phases of oilfield operations in Ecuador,”*’ including

prospection, exploration, exploitation, industrialization, storage and transportation, and

Id., Article 21.

Id., Glossary of definitions. Contamination (“contaminacion’) is defined as follows: “It is the
presence in the environment of substances, elements, energy, or a combination thereof, the
concentration and permanence of which are higher or lower than those prescribed by the laws in
force”. Environmental harm (“dafio ambiental’) is defined as follows: “It is any significant loss,
decrease, detriment or impairment to the preexisting conditions in the environment or one of its
components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources”.
Environmental impact (“impacto ambientat’) is defined as follows: “It is the positive or negative
alteration of the environment, caused directly or otherwise by a project or activity in a given area”
(Translations by the Tribunal).

commercialization of crude oil, its derivatives, and natural gas susceptible of causing
environmental impacts.

RAOHE requires operators to submit environmental programs and audits to the relevant
Ministry on a regular basis,”*° to undertake regular internal monitoring of environmental
conditions in relation to atmospheric emissions, solid and liquid discharges, as well as
remediation of contaminated soils or pits.” It also requires operators to present
environmental impact studies prior to any new phase in oilfield operations,** including

by providing environmental management and monitoring plans to mitigate and control

adverse impacts."

Article 42 of RAOHE further provides that operators must conduct biennial

292

environmental audits,~* in order to determine whether their oilfield operations comply

with applicable environmental standards, including the management and monitoring
plans.” Article 42 reads as follows:

ART. 42.— Environmental audit— The Undersecretariat of Environmental
Protection, through the National Environmental Protection Directorate,
shall audit, at least every two years, or whenever the Undersecretariat of
Environmental Protection so orders upon detecting non-compliance with
the Environmental Management Plan, the environmental aspects of the
various hydrocarbons activities conducted by the ones subjected to
control.

The Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, through the National
Environmental Protection Directorate (DINAPA), shall determine the type
and scope of the Environmental Audit for the operations of those
subjected to control based on compliance with the Environmental
Management Plan.

At least every two years, those subjected to control shall conduct an
Environmental Audit of their activities, following approval of the
corresponding Terms of Reference by the Undersecretariat of
Environmental Protection, and they shall submit the respective audit
report to the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection.

See, for instance: /d., Article 10.

See, for instance: /d., Article 12.

171.

Additionally, the parties, upon the termination of hydrocarbons
exploration and exploitation, or in the event of a change of operator, shall
conduct the audit referenced in Art. 11 of the Regulation to Law 44,
amending the Hydrocarbons Law.

To the effect of the aforementioned audits, the ones subjected to control

shall select an environmental auditor qualified by the Undersecretariat of

Environmental Protection to carry out the monitoring and verification of

compliance with the Environmental Management Plan, in accordance

with the Terms of Reference previously approved by the Undersecretariat

of Environmental Protection, in which the documentary framework is

determined against which the audit shall be conducted (Translation by

the Tribunal).
Article 16 of RAOHE stipulates that the operator must present for approval to the
Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection (Subsecretaria de Proteccién Ambiental)
a remediation plan in cases of remediation of pits, contaminated soils, and “major
accidents with spills of more than five barrels of oil, combustibles or other product”.2*
Within 15 days after completion of the remediation works, the operator must submit a
technical evaluation report to the Undersecretariat for Environmental Protection through
the National Direction of Environmental Protection (Direccién Nacional de Proteccién

Ambiental).2°5

RAOHE also requires that operators comply with permissible limits, i.e. with maximum
benchmark values set out in the annexes. Thus, with respect to atmospheric emissions,
liquid discharges and solid wastes, Article 86 of RAOHE requires that operators comply
with the permissible limits set out in Annexes Nos. 1, 2 and 3, which constitute the

296

“minimum program for the internal environmental monitoring” of the operator. If a

permissible limit set in the annexes is exceeded, the operator must immediately notify

Id., Article 16(2). The Parties disagree on the scope of the obligation of notification. Ecuador
submitted that the Consortium was under a duty to report any spill, not just those exceeding five
barrels of crude oil. According to Ecuador, the Consortium in any event failed to report all spills
that exceeded the five barrel limit. For its part, Burlington argued that it reported all spills
exceeding five barrels of crude oil, in addition to other, more minor spills. See, for instance:
Reply, 9 44-52; R-PHB, 9§ 766-774; Rejoinder, § 290-298; C-PHB, 4 2, 7.

have been applied.”*”

Annex 2 contains six tables detailing “parameters, maximum benchmark values and
permissible limits” for routine environmental monitoring and control relating to
atmospheric emissions (Table 3), liquid water and effluent discharges (Table 4), black
and grey water discharges (Table 5), soil remediation (Table 6), mud pit leachates
(Table 7), and waste disposal (Table 8). Finally, Annex 3 contains additional
parameters, benchmarks and limits for more in-depth environmental monitoring and
control.2%°

RAOHE Table 4 establishes permissible limits for the permanent environmental
monitoring of water and effluent discharges during all phases of hydrocarbons
operations. It requires oilfield operators to routinely monitor discharges in accordance
with the limits for discharge points (Table 4a) and for points at the receptor bodies
(Table 4b).2°

RAOHE Table 6 sets out permissible limits for the identification and remediation of
contaminated soils “in all phases of the hydrocarbons industry”.*” It specifies that “the
permissible limits to be applied to a determined project depend on the subsequent use
(uso posterior) to be given to the remediated soil’.°°' As already mentioned, Table 6
distinguishes between three types of land use: industrial, agricultural and sensitive
ecosystems.*” Industrial land use criteria apply to “sites of industrial use (constructions,
etc.)”; agricultural land use criteria focus on the “protection of soils and crops”; and
sensitive ecosystem land use criteria are employed for the “protection of sensitive
ecosystems such as the National Heritage of Natural Areas and others identified in the

corresponding environmental study”.°>

background values must prevail.

According to Table 6, contaminated soils must be monitored at least every six months
with at least one sample and a final characterization once remediation works are
finalized.

RAOHE Table 7 spells out the permissible limits for leachates during the “final disposal

pit is lined or not (has an “impermeabilization at its base or not”).°° Table 7a applies to
unlined pits and Table 7b to lined pits. Table 7a contains the following permissible

2.6 Unified Text of Secondary Environmental Legislation (TULAS)

TULAS was promulgated on 31 March 2003 in furtherance of the principles established
in the EML.% It deals inter alia with the environmental authorities, environmental
management, forest regime, biodiversity, coastal resources, environmental quality, the
special regime of the Galapagos, the Institute for the eco-development of the Amazon
region or ECORAE, and a special tax regime for the use of resources under the
authority of the Ministry of the Environment.

The provisions relevant to the present case are found in Book VI of TULAS, which is
composed of a number of sections and annexes. TULAS establishes a Single
Environmental Management System (the “SUMA”) in order to ensure inter alia the
State’s oversight of compliance with environmental management plans of regulated

entities.%°°

One of the main objectives of TULAS, in particular in Title IV, is to provide
the necessary regulations in pursuance of the Environmental Management Law for the
Prevention and Control of Environmental Contamination.°"° Article 42 of Title IV
provides that TULAS seeks to “determine, at the national level, the permissible limits for
discharges into water bodies or sewer systems; emissions in the air, including noise,
vibrations and other forms of energy; wastes, application and disposal of liquids, solids
or a combination, into the soil’, and to “establish the quality criteria of a resource and
criteria or objectives of remediation of an impacted resource”.*"

Article 45 of Title IV sets forth general principles of environmental stewardship of
regulated entities, such as sustainability, equity, prior informed consent, valid
representation, coordination, precaution, prevention, mitigation and remediation of

negative impacts, solidarity, co-responsibility, co-operation, recycling and reuse of
wastes, conservation of resources in general, minimization of wastes, use of clean
technologies, alternative and environmentally sound technologies, and respect for
traditional cultures and practices as well as ancestral possessions.°"

Chapter IV of Title IV addresses environmental control techniques, such as
environmental impact studies, environmental management plans, environmental audits,

and_inspections.*"*

In this context, Article 70 specifies that the approval of
environmental management plans or other environmental studies cannot exonerate
operators from liability for environmental contamination.°"* Chapter V sets out the rights
and obligations of regulated entities, such as the duties to submit annual reports on
environmental monitoring,°"° to obtain approval of environmental management plans

7

and environmental audits,°'° to immediately notify emergency situations,°"” and to

obtain permits for discharges or emissions.*'®

Finally, Chapter VIIl addresses
environmental norms, including the various stages for the elaboration of standards in

pursuance of Article 4 of the EML.

According to Ecuador, TULAS sets out general rules for the evaluation of environmental
impacts of water and soil resources “from a technical perspective”.*’° TULAS is
therefore complementary to RAOHE, since it supplies chemical parameters not present
in RAOHE and also provides for the application of background values.*”°

By contrast, according to Burlington, RAOHE is the primary source of environmental
obligations of oilfield operators in Ecuador, because, unlike the more general TULAS, it
expressly and specifically applies to oilfield operations, and TULAS merely supplements
RAOHE. Burlington submits that the rules in RAOHE trump the more general

regulations contained in TULAS, except where RAOHE is silent. This is so, for instance,
with respect to some soil contaminants that are not listed in RAOHE Table 6,
Annex 2.57!

The Annexes to Book VI of TULAS establish the limits for different environmental
media.°” For present purposes, Annex 1 relating to the quality of water resources and
effluent discharge standards and Annex 2 relating to soil quality standards and
remediation criteria are of particular relevance.

Turning first to soil quality, Annex 2, entitled “Environmental Quality Standard for Soil
Resources and Remediation Criteria for Contaminated Soils”, sets out regulatory
standards in furtherance of the EML and the Regulation of the EML for the Prevention
and Control of Environmental Contamination. Its application is mandatory across the
entire Ecuadorian territory.* Its main objective is to prevent and control soil
contamination, so as to preserve the integrity of humans, ecosystems and their
interrelationships, as well as the environment at large.°™* To this end, it establishes (i)
norms of general application for soils with distinct uses, (ii) soil quality standards, (iii)
remediation criteria for contaminated soils, and (iv) technical norms for the evaluation of
the agrological capacity of soils.°%

Article 4.1.2 deals with activities that are degrading the soil quality.**° It provides that
public or private entities engaged inter alia in hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation
must take the necessary measures to avoid harm to soils.” Article 4.1.3, relating to
contaminated soils, states that contamination due to spills or leaks must be remediated

CMCC, § 108; Bedén ER1, 31. Professor Bedon explained that “TULAS is applied in a general

manner to all of those activities that may cause an impact that requires environmental
authorization. The activities that have a specific regulation due to their subject matter, such as
those for hydrocarbons, mining or telecommunications, must be carried out pursuant to said
specific regulation and resort to the regulations of TULAS only in the absence of a specific
regulation, in which case TULAS will be applied in a supplementary manner”. Bedon ER1, App.

taking into account “the remediation criteria for contaminated soils found in [TULAS]’.2

It prescribes that the competent regulatory authority must request that remediation and
monitoring be undertaken until the “remediation objectives or remediation values”
established in TULAS are achieved.” It further states that “in case of the inapplicability
for the specific case of any parameter established in [TULAS] or in case of the absence
in the regulation of a relevant parameter for the soil under study”, the regulated entity
must establish the “background or reference value of the parameter of interest present
in the soil’ in the affected area, in order to compare the actual values with these
background values.**° This provision further indicates that a concentration exceeding
three times the background value for the soil constitutes contamination that requires
“immediate attention” on the part of the environmental control authority.**' In such
cases, the regulated entity must remediate the contaminated soil until the concentration
is lower or equal to 1.5 times the background value.**

Article 4.2 establishes soil quality standards and remediation standards. It defines soil
quality standards as “approximate background values or analytical detection limits for a
contaminant in the soil’.*** Background values refer to “representative environmental
levels for a contaminant in the soil’, which can reflect natural geological variations of
undeveloped areas or areas free of the influence of generalized industrial or urban
activities.° Table 2 sets out soil quality standards, comprising 3 general parameters
(electric conductivity, pH and sodium adsorption ratio), 19 inorganic parameters
(including arsenic, barium, cadmium, total chromium, mercury, nickel, lead, vanadium
and zinc), and 14 organic parameters (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons).°°°

2.7 The 2008 Constitution

Ecuador entered a new stage of environmental protection with the adoption of the 2008
Constitution. Most notably, the new Constitution bestows rights to nature (called Pacha
Mama using the term employed in traditional Andean cultures) and codifies the
fundamental principles of environmental stewardship. It declares that the elimination of
poverty and the promotion of sustainable development, as well as the equitable
redistribution of resources and wealth are fundamental duties of the State.°“* It also
specifies that constitutional principles and rights, including those relating to
environmental matters, are “unalienable, obligatory, indivisible, interdependent and of

equal importance”.

Id., Table 5 (Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0334-0337; Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0002-0004).

Addressing first the rights of nature, the Tribunal notes Article 10 providing that “[nJature
shall be the subject of those rights that the Constitution recognizes for it”. These rights
are then specified in Articles 71 to 74.

Article 71 declares that “Nature or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs,
has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and
regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes”.

Article 72 further provides that “Nature has the right to be restored” and that the duty to
restore nature runs in parallel to the duty to compensate individuals and communities
that depend on affected natural systems.*° The exploitation of non-renewable natural
resources leading to “severe or permanent environmental impact” must be subject to
“the most effective mechanisms to achieve the restoration”, including through “adequate
measures to eliminate or mitigate harmful environmental consequences’.*“°

Article 73 requires the State to apply “preventive and restrictive measures on activities
that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the
permanent alteration of natural cycles”.°“”

Article 74 then qualifies the rights of nature by stating that persons, communities,
peoples and nations have the “right to benefit from the environment and the natural
wealth” so as to enable them “to enjoy the good way of living”, while specifying that
environmental services are not subject to appropriation.*“*

Turning then to environmental protection in general, the Constitution declares as
matters of “public interest’, inter alia, environmental conservation, the protection of
ecosystems, biodiversity, the prevention of environmental damage and the recovery of
degraded natural spaces.“° The Constitution further recognizes the “right of the

population to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment that guarantees
sustainability and the good way of living (sumak kawsay)”.**° In this context, the State is
called upon to promote the use of environmentally clean technologies, nonpolluting and
low-impact alternative sources of energy, while certain noxious substances, such as
highly toxic persistent organic pollutants or toxic wastes, are forbidden.°*"

The Constitution also highlights the special value of the Amazon ecosystem, providing
that, in addition to the regular territorial subdivisions, special systems may be
established for reasons of environmental conservation.** With respect to the
Amazonian region, Article 250 insists on the conservation of its ecosystem as part of
the planet’s environmental equilibrium:

“The territory of the Amazon provinces is part of an ecosystem that is
necessary for the planet’s environmental balance of the planet [sic]. This
territory shall constitute a special territorial district, for which there will be
integrated planning embodied in a law including social, economic,
environmental and cultural aspects, with land use development and
planning that ensures the conservation and protection of its ecosystems
and the principle of sumak kawsay (the good way of living)’.
To implement these objectives, Article 259 requires the State to adopt sustainable

development policies:

“With the aim of safeguarding the biodiversity of the Amazon ecosystem,
the central State and decentralized autonomous governments shall adopt
sustainable development policies which shall also offset disparities in
their development and consolidate sovereignty’.°*
In connection with the economic aspects of environmental protection, the Constitution
reserves the State’s powers to administer, regulate, monitor and manage strategic

sectors,**> such as the hydrocarbons industry,** in accordance with “the principles of

Id., Article 14(1). The Good Way of Living System, is further expanded on in Title VII, Articles
340 to 415, focusing on inclusion and equity on the one hand (Chapter I), and biodiversity and
natural resources on the other hand (Chapter II).

Id., Article 15.

Id., Article 242(1).
Id., Article 250.
Id., Article 259.

Strategic sectors come under the “exclusive control of the State” and are defined as those
sectors “that, due to their importance and size, exert a decisive economic, social, political or

205.

207.

environmental sustainability, precaution, prevention and efficiency’.°°’ Only on an
exceptional basis may the State delegate to private enterprise the management of
strategic resources, including the sustainable use of natural resources.°*

Non-renewable natural resources are declared part of the “unalienable heritage of the
State and are not subject to a statute of limitations”.°*? Their management must take
into account the “responsibility between generations” and “the conservation of nature”
as well as the objective to “minimize the negative impacts of an environmental, cultural,
social and economic nature”.° Water, as a “vital element for nature and human
existence”, forms part of the “country’s strategic heritage for public use” which is
“unalienable” and imprescriptible property of the State.°*"

Of particular relevance for present purposes is Chapter II of Title VII which deals with
biodiversity and natural resources management as part of the so-called Good Way of
Living System. It addresses fundamental environmental principles,*® biodiversity

conservation,** natural assets and ecosystems,*™ natural resources, soils,°%

water,°°’ and the biosphere, urban ecology and alternative sources of energy.*®

Within Chapter Il, Article 395 sets forth fundamental environmental principles, such as
sustainable development, based on a model that is “environmentally balanced and

 

environmental impact and must be aimed at ensuring the full exercise of rights and the general
welfare of society”. /d., Article 313(2).

Strategic sectors are “energy in all its forms, telecommunications, nonrenewable natural
resources, oil and gas transport and refining, biodiversity and genetic heritage, the radio
spectrum, water and others as established by law”. /d., Article 313(3).

capacity of ecosystems, and ensures meeting the needs of present and future
generations”,*® integration,°” and public participation.*”' Article 395(4) embodies the

principle in dubio pro natura in the following terms:

“In the event of doubt about the scope of legal provisions for
environmental issues, it is the most favorable interpretation of their
effective force for the protection of nature that shall prevail”.

Article 396 then addresses the risks and consequences of human-induced

environmental impacts. Having articulated the principles of prevention and

372

precaution,“ it provides in paragraph 2 that strict liability governs environmental harm

and that full restoration of ecosystems must be achieved in addition to compensating
affected persons and communities:

“Responsibility for environmental damage is objective. All damage to the
environment, in addition to the respective penalties, shall also entail the
obligation to integrally restoring the ecosystems and compensating the
affected persons and communities”.°”

The third paragraph of Article 396 then imposes on all economic actors the duty to
prevent environmental impacts, and to mitigate and repair the “damages caused” by
them to the environment:

Id., Article 395(1).

Id., Article 395(2) (“Environmental management policies shall be applied cutting across all
sectors and dimensions and shall be mandatorily enforced by the State at all of its levels and by
all natural persons or legal entities in the country’s territory’).

Id., Article 395(3) (“The State shall guarantee the active and permanent participation of affected
persons, communities, peoples and nations in the planning, implementation and monitoring of all
activities exerting environmental impacts”).

Id., Article 396(1) (“The State shall adopt timely policies and measures to avoid adverse
environmental impacts where there is certainty about the damage. In the case of doubt about the
environmental impact stemming from a deed or omission, although there is no scientific
evidence of the damage, the State shall adopt effective and timely measures of protection”). The
translation provided by Ecuador reads as follows: “The State shall adopt the appropriate policies
and measures to avoid negative environmental impacts, where there is a certainty of harm. In
the case of doubt regarding the environmental impact of an action or omission, even where there
is no scientific evidence of the harm, the State shall adopt effective and appropriate measures of
protection” (Exh. P-12).

Id., Article 396(2) (Exh. C-413) (Translation by the Claimant). The translation provided by
Ecuador reads as follows: “Liability for environmental harm is strict. Any harm to the
environment, in addition to the corresponding sanctions, shall also give rise to an obligation to
fully restore the ecosystems and compensate the individuals and communities affected” (Exh. P-
12).

93

210.

211.

212.

213.

“Each one of the players in the processes of production, distribution,
marketing and use of goods or services shall accept direct responsibility
for preventing any environmental impact, for mitigating and repairing the

damages caused, and for maintaining an ongoing environmental
monitoring system”.°”4

Finally, the fourth paragraph of Article 396 provides for the imprescriptibility of
environmental claims in the following terms:

“The legal proceedings to prosecute and punish those responsible for

environmental damages shall not be subject to any statute of
limitations” *”°

In case of environmental harm, Article 397 provides that the “State shall act
immediately and with a subsidiary approach to guarantee the health and restoration of
ecosystems”. That provision further specifies that, in addition to sanctions, “the operator
of the activity that produced the damage” must procure “integral reparation, under the
conditions and on the basis of the procedures provided for by law’.

In this context, the (individual and collective) right to live in a healthy and ecologically
balanced environment is secured by a guarantee of access to justice, ascertaining
“effective custody in environmental matters”.°”° This entails among other things that the
operator of the impugned activity bears the burden of proving the “absence of potential

or real danger’.°””

In this section of Chapter II dealing with fundamental principles, the State further
pledges to “ensure the intangibility of protected natural areas, so as to guarantee the
conservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of the ecological functions of the

 

Id., Article 396(3) (Exh. C-413) (Translation by the Claimant). The translation provided by

environmental impact, for mitigating and repairing the harm that it has caused, and for
maintaining a permanent environmental monitoring system” (Exh. P-12).

ecosystems”.°” Finally, Article 399 vests a decentralized national environmental
management system with overall stewardship over the environment and nature.*”*

Among the other provisions of Chapter II which may be relevant for the resolution of this
dispute, the Tribunal notes in Section Ill: Article 404 under which ecosystems*° must
be managed “in accordance with land use planning and ecological zoning, in
compliance with the law”; Article 405 referring to the “national system of protected
areas” which serves to guarantee the conservation of biodiversity and the “maintenance
of ecological functions”; Article 406 mandating that the State regulate “fragile and
threatened ecosystems”, such as “high Andean moorlands, wetlands, cloud forests, dry
and wet tropical forests and mangroves, marine ecosystems and seashore
ecosystems”; and Article 407 prohibiting extractive industries of non-renewable natural
resources in protected areas and in “areas declared intangible assets”, subject to
limited exceptions.

In the remainder of Chapter Il, attention is called to norms of the following content:

Section IV which deals with non-renewable natural resources as part of the “unalienable

property of the State, immune from seizure and not subject to a statute of limitations”,**"

the production of which must be “in strict compliance with the environmental principles

set forth in the Constitution’;** soil conservation as a matter of “public interest and

national priority’;° the State must regulate water resources and the equilibrium of

Id., Article 397(4), 1% sentence.

Id., Article 399. This provision reads as follows: “The full exercise of state guardianship over the
environment and joint responsibility of the citizenry for its conservation shall be articulated by
means of a decentralized national environmental management system, which shall be in charge
of defending the environment and nature”.

Article 404 defines Ecuador's “unique and priceless” natural assets as including “the physical,
biological and geological formations whose value from the environmental, scientific, cultural or
landscape standpoint requires protection, conservation, recovery and promotion”. /d., Article
404, 1°' sentence.

Id., Article 408(1) (Exh. C-413) (Translation by the Claimant). The translation provided by
Ecuador reads as follows: “Non-renewable natural resources [...] are of the State’s inalienable,
imprescriptible and unseizable property” (Exh. P-12).

ecosystems,*™* mitigate climate change, limit greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation

and air pollution, as well as conserve “forests and vegetation”.°®°

This overview demonstrates that environmental protection is one of the 2008
Constitution’s fundamental pillars and that environmental stewardship has taken on a
new dimension in Ecuadorian society, where nature (or Pacha Mama) is itself bearer of

constitutional rights.

2.8 The PSCs

Although its claim is not contractual in nature, Ecuador has relied on the PSCs to
strengthen its contention that Burlington is liable for the environmental conditions found
in Blocks 7 and 21.

Under the Block 7 and Block 21 PSCs, the Contractor agreed to comply with “all laws,
regulations and other provisions” of Ecuador that are applicable to the contracts.**° The
Consortium also gave its consent to a series of reporting requirements, such as keeping

Petroecuador informed of the activities carried out under the contracts, including by

submitting environmental management plans;**’ carrying out environmental impact

studies in accordance with RAOHE;*® providing the Ministry of Energy and Mines and

Id., Articles 411-412.
Id., Article 414.

Clause 5.1.18 of the Block 7 PSC reads as follows: “Without prejudice to the other obligations
contained in this Contract, the Contractor is obliged to: [...] Comply with and require that its
subcontractors comply with all laws, regulations and other provisions applicable to this Contract
in the Republic of Ecuador” (Exh. C-1 Corrected translation; CE-CC-28). Similarly, Clause
5.1.17 of the Block 21 PSC provides that the Contractor shall “comply with all the laws.
regulations and any other applicable provisions of the Republic of Ecuador” (Exh. C-2; Exh. CE-
CC-13).

Clause 5.1.8 of the Block 21 PSC (Exh. C-2; Exh. CE-CC-13).

Clause 5.1.4 of the Block 7 PSC (Exh. C-1 Corrected translation; Exh. CE-CC-28). Under
Clause 5.1.11 of the Block 7 PSC, the Contractor agreed to provide to the Ministry of Energy
and Mines these environmental impact studies and any supporting documentation. Under
Clause 5.1.20.3 of the Block 7 PSC, the Contractor confirmed that “as of the effective date” of
the contract, it had completed the required environmental impact studies, and that they had been
submitted and approved by the Undersecretary of the Environment. Clause 5.1.20.4 of the Block
7 PSC states that any additional environmental studies that would be required for additional
oilfield activities have to be submitted in accordance with the RAOHE. Clause 3.3.12 defines
environmental impact studies as follows: “Environmental Impact Study (EIS): Is the document
whereby the Contractor reports the risks and potential positive and negative effects which
hydrocarbon operations or other activities foreign to the ecosystem could have on nature and
social organizations, and the measures that shall be taken in order to prevent, control, and
mitigate the risks and negative effects, as well as the necessary actions to rehabilitate affected

Petroecuador with copies of environmental information related to the Consortium’s
activities;>°° and conducting periodical socio-environmental audits “in order to prevent,
as much as possible, any negative impact of the Contractor's activities on human
settlements and on the environment”.°%°

Under Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 7 PSC, the Contractor agreed to “preserve the
existing ecological equilibrium in the Contract Area” in accordance with all pertinent
standards and the environmental impact studies.**' The Contractor also accepted to
“[t]hroughout the term of this Contract, take all necessary measures to conserve and
safeguard life and property and to protect the environment”.*” In order to achieve these
goals, the Contractor further undertook to employ “qualified personnel, equipment,
machinery, materials, operational procedures and, in general, technology which
complies with environmental protection standards and practices used in the
international petroleum industry, subject to compliance with existing standards in

Ecuador”.°%

 

areas”. Clause 5.1.20.4 spells out the content of environmental impact studies, as including (i)
an inventory and diagnostic (baseline) study to determine the environmental situation and the
level of contamination in the Contract Area, including a description of natural resources, in
particular forests, flora and fauna; (ii) a description and technical evaluation of the foreseeable
direct and indirect effects on the physical, biotic and social environment, in the short and long
term; (iii) a detailed environmental management plan, aimed at avoiding exceeding the
maximum tolerable levels; and (iv) and abandonment plan for the area. Since the Block 21 PSC
was executed prior to any oilfield operations, that contract is drafted in different terms, indicating
that exploration had to be undertaken within 6 months of the so-called “effective date”, which is
defined in Clause 3.3.15 as the “date of approval of the Environmental Impact Study by the
Ministry of the Environment for the seismic prospection phase of Block 21” (Exh. C-2; Exh. CE-
CC-13).

Clause 5.1.10 of the Block 7 PSC (Exh. C-1 Corrected translation; Exh. CE-CC-28). Compare
with: Clause 5.1.9 of the Block 21 PSC (Exh. C-2; Exh. CE-CC-13).

Clause 5.1.20.6 of the Block 7 PSC (Exh. C-1 Corrected translation; Exh. CE-CC-28).
Compare with: Clause 5.1.18 of the Block 21 PSC (Exh. C-2; Exh. CE-CC-13).

Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 7 PSC (Exh. C-1 Corrected translation; Exh. CE-CC-28). That
same provision adds that the Undersecretary of Environmental Protection “may request the
performance of studies complementary to” already existing environmental impact studies.

Clause 5.1.20.8 of the Block 7 PSC (Exh. C-1 Corrected translation; Exh. CE-CC-28). Clause
5.1.19 of the Block 21 PSC reads as follows: “While conducting the operations, the Contractor
shall take every necessary measure to ensure the preservation and safety of lives and
properties and preserve the environment. The above notwithstanding, the Contractor shall not
be responsible for changes to the ecosystem caused by third parties within the Contract Area”
(Exh. C-2: Exh. CE-CC-13).

Clause 5.1.20.9 of the Block 7 PSC (Exh. C-1 Corrected translation; Exh. CE-CC-28). Clause
5.1.7 of the Block 21 PSC is worded slightly differently: “To use personnel, equipment,

97

221.

The Block 7 and Block 21 PSCs also addressed the issue of remediation and post-
operations cleanup, in particular by providing that the Contractor would not be liable for
preexisting environmental conditions (prior to the Services Contract for Block 7, and
prior to the Participation Contract for Block 21), or for environmental conditions resulting
from operations that are subsequent to the expiry of the PSCs. Clause 5.1.20.10 of
Block 7 PSC reads as follows:

“The Contractor will take responsibility for cleanup and reforestation of
the area with species similar to those originally found at the site, in order
to, with time, allow the site to return to its original potential, with
environmental conditions similar to those found at the beginning of the
operations. The Contractor will also be responsible for abandonment of
the wells and installations for which the Contractor has been responsible
under the terms of this Contract. The cleanup, reforestation and return to
similar conditions and abandonment activities will comply with the
Environmental Regulations for Hydrocarbon Operations and with the
provisions of the Environmental Impact Study. The Contractor will not be
liable for preexisting environmental conditions at the beginning of the
Service Contract activities. In situations where government authorities
order remediation of the environment in the Contract Area due to
preexisting conditions, the Contractor will not be liable for the costs and
services. Moreover, the Contractor will not be liable for environmental
conditions resulting from operations conducted by PETROECUADOR or
third parties after the Contractor has returned the Contract Area”.

Similarly, Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 PSC reads as follows:

“The Contractor shall be responsible for the clean-up, reforestation, and
abandonment of non-productive wells and facilities as a result of this
Contract. These activities shall be carried out in accordance with the
legislation in effect in Ecuador at the time that such clean-up,
reforestation, or abandonment is carried out and as contemplated in the
Environmental Impact Study.

The Contractor shall not be responsible for pre-existing environmental
conditions at the start of the operations under the Contract.

In such cases where the competent authorities order mitigation of the
environment in the Contract Area due to pre-existing conditions, any
costs incurred in connection with such activities shall be assumed by the
Ecuadorian State.

Nor shall the Contractor be responsible for environmental conditions
resulting from operations by PETROECUADOR or third parties after the

Contract Area is returned by the Contractor”.°**

225.

Finally, in the context of the Contracts’ termination, the PSCs specify that the
Consortium was to undertake a “comprehensive environmental audit” two years prior to
the termination of the PSC. Clause 5.1.20.7 of the Block 7 PSC, for instance, reads as
follows:

“Two (2) years prior to the termination date of this Contract, the
Contractor will contract a comprehensive environmental audit of the
Contract Area, based on the Environmental Impact Studies, and this
audit must be completed no later than six (6) months prior to the
termination date of this Contract. The final results of the audit will be
binding for the Parties. The cost of performing the audit will be paid by
the Parties in equal proportions (50/50). This audit will be performed by a
company selected by mutual agreement of the Parties in a written
agreement and the audit will comply with applicable Ecuadorian Law.
The parties who perform these studies and audits must be previously
qualified by the Ministry of Environment through the Undersecretary of
the Environment’.°°

3. Conditions of liability

The Tribunal will start by reviewing the liability regime applicable to hazardous activities,
such as oilfield operations, in Ecuador (3.1). It will then address the statute of limitation
(3.2) and the liability for successive operators (3.3).

The Tribunal is called to rule on Burlington's possible liability in tort, as opposed to
contractual liability under the PSCs. It will thus review the tort liability regime for
environmental harm as it arises from the 2008 Constitution (3.1.1) and as it existed
before (3.1.2), to then draw the necessary conclusions for the case at hand.

3.1.1. The strict liability regime under the 2008 Constitution

The Parties agree, and rightly so, that the 2008 Constitution establishes strict liability for
environmental harm.°% The Constitution also sets the following rules of the strict liability

 

Clause 5.1.20.7 of the Block 7 PSC (Exh. C-1 Corrected transl. ; Exh. CE-CC-28).
Ex!

Compare with: Clause 5.5.5 of the Block 21 PSC (Exh. C-2 13).

Article 396(2): “Responsibility for environmental harm is objective. All damage to the
environment, in addition to the respective penalties, shall also entail the obligation of integrally
restoring the ecosystems and compensating the affected persons and communities” (Exh. C-
413).

regime: (i) the burden of proof of the inexistence of harm falls on the operator;*” (ii) the
operator is only responsible for the harm caused by him;°%° and environmental claims
are imprescriptible.°°°

The constitutional regime has been clarified in case law. Specifically, the burden of
proof of environmental harm was addressed in Los Vencedores, a decision dealing with
a claim against Perenco for soil contamination in Block 7 that occurred after the entry
into force of the 2008 Constitution.“ The Court held that the burden of proving harm
had been reversed by Article 397(1) of the 2008 Constitution, which provides that “[t]he
burden of proof regarding the inexistence of potential or real harm shall lie with the
manager of the activity or the defendant”. The Tribunal’s understanding is that the
plaintiff still has the burden to make a showing of harm plausibly connected to the
defendant's activities and the defendant then has the burden of proving its absence.

Applied to the present case, the rule contained in Article 397(1) means that once
Ecuador has made a showing of the existence of environmental harm reasonably
related to the Consortium’s risky activities, for example by way of the IEMS sampling
exercise, Burlington then carries the burden of demonstrating that there is no harm or, if
there is harm, what its limits are.

Ecuadorian courts have also held that fault is not a requirement of strict liability. The
National Court of Justice explained that strict civil liability is the equivalent of “risk
liability” or “fault-less liability” that is triggered “regardless of whether there was willful
misconduct or negligence from the person”.“°' The Court added that the duty to repair

Article 397(1), 2" sentence: “The burden of proof regarding the absence of potential or real
danger shall lie with the operator of the activity or the defendant” (Exh. C-413).

Article 396(3): “Each one of the players in the processes of production, distribution, marketing
and use of goods or services shall accept direct responsibility for preventing any environmental
impact, for mitigating and repairing the damages caused, and for maintaining an ongoing
environmental monitoring system” (Exh. C-413).

Article 396(4): “The legal proceedings to prosecute and punish those responsible for
environmental damages shall not be subject to any statute of limitations” (Exh. C-413).

environmental harm is based on the fact that the harm caused “may be materially
1 402

attributed to a certain activity, not on the existence of fault
Applied to this case, the absence of a requirement of fault implies that Burlington may
not avoid liability by raising that it acted diligently.

Another element of strict liability addressed by the courts is the requirement of
causation. Under the strict liability regime, causation is presumed. In Aguinda, the
National Court of Justice referred to the Delfina Torres decision, where it was held that
under strict liability the operator could only escape liability by showing that the harm
was caused by force majeure (hecho fortuito), a third party or the victim.4°°

The reliance on a presumption of causation under the constitutional regime is further
substantiated by the Final Report of Committee 5 on Natural Resources and
Biodiversity of the Constituent Assembly that prepared the 2008 Constitution. This

report explains that the reversal of the burden of proving harm is due to the need to

404

establish a “presumption of innocence” in favor of the environment,” which, in turn,

entails a reversal of the burden of proving the causal nexus between the act and the
damage:

“The presumption of innocence should be established in favour of the
environment. From this perspective, the burden of proof should be
reversed to be against the defendant [...], in other words, counter to the
former principle which assumes innocence until guilt is proven, strict
liability would be the defense in environmental matters. The plaintiff will
not be required to prove causal nexus, and the burden of proof would
correspond to the defendant. This principle eliminates one of the barriers
impeding access to environmental justice, which is the cost of producing
evidence and the technical requirement to prove environmental
damages”.

Ibid. The National Court of Justice also cited Resolution No. 378-1999 (Tercera Sala, R.O.
No. 23, 23 II del 2000) where it is stated: “The principle that any harm should be repaired gives
rise to entirely reconsidering the law of liability. From this principle derives strict liability, in which
it is not necessary for fault to link the damaging act with the victim, since the production of harm
may be sufficient [...]”. /d., pp. 115-116 (Exh. EL-233).

For present purposes, this holding means that Burlington can be exempted from liability
if it proves that the harm was caused by force majeure, by a third party, or by Ecuador
and in particular by Petroamazonas after the takeover of the Blocks.*% Burlington
accepts that the strict liability regime established under the 2008 Constitution involves
“some burden shifting within the concept of causation”. It insists, however, that Ecuador
needed first to prove that the harm “occurred on the Consortium’s watch”, after which
Burlington could show that the harm was caused by force majeure, the victim or a third
party.“°” While the Tribunal will revert to the issue of successive tort liability, it disagrees
with Burlington’s position that Ecuador must prove that the harm was caused during the
time of the Consortium’s operations. Indeed, proof of causation is not required.
Causation is presumed, with the result that liability ensues from the mere exercise of a
risky activity and the occurrence of harm that is plausibly connected to such activity as
far as the type and location of the harm is concerned.

The constitutional regime just described has no retroactive effect. Indeed, Article 7 of
the Civil Code restates the general principle that laws have no retroactive effect.“ It is
true that the decision in Baquerizo held that rules of public order do apply
retroactively.“°? However, environmental protection is not a matter of public order under
the 2008 Constitution. It is merely a matter of public interest. Public interest, which is
dealt with in Article 14 of the Constitution cannot be equated with public order, the latter
notion being more restrictive than the former. As a result, there is no room to apply a
rule on environmental protection such as the imprescriptibility of claims under Article
396(4) retroactively.

Aguinda v. Chevron, p. 210 (Exh. EL-233).

“It's typical in a strict liability regime that you would have some burden shifting within the concept
of causation. So, for example, under a strict liability regime like the 2008 Constitution, if a
claimant can prove that a certain type of harm occurred on the Consortium’s watch, then it's up
to the Consortium as the defendant at that point to say, well, that event, although it occurred on
my watch, was actually caused by a third party, someone from outside came in and sabotaged
the well or something of that nature”. Tr. (Day 1) (ENG), 214:1-11 (Opening, Coriell).

Article 7 CC reads as follows: “The law does not provide but for what is to come; it has no
retroactive effect” (Exh. CA-CC-38).

3.1.2 The liability regime for hydrocarbons operations prior to
the 2008 Constitution
The strict liability regime of the 2008 Constitution not applying retroactively, the Tribunal
must assess the rules governing liability for hydrocarbons operations prior to the 2008
Constitution.

The Parties diverge on whether these rules provided for fault-based or strict liability.
Burlington argues in favor of the former, with the result that Ecuador must prove the
existence of environmental harm and that the harm was caused by the Consortium’s
lack of diligence, that is, its fault. In other words, for Burlington, Ecuador must prove
harm, fault and causation. For its part, Ecuador argues that the Consortium’s activities
were always subject to strict liability, or at the latest since the 2002 Delfina Torres
decision of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court. Accordingly, says Ecuador, Burlington can
only be exonerated if it establishes that the harm was caused by force majeure, a third
party or the victim."° A showing of diligence, or lack of fault, would not suffice.

Prior to the entry into force of the 2008 Constitution, tort liability was governed by the
Civil Code. While liability was fault-based, the Civil Code also provided for an objective
liability standard applicable to particular situations.*"' Moreover, the Ecuadorian courts,
especially the Supreme Court in the Delfina Torres case, had extended objective
liability to hazardous activities such as oilfield operations based on the theory of risk.‘"?
In Delfina Torres, the Supreme Court of Justice provided the legal foundations for risk
based liability in the following language:

“Today's world and the coming world, with its extraordinary and
progressive accumulation of risks, requires greater defense of the values
of man, created by a technology that, while it enables everything, it also
threatens everything. The variety of real contingencies of dangers and
risks that are actually drawn as a result of dissatisfaction and aside from
any idea of damages, led to a slow evolution of elements and knowledge
that enabled the most advanced legal systems to enter into socialization

R-PHB, 45; Crespo ER, § 37.

Art. 2229 (prior to 2005, Article 2256) CC reads in relevant part: “The following are particularly
liable for reparation: [...] 3. He who removes slabs from an irrigation ditch or pipe in a street or
path, without the precautions necessary so that those walking or traveling around the area
during the day or night do not fall; [...] 4. He who, being compelled to build or repair a water line
or bridge crossing a path, keeps it in a condition that may be harmful to those transiting through
it” (Translation by the Tribunal) (Exh. CA-CC-38).

regimes of risk leading to the proposition that the victim is not left
defenseless. This gave rise to the theory of risk, according to which, he
who uses and takes advantage of any type of means that endow it with
benefits, generates social risks through such means, and, as a result of
that circumstance, must assume liability for harm caused by them [...].
No fault or wrongfulness is required to recognize tort liability. It is enough
that the harm is a direct consequence of the event that has caused it. It is

purely strict liability”.

The Supreme Court of Justice then identified the elements of strict liability showing that
it is for the alleged tort feasor to prove that he or she did not cause the harm:

“Hence, the need arises to promulgate a new type of liability for this type
of harm, eliminating the criteria of fault through strict liability or the
establishment of an absolute presumption of such. The owner of an
exploitation or industry should respond directly for harm caused by the
referenced industry or exploitation, and he may only exempt himself from
liability if he shows that the harm did not arise from the exploitation, and

arose instead from a foreign act (force majeure, fault of a third party or
the fault of the victim itself)”.“"*

Accordingly, the following elements are characteristic of the strict liability regime for
environmental harm under Ecuadorian law as established in Delfina Torres:

(i) the plaintiff must prove harm connected to the defendant's activities;

(ii) fault is not required; and

(iii) causation is presumed, the defendant being exonerated if he or she proves
that the harm was caused by force majeure, the victim or a third party.

The Supreme Court of Justice also held in Medardo Luna that fault is not required for
strict liability.“"® In the context of the Code of Aeronautics, the Medardo Luna court held
that it was irrelevant whether the company followed applicable regulations and whether
the pilot acted with care.*"®

CC-32): “[I]n strict liability, however, the individual identified as the culprit is imposed the
obligation to compensate the victim, regardless of foresight or intent that the aforementioned
may have had from the damage resulting from the accident. In other words, the party acting out
of malice, negligence or inexperience is no longer solely responsible, but responsibility also lies
upon the individual that created the hazardous activity or used the riskful asset”.

extracontractual civil liability; being it irrelevant whether said company complied with the

242.

The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ experts disagree on whether fault is not a
requirement of strict liability at all or whether it remains a requirement but is presumed.
Differently worded, they disagree on whether there is a rebuttable presumption of fault
(Burlington) or an irrebuttable one (Ecuador). The Respondent's expert Professor
Andrade speaks of an_ irrebuttable presumption (“presuncién de culpabilidad
absoluta’),‘"”
be juris tantum, that is rebuttable.*'® The analysis of the Delfina Torres and Medardo
Luna decisions just referred to show that the presumption of fault cannot be rebutted by

while the Claimant's expert Professor Bedén considers the presumption to

a showing that all precautions have been followed. Only a showing of force majeure, an
act of a third party or of the victim can exonerate the defendant.*"®

Even if the Tribunal were to adopt the position that the pre-2008 strict liability regime
implies a rebuttable presumption of fault, any exceedance of RAOHE or TULAS values
would defeat a due diligence argument. In addition, the non-compliances identified by
Ecuador's expert RPS in connection with the biennial audits for instance,“ as well as
evidence of Mr. Saltos, one of Burlington’s witnesses, on various practices of the
Consortium (discharges, mud pits, spills), would produce the same result.

More specifically, RPS reviewed the compliance record of the Consortium in
environmental matters and identified the following non-compliances during the
Consortium’s operatorship: (i) failure to conduct biennial environmental audits in 2004 in
breach of Article 42 of RAOHE and Article 61 of Book VI of TULAS; (ii) lack of key
environmental documents, such as_ environmental management plans and
environmental licenses; (iii) irregularities in the management of drill cuttings and mud
pits, such as exceedances in maximum permissible limits of leachates in unlined pits;
(iv) exceedances in maximum permissible limits for wastewater, as well as soil quality;
(v) additional non-compliances, such as irregular waste and chemical management, or

 

regulating standards for flight security, or whether the pilot took the precautions indicated for the
case”.

failure to respect a “highly sensitive ecological area” in Block 21; and (vi) environmental
liabilities associated with the Payamino field operations resulting in offsite
contamination and affecting third parties.**'

These instances refute Burlington’s contention that the Consortium complied with all
regulatory requirements.’ It is further preoccupying that the Consortium was operating
the Coca-Payamino, Jaguar, Mono and Gacela fields without any proper environmental
license*’ and was relying on an outdated environmental impact study for the Coca-
Payamino Field.‘** And while the Consortium sought to downplay the fact that it
produced no biennial environmental audit in 2004, the Subsecretary of Environmental
Protection held this omission to be a serious breach of RAOHE.* In this overall
context, the Tribunal further observes that Burlington has not put into the record any
baseline studies or internal due diligence studies generated at the outset of operations,
allowing to assess the environmental condition of the Blocks at the start of operations
as well as preexisting environmental liabilities.*°

The testimony of Mr. Saltos, also revealed various instances of Consortium
malpractices. For instance, Mr. Saltos mentioned that production water was discharged
on the sand bank of the Napo River at the Oso 4 site, so as to filter these discharges

Article 41, Section 6(5) RAOHE reads: “In the intervened zones, it is necessary for the Baseline
to include an analysis of prior impacts caused by other activities” (Translation by the Tribunal).
Article 41, Section 6(6) reads in relevant part: “The choice of assessment and evaluation
techniques shall be at the discretion of the party conducting the study; however, care shall be
taken to: - Analyze the prior environmental situation (Baseline) in comparison with the
environmental transformations resulting from the hydrocarbons activities conducted” (Translation
by the Tribunal). See also: Articles 13(2), 51, 55 and 87(a) RAOHE (Exh. EL-174). Article 2.37
of the TULAS defines the Baseline as follows: “Denotes the state of an altered system at a
particular point in time, before a subsequent change. It is also defined as the conditions at the
time of investigation within an area that may be influenced by productive or human activities”.
Whereas the baseline refers to prevailing environmental conditions in an altered system,
background level (linea de fondo) refers to prevailing environmental conditions “prior to any
disturbance”, i.e., “conditions that would have predominated in the absence of anthropogenic
activities, with only natural processes being active’. See: TULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Articles

2.37-2.38 (Exh. EL-173 (ESP) 0373; EL-173 (EN) 0005).

before they reached the water body.*?”

Mr. Saltos further testified that the Consortium
was using auxiliary mud pits, such as the well workover pit in Area 2MT in Payamino
1/CPF, which is located beneath the CPF close to the Afango River.*”® Mr. Saltos also
conceded that, during well workovers, the Consortium was moving drilling muds from
one site to another site with open pits, eventually even reopening sealed pits to
introduce newly contaminated soils.“ In addition, as the example of auxiliary pits
shows, the Consortium also made use of pits that were not reported to the authorities,
thus forcing Ecuador’s experts to discover unreported mud pits as a result of their
sampling campaigns (see, for instance, Payamino 1/CPF; Payamino 16).*°° Mr. Saltos
also confirmed that the collapse of the pit at Céndor Norte due to a landslide in 2006
was not remediated until the Consortium left the Blocks in 2009.‘*'

With respect to spills, the evidence provided by Mr. Manuel Solis of Petroamazonas
shows that Mr. Saltos’ list of spills during the Consortium operatorship is incomplete,
further showing that the Consortium did not report all spills to the authorities. Mr. Saltos
confirmed that at Jaguar 1, for instance, the 2005 spill in Area 3T was left unreported
and, worse, was left unremediated with a 30cm layer of clean soil having been put on
top of the affected area, which is not more than 8 meters away from a water body in
close proximity to human dwellings and a school.” Mr. Saltos also testified at Coca
CPF during the Site Visit that, while the malpractice of prior operators in discharging
produced water into the drainage leading to the Chala swamp was discontinued and

Reporte de taponamiento de piscinas de Oso 4-5, noviembre 2004, p. 5 (Exh. E-467): “Water
was transported to the beach of the ballast mine, so that such beach worked as an infiltration
field, thus preventing direct discharge into the river” (Translation by the Tribunal). Mr. Saltos
provided the following testimony: “Yes, | was referring here specifically to the fact that we did not
mix water to reduce exceedance and then discharge it back into the river, as you were saying. In
this specific case here, what it says right here, was released into the beach. Now, the beach acts
as the filter for the water, and this is probably the reason why it was done here. But it's simply
because the beach allowed for that to happen”. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1356:1-8 (Cross, Saltos). See
also: Saltos WS2, 4 26; Saltos WS2, § 29. This practice was also employed, for instance, in:
Coca 18, Payamino 24.

Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1228:1-17 (Cross, Saltos).

remediated, oil seeping continued during the Consortium’s operatorship without any
proper remediation being undertaken by the Consortium."

While the Tribunal accepts Mr. Saltos’ representation that the risk of spills is always
present in oilfield operations “no matter how cautious the operator is”, the Tribunal has
much more difficulty in accepting his statement that the Consortium had a “robust spill
prevention system” in place.*** The Tribunal is even less inclined to accept Mr. Saltos’
attempts to minimize the importance of certain spills, which he qualified as “casi

derrames’ or “liqueos’,“*® since the accumulation over time even of minute amounts of
certain contaminants can in certain circumstances lead to significant environmental
harm if left unremediated. Finally, while Mr. Saltos is right to argue that discharging
effluents into a river was not prohibited prior to the entry into force of TULAS on
31 March 2003,“ this practice does not support Burlington’s contention that the

Consortium was a responsible operator.

To conclude, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that in Ecuadorian law strict liability

governed instances of environmental harm at the latest since the Delfina Torres

decision was handed down in 2002.“%”

Saltos WS1, J 290, 294, 297; Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 139:17-23 (Tribunal, Saltos at Coca
CPF). “Unfortunately, it continued discharging water from the API separator, and this water may
have had traces of hydrocarbons that ended up in the swamp. And, logically, they continued to
go through the swamp until they reached Chala. And that area, as it is lower lying, and cannot
pass directly to the other side of the road, would become sedimented and contamination
accumulated there. When | lived in Chala, we tried to reach an agreement with Chala, we tried,
with him, to carry out a remediation Project. Unfortunately, 2009 came and we could not execute
it. That's how it was”.

Saltos WS1, §| 102. The Spanish version merely refers to the existence of “un sistema de
prevencién de derrames”.

Mr. Saltos stated in relevant part: “These things that are called spills are now not really spills.
These are leaks, small leakages. They're not really important volume wise. The ideal thing, of
course, would have been not to have leaked even one drop of crude, obviously, but these things
are bound to happen in the course of the operations. These operations are carried out by men,
and men are always capable of making a mistake”. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1215:9-16 (Cross,

dangerous activities”. De/fina Torres v. Petroecuador, § 20 (Exh. EL-160).

The Tribunal is mindful that the Perenco tribunal held that fault-based liability governed
Ecuador's claims for environmental harm that predates the 2008 Constitution. While the
Tribunal agrees with the finding in the Perenco Decision that “an operator can in
general be held only to the legal standards that applied to its conduct at the time”,“ it
has difficulty following the Perenco tribunal’s view that decisions of the Ecuadorian
courts have merely “strengthened the presumptions in favour of a finding of liability in
the case of damage caused through hazardous activities”.**° It finds indeed that these
courts have established a strict liability regime for hazardous activities, in particular
oilfield operations.

In addition, it is not disputed that Burlington may be held liable for the harm caused by
its Consortium partner, Perenco, which operated the Blocks during the Consortium’s

tenure.“

It is a different issue whether Burlington may be held liable for harm caused
by prior operators as Ecuador claims and Burlington opposes, to which the Tribunal will

revert after having addressed the limitation period.“*’

3.2 Statute of limitations

Burlington submits that most of Ecuador's claims are time-barred under the four-year
statute of limitations of Article 2235 of the Civil Code,“ which runs from the date when
the allegedly harmful act occurred.““* For Burlington, Ecuador is wrong in seeking to
import the so-called “discovery rule” into the Ecuadorian legal system or to argue that
the imprescriptibility rule of the 2008 Constitution could apply retroactively.“

Accordingly, Burlington submits that claims arising out of incidents that occurred before
18 January 2007 are time-barred and inadmissible.*®

Ecuador opposes Burlington’s argument mainly on the ground that Article 2235 of the
Civil Code only governs liability based on fault.“
the limitation set forth in Article 396(4) of the 2008 Constitution, as the Claimant's

expert Professor Bedén acknowledged at the Hearing.“*” Even if Article 2235 of the

Claims for strict liability are subject to

Civil Code were to apply, says Ecuador, the period would start to run when the harm is
discovered, which is after the Consortium abandoned the Blocks in July 2009.‘
Ecuador adds that its argumentation is reinforced by Burlington’s concealment policy
and lack of reporting,““? and that by acquiring its interest in the Blocks, Burlington

contractually took over the environmental liabilities of prior operators.“°°

It is common ground that environmental claims for harm caused after the entry into
force of the 2008 Constitution are imprescriptible. The Parties disagree, however, on
the prescriptibility of claims for harm caused prior to the Constitution’s entry into force.
They diverge on whether such claims are subject to the four-year limitation of Article
2235 of the Civil Code or whether they are imprescriptible.

The Tribunal is not convinced by Ecuador’s argument that questions related to the
statute of limitations are procedural rather than substantive. The approach in Nelson
Alcivar in this regard is not convincing, nor is its criterion of the date of the filing of the
claim." Article 7(20) of the Civil Code is of no help either here, since it leaves

Nelson Alcivar v. OCP, Corte Provincial de Justicia, 2011, 12 (Andrade ER, Annex 29): “The
provisions of the current Constitution as it relates to environmental issues and its protection is
also preferably applied, since, in procedural matters, the rules in force at the time of filing the
action apply, and not those that were in force when the legal situation was created. In this case,
we observe the moment on which the appeal was filed for application of constitutional rules in
procedural matters, related to the environmental case, in application of the provisions of Art. 7,
point 20 of the Civil Code”.

unaffected terms that have begun to run prior to a change in law.“ More generally, the
Tribunal is of the view that in comparative law and private international law the trend is
to consider the statute of limitation as a substantive rather than a procedural issue.“°

In the Tribunal’s view, it is correct that in principle the four-year statute of limitation
period provided in Article 2235 CC applies to harm caused prior to the entry into force
of the 2008 Constitution, subject to the following specifications.“* The date of the
discovery must apply for environmental harm, not the date of the act, since strict liability
is focused on the result, not on the act causing the harm. This is so because it is difficult

to identity the precise time when environmental harm is generated*®®

and because, in
oilfield operations in Ecuador, the identification of environmental harm is essentially
dependent on the operator’s self-reporting.“ In the same vein, reliance by Burlington
on environmental audits produced by the Consortium as a means to establish
constructive knowledge is misplaced here, since (i) environmental audits have no

preclusive effect as a general matter under Ecuadorian law,“°” and (ii) the Consortium

Article 7(20) CC reads: “Laws concerning the substance and procedure of cases prevail over

earlier ones from the time they take effect. But the terms that have begun to run and the actions
and proceedings that have already begun shall be governed by the law that was in force then”
(Exh. CA-CC-38).

In civil law countries, limitation periods are considered to be substantive in nature. While
common law countries traditionally considered limitation periods to be procedural in nature,
various countries have progressively shifted away from that traditional approach. See, for
instance the Report of the Law Reform Committee “Limitation Periods in Private International
Law” (Singapore Academy of Law, 2011), J 2.

Article 2235 CC reads: “Claims that this Title grants for harm or willful wrongdoing have a statute
of limitations of four years, counted from the perpetration of the act” (Exh. CA-CC-38).

See, for instance, Mr. Saltos’ statements on the necessity to assume facts due to the difficulty to
determine the origin and date of contamination. Saltos WS1, § 252 (Payamino 2-8), § 265
(Payamino 14-20-24); Saltos WS2, 9§ 54, 93, 123; Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1279:18-22 (Cross,
Saltos). Also, GSI acknowledged at the Hearing that they were providing “best estimates” as to
when the alleged damage might have occurred. See, for instance, in relation to the workover pit
at Payamino 1: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1556:20-21 (Cross, Connor).

See, for instance: RAOHE, Article 16 (Exh. EL-174).

TULAS, Book VI, Article 70 reads as follows: “The approval of environmental management plans
and other environmental studies shall not be used as exonerating evidence in environmental
contamination incidents or accidents attributable to any activity, project or construction. The
natural or juridical persons, public or private, that represent such activities shall be liable for
payment of any applicable damages and penalties” (Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0001). See also: Crespo
ER, 9 97-98; SMCC, 9 46-47; 2"? SMCC, 49 46-47. The Block 7 2008 Environmental Audit
indicated that it verified the global compliance of the operations with Ecuadorian regulations, but
that it could by definition not ensure complete compliance: “Por definicién, la auditoria no
asegura que se hayan revisado la totalidad de los requisitos establecidos en el marco legal y

did not generate the required 2004 biennial audits.“ Accordingly, the limitation period
only starts to run from the discovery of the harm. The same applies to harm that has
been insufficiently remediated, since Ecuador could only assume on the basis of
remediation plans and reports submitted by the Consortium that identified harm had
been properly remediated. In this context, the notion of “pasivo ambientaf in Article 1 of
the Ministerial Agreement No. 169 (2012), which refers to insufficiently remediated
harm, further reinforces the Tribunal’s findings above.*?

In sum, (i) environmental harm caused and/or discovered after the entry into force of
the October 2008 Constitution is actionable (Articles 396(4) and 11(3) Cst.), (ii)
environmental harm caused between 17 January 2007 and the entry into force of the
2008 Constitution is actionable, and (iii) environmental harm caused prior to 17 January
2007 is actionable to the extent that it was discovered thereafter (Article 2235 CC read
in light of strict liability). This extends to harm that has been insufficiently remediated,
since any remaining exceedances were only discovered by IEMS in 2011 or thereafter.

3.3. Successive liability of operators

Burlington rejects Ecuador's attempts to hold it liable for harm caused by prior operators
as a matter of tort law (successive tort liability) or pursuant to Clause 5.1.20.10 of the
Block 7 PSC and Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 PSC (successive contractual liability).“°°
After addressing the issue of Burlington’s liability for the acts of prior operators, the
Tribunal will also address the matter of liability for acts of Petroamazonas, the operator
that succeeded the Consortium and is presently operating the Blocks.

See above, paragraphs 242-243.

Article 1 contains various principles and definitions relating to the governance of public
environmental policies, including a definition of environmental liability (pasivo ambiental) which
reads as follows: “These are environmental damages and/or negative environmental impacts not
repaired or restored respectively, or those that have previously been worked on but insufficiently
or incompletely and that continue to be present in the environment constituting a risk to any of its
components, which are generated by a work, project or a productive or economic activity in
general” (emphasis added by the Tribunal). Ministerial Agreement No. 169, published in Official
Register No. 655 of 7 March 2012 (Exh. CA-CC-53). The Tribunal notes that this regulation
postdates the initiation of these counterclaims proceedings.

With respect to successive tort liability for prior operators, the Tribunal has already held
above that causality is a component of strict liability (both under the liability regime of
the 2008 Constitution and under the anterior regime elaborated by Ecuadorian courts),
although it is presumed. Accordingly, to be exonerated, Burlington must prove that any
alleged harm was caused by force majeure, the victim, or a third party. In other words,
under the strict liability regime, Burlington cannot be held liable for harm which it can
prove to have been caused by prior operators.

The situation is different under the PSCs. As was seen above, Clause 5.1.20.10 of the
Block 7 PSC excludes the Consortium’s liability for environmental harm caused prior to
the first service contract, i.e., prior to January 1986 and after return of the contract area,
i.e. in July 2009.**' A similar provision is found in the Block 21 PSC, with the difference
that the starting point for the Consortium’s liability is set at the conclusion of the first
participation contract in 1995.“ Within these time spans, the Consortium is under a
contractual obligation to remediate any environmental harm caused by prior operators.

The question is thus whether the Tribunal should apply this contractual obligation for
harm caused by prior operators in the present context. Ecuador's position has
somewhat fluctuated on this issue.“* At the Hearing, it sought to clarify matters as
follows: “Now, our case, Members of the Tribunal — and we don’t want you to have any
confusion about it — our case is not based upon any contractual liability, but rather of a

Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 PSC reads in relevant part: “The Contractor shall not be liable

for environmental conditions preexisting at the beginning of operations under the Services
Contract. [...] The Contractor shall also not be liable for those environmental conditions which
are the consequence of operations performed by PETROECUADOR or third parties after the
Contractor has returned the Contract Area”. Clause 2.1 of the Block 7 PSC specifies that the
Services Contract was concluded on 18 December 1985, effective as of 17 January 1986 when
it was inscribed in the National Hydrocarbons Directorate (Exh. CE-CC-28).

Block 21 Participation Contract, Clause 5.1.20 (Exh, CE-CC-13). The Block 21 PSC was first
executed on 20 March 1995.

In its Counter-Memorial on Liability, Ecuador mainly relied on Ecuadorian tort law to invoke
Burlington's liability. It mentioned the PSCs “ex abundanti cautela” and stated that “[b]ecause
Ecuadorian law recognizes the principle of strict liability for environmental damages caused by
hydrocarbons operations, there is no need to consider separately whether, in addition,
Burlington could be contractually liable to Ecuador for that same environmental damage under
the Participation Contracts [...]” (Counter-Memorial on Liability, §§ 760-761). Ecuador did not
invoke the PSCs in relation to the environmental counterclaim in its Supplemental Memorials on
Counterclaims. In its Reply, however, Ecuador referred to the PSCs to extend the temporal
scope of the strict liability regime (Reply, § 430).

113

tort liability’.“** In spite of this clear statement, Ecuador sought relief in reliance on the
Constitution and the PSCs*® and one part of its oral presentation focused on the

construction of the PSC provisions on successive operators.“

On a question from the
Tribunal, Ecuador further explained that “the basis for Ecuador's claim is principally the
2008 Constitution tort liability principles; and [...] tentatively the Contract would apply, if
you don’t find that a [sic] tort liability principles apply here. Second point, is that, even if
you have, as the main case of Ecuador, these tort liability principles encompassed in
the 2008 Constitution, it is our position [...] that there are some contractual provisions
that have a bearing on the issue of causation, which you understood especially in this
scenario of succession of operators [...]’.“®” In its Post-Hearing Brief, Ecuador then
invoked strict liability and stated that, in addition, the obligation to fully restore the

468

Blocks also arises from the PSCs“® and the transfers authorized by the Ministry,“°

which obligation extends to the CPUF.‘”°

On this basis, the Tribunal understands that (i) Ecuador’s environmental counterclaim is
a strict liability claim in tort and that (ii) Ecuador refers to the PSCs first, to provide
principles of liability in the event that such principles are lacking in the legal framework
governing strict liability and, second to regulate causation in respect of other operators
in the field.

For its part, Burlington regards this counterclaim as one based exclusively on tort
law.‘”' It also considers that the outcome under the PSCs would be no different, as “the
PSCs exonerate Burlington from liability for harm caused by others’.“” Before
proceeding further, the Tribunal notes that the outcome would, however, be different, as
the contractual liability starts to accrue from the first contracts for the Blocks and not
from the beginning of the Consortium’s operations, as is shown by Clause 2.1 in
conjunction with Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 PSC and by Clause 5.1.20 of the Block
21 PSC.

The Tribunal does not consider that resort to the PSCs is well-founded here. The 2008
Constitution and Ecuadorian case law provide the relevant tort liability principles, as
established above, and there is no basis to import liability principles from the PSCs. As
regards the contractual rules on successive liability of operators more specifically,
Ecuador has not convincingly explained why the Tribunal would need to apply such
contract rules to a tort claim in derogation from the tort liability rules contained in the
2008 Constitution and case law. The same reasoning applies to Ecuador's argument in
respect to the successive transfers of the prior contractor’s obligation to restore the
Blocks which were authorized by the Ministry of Mines and Energy.*”® While Ecuador
characterizes these transfers as a “parallel source of Burlington's obligation to fully
restore the environment in Blocks 7 and 21”,‘” it has not sufficiently substantiated that
this obligation must take precedence over the general tort liability regime discussed

above.

Ecuador has also relied on Article 2217 of the Civil Code to argue that, where harm is
attributable to several authors, each one is liable for the full amount.*” There is no need
to dwell on the rather obvious point that this rule concerns a situation in which several
actors create the same harm; it does not govern a situation in which an operator which
has not caused the harm may, by operation of law or contract, be liable for the harm
caused by another.

Accordingly, Burlington can only be held liable in these proceedings for harm caused by
the Consortium. In other words, Burlington can avoid liability if it shows that the alleged
harm was caused by prior operators. This conclusion is nuanced to take account of the
possibility that pre-existing environmental harm may have continued to expand or
disperse as a result of the Consortium’s breach of its duty to monitor the environmental
conditions in the Blocks and remediate any exceedances, as well as for the possibility
that the Consortium increased the environmental liabilities of an already contaminated
site. In either case, such harm could properly be said to have been at least partially
caused by the Consortium.

In application of the principles of causation discussed above, the Consortium cannot
either be held liable for harm caused by Petroamazonas, the operator that took over the
oilfields in 2009 and expanded operations since then. The Tribunal, however, rejects
Burlington's argument that the Consortium bears no liability for the environmental
conditions of the Blocks simply by virtue of the fact that Petroamazonas took over the
Consortium’s rights and obligations by substituting itself to the Consortium.

Having set out the key components of the strict liability regimes, the Tribunal will now
address the Parties’ positions and set out the Tribunal’s approach regarding soil
contamination (Section 4), mud pits (Section 5) and groundwater contamination
(Section 6). Finally, the Tribunal will address the issue of well site abandonment
(Section 7).

4. Soil contamination

With respect to soil contamination, the Tribunal will start by addressing the notion of
environmental harm (4.1), followed by general considerations on permissible limits
(4.2), land use criteria (4.3), as well as guidelines to calculate impacted areas and
volumes of impacted soils (4.4) and the remediation costs (4.5). This will then allow the
Tribunal to outline its approach to assessing the environmental conditions in the Blocks
and engage in a site-specific analysis (4.6).

4.1 The notion of environmental harm

The Parties disagree on the definition of environmental harm. The opposition hinges on
whether environmental harm is defined by reference to “permissible limits” set out in
applicable regulations (as argued by Burlington) or to “background values” that reflect

116

270.

environmental conditions as they were prior to any human interference (as argued by
Ecuador);*”° and, if the permissible limits approach is adopted, whether the relevant
limits are those applicable to industrial or agricultural land use (as argued by Burlington)

or to sensitive ecosystems (as argued by Ecuador in the alternative).

The consequences of adopting one or the other of these positions are significant in
terms of the monetary relief for soil remediation claimed by Ecuador. Indeed, Ecuador's
primary case is for soil remediation of any environmental harm in the Blocks back to
background values, for which it claims USD 2,507,107,626 (the “background values
case”). In the alternative, Ecuador claims soil remediation back to the sensitive
ecosystems criteria, i.e. the most protective land use standards under RAOHE Table 6,
in the amount of USD 790,465,298 (the “regulatory criteria case”). The Tribunal will
therefore first assess the merits of Ecuador’s argument that background values should
apply as a general matter, and it will only address Ecuador's alternative case if its
background values case is ill-founded.

4.141 Parties’ positions

In support of the background values case, Ecuador essentially argues that the notion of
environmental harm under the 2008 Constitution and the EML is distinct from the notion
of regulatory permissible limits enshrined in RAOHE and TULAS.*” For Ecuador, the
Tribunal must determine environmental harm by examining whether there is a “negative
impact” of any sort on the environment, that is, whether the alleged alteration affects
“the functions of the environment or the renewability of the resources” in accordance
with the EML.*” The Consortium, Ecuador states, had no right to pollute up to
regulatory permissible limits and it must repair all harm found in the Blocks so as to
restore the environment “to its original ‘background condition’.“’”? This must be so,
according to Ecuador, because (i) Burlington’s permissible limits theory is contrary to
the Constitution’s aim of full restoration,” (ii) the notion of environmental harm is not

Mr. Alfaro defined background values as follows: “The concept of background value [...] entails
the conditions of the facilities without or prior to the hydrocarbons operation”. Tr. (Day 3) (ENG),

defined in RAOHE and TULAS,“*' which are mere instruments (iii) aimed at regulating

the activities of oil operators,“ 483

(iv) and at operating as risk management tools," which
(v) govern administrative liability, not civil liability for harm.“®* In the end, Ecuador
argues that (vi) the significance of a “negative impact” can only be assessed on the
specific facts of each case and environmental harm “cannot per se be defined through
quality standards or permissible limits”,“®° in particular because RAOHE and TULAS do
not differentiate the “types and characteristics of lands (deserts, forest, rainforest,
mountains, islands. ..)”.“®

For Burlington, the background values case has no technical or scientific basis, and
only serves to inflate Ecuador's claims in the arbitration.*”’ In particular, Burlington
highlights that IEMS, acting independently, initially applied the permissible limits in
RAOHE and TULAS to determine the existence of harm in the Blocks, but was
subsequently instructed by Ecuador to apply background values without ever evaluating
whether the ecosystem had in fact been impacted.*® IEMS further confirmed that if the
Consortium were still operating today it would be subject to RAOHE and TULAS, not

background values,“®® and RPS agreed that it is appropriate to consider local

regulations when determining volumes of contaminated soils.‘°°

According to
Burlington, meeting permissible limits avoids environmental harm and it is these limits
that determine whether remediation is warranted.**' While Ecuador failed to present a
single example where background values had been applied in practice,“®* the record is
replete with examples where permissible limits were applied, including instances of

remediation by Petroamazonas pursuant to RAOHE and TULAS. The 2010 Ex-Post

Studies also evaluated the environmental condition of the Blocks under regulatory
criteria.“ In addition, Burlington argues that IEMS applied a flawed methodology for
calculating background values of metals resulting in 84 percent of IEMS’s clean

0.494

samples being deemed contaminate: In the end, Burlington submits that

“[rlemediation must be limited to those soils that exceed Ecuador's protective regulatory

limits”, and therefore Ecuador's background case should be dismissed in its entirety.*°°

4.1.2 Discussion

The Tribunal will first ascertain the meaning of environmental harm within the
Ecuadorian regulatory framework (Section a) and then address Ecuador’s argument
that background values provide the relevant threshold for determining the existence of

environmental harm (Section b).

a. Environmental harm under Ecuadorian law

The Tribunal starts its analysis by noting that neither the 2008 Constitution, nor RAOHE
or TULAS contain a definition of environmental harm. Paragraph 2 of Article 396 of the
Constitution provides that any environmental harm triggers the duty to fully restore the
affected ecosystem. It reads in relevant part:

“All damage to the environment, in addition to the respective penalties,

shall also entail the obligation of integrally restoring the ecosystems and

compensating the affected persons and communities”.“%°
The Tribunal further observes that Article 71 of the Constitution states that nature has
the “right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration
of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes”, and Article 72
provides for nature’s “right to be restored”. This latter provision further stipulates that in

cases of “severe or permanent environmental impact” caused inter alia by the

Article 396(2), 2"° sentence of the 2008 Constitution (Exh. C-413) (Translation by the Claimant).
The translation provided by Ecuador reads as follows: “Any harm to the environment, in addition
to the corresponding sanctions, shall also give rise to an obligation to fully restore the
ecosystems and compensate the individuals and communities affected” (Exh. P-12).

exploitation of nonrenewable resources, “the State shall establish the most effective
mechanisms to achieve the restoration and shall adopt adequate measures to eliminate
or mitigate harmful environmental consequences”.**”

Article 397 further states that, in case of environmental harm, the State is to act
immediately to ensure the restoration of affected ecosystems, and that, in addition to
sanctions, “the State shall file against the operator of the activity that produced the
damage proceedings for the obligations entailing integral reparation, under the
conditions and on the basis of the procedures provided for by law’.“°® Thus, under the
2008 Constitution, any environmental harm triggers the duty of full restoration but under
the conditions and on the basis provided for by law. The concept of integral or full
restoration has been addressed in various instances. The travaux préparatoires of the
2008 Constitution indicate, for example, that full restoration means returning things to
their original state (“volver las cosas a su estado original o a su lugar’).“*° And in
Aguinda, the National Court of Justice held that integral reparation served to achieve
the ultimate finality of “global restoration of environmental goods”. In sum, the
Constitution does not define environmental harm, but states that such harm must be
fully restored according to the conditions set out in the law. The Tribunal therefore finds
no support for Ecuador’s argument that the notion of full reparation or full restoration
under the 2008 Constitution mandates a return to pre-human conditions or, as Ecuador

The Tribunal notes Ecuador's representation that Article 72 “only pertains to environmental
disasters, such as Chernobyl, where the State has a duty to intervene without awaiting the
operator's actions”. R-PHB, § 105.

Article 397 (Exh. C-413) (Translation by the Claimant). The translation provided by Ecuador
reads as follows: “In the event of environmental harm, the State shall act immediately and
subsidiarily to ensure the health and the restoration of the ecosystems. In addition to the
corresponding sanction, the State shall seek restitution from the operator of the activity that
produced the harm for the obligations entailed by full reparation, under the conditions and on the
basis of procedures established by law” (Exh. P-12).

 

Minority Report of the Assembly member Sergio Chacon Padilla on the rights of Nature
(Exh. EL-230); Majority Report on the rights of Nature (Exh. EL-231). The Ministerial Agreement
No. 169 (2012) defines “integral restoration” and “integral reparation”. Integral restoration, as a
right of nature, is defined in relevant part as a return “to the conditions set forth by the
environmental authority that ensure the reestablishment of natural balances, cycles and
function”. Integral reparation is defined in relevant part as the “[s]et of actions, processes and
measures that, when comprehensively applied, tend toward reverting environmental damage
and liabilities through the reestablishment of the quality, dynamics, ecological balance, life
cycles, structure, functioning and evolutionary process of the affected ecosystems”. Ministerial

puts it, the return to a state of the environment “prior to any form of contamination”.°' In

the end, Ecuador's reliance on the notion of full restoration sheds no light on the notion
of environmental harm. The question remains whether relying on permissible limits to

define environmental harm would be contrary to the 2008 Constitution as Ecuador

contends.5°

The notion of environmental harm is defined in the glossary of the EML, which also
contains definitions of the terms contamination and environmental impact.5%

Environmental harm is defined as:

“any significant loss, decrease, detriment or impairment to the preexisting
conditions in the environment or one of its components. It affects the
functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources”.°™*

Accordingly, environmental harm is more than a mere “negative impact” (as argued by
Ecuador), it implies a significant loss or impairment. Ecuador's definition also fails to

capture de minimis or socially and environmentally tolerable impacts, that is, as IEMS
puts it, impacts which do not “significantly [affect] human health or the environment’.°°

The second sentence of the EML definition provides some criteria for determining when

R-PHB, 496.
R-PHB, 483.

Contamination is defined as: “The presence in the environment of substances, elements,
energy or a combination thereof, the concentration and permanence of which are higher or lower
than those prescribed by the laws in force”. Environmental impact is defined as: “The positive or
negative alteration of the environment, caused directly or otherwise by a project or activity in a
given area” (Translations by the Tribunal) (Exh. CA-CC-33).

Translation by the Tribunal. A similar definition is provided in Article 1 of Ministerial Decree No.
169: “Environmental harm: It is the negative environmental impact on the environmental
conditions present in a given space, caused by the conduct of development projects, leading to
an imbalance in the functioning of ecosystems and altering the supply of the services that such
ecosystems contribute to society” (Translation by the Tribunal) (Exh. EL-228).

Ecuador's experts from IEMS explained in their first expert report that the “need to use
comparison criteria is based on the fact that, on properties that are used for productive purposes
related with petroleum activities, we tolerate certain concentrations of contaminants without
altering its functions, and without significantly affecting human health and the environment.
Furthermore, the presence of contaminants resulting regularly from petroleum activities, in
tolerable quantities and concentrations, represents a [sic] alteration of little relevance compared
with the other alterations caused by the same productive activity (deforestation, noise,
modification of the hydrological environment, etc.). Therefore, the comparison criteria (which, in
this case in particular, consist in the permissible limits set forth in the Ecuadorian legislation),
make it possible to establish whether the presence of contaminants at certain levels and
components of the environment (soil, surface water, and underground water) is tolerable”. IEMS.

an environmental impact is “significant” and thus constitutes environmental harm,
namely when it “affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its

resources”.

Neither Party has put much emphasis on the second sentence in the definition.
Burlington has tendered evidence showing that the permissible limits in RAOHE and
TULAS pose no risk to human health,°° but has not otherwise sought to demonstrate
that compliance with these standards is sufficiently protective to ensure the
ecosystem’s functioning and the renewability of its resources. For its part, Ecuador has
offered a preliminary analysis of certain macro-invertebrates,°” but has otherwise not
provided an ecological risk assessment or any other analysis of possible impacts of the
Consortium’s operations on the ecosystem of the allegedly contaminated sites. The
Tribunal will thus form its opinion on the background values case on the basis of other
elements in the record.

In this context, the Tribunal notes that the EML not only provides a definition of
environmental harm, it also refers to permissible limits. Article 1 states that the EML
establishes principles and guidelines of environmental policy, determines obligations
and responsibilities, and “indicates the permissible limits, controls and sanctions in this
matter’. Moreover, Article 33 stipulates that “environmental quality parameters” shall be
established as “instruments for the application of environmental norms”, which shall be
“governed by the respective regulation’.°°° This provision tends to support the
proposition that RAOHE and TULAS refine and implement the general provisions of the
EML.

The Tribunal further notes that Ecuador's adoption in 1999 of the definition of
environmental harm in the EML, was followed shortly thereafter by revisions to the
permissible limits in RAOHE in 2001 and by the adoption of limits in TULAS in 2003. It

GSI ER1, App. E (Evaluation of Potential Human Health Risks Associated with Environmental
Conditions).

Article 33 EML reads as follows: “The following shall be established as instruments for the
application of environmental norms: environmental quality parameters, rules on effluents and
emissions, technical rules on product quality, system of administrative permits and licenses,
environmental impact assessments, lists of contaminating products harmful to human health and
the environment, environmental quality certification of products, services and others to be
governed by the respective regulation” (emphasis and translation by the Tribunal) (Exh. CA-CC-

33).

is also particularly noteworthy that the definition of environmental harm under the EML,
as well as the permissible limits under RAOHE and TULAS, remained unchanged
following the adoption of the 2008 Constitution.

It is also relevant that RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Table 3 apply specifically to soil
contamination and remediation. RAOHE Table 6 is entitled “Permissible limits for the
identification and remediation of contaminated soils in all phases of the hydrocarbons
industry’. In this context, it is noteworthy that the glossary in RAOHE Annex 6 defines
permissible limits as the “maximum value of concentration of element(s) or
substance(s) in the different components of the environment, determined through
standardized methods, and regulated through legal instrument’.®° Article 4.2.2 of
TULAS which comprises TULAS Table 3 is similarly entitled “Soil Remediation or
Restoration Criteria”, further specifying that the values in Table 3 aim at “establish[ing]
the maximum contaminant concentration levels for soil in the process of remediation or

restoration”.°"°

The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that the constitutional duty of full or integral
restoration is not in all cases necessarily exhausted by referring to permissible limits
under RAOHE and TULAS, but it cannot agree with Ecuador’s position that remediating
back to permissible limits for the relevant parameters set out in these regulations would
be unconstitutional.

Harm to the environment could indeed be caused in a myriad of different ways, but in
the Tribunal’s view, when it comes to allegations of soil contamination by one of the
parameters set out in RAOHE Table 6, then the dividing line between impact and harm
(or between impacto ambiental and dafio ambiental) is encapsulated in the very notion
of permissible limits.

b. The subsidiary nature of background values

It is only when there is soil contamination by an element not contemplated in RAOHE
Table 6, such as for instance barium or arsenic, that recourse must be had to
supplementary means such as TULAS, which contains permissible limits for additional
parameters, and otherwise enshrines rules prescribing recourse to background values

286.

as a subsidiary means to determine the proper remediation standard. Of particular
relevance in cases of soil contamination is Article 4.1.3.3 of TULAS, which specifically
contemplates having recourse to background values only in the absence of a parameter
in TULAS or in case of inapplicability of a certain parameter:

“In case of the inapplicability for the specific case of any parameter
established in the present regulation, or in case of the absence in the
regulation of a relevant parameter for the soil under study, the
Environmental Control Entity shall adopt the following evaluation criteria:
The regulated entity must establish the background or reference value of
the parameter of interest present in the soil. The regulated entity shall
determine the present or current concentration of the parameter under
study in the affected area. It shall then proceed to compare the obtained
results for the concentration present in the soil against the background
values. In general, it is considered that a present concentration greater
than three times the background value for the soil denotes contamination
that requires immediate attention on the part of the Environmental

Control Entity”.

Accordingly, recourse to background values is subsidiary and only permitted in two
cases, namely when a specific parameter is inapplicable or the absence of a relevant
parameter, an issue to which the Tribunal will revert further below. In contrast to the
regime established in RAOHE, TULAS further differentiates between screening criteria
and remediation criteria by stating that any concentrations exceeding three times the
mean background value (screening criteria or action level) must be remediated back to
1.5 times the background value (remediation criteria).

“If the concentration is found to be three times higher than the
background value, the Environmental Control Entity shall give immediate
attention to this situation and must obligate the regulated entity to
remediate the soil until the present concentration is less than or equal to
1.5 times the background value”.°"*
This provision not only demonstrates the subsidiary or residual nature of recourse to
background values to determine remediation criteria, but also puts to rest Ecuador's
thesis that Burlington must remediate any alleged harm back to background values,
since any remediation would ex hypotesi be limited to reducing any contamination
present in soils to 1.5 times the mean background value of the relevant parameter. In

TULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Article 4.1.3.3 (Exh. EL-173 (EN) 0006). A similar rule relating to

sum, in addition to the fact that Ecuador has not pointed to a specific provision in its
legal order which would mandate having recourse to background values as remediation
criteria, the existing references to background values in Ecuadorian law have a much
more limited scope of application than suggested by Ecuador.*"*

Two further considerations are of relevance here, namely the actual practice in Ecuador
when it comes to the remediation of environmental harm and the methodology initially
adopted by Ecuador's experts from IEMS. With respect to actual practice, the Tribunal
notes that Ecuador has not provided a single example where background values have
been applied in practice. All remediation reports in the record show that instances of
contamination were remediated back to permissible limits as specified in RAOHE and
TULAS, be that before or after the promulgation of the 2008 Constitution.°* The Los

For instance, Table 2 in TULAS, Book VI, Annex 2 sets out soil quality criteria, which are defined
in Article 4.2.1 as “approximate background values or analytic detection limits” serving as
representative environmental values of a contaminant in the soil reflecting natural geological
variations in non-developed areas or areas free of industrial or urban activities. Accordingly,
Table 2 only sets out approximate background values, but does not spell out remediation criteria
or otherwise provide any insight into what amounts to environmental harm under Ecuadorian
law.

Vencedores case is particularly apposite here since it deals with a 12-barrel crude spill
that occurred in Block 7 on 11 June 2009 when the Consortium was still operating the
Blocks. The court in that case repeatedly referred to permissible limits in RAOHE Table
6 and ultimately found that Perenco had properly remediated the spill within those
permissible limits.°"° The same can be said of the environmental audits in the record,
whether commissioned by the Consortium or by Petroamazonas, which identify
environmental conditions by reference to permissible limits.*"° Interestingly, the court in

It is also noteworthy that the 32 Environmental Impact Statements and Environmental
Management Plans issued since 2001 for both Blocks (that is, after Decree 1215 was
enacted) and reviewed by GSI show that RAOHE and TULAS were consistently
referred to as the applicable regulations.’ GSI further pointed to 20 remediation
projects undertaken in other Blocks in the Oriente region, all of which applied regulatory
criteria under RAOHE Table 6 and none requiring remediation back to background
levels.51°

Of further relevance is the fact that Ecuador’s own expert IEMS initially sought to
determine the environmental conditions of the Blocks by reference to the permissible
limits in RAOHE and TULAS,*”° before being instructed by Ecuador to apply
background values on the grounds that permissible limits were not sufficiently protective
of the environment.*' Ecuador admitted at the Hearing that it instructed IEMS to apply
background values™? and explained that IEMS employed permissible limits in RAOHE
and TULAS during its first sampling campaign “for the sake of information only”, since
IEMS did not yet have the reference background values at its disposal.* IEMS

Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 710:20-711:5, 711:20-712:5 (Cross, Alfaro). IEMS put it in the following
terms: “We received instructions to apply a criterion that would be compatible with the
restoration back to original conditions. And to us that, that meant background levels”.

Tr. (Day 1) (ENG), 47:15-20 (Opening, Silva Romero). Counsel for Ecuador stated the following:
“Ecuador fails to see how in this case it could be disputed that all environmental harm should be
repaired so as to restore the site to its original, natural condition, and this is the reason why
IEMS, the technical experts of Ecuador, were instructed to employ ‘background values”.

SMCC, note 145. Ecuador indicated that: “For the sake of information only, IEMS analyzed the
collected soil samples in accordance with the parameters set forth in the Ecuadorian regulations
(RAOHE and TULAS). Nevertheless, it stresses that the correct criteria to be applied in order to
guarantee the full reparation of the damage [...] are the real Reference Values. At the time of its
first report, IEMS did not have the Reference Values yet, reason why it applied the criteria
provided in the regulations for comparative purposes”.

127

moreover opined that Ecuadorian benchmarks are “arbitrary” and “not sufficiently
» 524

protective of the health of the people who live in the area”.
Whatever the merits of these explanations, it remains that IEMS chose to use
regulatory limits in its first report and then shifted to background values under the
pretext that, in its expert opinion, the regulations were not protective enough, but in
reality because it was instructed to do so.° As to Ecuador’s argument that its own
regulatory limits are not sufficiently protective of the environment or human health, the
Tribunal observes that Ecuador set the permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS further
to the adoption of the EML, that it did not amend these limits following the entry into
force of the 2008 Constitution, and that it is not for the Tribunal to modify Ecuador’s duly
enacted regulatory framework in place of the competent authorities. The same applies
to Ecuador's argument that its regulations are deficient since they do not differentiate
between various ecosystems in Ecuador, and that the Amazon region should find
particular protection. As already noted above, the 2008 Constitution makes special
reference to the Amazon region and this element will be of some relevance when it
comes to determining the applicable land use, but here again it falls within the remit of
the Ecuadorian authorities to set different criteria for the Amazon region, if they so wish;
it is not for this Tribunal to do so.

In light of the foregoing, it is the Tribunal’s view that environmental harm is defined by
reference to regulatory criteria. In the case of oilfield operations, these regulatory
criteria are to be found primarily in RAOHE, and subsidiarily in TULAS. In other words,

IEMS ERS, p. 38.

For instance, in its third expert report, IEMS stated that “[i]n this case, to determine whether a
site was contaminated, the comparison criterion that was considered, according to our technical
opinion, was the concentrations of the substance in question that were found in a natural state in
areas not affected by hydrocarbon activity (called ‘background levels’ or ‘benchmarks’); if
background levels are exceeded, it has been shown that the operations conducted had a
negative impact on the environment, that is, that there had been an alteration of the natural
state, which should be restored”. IEMS added that “fiJn the opinion of an IEMS expert, the
benchmarks stipulated in Ecuadorian law [...] should not be used generally to determine liability
[because] [t]he allowable limits established in [TULAS] do not appear to be based on criteria
aimed at the protection of the health of the ecosystem or persons who reside in the impacted
area and, therefore, the effectiveness of such limits appears to be limited. The amounts
expressed in the regulations appear to be defined in a manner better characterized as arbitrary”
and ‘“[iJn the opinion of the IEMS expert [...], the obligation to conduct cleanup and/or
environmental restoration operations should be based on benchmark concentrations obtained
through evaluations of the risk to human health and the environment”) (emphasis added). IEMS
ER3, pp. 36-38.

128

292.

294.

an oilfield operator could not be considered to have caused environmental harm if
permissible limits were observed, since precisely these permissible limits allow
determining when a negative impact crosses the threshold of harm.

Consequently, the Tribunal will resort to RAOHE and TULAS to define harm under the
EML. Hence, the limits set out in these regulations establish when impacts become
significant, and thereby become harm, thus allowing the inference that these limits
determine when the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources
are affected.© In other words, any exceedance of applicable limits triggers extra-
contractual civil liability and the ensuing obligation of full restoration back to these limits,
independently from parallel administrative liability and possible sanctions.

Having rejected Ecuador’s background values case, the Tribunal will now assess the
regulatory criteria cases presented by the Parties respectively, starting with the
applicable permissible limits for soil remediation and thereafter setting out the
applicable land use criteria. Following its analysis for soil remediation, the Tribunal will
address the applicable regulatory framework for mud pits and for the alleged
groundwater contamination.

4.2 Permissible limits for soil remediation

Turning to Ecuador's alternative case for soil remediation based on regulatory criteria,
the Tribunal must now determine which standards apply to the allegedly impacted areas
in the Blocks. The Parties agree that under the regulatory criteria scenario, RAOHE
Table 6 applies for soil remediation, but they disagree whether the values in that table
must be adjusted to higher natural values and, if so, what the proper values should be
(4.2.2). They further disagree whether TULAS Table 2 (as Ecuador contends) or Table
3 (as Burlington contends) applies for parameters not contemplated in RAOHE Table 6
(4.2.1).27

See IEMS’s statement that “we tolerate certain concentrations of contaminants without altering
its [ie., the environment’s] functions, and without significantly affecting human health and the
environment”. IEMS ER1, p. 20.

Ecuador's experts from IEMS indicated that “[s]ince at this point, there is no remediation taking
place, it is not clear that Table 3 levels can be asserted proactively as a maximum contaminant
level”. IEMS ER4, p. 43.

4.2.1. Applicable table under TULAS for soil remediation

TULAS Table 2, entitled “soil quality criteria’, is part of Article 4.2.1 and sets out soil
quality criteria for different “parameters” or substances. Article 4.2.1 defines soil quality
criteria as “approximate background values or analytical detection limits for a
contaminant in the soil’. It further provides that background values “refer to the
representative environmental levels for a contaminant in the soil” and that these values
“reflect the natural geological variations of undeveloped areas or areas free of the
influence of generalized industrial or urban activities’. In other words, Table 2 only
provides for approximate background values reflecting natural variations in
undeveloped areas. By contrast, Table 3 is entitled “Soil Remediation or Restoration
Criteria” and sets forth the “maximum contaminant concentration levels for soil in the
process of remediation or restoration”. In light of the subject matter of the two tables,
Table 3 is the proper source for soil contamination parameters not contemplated in
RAOHE Table 6.

4.2.2 Adjustment to higher natural values

The Tribunal now turns to the need to adjust the permissible limits to account for higher
natural values. After setting out the adjusted values adopted by the Parties as well as
the justifications provided by the Parties (Section a), the Tribunal will address the
methodologies adopted by the Parties to calculate their adjusted values and then
establish the adjusted values applicable to the present case (Section b).

a. Parties’ positions

The Parties adjusted the permissible limits of various compounds to take into account
higher natural concentrations in the soils, but reached different conclusions in great part
because they applied different methodologies. The Tribunal will first set out the adjusted
values adopted by the Parties ((i) below) and then the justifications provided by the
Parties ((ii) below).

(i) The adjusted values adopted by the Parties

Ecuador’s expert IEMS collected 192 soil samples in areas not impacted by oilfield
operations to calculate the natural concentrations of (i) cadmium, nickel and lead, which

130

299.

are regulated under RAOHE Table 6;°% and (ii) barium and vanadium, which are
regulated under TULAS Table 3.°” In addition to making its own calculations for the
values of these compounds, Burlington’s expert GSI also calculated the natural value
for chromium in Block 7 but not Block 21.5% As a result, each Party adopted the higher
values which it had reached as remediation criteria for barium, cadmium, lead, nickel
and vanadium.**' The relevant values adopted by the Parties are the following:°°*

“Background” | IEMS “Regulatory” || Applicable

Criteria

 

Accordingly, with respect to Block 7/CPUF, the Parties agree that RAOHE Table 6 be
adjusted for cadmium, not for lead and nickel, but disagree on the adjusted value and
the relevant land use. Ecuador argues that the cadmium value be adjusted to 2 mg/kg
for sensitive ecosystems, whereas Burlington argues that the cadmium value be
adjusted to 3.8 mg/kg for sensitive ecosystem as well as agricultural use. And with
respect to compounds regulated under TULAS, the Parties agree that TULAS Table 3
be adjusted for barium and vanadium, and not for chromium. They disagree, however,

Ecuador set the background value for TPH at zero.

IEMS also tested for pH and electrical conductivity but Ecuador raised no claim with respect to
these two parameters. IEMS ER4, p. 15. See also: IEMS ER4, Att. 4; IEMS ER3, Section IV.1.A,
Annex L.4 and Annex Y.

on the adjusted values. Ecuador argues that the barium value for sensitive ecosystem
land use should be increased from 500 mg/kg to 639 mg/kg, whereas Burlington argues
for an increase to 706 mg/kg. With respect to vanadium, Ecuador's adjusted value of
320.75 mg/kg is higher than Burlington’s adjusted value of 311 mg/kg.

With respect to Block 21, the Parties disagree on the adjusted value for cadmium for
sensitive ecosystems, Ecuador arguing for an increase to 1.77 mg/kg and Burlington to
2 mg/kg. They further disagree on whether the value for nickel for sensitive ecosystems
should be adjusted, Burlington arguing that the value for nickel should be increased
from 40 mg/kg to 47 mg/kg. In addition, Ecuador calculated the background value for
barium at 133 mg/kg and the remediation criteria at 600 mg/kg, while Burlington
provided no adjusted value for barium. Finally, Ecuador proposed an adjusted value of
186 mg/kg for vanadium, while Burlington did not adjust the vanadium limit.

(ii) Justifications

In general terms, the disagreement between the Parties on adjusting regulatory criteria
to reflect higher natural concentrations in the soils essentially turns on when a specific
TULAS parameter is inapplicable and, when it is, whether the adjusted value should be
calculated using the mean value of all samples (as Ecuador and its experts contend) or
the 99% upper prediction limit (“UPL”) (as Burlington and its experts contend).

The approach adopted by Ecuador’s experts can be summarized as follows. IEMS
gathered 192 samples from the Blocks to calculate the background values.** For IEMS,
background values under TULAS are determined by calculating the population mean,
i.e. the mean of the complete set of samples. IEMS thus calculated the population
mean by taking “all particles of soil from the unaffected areas in each block, to average
them, and to calculate an average concentration of all the particles”. Since IEMS did

IEMS ER4, Att. 4.

IEMS ER4, p. 16. To take account of the fact that “different populations may have different
distributions and different variability” across the two Blocks, IEMS classified the results of soil
samples in four groups according to the block and the sample depth in accordance with Chapter
4 of PROUCL Version 4.0 Technical Guide, EPA/600/R-07/041 (USEPA, 2007). |EMS's analysis
of variance showed that, except for lead, the parameters were not statistically similar between
Block 7 and Block 21. Accordingly, IEMS estimated separately the background levels for Block 7
and Block 21, except for lead where the analysis of variance showed that the results were
statistically similar across the Blocks but statistically different between samples less than 1
meter and those below 1 meter. Thus, IEMS estimated separately the background levels for lead

132

303.

not sample the entire Blocks, it constructed a confidence interval (“CI”) around “a range
that contains the population mean with a specified probability’.©°° IEMS estimated the
99% Cl of the mean concentrations, such that there is, in its opinion, a “99% probability
that the true but unknown background mean concentration is below the value presented
by IEMS and, conversely, only a 1% probability that it be above”.®*° This approach, says
IEMS, is “consistent with the provision of TULAS, although slightly more conservative”,
since using a 95% Cl would result in lower background concentrations thus increasing
the size of the contaminated area.®’ Thus, for barium in Block 7 for instance, IEMS
calculated the population mean to be 183.65 mg/kg, with a 99% Cl value set at
213.10 mg/kg whereas a 95% confidence interval would have resulted in a value of
203.21 mg/kg. In other words, if the 99% Cl method is chosen, as advocated by IEMS,
there is a 99% probability that the background value for barium is below 213.10 mg/kg
and a 1% probability that it is above that value.

IEMS then compared the values of the 99% Cl with the values in TULAS Table 2 and
then estimated the adjusted regulatory criteria by multiplying by three the site-specific
background value “or 3 times the Table 2 criteria (general background values),
whichever was higher”.5% IEMS stressed that, by contrast, GSI’s “selective use of the
criteria” by estimating background values as the 99% UPL is “erroneous and
unreliable”, since it is “inconsistent with regulatory requirements”.°°° For IEMS, no
provision states that the background values must be estimated by comparing the 99%
UPL to any table in TULAS, let alone to Table 3 as GSI did. Instead of using the 99%
UPL, GSI should have calculated the “true population mean” of all 192 samples to
estimate the 99% CI.° IEMS further argued that GSI engaged in “biased
manipulation”, since the “gg” percentile is the value that is above 99% of the dataset”,
and thus artificially increased the “tolerance to contamination”.**' In other words, had

GSI applied a 100% UPL, the background value would have equalled the highest
measured value in clean soil samples. Similarly, after GSI eliminated outliers, its 99""
percentile approach resulted in a background value that is above 99% of the dataset,
and therefore biased and excessively conservative.

Ecuador’s experts from RPS concur with IEMS that GSI’s use of the 99% UPL is
inconsistent with the methodology specified in TULAS. RPS explains that remediation
criteria for a particular parameter are not applicable if “the remediation criterion for a
parameter is less than the background concentration’.*? In such cases, the
“background threshold values” (“BTVs”) is equal to three times the mean of the
background value. In other words, if concentrations at an oilfield site exceed the BTV,
“then remediation is required and the actual cleanup level (remediation criteria) is set
equal to 1.5 times the mean of the background data set”.°“* While GSI’s block-specific
remediation criteria equal to 3 times the mean background value are correct, RPS
argues that GSI should also have shown “the actual remediation criteria as 1.5 times
the mean background concentration”.*“* Instead, GSI’s approach underestimates the
volume of impacted soils to be remediated. In addition, RPS highlights GSI’s use of
“incorrect values for the background soil concentrations”, pointing to discrepancies
between the data used by GSI in the ProUCL software with the background soil
concentration included in GSI’s Table D.18 Analytical Results for Background Metal
Concentrations.>*

GSI adopts a different approach to estimate background values. While GSI accepts that
IEMS’s tests may be representative of background soil conditions, GSI criticizes the
“fundamental conceptual error’ committed by IEMS when calculating their background
metals concentrations.“ By calculating the 99% upper confidence limit on the mean
concentration, GSI considers that IEMS adopted an adjusted mean concentration that is
only slightly above the average “but far below the upper range of concentrations

observed in clean samples”, thus resulting in “approximately 80% of the clean soils at
all sites” being declared by IEMS as being contaminated.°”

According to GSI, background values are in practice “commonly established at or near
the upper range of observed concentrations (e.g., 99" percentile) of a compound in
unaltered “clean soils”.*“® According to GSI, the use of the UPL is “a well-recognized
statistic” that “can be employed as a conservative measure of the upper range of
normal metals concentrations”, where UPL is defined “as the value below which a given
percentage of the background sample population falls” and corresponds to the “upper
end of the normal range of measured background concentration”.™? To that end, GSI
conducted additional background soil sampling, collecting 91 additional samples,
including 12 duplicate samples in the CPUF and Block 7.

GSl’s approach can be summarized as follows. As a first step, GSI compiled all
background samples in a Microsoft Access database and compared the population
distributions of metal concentrations in both Blocks. Using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
statistical test, GSI then determined that the mean background concentrations of all
metals, except for lead and nickel in Block 7, were different from those in Block 21, thus
justifying evaluating the background soil samples from CPUF/Block7 and Block 21 as
“two distinct background populations, representing site-specific conditions”. Since the
comparison of IEMS and GSI samples collected in CPUF/Block 7 presented similar
background populations, GSI combined its analytical results with those of IEMS “to
create an encompassing background soil dataset (CPUF/Block 7) comprised of 243
unaltered soil samples”.°"'

As a next step, GSI excluded data outliers from the background populations in the
calculation of the UPL by using Rosner’s Outlier Test in the ProUCL software.** GSI

also used half of the detection value for non-detect concentrations. After deriving the
99% UPL for each data set,®°* GSI evaluated the 99% UPL value against the population
of metals measured in background soil samples.*™ It finally proceeded to adjust the soil
cleanup criteria based on the applicable regulations in RAOHE and TULAS.** For GSI,
the fact that outliers were excluded and more than 1% of clean soil samples exceeded
the 99% UPL for several metals (barium, cadmium and nickel), confirms that its
approach is conservative.*® GSI rebuts IEMS’s criticism that outliers should only be
removed after careful review and that Rosner’s Outlier Test should only be used when
data follows a normal distribution, by stating that the inclusion of the outliers would have
skewed the 99% UPL towards less conservative estimates.*”

With respect to RAOHE Table 6, GSI considers that the 99% UPL background level is
the appropriate cleanup criteria for chemicals for which the relevant 99% UPL
background level exceeds the regulatory criteria.*°* With respect to TULAS, GSI opines

GSI explained its approach as follows: “UPLs can be computed using either parametric
methods, whereby the data is assumed to display a normal bell-shaped pattern, or non-
parametric methods, whereby the data does not exhibit a predictable distribution (e.g., data may
be highly skewed towards low or high concentrations). The application of non-parametric
statistical methods to normally distributed data is acceptable, although the reverse (application
of parametric statistical methods to non-parametric data) is not appropriate [...]. [A]ll metals in
the CPUF/Block 7 region and Block 21 displayed non-parametric population distributions, except
for lead, which exhibited a normal distribution for both the CPUF/Block 7 region and Block 21,
and chromium, which exhibited a normal distribution for CPUF/Block 7. The 99% UPL for each
of these metals in the CPUF/Block 7 region and Block 21 was then calculated according to the
respective population distribution using the ProUCL Software [...]. Because the nonparametric
99% UPLs for lead in CPUF/Block 7 and Block 21 were actually equal to or lower (i.e., more
conservative) than the parametric 99% UPL, the non-parametric 99% UPL statistic has been
chosen as a conservative representation of background values for lead in the appropriate
geographic areas. In contrast, the parametric 99% UPL for chromium in CPUF/Block 7 was
chosen as a conservative representation of the chromium background value in CPUF/Block 7
soils". GSI ER1, Att. |, p. 1.4. GSI added that “[w]hen background populations from CPUF/Block
7 and Block 21 contained non-detect measurements, the Kaplan Meier estimation method was
used to determine summary statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) for the computation of
the 99% UPL”. GSI ER1, Att. |, p. 1.5.

GSI sought to confirm that the 99% UPLs provide “reasonable estimates of the normal range of
metals in background soils”. It concluded that based on the small percentage of clean samples
exceeding the 99% UPL, this method served as an appropriate estimate of the “typical range of
metals in background soils”, further confirming that the estimates are conservative. GSI ER1,

that IEMS not only misinterpreted TULAS but also misrepresented GSI’s approach,°°°
which it explains in the following terms: “for chemicals for which the relevant 99% UPL
background level exceeded the regulatory cleanup level provided in TULAS Table 3
(meaning that the cleanup level logically cannot apply), an action level equal to three
times the average background concentration measured for that chemical [is to be used]
as the appropriate site-specific cleanup level’.*©° Accordingly, this approach not only
recognizes that remediation below natural background concentrations is “infeasible”,
but also that “an additional ‘significance’ factor” is applied “to more accurately indicate
abnormal conditions that may warrant action”.°*'

In other words, since TULAS does not define when a relevant remediation criterion is
inapplicable, GSI opined that the “only reasonable interpretation” is that a criterion is
inapplicable “when it is less than the observable range of clean background
concentrations’.°* Thus, if the 99% UPL of a given parameter exceeded the
remediation criterion, GSI calculated a substitute criterion as mandated by TULAS by (i)
establishing the mean background levels, (ii) calculating a substitute criterion by
multiplying the mean concentration of the clean background soil samples by three, and
(iii) Comparing concentrations in the affected area to the substitute criterion to
determine if remediation is required.® By contrast, the effect of IEMS’s approach is
“absurd” according to GSI, since 84% of IEMS’s actual clean samples require cleanup
under its approach, which constitutes a “gross overestimate of the cleanup
requirements”.°* By ignoring that TULAS specifically requires that soil measurements
must be compared to a substituted criterion that is three times the average background
concentration, IEMS erroneously concluded that 84% of clean soils are
contaminated.°°°

For GSI, RPS also misinterpreted TULAS by claiming that a relevant criterion is
inapplicable when the mean value of clean background samples is greater than the

relevant criterion.* This approach is “irrational” according to GSI, since this would
mean that “approximately half of clean samples used to represent naturally occurring
background conditions would require remediation under TULAS regulations”.°°” RPS
further misapplied TULAS by claiming that the background threshold value should be
calculated using three times the mean background concentration. According to GSI,
TULAS instructs that three times the mean value should be used as a replacement
regulatory criterion “only when the regulatory criterion provided by TULAS is
‘inapplicable’”.°°° RPS also misrepresented GSI’s actions when claiming that GSI
should have calculated the actual remediation criteria as 1.5 times the mean value of
the background concentration. GSI explained that the volume of impacted soils
should be determined by using three times the mean value of the background dataset,
and TULAS only requires that this volume of soil should be remediated to 1.5 times the
mean background samples.*” Accordingly, RPS’s approach for calculating soil
remediation criteria violates TULAS, since RPS “replaced the Ecuador criteria with a

value equal to 1.5 times the mean background concentration”.°”'

b. Discussion
(i) Preliminary remarks

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that, with slight divergences, both Parties accepted
that their background values apply to the entire block, even though the actual
background concentrations may vary significantly from one site to another within the
same block. The Tribunal further notes that neither Party has pointed to any practice
where regulatory criteria have been adjusted to take into account higher natural
concentrations in the Blocks.

(ii) | Methodologies to adjust values under RAOHE and TULAS

RAOHE Table 6 and Article 4.1.3.3 TULAS allow adapting permissible limits to take into
account that natural concentrations of certain chemicals in the soil exceed permissible
limits for those substances. However, these two regulations adopt different approaches.
RAOHE Table 6 provides for adjusting the Table 6 limits upwards — “se pueden
incrementar” — where they are exceeded by natural concentrations.®” The use of the
word “incrementar” defeats Ecuador’s contention that these limits can also be adjusted
downwards. On the other hand, RAOHE Table 6 does not indicate how to assess the
natural concentrations or how to adjust the permissible limits to account for these.

Article 4.1.3.3 of TULAS adopts a different approach to the adjustment of the
remediation criteria:

“In case of the inapplicability for the specific case of any parameter
established in the present regulation, or in case of the absence in the
regulation of a relevant parameter for the soil under study, the
Environmental Control Entity shall adopt the following evaluation criteria:
The regulated entity must establish the background or reference value of
the parameter of interest present in the soil. The regulated entity shall
determine the present or current concentration of the parameter under
study in the affected area. It shall then proceed to compare the obtained
results for the concentration present in the soil against the background
values. In general, it is considered that a present concentration greater
than three times the background value for the soil denotes contamination
that requires immediate attention on the part of the Environmental
Control Entity. [...] The procedure described shall be coordinated and

supervised by the environmental control entity”.°”

This provision goes on to state that the most reliable way to calculate natural
concentrations is to collect samples in areas “immediately outside the area under study”
with no local contamination. Where there is a “total absence” of such values in the
immediate area surrounding the area under study, the background values may be
obtained in regional or national areas. More specifically, it provides some indications on
the sampling:

“If the natural (non-contaminated) soils in the area present concentrations higher than the
established limits, the values of the respective parameter may be increased to this level, so long
as this phenomenon has been statistically verified through monitoring of undisturbed and
uninfluenced soils in the same area” (Translation by the Tribunal). RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6

317.

“In order to determine the background or reference value, at least 5

samples must be taken, if between 5 and 20 samples are taken, the
mean value must be selected as the background value”.

In sum, with different approaches, both RAOHE and TULAS allow adjusting relevant
remediation criteria to take into account higher natural concentrations in soils. On the
one hand, RAOHE Table 6 merely states that permissible limits can be adjusted
upwards when natural concentrations exceed the regulatory criteria without specifying
how this is done. On the other hand, TULAS provides that contamination exists when
concentration in the soil is greater than three times the mean background value in case
a given parameter is absent or inapplicable. In addition, TULAS provides that
background values are to be determined by taking at least 5 samples and that “if
between 5 and 20 samples are taken, the mean value must be selected as the
background value”.®”° This formulation is confusing, as it might be read to suggest using
another methodology above 20 samples. Since the regulation provides for no
alternative methodology, the Tribunal rejects this suggestion. It therefore finds that,
where IEMS collected 192 samples, the mean value of these samples must in any
event be estimated so as to comply with TULAS.

The Parties diverge significantly on the proper methodology for adjusting permissible
limits. Ecuador's experts from IEMS adopted the 99% Cl to determine the mean
background concentration, whereas Burlington’s experts from GSI held that the proper
methodology is to estimate the 99% UPL for each metal in clean background soil
samples. In this context, the Tribunal notes that neither RAOHE nor TULAS refer to
either methodology, TULAS only referring, as seen above, to the “mean” background
value (valor promedio).5”° The Tribunal further notes that GSI, while invoking “accepted
technical guidelines”, in particular of the Environmental Protection Agency of the United
States but none from Ecuador, indicated that resort to the 99% UPL “can be employed
as a conservative measure of the upper range of normal metals concentrations”,°” and
that it was “our understanding [...] that sound technical judgment should be applied in
this determination’.5”° Absent any express stipulation in the regulations, the Tribunal is

disinclined to follow GSI’s approach and thus relies on IEMS’s approach of estimating
the 99% Cl even if it too is not strictly compliant with TULAS. This is so, because the
99% Cl is a slightly more conservative method than the mean value, there being only a
1% probability that the background mean concentration is above the confidence interval
calculated by IEMS. Accordingly, the Tribunal will estimate the background values on
the basis of the mean background concentration as adjusted by the 99% Cl.

(ili) Adjusted values determined by the Tribunal

With respect to RAOHE, the Tribunal notes that the only divergence between the
Parties lies in the cadmium values for both Blocks and the nickel value for Block 21.
IEMS accepts that the sensitive ecosystem land use criterion for cadmium be adjusted
to 2 mg/kg for Block 7, which is the same criterion for agricultural land use, and to
1.77 mg/kg for Block 21. For its part, GSI estimated the background value for cadmium
in Block 7 at 3.8 mg/kg, thus requiring in its view an adjustment of both the sensitive
ecosystem and agricultural land use criteria. For nickel, GSI estimated the background
value in Block 21 to be 47 mg/kg instead of 40 mg/kg. Consistent with its decision to
discard GSl’s use of the 99% UPL to estimate background values, the Tribunal will
adjust the criteria for cadmium as follows: 2 mg/kg for Block 7 and 1.77 mg/kg for Block
21. Similarly, the Tribunal did not adjust the nickel value for Block 21. This approach is
consistent with the few instances of practice that the Tribunal discerned in the record.
For instance, the Tribunal observes that in two remediation reports for spills in Oso 2 in
2007 and in Mono CPF in 2008, the applicable cadmium value for agricultural land use
was held to be 2 mg/kg and not the 3.8 mg/kg advocated presently by Burlington.°”°

With respect to TULAS, there is a first significant disagreement between the Parties on
when a specified criterion is inapplicable under TULAS, thus justifying adjusting that
criterion to reflect background conditions. For IEMS, a given criterion is inapplicable if
the mean background concentrations exceed the criterion provided in TULAS
Table 2.°° RPS also stated that a remediation criterion is not applicable, for instance, if

the remediation criterion for a parameter is less than the background concentration.°**
For its part, GSI indicated that a remediation criterion is to be considered inapplicable
under TULAS “when it is less than the observable range of clean background
concentrations”, meaning that only if the 99% UPL exceeds the established criterion in
Table 3, in which case an adjusted criterion should be established by multiplying by
three the mean background concentrations. *®*

TULAS contemplates adjusting remediation criteria in two scenarios, namely in case (i)
of the “inapplicability for the specific case of any parameter established in the present
regulation”, or (ii) of the “absence in the regulation of a relevant parameter for the soil
under study”.©° At the outset, the Tribunal stresses that, while TULAS speaks of the
“inapplicability of any parameter” relevant for the specific case, it should properly be
interpreted for present purposes as meaning the inapplicability of any criterion for a
given relevant parameter (since it would be contradictory to establish new criteria for a
parameter which is held to be inapplicable). The Tribunal notes that neither Party
argued that in the present case a relevant parameter is absent in TULAS, but that they
advocated differing interpretations on when a criterion of a given parameter is
inapplicable. In this context, the Tribunal recalls that TULAS Table 3 contemplates four
land uses, namely industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential, but does not
provide specific criteria for sensitive ecosystem land use. Thus, it may reasonably be
considered that the remediation criteria established in TULAS are inapplicable for
sensitive ecosystem land use and that new criteria should be established for this
hypothesis by following the procedure provided for in Article 4.1.3.3. This also avoids
having to choose either agricultural or residential criteria as a proxy for sensitive
ecosystem land use.

In conformity with its decision not to use GSI’s 99% UPL, the Tribunal also rejects GSI's
interpretation that a given criterion becomes inapplicable only if the 99% UPL value
exceeds the relevant criterion set in Table 3. For the Tribunal, the correct approach to
establish new or adjusted permissible limits for sensitive ecosystem land use is to
multiply the mean background value by three, and to compare the result with the

RPS ER2, p. 18.

relevant criterion set out in TULAS Table 3. This approach does away with GSIl’s
criticism that relying on mean background values would imply that clean samples are
considered contaminated, an argument that would hold true for Ecuador’s background
value case (which was rejected above), but not for Ecuador’s regulatory criteria case.
Thus, for instance, with respect to barium, IEMS calculated a mean background value
(adjusted to the 99% Cl) of barium in Block 7/CPUF of 213.10 mg/kg, meaning that the
permissible limit for barium in that block is 639.30 mg/kg. This value appears
reasonable when compared to the permissible limit of 750 mg/kg for agricultural land
use and 500 mg/kg for residential land use.***

The issue is somewhat different with respect to vanadium in Block 7, the only other
parameter where the Parties disagree on the adjusted value. They concur, however,
that the permissible limits for all relevant land uses should be adjusted upwards. This is
thus truly a case where the regulatory remediation criteria need adjustment. For the
Tribunal, a given criterion becomes inapplicable if (i) the mean background value
exceeds the soil quality criterion established in Table 2 and (ii) the newly adjusted
criterion calculated as three times the mean background value exceeds any given
permissible limit. Thus, for vanadium, the relevant criteria for the contemplated land
uses (i.e., industrial and agricultural) must be adjusted since the mean background
value calculated by IEMS of 106.71 mg/kg exceeds the 25 mg/kg criterion established
in Table 2. Here too, the Tribunal will rely on IEMS’s mean background value of
106.71 mg/kg, thus adjusting the applicable permissible limit to 320.75 mg/kg.°®° The
Tribunal also adopts this value for sensitive ecosystem land use. Although this value is
somewhat higher than the one calculated by GSI (i.e., 311 mg/kg), the Tribunal notes
that it does not make any difference in terms of actual volumes of soils to be
remediated since there are no samples showing vanadium values in between those
proposed by either Party. For the same reasons, the Tribunal adopts Ecuador's

The Tribunal notes that for Block 21, IEMS estimated the mean background value for barium at
113.93 mg/kg, but multiplied the barium value of 200 mg/kg in Table 2 by three to calculate a
permissible limit of 600 mg/kg for sensitive ecosystem land use. GSI calculated the 99% UPL at
163 mg/kg. Since Burlington did not specifically challenge Ecuador's use of 600 mg/kg for
sensitive ecosystem land use, instead arguing that the primary land use in Block 21 is
agricultural, the Tribunal accepts IEMS’s value of 600 mg/kg for sensitive ecosystem land use in
Block 21.

While 3x106.71 equals 320.13, IEMS uses 320.75 (IEMS ER4, Att. 38), which the Tribunal will
employ as well.

adjusted value of 186 mg/kg for vanadium in Block 21 for agricultural and industrial land

uses, as well as for sensitive ecosystem land use.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

323. Finally, the Tribunal rejects RPS’s approach of calculating the remediation criteria as
1.5 times the mean background value concentrations, since the volume of
contaminated soils is determined on the basis of the adjusted permissible limit (i.e., a
multiple of three of the mean background value), not the adjusted remediation criteria
set in TULAS (i.e., a multiple of 1.5 of the mean background value). As GSI correctly
stressed, “TULAS never states that soil samples with concentrations exceeding
1.5 times the mean of background samples must be remediated”, since this would lead
to an overestimation of the volume of soil requiring remediation.°°°

324. On this basis, the Tribunal has determined that the applicable remediation criteria are

RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Table 3 set different limits depending on the subsequent
use (uso posterior) of the land.

RAOHE Table 6 distinguishes between industrial, agricultural and sensitive ecosystem
land uses, the first being more permissive than the last. TULAS Table 3, for its part,
distinguishes between industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential land uses.
While the first is also here the most permissive, agricultural or residential use is the
least permissive depending on the particular parameter. Since TULAS Table 3 does not
contemplate land use for sensitive ecosystems, the Tribunal used the adjusted
background values calculated by IEMS as the applicable values for sensitive
ecosystems for the relevant parameters (i.e., for barium and vanadium).

The Parties diverge on the meaning of uso posterior, and on the question whether the
entire Blocks should be classified as sensitive ecosystem (as Ecuador contends) or
agricultural land (as Burlington contends). They further disagree whether the notion of
uso posterior in RAOHE Table 6 refers to use immediately after remediation (as

145

 

328.

329.

Burlington argues) or to eventual use at the end of hydrocarbons operations (as
Ecuador argues). After setting out the Parties’ positions (4.3.1), the Tribunal will first
clarify the meaning of uso posterior, before addressing the time at which uso posterior
must be assessed and then setting out its own approach to determine the land use at
each site (4.3.2).

4.3.1 Parties’ positions

For Ecuador, uso posterior refers to future land use. It does not refer to land use after
the Consortium leaves the Blocks but to the time “when oil operations will end”,°®”
especially since oil operations are “per se temporary” and that the oilfields are destined
“to be absorbed again by rainforest’.®% Accordingly, the current use of the Blocks,
whether Petroamazonas’ expansion or the use made by farmers of the land around
active fields “is obviously of no relevance to future land use”.°°? The Tribunal should
therefore characterize all facilities and surrounding areas in the Blocks as sensitive
ecosystems,” especially taking into account IEMS’s ecological studies demonstrating
that the “areas in question display characteristics similar to those of a National Natural
Area”.®°" Such conclusion is further reinforced by the fact, Ecuador argues, that the
Blocks overlap with the Sumaco and Yasuni biosphere reserves, and that a “significant
portion of Block 21 lies within the Huaorani indigenous reserve”.°

For its part, Burlington rejects Ecuador’s “broad and extraneous characterizations of the
Amazon rainforest as generally sensitive”.°* It points to various instances of practice
where Ecuadorian regulators applied the “immediate subsequent use” to classify land
use for remediation purposes,®™ further highlighting that industrial facilities have
consistently been classified as falling under the industrial land use criteria, and that

otherwise agricultural land use was applied as a default criteria, except for the few
instances where sites have been expressly designated as protected areas under the
National System of Protected Areas (“SNAP”).°% In this context, Burlington argues that
sensitive ecosystem land areas are areas which are either “(1) certified under the
National System of Natural Areas, or ‘SNAP’ program, or (2) expressly designated as
sensitive ecosystem in an Environmental Impact Study”. Accordingly, Ecuador's
“colloquial description” of the Amazon as sensitive ecosystem in its entirety for
regulatory purposes should be rejected.®*” Burlington further argues that the certificates
of intersection issued by the Ministry of Environment under the SNAP program show
that “the majority of the Blocks do not intersect with the SNAP program’.°% Burlington
also indicates that the Environmental Impact Studies, including the 2010 Ex-Post
Studies, consistently apply agricultural and industrial land use standards.°* Finally,
Burlington calls Ecuador's reliance on the Sumaco Biosphere Reserve a “red herring”,
and irrelevant, since that reserve has not been designated as sensitive ecosystem in
the SNAP program or in any Environmental Impact Study which are “the only two ways

to designate an area as sensitive ecosystem under RAOH”.°°°

4.3.2 Discussion
a. The meaning of uso posterior

First, the Tribunal must determine the meaning of uso posterior and at what point in
time such use must be assessed. RAOHE Table 6 speaks of “subsequent use to be
given to the remediated soil” (uso posterior a darse al suelo remediado).*"' It adds that

C-PHB, {§ 118, 125-132. See also: GSI ER1, p. 40 (“Available records for remediation projects
completed in Ecuador oilfields over the past decade show that approximately 80% of sites have
been remediated subject to RAOH Table 6 agricultural soil criteria”).

C-PHB, {| 111. See also: GSI ER1, p. 40 (“Subject to the specifications of RAOH Table 6, the
“sensitive ecosystem” designation is applicable to designated ecological preserves, not to
agricultural lands or secondary forest, which represent the principal land uses in the areas
surrounding oilfield facilities in the Consortium area”).

Translation by the Tribunal. The accompanying text to RAOHE Table 6 indicates the following:
“The permissible limits to be applied in a determined project depend on the subsequent use to
be given to the remediated soil, which shall be included in the respective Remediation Program

147

331.

332.

such use must be indicated in the remediation program to be approved by the
Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection, which tends to show that the determination
is both context-driven and immediately posterior to any remediation. This is reinforced
by the use of the expression uso posterior (subsequent use), as opposed to the more
indeterminate uso futuro (future use). It thus appears that the uso posterior of land is
determined on a case by case basis according to its use immediately after remediation,
and that this determination is subject to approval in each instance by the
Subsecretariat.°” This reading consequently does not support the argument of a single
standard to be applied across the board. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot accept
Burlington’s position that the agricultural standard applies by default to all off platform
areas not specifically designated as sensitive ecosystems.

For the same reason, the Tribunal cannot accept Ecuador's position either according to
which the entire Blocks must be deemed to be sensitive ecosystem or that their future
use, as the expression is used in Ecuadorian law, is necessarily and in all cases to
revert to rainforest.°°° Ecuador's argument that the Consortium must remediate the
entire Blocks back to sensitive ecosystem criteria is incorrect for practical reasons. It
makes no sense that an operator should be required to restore to sensitive ecosystem
values the soil of an operating platform that will continue in operation. This is especially
so in a situation where Ecuador itself concedes that Petroamazonas may well continue
to operate the Blocks for another 30 years.

Furthermore, the evidence on record does not support Ecuador's view. To the contrary,
the record demonstrates that the uso posterior of platforms and other industrial facilities

 

or Project approved by the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection” (Translation by the
Tribunal) (Exh. EL-174).

This conclusion is further reinforced by the introductory comments of Ms. Rosa Zehner, technical
assessor of the Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection of the Ministry of Energy and Mines,
attached to RAOHE: “In the case of contaminated soils, permissible limits and parameters are
established in view of the use that, subsequent to a remediation, is planned to be given thereto”
(Translation by the Tribunal). See: IEMS ER1, Exh. 9, p. 8. Note that these introductory remarks
were not attached to Ecuador's exhibit of RAOHE, but were attached to IEMS’s exhibit of
RAOHE (cp. Exh. EL-174 with IEMS ER1, Exh. 9).

Ecuador's expert, RPS, conceded that it would be speculative to determine the long term future
land use of the Blocks: “we don’t know what will happen in this area in 30 years or more, it could
be used for homes, schools, recreation, agriculture, or just be returned to habitat”. Tr. (Day 4)

has been consistently classified as industrial.°“ This practice has continued after

Petroamazonas took over the Blocks in July 2009.°°°

b. The time at which uso posterior is assessed

This raises the question of the time at which the subsequent land use must be
assessed. When the operator alleged to have caused the harm is still operating the
facilities, the subsequent use is normally assessed at the time of remediation. The
position is different here as the Consortium stopped operations in July 2009 and the
harm was allegedly caused before, but only brought forward in 2011. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the most appropriate solution is to assess
the subsequent use at the time of the expropriation in August 2009. Indeed, the

The 2003 Remediation Plan of Contaminated Areas in Block 7 and Coca-Payamino (covering
Payamino Sanitary Landfill, Payamino 22, and CPFs in Payamino, Coca, and Jaguar), approved
by Ecuador's Ministry, indicates that remediation will be done in accordance with the industrial
land use criteria set forth in RAOHE Table 6. See: Letter from Luis Cobos (Perenco) to Edgar
Lopez (DINAPA), attaching the Remediation Program for Block 7, including Coca-Payamino
field, 28 January 2003 (Exh. CE-CC-51); Letter from Vicente Inepa (Ministry of Energy and
Mines) to Luis Cobos (Perenco), approving the Block 7/CPUF remediation plan, 13 June 2003
(Exh. CE-CC-57).

The 10-barrel spill in Payamino 19 in June 2009 was to be remediated back to industrial land
use criteria of RAOHE Table 6. See: Perenco Ecuador Limited, (Blasting, Painting and
Mechanical Repairs on Gacela Station Tank), March 2005. See: CMCC, note 358.

The Oso A and Oso B EIS of April 2006 indicates that at the end of the drilling operations,
contaminated soils will be remediated to levels below 4000 mg/kg of TPH, which is the industrial
standard under RAOHE Table 6. See: EIS, Oso A and Oso B, Block 7, April 2006, p. 7-70 (CE-
CC-110) (“Soil samples shall be taken in areas showing evidence of contamination in order to
determine hydrocarbon concentrations and potential contamination. Areas where concentrations
above 4,000 mg/Kg are detected shall be remediated to levels below this value” (Translation by
the Tribunal).

Also, the remediation progress report in 2003 regarding remediation in Coca CPF stated that
criteria of Table 6 RAOHE are applicable. See: Letter from Luis Cobos (Perenco) to Dr. Huga
Chamba (DINAPA), 22 April 2003, p. 1 (Exh. CE-CC-54) (“The value that is important to
consider is the TPH (4211.5 mg/Kg), which shows a degree of contamination very close to, but
still above, the maximum reference value for industrial-use soils as established in Table 6 of [the
RAOHE], which is 4000 mg/Kg").

The 2010 Ex-Post EIS’ commissioned by Ecuador also employ industrial land use criteria to
measure potential effects in the operational areas. See, for instance, Ex-Post EIS for Coca,
Payamino, Gacela, Section 3, p. 17 (Exh. CE-CC-241); Ex-Post EIS for Mono and Jaguar,
Section 3.1.6.2., pp. 15-17 (Exh. CE-CC-242); Ex-Post EIS for Oso, Section 3.1.6.3 (Exh. CE-
CC-236).

Tribunal must determine the existing liabilities of the Consortium at the time it was

expropriated.°°

c. The Tribunal’s approach to determining subsequent land use

The Tribunal is of the view that functioning platforms should be classified as ‘industrial’.
This applies also to areas that were not industrial in August 2009 but became so under
Petroamazonas, with the exception of rights of way which are cleared strips of land and
which the Tribunal, in part based on its observations during the Site Visit, classifies as
agricultural land.®’ The question also arises as to the classification of platforms no
longer in operation in August 2009 and which should have been revegetated by the
Consortium in accordance with RAOHE.®® Because they were no longer in use in
August 2009 (and were not put into use by Petroamazonas), the Tribunal is of the view
that these platforms do not qualify as industrial areas and will therefore classify them
under the remaining land use categories on a case by case basis according to the
circumstances of the relevant site.

The classification of land is more complex with respect to off platform areas. Ecuador
argues that all these areas must be classified as sensitive ecosystem. Burlington
concedes that sensitive ecosystem criteria apply to a limited number of designated
protected areas in Block 7 (Payamino 1/CPF, Payamino 2/8 and Payamino 18) located
in the Protected Forests Scientific Station Napo Payamino Cuerpos 1 and 2 Cerro
Sumaco, Cuenca Alta of the River Suno Ampliacién,®”° which form part of the National
System of Protected Areas, Protective Forests, and Forestry Assets of the State

Expansion activities took place at the following sites: Coca 13, Oso A, B and G, Coca A, Coca K,
Yuralpa Pad A. Petroamazonas also undertook to construct a new pipeline connecting Coca 1,
Coca CPF and Gacela 1-8. See: CMCC, § 469; Rejoinder, 80; Saltos WS2, {§ 125-133. Also:
Video of Petroamazonas’s Expansion of Operations in Blocks 7 and 21, 2 July 2013 (Exh. CE-
CC-384).

The glossary in RAOHE Annex 6 defines a right of way (derecho de via) as follows: “Fringe of
terrain of specific dimensions, in which a duct and/or access road is installed, which traverses
one or various properties and to which the owner of the duct has access or a transit servitude,
and in which area are established limitations of dominion” (Exh. EL-174) (Translation by the
Tribunal).

(SNAP).©"° Burlington also agrees that Nemoca and Waponi-Ocatoe in Block 21 fall
within a designated area qualifying as sensitive ecosystem.*"' At these locations, GSI
applied sensitive ecosystem criteria although the actual land use in Payamino 2/8 and
Payamino 1/CPF was arguably different. The Tribunal also notes that ConocoPhillips’
own environmental assessment of the Blocks in 2006 recognized that the Puerto Napo
— Yuralpa pipeline in Block 21 traverses three privately managed protected areas,
namely the Venecia Protected Forest, the Jatun Sacha Foundation and the Selve Viva
Foundation.°"* Beyond this, Burlington takes the position that the subsequent use of all
off platform, non-industrial land should be considered agricultural.

RAOHE Table 6 provides that the sensitive ecosystem values apply to “sensitive
ecosystems such as Natural Areas of the National Patrimony or others identified in the
corresponding environmental study” (“valores limites permisibles para la proteccién de
ecosistemas sensibles tales como Patrimonio Nacional de Areas Naturales y otros
identificados en el correspondientie Estudio Ambiental’) (emphasis added by the
Tribunal). The use of the words “such as” — “tales como” — shows that the reference to
formally designated protected areas is illustrative as opposed to exhaustive.°’* Hence,
the Tribunal cannot accept Burlington’s restrictive understanding of sensitive
ecosystems. Neither does it agree with Ecuador that all areas within the Sumaco or
Yasuni biosphere reserves automatically qualify as sensitive ecosystems. Indeed, the

The Tribunal notes that the SNAP map used by Burlington at the Hearing does not mark the
protected areas in Block 7 and Block 21 as being part of the SNAP system (Exh. CE-CC-363).
Additionally, the PANE sheet filed by Burlington indicating the National Heritage of Protected
Areas does not contain any protected areas in Block 7 and Block 21 (Exh. CE-CC-266).

biosphere reserves under the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (“MAB”) Program are
Not in fact strictly protected areas in which no human economic activity is tolerated.®"*

UNESCO launched the MAB program in 1971 and the biosphere reserve network in
1976. In 1995, the Seville Strategy was adopted as well as the Statutory Framework of
the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, which sets out the key components of MAB
reserves, such as designation, support and promotion of biosphere reserves.°"® MAB
biospheres should “strive to be sites of excellence to explore and demonstrate
approaches to conservation and sustainable development on a regional scale”. Such
sites must fulfill three functions: (i) the conservation of landscapes, ecosystems,
species and genetic diversity; (ii) the achievement of human and economic
development from a sociocultural and ecological point of view; and (iii) the support of
local, regional, national and global projects of education, training, research and
monitoring of the environment and sustainable development.*® Biosphere reserves
comprise a “mosaic of ecological systems” that are of significance for “biological
diversity conservation”.°””

Land use in these biosphere reserves depends on zoning, each reserve being divided
into three zones: (i) a nature reserve or national park as the core area where no
economic activity is tolerated (except for traditional uses), (ii) the buffer zone where only
activities compatible with the conservation of the ecosystems is allowed, and (iii) the
transition zone, which is the external ring of the biosphere and where sustainable

by Ecuador as a MAB biosphere in 1989, and the Sumaco reserve in 2000.°°

On this basis, the Tribunal notes that neither of the Blocks intersect with the core area
or buffer zone of these reserves; the sites under review only overlap with the transition
zones.™ Further, the Yasuni and Sumaco biosphere reserves under the MAB program
have not been designated as part of the protected areas known as SNAP, with the
exception of their core areas (i.e., the Parque Nacional Sumaco and the Parque
Nacional Yasuni).°*' The partial overlap of the Blocks with the Sumaco and Yasuni
reserves does not per se impose a classification as sensitive ecosystems. Finally, the
Tribunal notes that the Huaorani reserve partly overlaps with Block 21, but not with the

Yuralpa field where most of the environmental harm in that block is alleged to have

occurred. It is therefore not material to determine the land use in that field.©

Development (HSE&SD) assessment conducted in 2006 states that although neither block
overlaps with the Sumaco Napo-Galeras National Park, “both blocks do overlap (about 50
percent of the total surface area) the ‘transition zone’ or buffer area of the Sumaco Napo-

The Tribunal notes that the Yasuni National Park and Sumaco-Napo Galeras National Park were
designated under the SNAP system in 1979 and 1994, respectively, but they do not overlap with
the oilfields in the Blocks and Ecuador has not alleged this to be the case. See: Map of Sites in
Blocks 7 and 21 that Intersect Protected Areas (2012) (Exh. CE-CC-266); Ministry of the

a designated area where sensitive ecosystem criteria apply. See: Map of Sites in Blocks 7 and
21 that Intersect Protected Areas (2012) (Exh. CE-CC-266). As seen further below, the Tribunal
has classified the land use surrounding the platforms at these sites as being sensitive

153

341.

This said, the Tribunal is mindful that the Amazon region in Ecuador is considered to be
one of the most diverse and sensitive ecological areas in the world,°** and that it finds
special mention in the 2008 Constitution as was seen above.°* The Tribunal also
recalls IEMS’s evidence that secondary forests surrounding platforms can function as
biological corridors connecting preserved areas and modified primary forests, thus

fostering biodiversity conservation and protection.

However, IEMS’s biological
resource assessment in no way justifies qualifying the entirety of the Blocks as sensitive
ecosystems for present purposes. Indeed, in light of the existing human dwellings in
proximity of many platforms in both Blocks, especially in the northern part of Block 7,
the Tribunal considers IEMS’s opinion concerning the “regeneration capacity of the
rainforest’”’ too general and vague to support the adoption of a single, all-
encompadsing standard across the Blocks and thus disregard the actual situation on
the ground. In line with the Tribunal’s earlier conclusion, subsequent land use must be
assessed case by case, by reference to the particular circumstances of each site.

The Site Visit provided the Tribunal an important, first-hand view of the actual use of
land surrounding the platforms. By way of general observations, the Tribunal noted that
the vegetation cover was much denser in Block 21 than in Block 7, and that the CPUF

 

ecosystem based on the fact that they are surrounded by dense forest, without needing to rely
on the fact that these areas fall within the Huaorani indigenous reserve.

The Consortium and previous operators have acknowledged the sensitivity of the land
surrounding several platforms, for example in the Environmental Impact Assessment and
Environmental Management Plans for Condor Norte and Lobo 3 (“All water bodies that are
localized in the area of influence of the project correspond to zones that are sensitive to the
activities of the project, therefore sensitivity is high”). See further examples compiled by IEMS
regarding Yuralpa Pad D and West Lobo. IEMS ER4, pp. 41-42; Environmental Impact Study for
the Yuralpa Field, Block 21, p. 2-2 (Exh. E-156). See also Oryx’s Environmental Impact Study
for Block 7, where it is stated that “[gliven that Oryx’s operations take place in the fragile and
diverse amazonic ecosystem and particularly in the ecosystem that dominates the course of the
Napo river and its tributaries, it is also justified that those operations be performed adopting all
possible technical and economical, preventive and corrective measures to reduce to the
minimum possible the undesirable environmental effects [...]” (Translation by IEMS).

is located in the most developed part of the Blocks. This does not mean that all
disputed areas in Block 21 are sensitive ecosystems, nor that all land surrounding
platforms in the CPUF is agricultural. Again, a site-specific assessment is needed. Yet,
the general characterization just mentioned may inform such assessments.

On the basis of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal has engaged in a case-by-
case assessment of each site to determine subsequent land use. Its assessment is
primarily based on evidence gathered during the Site Visit, the explanations provided by
the experts,°* and the satellite imagery and aerial photogaphs of the sites closest in
time to the date of expropriation. Where the record contains no images or photographs

from that period, the Tribunal decided on the basis of the best available evidence.

Consequently, the Tribunal developed the following guidelines to assess land use at
any given site:

i. Platforms in operation on or after the date of expropriation have been classified as
industrial, as explained above.

ii. | Formally designated protected forests are classified as sensitive ecosystems
(except for platforms), regardless of other current uses.*°

iii. | Where platforms are completely surrounded by primary or secondary forest, the
Tribunal classified the forested areas as sensitive ecosystem.

iv. Where areas surrounding the platform are largely cleared, the Tribunal classified
the land use of those areas as agricultural.

v. Where multiple land uses may apply to a single site,®* the Tribunal looked more
specifically at the sampling locations to determine the land use in that specific
631
area.

GSI, refer in particular to GSI ER1, App. L and GSI ER2, App. L.

The following sites in the CPUF fall within a protected forest: Payamino 1/CPF, Payamino 2/8,
and Payamino 18. Payamino 4, Payamino 14, 20 & 24 and Payamino 23 are immediately
adjacent to the protected forest. The following sites in Block 21 fall within State Forest Heritage:
Nemoca and Waponi-Ocatoe. Dayuno and Yuralpa 01 are in close proximity of the State Forest
Heritage. Map of Sites in Blocks 7 and 21 that Intersect Protected Areas (2012) (Exh. CE-CC-
266).

155

344.

345.

vi. Where land use appeared mainly agricultural, the Tribunal nonetheless looked
more closely at particular features, such as swamps, creeks and rivers, that may
justify stricter criteria.

vii. Where human dwellings, including school or other community buildings are
adjacent to a water system and in close proximity to a contaminated site, the
Tribunal applied sensitive ecosystem criteria for RAOHE parameters and
residential criteria under TULAS Table 3 (for parameters not contemplated in
RAOHE Table 6).°

viii. For platforms that have been abandoned, the Tribunal did not apply industrial
criteria to the platform, but the relevant land use of the surrounding area.°*

ix. In cases of doubt, the Tribunal adopted the most protective standard in conformity
with the principles of precaution and in dubio pro natura.

In applying these guidelines, the Tribunal also considered the administrative practice of
land classification, as it arises from approved remediation reports. Most remediation
reports address on platform exceedances and classify the land as industrial. As regards
off platform exceedances, the few remediation reports referred to by Burlington mostly
refer to agricultural use.°™*

In addition to remediation reports, the Tribunal also reviewed the ex-post studies
prepared by Entrix (at the request of Petroamazonas) as well as the post-expropriation
practice of Petroamazonas. The ex-post reports very generally apply agricultural criteria
to the Coca, Payamino, Lobo and Mono fields,°°° which appears too wide an approach

context, the Tribunal also observes that IEMS indicated that agriculture partly surrounds
the platforms at Coca 6, Coca 8, Lobo 3, Lobo 1, Oso 9, Mono CPF and Payamino

This being so, the Tribunal stresses that the administrative practice of Ecuadorian
authorities was certainly helpful. At the same time, reliance on such practice cannot
excuse the Tribunal from the task of making its own assessment on the basis of the
entire record to ensure that it applies the regulatory criteria correctly.

4.4 Guidelines for calculating impacted areas and volumes of
impacted soils

The Parties advocated divergent approaches for calculating the extent of soil
contamination in the Blocks. Whereas Ecuador argued that, due to the impossibility of
sampling the entire Blocks, the extent of soil contamination can only be established by
extensive modelling (4.4.1), Burlington favored delineation through a process described
as “hand-contouring” (4.4.2). After reviewing the Parties’ methodologies, the Tribunal
will set out its own approach (4.4.3).

4.4.1. IEMS’s methodology and Ecuador’s position

For Ecuador, GSI’s approaches “to sampling, data collection and analysis do not
provide a sound or reasonable basis” to quantify the extent of harm in the Blocks, since
they are “inherently subjective and arbitrary’, and thus should be disregarded.**” By
contrast to GSI’s “contrived and unreliable sui generis delineation theory”, Ecuador
submits that IEMS reliably and conservatively quantified the extent of harm through
modelling and by using the “widely accepted” Inverse Distance Weighted (“IDW”)
interpolation technique.®*

See, for instance: CMCC, § 301, referring to: IEMS ER3, Annex H (REC 7-COC06-389, p. 5;
REC 7-LOB3-475, p. 47; REC 7-LOB1-208, p. 44; REC 7-OS09-345 p. 62).

Ecuador explains that IEMS used the computer software ArcGIS to calculate the total
volume of contaminated soil.° Using ArcGIS, IEMS developed a Geographical
Information System for Quantifying Environmental Impact Soil (“SIGAAS”), which
mapped every production facility within Block 7/CPUF and Block 21.%° For the areas of
contaminated soil, IEMS mapped each sample it collected, delineated a 10-meter
radius around it (called a “buffer”), and defined the boundaries of the contaminated area
as the outer limits of all buffers (a group of buffers is referred to as “cluster”) marked by

a rectangle called “bounds” (see figure below).°"'

To calculate the volumes of contaminated soil, IEMS modeled six different layers of
depths (from 0 to 1 meter, 1-2 meters, 2-3 meters, 3-4 meters, 4-5 meters, and more
than 5 meters deep).®* For each layer, IEMS measured the level of pollution for each
contaminant. IEMS explained that its analytic model required at least three polluted
samples per layer and that layers with less than 3 polluted samples were

disregarded.**

Once the bounds and the layers were established, IEMS (i) divided the
area within the bounds into “cells” of one square meter; (ii) categorized each cell where
samples were taken as non-contaminated, contaminated in excess of background
values but below regulatory levels, or contaminated in excess of regulatory thresholds;
and (iii) categorized each surrounding cell applying the IDW method of interpolation
with ArcGIS.©° With that method, the value attributed to each surrounding cell is a
function of the value of the sample data cells and the distance between the sample cells
and the surrounding cells. In other words, the closer a sample data cell is to a
surrounding cell, the more impact it has on the surrounding cell’s value. In consonance
with IEMS’s conservative model, argues Ecuador, total volumes of contaminated soil
were calculated only within the bounds.*°

The IDW interpolation method was necessary, according to Ecuador, due to the sheer
scale of the contaminated areas and because hand contouring would require
disproportionate resources.” IDW was chosen among various other models on the
basis of the characteristics on the ground, and the model was duly adjusted to account
for the particular characteristics of each site. In addition, Ecuador argues that literature
confirms that IDW is a recognized and well-understood form of linear interpolation.

2" SMCC, 4 176; IEMS ER8, Annex A.8, pp. 6-7.

IEMS explained that: “Since the interpolation method requires at least three sampling points
within the same analysis layer in order to generate an area, and also the samples corresponding
to these points must have significant contamination values in order to be able to evaluate the
level of dispersion, those sampling points which showed the existence of contamination but
which did not meet these conditions (for example, when only two samples were available for a
layer, even if they were contaminated) were not included in the modeling process, in keeping
with the conservative methodology used for the study”. IEMS ER3, p. 146. IEMS further held
that: “This methodology is conservative since it did not include identified or suspected areas of
contamination that could not be quantified with acceptable certainty (e.g., because our modeling
requires at least three contaminated samples within the same depth; anything less than three
samples were not modeled)”. IEMS ER4, p. 5. See also: R-PHB, § 429; Tr. (Day 3) (ENG),

Contrary to the assertion of Burlington’s expert Professor Rouhani, the “deterministic
linear interpolator IDW is not conditional on mathematical semivariance (‘spatial
correlation’), since semivariance is only required with the geostatistical linear
interpolation method known as “kriging”.© In this context, Ecuador explains that IDW is
a deterministic, not a geostatistical interpolator. The corollary of the foregoing is that
IDW assumes spatial correlation. Accordingly, spatial correlation was not tested by
IEMS because IDW is not mathematically dependent on semivariance.™?

Ecuador further contends that Professor Rouhani’s “desktop review” employed a wholly
inapplicable analysis.°° For instance, variograms are not used to evaluate IDW on a
post hoc basis. Indeed, Professor Rouhani conceded that his approach was “sub-
optimal’.®*' Moreover, IEMS confirmed that the contamination in the Blocks was in any
event sufficiently correlated at each particular site, and Professor Rouhani conceded
that practical experience trumps statistical analysis.®™ Finally, Burlington’s reference to
literature suggesting that IDW should not be used for decision-making is misplaced,
since (i) the literature relied upon by Burlington is published by the software developer
of ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst, (ii) that manual does not exclude the use of IDW but
merely cautions users about the reliability of the IDW interpolations, and (iii) IEMS
applied IDW conservatively and with all due caution, for instance, by applying control
systems and prediction capacity.®°

With regard to the last point, Ecuador insists that IEMS’s comprehensive model relies
on robust sampling taking into account topography and site features. Furthermore,
modeling was undertaken within small-bounded and well-sampled areas. These bounds
circumscribed areas of known contamination. Also, contrary to Professor Rouhani’s
assertion, IEMS included clean samples in its modeling. In addition, IDW was only used
in those locations with a minimum of three nearby data points, and IEMS weighted the
IDW interpolations conservatively by using a power of 3, instead of the standard power
of 2, the consequence being that the importance given to each sample decreased

rapidly.°* Finally, IEMS did not interpolate between points separated by more than 300
meters.©°°

Ecuador further asserts that Burlington errs when stating that the IDW method is
“conceptually flawed” or “scientifically inappropriate’.°°° In fact, Professor Rouhani
confirmed at the Hearing that IEMS’s IDW approach is a “systematic space-wide
analysis’.°’ Indeed, the experts on both sides employed some form of linear
interpolation. Yet, as Professor Rouhani noted at the Hearing, GSI used the
“rudimentary” hand contouring technique, while IEMS used the more powerful and
conservative IDW.®* Ecuador further explains that GSI also used mathematical forms
to interpolate the extent of negative impacts. In fact, “all experts agree that a
mathematical approach is the scientifically correct way to estimate environmental
contamination”.©® Moreover, GSI's criticism of using computer software is unfounded,
since GSI also used a computer for its “hand-drawn” contour lines.°° Finally, GSlI’s
claim that IEMS extrapolated from a given point outwards is plainly wrong, according to
Ecuador. Interpolation was done within well-defined bounds, circumscribing “heavily
sampled areas which were known to contain contamination”.**'

Regarding GSI’s quantification of contamination, Ecuador argues that GSI’s approach is
unreliable for various reasons: (i) GSI did not undertake a site-wide analysis; (ii) GSI’s
self-made and arbitrary topographical exclusion rules are scientifically flawed; (iii) GSI
failed to “step out” to take additional samples until clean soil was reached; (iv) GSI’s
manual delineation approach is arbitrary and (v) produces massive errors; and (vi)
GSI’s contingency factor cannot iron out the wide-scale methodological shortcomings of

GSI’s delineation approach.

First, Ecuador stresses that GSI limited itself to IEMS’s sampling without itself engaging
in a site-wide analysis, thus undermining its claim of a comprehensive assessment.**
For Ecuador, proper delineation would require an assessment on a meter-by-meter grid
basis. Since it is Burlington’s burden to prove the absence of significant negative
impacts, says Ecuador, one would have expected GSI to undertake a systematic
assessment: “[T]he easiest way for GSI to disprove IEMS’ quantification of the negative
impact was to sample, meter-by-meter, across the sites and perform a true
delineation’. Critically, Burlington not only decided not to undertake site-wide
sampling, it also decided not to test seriously, “whether or not IEMS’ sampling program
was representative of contamination across the Blocks”.°©° Ecuador further argues that
Burlington’s and GSl’s punctual criticisms fail to address the more general question
“whether, as a whole, IEMS’ sample design produced a representative sample set upon
which to found their interpolations”.

Second, GSl’s “sui generis delineation” rests on a set of misplaced arbitrary and self-
made topographical exclusion rules,” which GSI nonetheless does not follow,
according to Ecuador. As a starting point, Ecuador states that it bears recalling that
both RPS and IEMS confirmed that once contamination reaches the subsoil “any
surface topographic features will no longer have any impact on how the contamination
migrates through the subsoil’.°® Importantly, GSI applied its own topographical rules in
an arbitrary manner. In doing so, Professor Rouhani admitted that GSI failed to take
further delineation samples around exceedance points, such as, for instance, in Coca 8,

Id., 4.358.
Id., 344,
Id., 4.345.
Ibid.

Id., 4§ 349-351, where Ecuador provides a list of these topographical exclusion rules: (i)
topographic features, such as streams and catchment areas were considered; (ii) impacts within
stream features were bounded by the stream banks; (iii) upstream and downstream extents of
impacts extend to the nearest point with concentrations below the applicable criteria in each
direction; (iv) impacts that affect a localized area on a slope are assumed to extend twice as far
down slope than across slope; (v) site features were always considered, such as edges of pits,
platforms, oil-water separators, and/or roads; (vi) sampling results of points located more than
100 meters away from an exceedance point were only considered from a qualitative standpoint
on a case-by-case basis, but were not used for interpolation purposes. Ecuador admonishes
GSI for not providing any justification for these rules, or not providing explanations how factors
within these rules were considered. See, for instance: GSI ER1, App. L, Att. L.6.E, p. L.1
(Coca 8).

where GSI did not take any delineation samples to the northeast, east, southeast, south
or southwest of exceedance point # 5 (CO08-4M-03).°° Ecuador highlighted that
Professor Rouhani accepted that “it would have been much easier to solve this problem
by just having one more delineation sample”.°”

Third, Ecuador criticizes that GSI did not “step outwards” to take additional samples
until clean soil was reached.®”' Ecuador explained that “[i]n every case GSI’s
delineations are founded on only two samples — one being an ‘exceedance’ and one
being a ‘non-exceedance”.°” Yet, as IEMS stated, the most obvious step to achieve a
true delineation would have been to continue sampling until clean soil was uncovered.
To compound matters, Ecuador stresses that GSI willfully put dirty samples back into
the ground, discarding them totally.°” This happened not only in a few instances as
claimed by GSI, but in at least 6 sites (of the 17 where GSI took delineation
samples).°* When asked to comment, Ecuador states, GSI “cynically” explained: “And
the reason for that is because we stepped out because we're looking for the clean
margin”.*”° For Ecuador, “[t]rue delineation required continued sampling in all directions

until all contamination was captured”.°”°

Fourth, Ecuador states that GSI’s delineation approach is in any event wholly subjective

and arbitrary.°”

GSI cites no literature in support of its sui generis approach. The hand
drawn isoconcentration contour lines are a “very rudimentary form” of interpolation, as

Professor Rouhani conceded.®” In addition, this technique provides no certainty as it is

Id., § 360. Ecuador further points to Exceedance #1 (CO08-4M-07), where GSI did not take any
further delineation samples to the northwest, west, southwest, or the south, and Exceedance #4
(CO08-4M-04), where GSI did not take any further delineation samples to the south. Also

not possible to assess the errors associated with the tick marks or the hand drawn
contour lines.

Fifth, GSI’s approach produced massive errors according to Ecuador, notably because
of its “sample dilution” (both through the use of composite samples and by putting dirty
samples back into the ground).°” Finally, GSI’s “all purpose 20% ‘contingency” cannot
account for the errors in GSI’s delineations and is a “completely inadequate margin for
the massive limitations to, and errors inherent in, GSI’s delineations”.°° Ecuador
nonetheless points out that both Parties’ experts agree that a contingency factor

ranging from 20%-30% should be included."

4.4.2 GSI’s methodology and Burlington’s position

For Burlington, Ecuador’s reliance on IEMS’s computer model to estimate volumes of
allegedly contaminated soil is “[o]ne of the most consequential flaws in Ecuador's
environmental claim”.°* The result is to artificially inflate the estimates of soil
contamination by relying on modelling instead of delineating actual contamination in the
fields.®° Burlington also criticizes IEMS for committing serious errors in constructing its

1,884

model and argues that had IEMS engaged in validation testing, it would have

realized that the model is “highly unreliable”.°°

According to Burlington, the modelling methodology is incorrect and unreliable,°° in
particular because specific circumstances which may justify using computer predictions
as a substitute for real data are not present here.®” Relying on Professor Rouhani,
Burlington argues that the only reliable method for the Blocks is “site-specific field

delineation, relying on real data and observations’. Therefore, GSI employed the
methodology known as “hand-contouring” which involves “sampling known or
suspected areas of contamination and then ‘delineating’ these areas by taking
additional samples until clean soil is reached”.® These clean samples together with
topographical features then provide the “contours of the contaminated area”.®°°

With respect to Ecuador's modelling exercise, Burlington argues that IEMS used
ArcGIS to model the extent of contamination, although that software is “not designed to
extrapolate outwards from a particular data point’ but serves only to “interpolate
between plotted data values”.°*' As Professor Rouhani indicated, IDW is “simply not an
appropriate method for modeling soil contamination in the Blocks, as it cannot make
predictions within any acceptable range of reliability’.°%

Burlington explains that IEMS should have interpolated whereby “samples are taken
moving outward from a contaminated point until compliant samples are found”.6?
Instead, IEMS used a “fill” function in ArcGIS to connect “non-clean” samples, thus

ignoring topography (as the examples of Punino and Coca 1 demonstrate)®™ and other

physical features (such as low-lying drainages, roads or hills),°°°

resulting in a modelling
exercise where the “vast majority of areas” claimed to be contaminated are in fact areas

where IEMS’s own samples comply with Ecuadorian regulatory criteria “or areas where

Id., {§ 156, 161; Rouhani ER, §§ 88, 98, 100. Burlington further argued that “[b]y its nature,
therefore, this modeling process generates an imperfect image of reality, and it should only be
used when real data is not reasonably obtainable”. Rejoinder, {| 162.

GSI ER1, § 125 and App. F.5, pp. 10-12, 14-15. Burlington explained the consequence of the
failure to take into account topography and other physical features as follows: “IEMS's election
to wholly ignore the physical characteristics of the Blocks, many areas of which would naturally
constrain contamination, appears deliberate. It specifically selected low-lying areas for its
sampling points, since contamination naturally migrates down-gradient. It then selected a
modeling procedure that ignored these physical boundaries and “found” contamination in
surrounding upland areas where impacts are simply unfeasible” (footnotes omitted). CMCC,

no samples were taken at all’.°° In addition, IEMS’s models extend “far beyond the
vicinity of any of IEMS’s samples” thus imputing alleged contamination to areas where

7

no sampling was undertaken.®’ Burlington also criticizes IEMS’s “inconsistent

treatment of samples taken from pits”, in particular by using those samples to

698

interpolate in areas extending beyond the boundaries of the pits,“ as well as IEMS’s

substitution of “near-detection-limit values” for non-detect samples.®

According to Burlington, IEMS provided no explanation for choosing the IDW method
over other methods.” IDW only calculates an “average, weighted by distance”, based
on the assumption that all points are “correlated”, irrespective of “how far away one
travels from those samples, how unrelated the area being interpolated is to the one
from which the samples were taken, or whether there are topographic or other features
that would naturally isolate one area from the other’. In other words, Burlington
submits that IEMS’s model is “blind to the absence of correlation between the existing
data and the point that it has been instructed to predict”.’”

Ecuador’s argument that the assessment of actual soil conditions would have required
1.12 million additional samples is unavailing according to Burlington, especially since (i)
sampling was not required in a majority of the Blocks where IEMS did not even identify
any exceedances or recognized environmental conditions (“RECs”), (ii) 88% of IEMS’s
sampling locations comply with regulatory criteria, and (iii) IEMS failed to consider all
available data, ignoring “more than 500 soil samples, including ail of the data collected
by GSI (390 soil samples) as well as IEMS’s own samples from its most recent field
campaign (157 soil samples)”.”*° Burlington argues that the difference between IEMS’s
and GSl’s approaches is best illustrated when comparing the results for barium
contamination in Mono CPF, where IEMS’s model predicts contamination “that has no

ER4, Att. 38, Mono CPF, p. 29. It appears that the map was generated by GSI as part of an
exercise to assess the effect of various model search radiuses on the predicted area of impacted
soils, and in particular the effect of the variable search radius employed by IEMS. See: GSI ER2,
p. 35, Exhibit 17 and Annex F.5, p. F.5.7, Figure F.5.5. As seen below (paragraph 376), the

According to Burlington, employing appropriate delineation methods would reduce
IEMS’s estimations “to virtually nothing”.’”® Burlington further explained that IEMS
compounded matters by engaging in a series of “extraordinary errors and omissions” in
constructing and applying its method, thus producing distorted results.” In particular,

 

Rejoinder, {| 164. Burlington explained that: “The red area represents predicted exceedances of
IEMS's regulatory criteria, and suggests that there is ‘contamination’ spreading uphill and over
the platform. Such a result is clearly irrational: it bears no apparent relationship to the
topography observed on the ground or the location of the actual exceedances (none of which
were on the platform)”. /d., § 165.

Rejoinder, § 157.

Burlington highlights the fact that IEMS converted non-detect samples into positive
values (so-called false positives) with the result that the ArcGIS software erroneously
used “positive data values to generate maps of allegedly “contaminated” areas”.’"° This
resulted, Burlington says, in a manipulation of 79% of IEMS’s data points.’"' Ecuador’s
explanation regarding the power function is to no avail since the power function simply
instructs the IDW model “how heavily to weight one sample compared to another based
on their proximity”, but will “always calculate a value for every cell in the modeled area
that is between the minimum and maximum sample value, no matter what power is
used’.’ Instead of using a fixed search radius to avoid overreaching, IEMS used a
variable search radius resulting in the model’s IDW calculations continuing to run “until
it reaches the model’s bounds”,’"* as GSI demonstrated when modifying the bounds in
the model.’"*

Finally, Burlington argues that IEMS’s failure to engage in meaningful validation testing
proves the unreliability of its model, Professor Rouhani having confirmed that these
kinds of models require validation testing.’’® As a basic reality check, IEMS should at
the very least have compared its model to GSI’s 390 soil samples or its own additional
157 samples. Instead, IEMS only plotted its new sample locations on its site maps
resulting in clean samples appearing in allegedly contaminated areas such as Coca 8,
Coca 9, Coca 18-19, Payamino 4, Mono CPF, Mono 10-12 and Céndor Norte.” In this
context, IEMS’s cross-validation at Coca 8 taking “a single analyte in a single layer ina
single site” is unreliable, since cross-validation “only works in points for which the model
already contains data’ and not at locations distant from known samples.”"” In any event,
IEMS’s cross-validation shows that “the average difference between known values and

predicted values” is ten times greater than the acceptable error level calculated by
Professor Rouhani.”"®

Moreover, argues Burlington, IEMS should have engaged in further tests by measuring
the correlation of the data and mapping the reliability of the model’s predictions through
a prediction standard error (“PSE”) map.”'? With respect to data correlation, Professor
Rouhani’s variograms showed that “more than half of the model layers” are not
correlated with the result that linear interpolation is unreliable.’ IEMS should also have
tested the reliability of its interpolation by generating a PSE map showing “zones of
reliability” and indicating the range of error within each zone.”' For Burlington,
Professor Rouhani’s testing of IEMS’s model through cross-validation and the use of

PSE maps confirmed that the model is not reliable.”

44.3 Discussion

After closely reviewing the evidence and the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal comes to
the conclusion that, as between the methods presented to it, the delineation of discrete
pockets of contamination by relying on actual sampling is best suited to estimate the
impacted areas and to calculate the volumes of contaminated soil requiring
remediation. It therefore discards IEMS’s modelling, which it considers unreliable, or at
least less reliable, in the circumstances. For various reasons, however, the Tribunal
does not rely completely on the results of GSI’s delineation exercise and has therefore
independently calculated impacted areas and volumes of soil. The Tribunal first
provides its reasons for discarding IEMS’s modelling ((a) below), then addresses the
problems with certain of GSI’s delineations ((b) below), before explaining its own
approach ((c) below).

a. _ IEMS’s modelling

The Tribunal discarded IEMS’s modelling for various reasons. In far too many instances
there appears to be no reasonable relationship between the model's predictions and the

actual data, thus excessively inflating the size of contaminated areas. Among other
things, the model does not properly consider clean samples, extends to areas where no
sampling was undertaken, and insufficiently takes account of topography and other
physical features. In addition, it appears that IEMS did not test the reliability of its
conclusions although the ArcGIS user instructions require cross-validation.”* These
failings of IEMS’s modelling are discussed below.

First, the Hearing and the Site Visit showed that IEMS’s model extends to demonstrably
uncontaminated areas. It is common ground among the experts that soil sampling data
determine the existence of contamination.” Burlington rightly pointed to Gacela 4 and
Jaguar 3 as examples where clean samples collected by IEMS during its fourth
sampling campaign are located in areas that were modelled as contaminated after the
first three sampling campaigns, thus disproving the model's predictions.” IEMS’s re-
modelling of Gacela 4 after the fourth campaign still predicted contamination in areas

where new clean samples had been found.’

The ArcGIS user instructions provide in relevant part: “Before you produce the final surface, you
should have some idea of how well the model predicts the values at unknown locations. Cross-
validation and validation help you make an informed decision as to which model provides the
best predictions. The calculated statistics serve as diagnostics that indicate whether the model
and/or its associated parameter values are reasonable”. Performing Cross-Validation and
Validation, p. 1 (Exh. CE-CC-439).

375. Similarly, during the Site Visit, the Tribunal observed the absence of correlation of the
data included in IEMS’s models, in particular at Gacela 2 and Mono CPF. The image of
Gacela 2 below shows how IEMS’s model predicts contamination extending up and
across most of the platform to the north (and beyond) to areas where not a single soil
sample had been collected.”” In fact, only one sample taken on the platform — indicated
by the Tribunal with an arrow — appears to drive the model's predictions (all other
samples are to the south or southwest of the platform and lie in lower altitudes than the
platform):

377. The pictures above also illustrate that the bounds on IEMS’s modelling are determined
by clusters of samples and/or discrete samples without considering that large areas
inside the bounds have not been sampled at all. Much of IEMS’s modelling is thus
rather speculative. It also involves a degree of arbitrariness as the models commonly
predict that contamination abruptly stops at straight lines.

378. As was already mentioned, IEMS’s model also fails to sufficiently factor in topography
and other physical features of the sites, which is exemplified in the following figure

several meters — indicated by the Tribunal with a yellow arrow —,’”° which is contrary to
IEMS’s own explanation that contamination could conceivably spread uphill some
50 centimetres when the water level rises during the rainy season.” In addition,
IEMS’s model ignores GSI’s samples on the other side of the creek which show no
exceedances.’*'

IEMS’s modelling at Yuralpa Pad A provides another example of the lack of relation to
actual site data. On the basis of a single sample taken next to the oil water separator in
the southern corner of the platform (i.e., in the area designated by GSI as Area 2M) —
indicated by the Tribunal with an arrow — the model predicts that contamination not only
spreads downhill to the southeast, but also towards the southwest without any
substantiated explanation for this pathway.’ Indeed, there are no IEMS samples
showing contamination in that particular area. To the contrary, GSI samples show that
the contamination flowed some distance in the southeast direction,” but that in fact it
did not extend to the southwest of the oil water separator.” This is illustrated by IEMS
as follows:”*

During the Site Visit, IEMS pointed to two potential contamination pathways. First, IEMS
mentioned in passing the existence of a river surrounding the platform without providing more
specific indications as to the direction of the water flow. Second, IEMS spoke about the structure
of the material used to build platforms, which would facilitate the migration of contamination to
off platform areas. Tr. Site Visit (Day 1) (ENG), 18:22-19:9 (Tribunal, Chaves at Yuralpa Pad A).

IEMS’s predictions for contamination at Coca 15 also demonstrate the flaws of its
model. At that site, a single sample with a TPH value purportedly exceeding permissible
limits — signalled by the Tribunal with an arrow — drives the entire model and predicts
contamination in excess of regulatory limits across approximately one-fourth of the
platform.” This is illustrated by IEMS as follows: °”

The Tribunal is concerned here with assessing the reliability of IEMS’s model, not on whether
any particular sample location has been properly classified under applicable land use criteria. As
will be seen further below, this sample (MS-COC-C2-15.3-0.5) has a TPH value of 3,571 mg/kg
but shows no exceedance of the correct applicable regulatory criteria, since it is located on the
platform and thus must be compared to industrial land use criteria. As stated by Burlington's
counsel during the Site Visit: “So, there’s no reason to have the model call for any remediation,
and, yet, this site really allows me to illustrate, perhaps, most vividly why this model is so
detached from reality and detached from the data. One sample point for a TPH exceedance that
is not real drives this red part of the model”. Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 72:26-31 (Presentation
by Ms. Renfroe at Coca 15).

During the Site Visit of Coca 15, the Parties’ experts disagreed whether the model
extended north of the platform where the terrain shows a steep slope upwards.”*° While
IEMS opined that its model perfectly aligned with topography,’*® the Tribunal observes
that the red area extends approximately 5 meters beyond the platform (the scale of the
map is 1:1000) and thus predicts contamination going up the slope.””°

In addition, the Tribunal notes that IEMS did not perform any analysis to determine
whether its data was spatially correlated.”*' It also conceded at the Hearing that it did
not conduct a quantitative review to verify the reliability of its model.” IEMS actually
stated that it could not assess the level of precision or imprecision of its model for lack
of quantitative analysis’ and admitted being unable to opine whether a 50 percent
margin of error would be acceptable.”*

Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 76:1-30 (Tribunal, Chaves) and 76:31-77:10 (Tribunal, Bianchi).

During the Site Visit, IEMS conceded that they did not verify that their bounds aligned to local
topography at this particular site, although IEMS thought that this site demonstrated how well its
model worked: “Q: How could the contamination get up there?. A. It doesn’t rise. Q: It doesn’t
rise. Then how does it get here? A. We have a sampling point with TPH values of 3571; the truth
is that | hadn't paid attention to that, but, what a good model we made!”. Tr. Site Visit (Day 4)
(ENG), 76:1-8 (Tribunal, Chaves).

As GSI explained during the Site Visit: “This is clear evidence of the arbitrariness of how this
model works and how it does not consider topography. The model, even if he used it correctly,
does not have any input for topography. There is nowhere that you tell it, “This is higher. This is
lower.” So, we have to dispel that notion that it considers topography. But more than that — I’m
going to hurry. Look at the scale, 1:1000. Every measurement here of one inch would be a
thousand inches. This is putting us on the other side. | mean, we can talk about the trees, the
clouds, we can talk about anything you want, but this model is on the other side of the slope”. Tr.

C-PHB, 9 165-166. IEMS confirmed at the Hearing that it did not engage in any quantitative
analysis to test the spatial correlation of its dataset. Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 835:21-836:7 (Cross,
Chaves).

During cross-examination, IEMS responded as follows: “Q. And before submitting your Final
Report in this case, you did not undertake to evaluate in any quantitative fashion the margin of
error or degree of reliability or certainty or uncertainty in your Report, did you? A. Quantitative,
no, we didn’t conduct a quantitative analysis”. Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 787:20-788:4 (Cross, Alfaro).

IEMS responded as follows during cross-examination: “Q. | want to focus on the risk that the
number you have given this Tribunal of $2.6 billion has a margin of error, has a significant
margin of error. And as the Project Manager for this project, and the man who has
recommended $2.6 billion of remediation, I'm asking you, sir: Is it acceptable to you for that
number to have a 50 percent margin of error? A. Honestly, | don’t know if it’s acceptable or not

Finally, the Tribunal observes that Ecuador's other expert, RPS, did not peer review
IEMS’s model predictions or otherwise test the validity of IEMS’s work.”° More
importantly, it appears to the Tribunal that, although RPS criticised GSI’s sampling
methodology (such as using composite samples or sampling at different depths than
IEMS), it did not express any principled criticism of GSI’s contour delineation.”

For these reasons, the Tribunal will not rely on IEMS’s modelling. It does not, however,
discard the extensive sampling data collected by IEMS. The Tribunal now turns to GSI's
delineation approach.

b. —_GSI’s delineation

Before addressing in more detail GSI’s approach to delineation (iii), two preliminary
issues need to be addressed, namely GSl’s indicator parameter theory (i) and GSI's
recourse to composite sampling for delineation purposes (ii).

(i) Indicator parameters

GSI only delineated around samples showing TPH or barium exceedances and
discarded other heavy metal exceedances as “background metals issues”, on the

ground that such exceedances are unrelated to oilfield operations.” Ecuador strongly

8

objected to this practice,”* in particular by stressing that Mr. Saltos confirmed that

numerous chemicals are used during various phases of the oilfield operations and that

RPS testified as follows during cross examination: “Q. And you're not endorsing the model that
they have prepared for this case, are you? A. | have not reviewed the details of the models, no”.
Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1061:14-17 (Cross, Crouch). And further: “[L]ike | say, I'm not certain of
everything IEMS ran. | didn’t review all four of their Reports. | looked at what GSI brought
forward into their Reports”. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1100:9-12 (Cross, Crouch). See also: C-PHB,
4175.

For instance, RPS stated the following under cross-examination: “Q. And so — and you've
provided no criticism of the actual delineation of impacted soils done by GSI at the 17 sites that
they identified in their Report? A. No, | think my primary criticisms there were the compositing of
the delineation samples — | guess | offered two criticisms”. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1072:8-13 (Cross,
Crouch). RPS also criticized GSI more generally for only analyzing for metals and TPH, but not
other petroleum chemicals of concern such as BTEX or PAHs. RPS ER2, p. 43. The Tribunal
further notes that even IEMS appeared to agree that delineation is a reliable methodology if
properly applied: “When delineation per se is carried out, it can be done in a relatively
trustworthy way, but it has to be very well-done”. Tr. (Day 3) (ENG), 947:14-16 (Tribunal, Alfaro).

Burlington failed to provide a list of the chemicals the Consortium used.”° The Tribunal
rejects Burlington’s indicator parameter theory for the simple reason that under RAOHE
and TULAS any exceedances of applicable remediation criteria (adjusted as required to
account for higher natural concentrations) in the area of the oilfield operations, warrant
remediation by the Consortium, unless Burlington can rely on one of the three
exculpatory causes referred to in paragraph 238(iii) above.

(ii) | Composite sampling

Another issue with GSI’s approach lies in the use of composite delineation samples.
The Tribunal notes that GSI collected discrete risk characterization and soil
confirmation samples and that GSI initially started out by collecting discrete delineation
samples, only later collecting composite samples since IEMS was_ projecting
contamination in 1-meter layers.”©°

In addition to various other criticisms raised by Ecuador with respect to composite
samples,”°' Ecuador notes the risks of dilution and volatilization.” Ecuador stressed

R-PHB, § 240, referring to: Tr. (Day 4) (ESP), 1267:1-13 (Cross, Saltos), corresponding to
Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1210:5-15 (Cross, Saltos).

While GSI first took 30 centimeter interval discrete samples, it then resorted to 1-meter interval
composite sampling for delineation purposes. GSI explained that prior to its second sampling
campaign “it was discovered that IEMS used discrete sampling intervals to represent full 1m
depth intervals. For example, if an exceedance was detected from 1.2 to 1.5 m, then IEMS
assigned that exceedance to the entire 1 to 2 m depth interval. In response, GSI collected
composite delineation soil samples [...] from 1-m intervals (i.e., 0.0 — 1.0 m) to provide full lateral
delineation. In addition, if the target IEMS sampling location was collected from a portion of a 1-
m depth interval, then the GSI composite delineation samples were collected from that full 1-m
interval”. See: GSI ER1, pp. D.10-D.11. At the Hearing, GSI explained its course of action as
follows: “The goal of our or the objective of our program, was to delineate soil impacts and also
to check the IEMS model, and it is true that we began taking these discrete samples and then
we switched to taking the 1-meter samples for the purposes of delineation and checking the
model”. Tr. (Day 5) (ENG), 1454:14-19 (Direct, Bianchi). See also: Ecuador's Closing Statement,
Slide 104.

For instance, Ecuador stated that GSI collected its delineation samples at different depths from
IEMS’s samples showing contamination. Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 107. Ecuador's
expert RPS already raised concerns with respect to GSI’s use of composite samples for its risk
characterization of mud pits, using Oso 9 as an illustration. RPS ER2, p. 48. RPS stated that
GSI's risk characterization samples collected at mud pits at the Oso 9 site were “two-part
composites”. RPS further stated that the use of composite samples led to (i) the loss of VOCs
such as TPH, benzene and 1-methylnaphtalene prior to analysis, and (ii) dilution of sample
results that are biased low and do not represent the potential concentration of contaminants in
the media. According to RPS, ‘“[iJt is standard risk assessment protocol to collect “discrete”
rather than “composite” samples for determining exposure point concentrations”. RPS further
pointed to the EPA's guidance on composite sampling, which provides as follows: “If the integrity
of the individual sample values changes because of compositing, then composite sampling may

179

389.

390.

that GSI conceded that 1-meter composite samples are biased towards the lower value
since they only show an average and not the highest concentration.”° For these
reasons, IEMS did not rely on GSI’s delineation samples to compile its models.”

The Tribunal need not enter with great detail into the Parties’ discussion on composite
samples.” It generally agrees that discrete samples allow for greater accuracy in
determining the highest concentration of a contaminant in the soil. There is thus a
certain risk of dilution inherent in composite sampling which mixes larger intervals of
soil instead of testing thinner intervals. On the other hand, IEMS’s 30 centimeter interval
samples also involve a degree of composition, merely on a smaller portion. Thus, the
Tribunal notes that a certain level of vertical compositing is inevitable for any soil
sample.

More importantly, the Tribunal notes that Ecuadorian regulations do not mandate a
particular sampling method, and, in particular, do not impose discrete sampling. Rather,
RAOHE provides that composite sampling is acceptable.“ RAOHE Annex 5
determines various analytical methods and provides that the method for soil sampling is

 

not be the desired approach. For example, volatile chemicals can evaporate upon mixing of
samples or interaction can occur among sample constituents. Another limitation is imposed by
potential dilution, when an individual sample with a high value is combined with low values
resulting in a composite sample that falsely tests negative’. USEPA, EPA Observational
Economy Series, Volume 1: Composite Sampling, EPA/2010/R-95/005, August 1995, p. 5 (RPS
ER2, Exh. 30a). See also: RPS Direct Presentation, Slide 14.

Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 106.

See, for instance, Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 108, referring to: Tr. (Day 5) (ENG),
1656:12-19 (Tribunal, Bianchi).

During the Site Visit, Ecuador explained at Coca 8 why IEMS did not use GSl’s delineation
samples to model the extent of contamination: “all of these delineation samples here are
composite [...] and explains why GSI results are simply not reliable. They cannot be used. If you
were to use that, you will be using wrong data [...] If delineation had been done and they had the
choice at the same depth, horizontally, in the same location vertically, we could be talking about
delineation, but that’s not what they did”. Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 83:19-24 (Presentation of
Mr. Garcia Represa at Coca 8). See also: R-PSVB, pp. 38-39.

RAOHE Annex 5 (Exh. EL-174). Table 7 of RAOHE Annex 2 also expressly contemplates
composite sampling within mud pits. It reads in relevant part: “The sampling shall be performed
so as to obtain representative composite samples as a function of total volume disposed of at
the respective site” (Translation by the Tribunal). See also: GS! ER2, { 196.

to collect a “composite and representative sample” (“Muestra compuesta y
757

representativa’),
Finally, the Tribunal accepts GSI’s composite samples in light of the fact that IEMS itself
calculated the allegedly impacted areas on the basis of 1-meter layers, the values of
which were determined based on samples that ranged from only 10 to 30 centimeters in
length.”

As to the risk of volatilization referred to above, the Tribunal notes that IEMS did not
test its samples for Volatile Aromatic Hydrocarbons,’** and that RPS confirmed that GSI
screened its samples with a photo ionization detector (“PID”) before sending them to
the laboratory.” In any event, the Tribunal is satisfied with GSI’s explanation that by
the time the sampling took place, these compounds had volatilized to a large extent,
since the alleged contamination dated back several years and a key characteristic of

these compounds is their high mobility.”

(iii) Linear interpolation
With these considerations in mind, the Tribunal now turns to GSI’s approach to
delineation through linear interpolation. While the Tribunal generally accepts
Burlington’s delineation methodology, it cannot simply rely on GSIl’s calculations for
several reasons. First, GSI only investigated 22 sites to confirm and delineate the
extent of contamination at 74 facilities (of which GSI inspected 58) based on the
erroneous assumption that most off platform areas must be evaluated against

It then goes on to state as follows: “a minimum of 15-20 sub-samples per hectare or equivalent,
homogenization” (Translation by the Tribunal). RAOHE Annex 5 (Exh. EL-174).

GSI provided the following explanation: “IEMS collected soil samples that typically ranged from
10 to 30 cm in length but assigned the concentration of those samples to the entire 1-meter
depth interval of the layer being modeled in their volume calculations. GSI, however, collected
soil samples of the full 1-meter length or thickness of the layer being delineated. Consequently,
GSI did not have to extrapolate concentrations from a small vertical interval and assume that
they applied to a much thicker layer”. GSI ER2, {| 197.

The Tribunal also notes that IEMS only initially analyzed its samples for PAHs, i.e. compounds
which Ecuador's other expert RPS qualified as being pervasive, more toxic and mobile than
volatiles, but stopped when it found no exceedances. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1097:19-1098:2 and

agricultural land use criteria."°" Consequently, for the contaminated sites for which GSI

provided no delineation, the Tribunal will have to undertake its own assessment.

Second, as discussed above (see paragraphs 318-322) for the 17 sites where GSI
identified exceedances, GSI’s adjusted remediation criteria for certain metals (i.e.,
barium, cadmium and nickel) have now been found to be incorrect. As GSI conceded
under cross-examination, it would have had to delineate around more IEMS samples if
the regulatory criteria had been lower than those which it applied.” Moreover, GSI did
not propose alternative delineations considering different regulatory criteria. In other
words, GSI’s delineation data is insufficient for purposes of the Tribunal’s
establishement of soil contamination.

Third, various aspects of GSI’s sampling procedure have led the Tribunal to adjust
GSI's estimates. In this respect, it may be useful to start by outlining GSI’s approach of
physical delineation and hand-contouring. GSI first reviewed the laboratory results of
soil samples to identify and locate impacted soils.” It then surrounded these
exceedance points with additional soil samples “until a clean perimeter is defined as
needed to delineate the extent of the impacted soils”.”® This “clean perimeter” is also
referred to as the “clean margin”.”©° It then drew hand contour lines “by interpolating
among the sample points” (this process is described below), to finally delineate the

GSI ER1, p. 70. In its second expert report, GSI recognizes that remediation of 37,555 m3 of
contaminated soil is required at 17 sites, although it denies that the Consortium caused this
contamination. These sites are: Coca 1, Coca 4, Coca 6, Coca 8, Coca CPF, Payamino 1,
Payamino 2/8, Payamino 4, Payamino 23, Gacela 1/8, Gacela 2, Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 7/8,
Mono CPF, Mono Sur and Yuralpa Pad A. See: GSI ER2, p. 24, Exhibit 8 and Table 4; Tr. (Day
5) (ENG), 1462:22-1463:8 (Direct, Bianchi); GSI’s Direct Presentation, Slides 22 and 54. In its
first expert report, GSI originally recognized that remediation was warranted at 16 sites,
corresponding to 33,415 m* of total soil volume. See: GSI ER1, p. 88.

GSI responded as follows: “Q. So, the definition of what an exceedance is is really material, and
what I’m putting to you is, if the exceedance threshold is lower, you may be required to delineate
around other IEMS samples; correct? A. That is correct. That is possible”. Tr. (Day 5) (ENG),
1585:9-14 (Cross, Bianchi). And also: “Q. Now, you recognize, sir, that had you lowered the
threshold for an exceedance, there would be more IEMS samples that would need to be
delineated around, and some of your own samples may not show clean, and, therefore, you
would be required to go even farther to delineate; correct? A. In that hypothetical, yes”. Tr. (Day
5) (ENG), 1586:3-8 (Cross, Bianchi).

catchment areas) and field observations.””

GSI relied on linear interpolation using an equation “to mathematically locate the
isoconcentration contour line between a sampling location that exceeded the specified
criterion to a corresponding sampling location that was below the criterion’.’””"’ The
interpolated points were indicated on a map using “tick marks” and then connected to
create an isoconcentration contour line at the specified regulatory criterion for a certain
parameter.”” GSI considered site features “particularly in situations where linear
interpolation was not possible”.’”” It further explained that “[flor selected portions of
potentially impacted areas at some sites”, it determined a “set distance beyond points of
exceedance” based on local topography and field observations where “linear
interpolation was not applicable and/or site features were not available to delineate
potentially impacted areas”.’”* At the Hearing, GSI acknowledged that the methodology
involved a degree of uncertainty in some areas, but that by using professional
judgment, providing for additional sampling, and allowing for a contingency factor — all
of which it did — that uncertainty could be significantly reduced.”

The Tribunal’s concerns with GSI’s approach can be well illustrated using Coca 8 as an
example. Indeed, this could be called the “poster child” of Ecuador's critique of GSI’s
methodology in view of the prominence that it was given at the Hearing. The figure
below shows GSI’s delineation for barium in the 1-2 meter layer in the area south of the

mud pits (located south of the Coca 8 platform). ’”°

399. As a first concern, although it does not share Ecuador's criticism that GSI failed to
engage in a site-wide assessment,’” especially since the burden to make a showing of
harm rests on Ecuador, the Tribunal notes that, as this figure graphically depicts, GSI
failed at times to comprehensively collect delineation samples around certain known
exceedance points. In the example above, this is the case for instance at: (i) sample
location CO08-4M-07 in Area 4M, where no delineation samples were taken to the
northwest, west, southwest or south; (ii) sample location CO08-4M-03, where no
delineation samples were taken to the northeast, east, southeast, south and southwest;
(iii) sample location CO08-4M-04, where no sample was taken to the south; and (iv)
sample location CO08-4M-06, where no sample was taken to the west.

400. ‘The Tribunal is aware of the fact that the barium value for sample location CO08-4M-07
(770 mg/kg) is close to permissible limit for agricultural use (i.e., 750 mg/kg). The
Tribunal nonetheless considers that, as a general matter, and in the light of its own
description of its methodology, GSI should have taken additional samples, in particular

mz See, for instance: R-PHB, § 339.

185

402.

because GSI purportedly “stepped out” of impacted areas to find clean soil.’ This is
compounded by the fact that here the applicable criterion is the adjusted sensitive
ecosystem limit of 639 mg/kg (see below paragraph 472).

The Tribunal further notes GSI’s explanation for sample location CO08-4M-03, where
the “potentially impacted area” was extended by 11 meters southeast since that sample
location “did not have a bounding delineation sampling location or site feature to the
east”.’”° GSI explained that the 11 meter perimeter was “a conservative estimate based
on the relatively flat localized terrain; therefore, the potentially impacted area was
assumed to extend radially an equivalent distance from the GSI exceedance point”.”°°
However, Professor Rouhani conceded that “it would have been much easier to solve
this problem by just having one more delineation sample”.’”' Admittedly, he also
concurred with GSI’s explanation that practical limitations may militate for using
“professional judgment” in cases where the results of delineation samples come back
from the laboratory with higher than expected values, thus compelling engineers to
apply practical approaches instead of relying on purely statistical methods.”*

A second and potentially more problematic difficulty is GSl’s resort to linear
interpolation combined with its practice, during its stepping-out from exceedance points
to locate the clean margin, of putting visually “dirty” samples back into the soil without
actually testing them in the laboratory. At the Hearing, GSI justified this practice by
saying that it was inconsequential to its procedure of “stepping out” to find the “clean
margin’, that is, a clean sample that could be interpolated with an exceedance point:

“Q. Now, leaving aside the conceptually [sic] caveat you put to your
answer, in practice, were there instances in which you made a hole in the
ground, you looked at the contents of that soil boring —- you took a
sample — and in which you did not submit that sample for laboratory
testing? Yes or no.

A. | believe so, yes, if | understood correctly your question. So, we saw
evidence of contamination, and we did not submit that sample. Did |
understand that correctly?

403.

Q. Right.

A. And the reason for that is because we stepped out because we're

looking for the clean margin. So, if we're here and we take the sample —

the exceedance is that monitor there in the middle, and we come here

because we believe we're going to be in a clean zone. We look at the

sample and like we're not in a clean zone, so that’s what | described in

my presentation, | think, that we step out. We go further out so that we

make sure we include this point, if appropriate — and that’s a key, if

appropriate — within that area”.”*°
GSI further indicated at the Hearing that this practice was infrequent, pointing to Coca 8
as one instance.” But Ecuador reviewed GSI’s boring logs and pointed to certain other
instances’® at Coca 1,”° Coca 6,”°” Jaguar 1,” Mono CPF” and Payamino 23.’°°
Generally speaking, the Tribunal has no issue with and accepts using linear
interpolation between an exceedance point and a non-exceedance point in order to
determine the impacted area based on regulatory criteria. Stepping out looking for clean
samples seems appropriate, especially if the clean sample point is taken as the outer
limit of the impacted area. However, it also appears to the Tribunal that, as with any
methodology, linear interpolation that is based on incomplete data — in this instance
where “dirty” borings were not considered — can distort the results and end up
underestimating or otherwise misrepresenting the contaminated area. When linear
interpolation between an exceedance point A and a non-exceedance point B is applied,
but a “dirty” sample C in between is not considered, there is a risk that the contour line
is too close to A or otherwise does not reflect the true contours of the contamined area.

GSI stated that it “can think of Coca 8 as being one example”, further stating that it could not
“recall it happening very often” and that “there was very, very few [instances], if more than one”.

404. This underestimation became clear during Professor's Rouhani’s examination, when he

was confronted with the following demonstrative: ’*"

 

405. In connection with this demonstrative, the following question was put to Professor
Rouhani:

“Q. [...] Now, what | sought to do is | sought to put A and C sort of
equidistant from the hand contour line, and you will recall that what we
discussed earlier was that, if we had an exceedance that was the same
level in excess of the regulatory criteria and a non-exceedance that was
the same distance below, or the same volume below, we would arrive
roughly in the middle. Now, B, B is our hypothetical exceedance. If B has
the same exceedance level as A, and we apply the linear interpolation
formula that we have been discussing this evening, and C, the non-
exceedance, remains the same level, our tick mark is going to end up
further to the east; right? It's going to end up outside the hand contour?

A. Yes.
Q. Would you agree with that?
A. Yes.’

of Professor Rouhani. See also: R-PHB, § 367.

407.

In light of the fact that GSI had recourse to this practice in no less than 6 out of 17 sites
where GSI delineated impacted areas, the Tribunal cannot but agree with Ecuador that
this practice was more systematically used than GSI is willing to concede.” As
discussed above, the Tribunal considers that at certain sites the result of the practice
may be to underestimate the contaminated area, in particular where there are no clean
samples that define the clean margin in the relevant part of the contour line.

The Tribunal’s third concern is that GSI has only delineated areas impacted by its so-
called indicator parameters, i.e., barium and TPH.” As the figure at paragraph 398
above for Coca 8 shows (see also paragraph 471 below), GSI did not delineate areas
impacted by what it qualifies as “background metals issues” or areas where metal
concentrations exceed regulatory limits but no indicator parameter was found. Sample
point CO08-4M-05B demonstrates this flaw with respect to its “background metals” and
indicator parameter approach.

GSI indicates that sample CO08-4M-05B in the figure at paragraph 398 above,
presents a background metals issue in the layer between 1 to 2 meters. Since the
nickel value for that sample at that depth is 53 mg/kg, there is an exceedance at that
point both under the agricultural and the sensitive ecosystems limits,”°° and GSI should
have delineated around that exceedance point, which it has not done. Further, this
sample location also serves to disprove GSI’s indicator parameter theory. Sample
CO08-4M-05B in the layer between 1 to 2 meters has a barium value of 310 mg/kg,

GSI ER1, § 181(1). GSI explained its indicator parameter theory as follows: “[For the]
characterization of oilfield-related soil impacts, the IEMS soil test results for the primary
indicators of oilfield materials (i.e., barium for drilling mud; TPH for crude oil; soil electrical
conductance for produced water) were compared to Ecuador regulatory criteria for the relevant
land use. The presence of other chemicals in the soil, in the absence of a primary indicator (e.g.,
nickel in the absence of elevated barium or TPH), cannot be caused by an oilfield material and
was therefore not retained for further investigation” (emphasis added). GSI further stated: “In
simple terms, there cannot be an impact by drilling mud, without drilling mud (as indicated by
barium), and there cannot be an impact by crude oil without crude oil (as indicated by TPH). The
additional chemicals specified in the regulations serve to assess the other constituents (i.e., ‘the
cream’) in the spilled material, but they are not reliable to identify the source and/or delineate the
spilled material”. GSI ER2, p. 18, 9 45(d).

which is below regulatory limits. However, the barium value in the layer between 0 and
1 meters at that same location is above regulatory criteria (i.e., 830 mg/kg).”°°

c. _ Tribunal’s approach to determining the extent of soil contamination

Having determined that it cannot use IEMS’s models and that GSI’s methodology is
affected by certain deficiencies, the Tribunal will now outline its own approach to assess
the extent of impacted areas and volumes of contaminated soils. Doing so, the Tribunal
relies on all of the elements in the record, including evidence and observations
gathered during the Site Visit, which it considers can usefully inform its analysis, in the
exercise of its discretion in matters of evidence and quantification of damages.

In application of the regulatory and land use criteria as set forth in paragraphs 324 and
343 above, the Tribunal starts by determining all exceedance points for a particular site
as they arise from the sample results provided by the Parties.” It then assesses
whether the contamination can be attributed (at least partly) to the Consortium, it being
recalled that (i) fault is not required, (ii) causation is presumed, the Consortium being
exonerated if it proves that the harm was caused by force majeure, the victim or a third
party (including prior and subsequent operators), and (iii) a finding of fault can lead to
the partial attribution of pre-Consortium harm to the Consortium (for instance, with
respect to the Consortium’s mismanagement of pits built by preceding operators).
Where harm is attributed to the Consortium, it then engages in delineating the impacted
areas.

For sites delineated by GSI, the Tribunal adjusts as necessary GSI’s impacted areas
obtained through linear interpolation by extending them to the next “clean” delineation
sample (i.e., a sample showing no exceedance under applicable regulatory criteria),
where an appropriate “clean” sample exists. Where the Tribunal considers that
insufficient delineation samples were taken (such as for example in the area in
proximity to Coca 8 sample CO08-4M-03 in the figure reproduced at paragraph 398
above), the Tribunal adopts GSI’s set distance (for instance, 8 meters at Payamino 23
and 11 meters at Coca 8), if that distance appears sufficiently protective of the

environment. Otherwise, the Tribunal extends that distance as it considers appropriate
in the light of all of the circumstances.

For sites not delineated by GSI, the Tribunal seeks to take into consideration all
information in the record. Where a number of samples are clustered in a given area, the
Tribunal calculates the impacted area on the basis of the scale of the maps, while also
considering site features and local topography.

For sites not delineated by GSI but showing discrete exceedance points, the Tribunal
also considers site features and local topography, but mostly applies a set radius
around the exceedance point to determine a circular impacted area. The length of the
radius depends on various factors, such as the type of contaminant, the level of
contamination, the location of the exceedance point, the land use, local topography and
proximity to human settlements. Thus, the radius is for instance larger for heavy metals
than TPH exceedances due to the increased mobility of the former. The radius is also
larger for higher than for lower levels of contamination, or if the exceedance is located
in a sensitive ecosystem as opposed to on a platform.

In general, the Tribunal applies a 5-meter radius for TPH exceedances (amounting to
an impacted area of approximately 80 m?) and an 8-meter radius for heavy metal
exceedances, including barium (amounting to an impacted area of approximately
200 m?). It considers that these radiuses are adequately protective of the environment.
It, however, also takes into consideration that GSI itself sometimes applied slightly
larger distances (see, for instance, above paragraph 401; 11 meters at Coca 8, and
8 meters at Payamino 23). As stated above, the radiuses are thus increased as
appropriate at certain sites.

On that basis, the Tribunal establishes the impacted area for each site. To calculate the
volume of contaminated soil, it then multiplies the impacted area by the depth of the
contamination, rounding-up the depth to the next meter. Doing so, it seeks to take
account of differences in contamination per layer where appropriate. For instance, if the
impacted area in the layer between 0 and 1 meter is 200 m? and the impacted area in
the layer between 1 and 2 meters is 80 m?, the total volume of contaminated soil would
amount to 280 m*. Where feasible and practicable, the Tribunal calculates total volumes
of contaminated soil on the basis of layer-by layer values in an effort to avoid over-

191

A416.

417.

798

estimating such volumes.’*° However, the Tribunal does not always enter into this level
of detail. For instance, where the impacted area of the top layer is smaller than the
impacted area in a lower layer (and so, perforce, must be removed and remediated
along with the larger contaminated area that lies below), or where the difference of
impacted areas between layers is not significant, the Tribunal simply multiplies the
largest impacted area by the maximum depth of contamination.

4.5 Remediation costs for contaminated soils
4.5.1 Parties’ positions

Ecuador calculates the remediation costs by (i) increasing the volume of the compacted
clayey soils by a 30% volumetric expansion factor, (ii) applying different costs per cubic
meter according to three remediation technologies depending on whether the soil is
polluted with TPH only, heavy metals only, or a mixture of both, (iii) adding other costs
for studies, remedial design, logistics, transportation, replenishment of excavated areas,
safety measures, management and consulting costs, reforestation and environmental
monitoring, and (iv) adding a contingency factor.’°°

Relying on international price comparisons and in particular costs for soil remediation
charged by companies in the United States of America, Ecuador envisages ex situ
bioremediation for soils mostly contaminated with hydrocarbons at a unit cost of
USD 280/ms:5° ex situ controlled confinement for soils only contaminated with heavy
metals at a unit cost of USD 320/ms:°"' and ex situ soil washing for soils contaminated
both with hydrocarbons and heavy metals at a unit cost of USD 240/ms.* It rejects

Burlington’s proposal to treat and dispose of contaminated soils on site as contrary to
the principle of full restoration enshrined in the 2008 Constitution.°°

On that basis, Ecuador estimates the total volume of contaminated soil at 654,687 m?
and claims total costs of USD 790,465,298, amounting to an average unit cost of
USD 1,220 per cubic meter.®*

Burlington contends that Ecuador's remediation costs have no factual basis, and are
based on wholly unnecessary remediation technologies and cost elements when
equally effective and less costly methods are available, in Ecuador, from Ecuadorian
companies.*® Burlington calculates remediation costs by (i) identifying sites exceeding
regulatory criteria, (ii) measuring the areas requiring remediation, (iii) evaluating
available remediation technologies, (iv) selecting the appropriate remediation
technology, (v) creating a site-specific preliminary engineering design, and (vi)
calculating the total costs based on local prices.°

With respect to remediation technologies, GSI observes that technologies used in the
Oriente region to remediate oil spills include (i

) on site bioremediation, such as
landfarming, composting or biopiles, (ii) off site treatment and disposal, and (iii) a
combination of both.®°’ Among these, it retained off site treatment and disposal.®°® For

list published by the Ministry of the Environment of companies licensed to clean-up
contaminated sites, remediation contractor websites, direct information from local contractors,
and the price list from the Camara de la Construccién de Quito. In addition to identifying
remediation contractors providing on site remediation services, GSI also listed various
contractors offering off site treatment and disposal, including Ecuambiente Consulting Group
Cia. Ltda., PECS IECONSTA S.A., GROWER Group S.A., GOGEMINPA Cia. Ltda., and

confined in pits on site.*""

 

421. In addition to inflating the cost for soil treatment and disposal,®"* Burlington contends
that Ecuador includes unnecessary transportation costs to a transfer station,®"* inflates
backfilling costs,°"* and applies excessive mark ups and contingency.*'® Relying on the
“upper-range” costs of local contractors, Burlington calculates unit costs of USD 80/m*
for off site treatment and disposal (rounded up to USD 100/ms);8'® USD 0.40/m3/km for
transportation; USD 3/m for backfill material; USD 2.50/m’ for excavator rental; and
USD 800/day for front loader and bulldozer rental.*"’ Burlington also includes pre-
design assessment costs (including for additional soil sampling and testing, as well as
travel costs):°"° a base cost of USD 20,000 per site for permitting and reporting; and a
contingency ranging from 20% (for sites with no potential delineation or access issues)
to 30% (for sites with both delineation and access issues).°"°

422. In total, Burlington calculates an average all-in unit cost for off site landfill disposal of
USD 260/m%, which is comparable to and mid-way between the average cost in Europe
other technologies, mainly because they are ineffective in clayey soils, such as in-situ soil vapor
extraction, on site soil washing, bioventing, enhanced biodegradation, or passive remediation.

of USD 303/m? and in the United States of America of USD 218/m®.®”° On that basis,
Burlington arrives at a total cost of USD 10,513,000 for the remediation of the 17 sites
where it identified exceedances, including closing four open pits and abandoning seven
wells®" (although Burlington insists that it is only responsible for remediation at Yuralpa
Pad A for USD 110,000 and Jaguar 1 for USD 213,000, in addition to the four pit
closures and the seven well abandonments for a total of USD 1,091,000).°

4.5.2 Discussion

First, the Tribunal must decide whether to apply local or international prices. Contrary to
Burlington’s computations, Ecuador's remediation costs are mostly based on
international prices charged by international contractors. Ecuador’s expert, IEMS,
rejects the use of Ecuadorian contractors because it claims that they are unable to

“provide all of the services required for remediation in compliance with standard[s]

9823

which truly protect the environment’ and because of the extraordinary amount of

remediation under Ecuador's background value case:

“the reason we didn’t choose Ecuadorian contractors, is because the job
that we envisaged, that we costed, is a job that has not been done in
Ecuador yet [...] It’s a job at a level that really has not been done very

much in the world. No one has worked those standards before”.°*

In fact, the volumes of soil requiring remediation fall significantly below Ecuador's
estimates (be it under its background value or its regulatory criteria case). Moreover,

The cost for plugging and abandonment of inactive oil wells is estimated by Burlington at
USD 100,000 per well. GSI ER1, App. H, p. H.12.

amount of USD 395,000 for the remediation of Jaguar 1, which, in addition to the USD 213,000
for which Burlington accepts liability (Area 3T), includes the remediation costs for the
contamination in Area 2M, which Burlington attributes to pre-Consortium activities. See: GSI

the type of remediation activities contemplated here are routinely undertaken in the
Oriente region.®”° Therefore, the Tribunal sees no reason not to use local prices.

Second, the Tribunal must assess whether the remediation must be processed on or off
site. Off site remediation appears the more environmentally protective technique. As
GSI confirmed, it is indeed used in the Oriente region in about 50% of cases.*° On the
basis of the Site Visit and the information on local contractors in the record,®” the
Tribunal is satisfied that qualified remediation contractors are available in El Coca and
its surroundings which can handle the volumes of contaminated soils off site. °° For
these reasons, the Tribunal decides in favor of off site remediation by local contractors.

Third, as to remediation technology, RAOHE Annex 8, which relates to the treatment of
wastes, indicates in its sub-section on non-hazardous wastes, that soils and
drillings/cuttings contaminated with crude must be remediated through bioremediation
or landfarming.%° The regulations are silent about treatment of heavy metals
contamination, but Burlington agrees with Ecuador's view that controlled confinement is
the proper technology for soils contaminated with heavy metals (although Burlington
favors on site confinement, which the Tribunal rejects for the reasons just mentioned)
and that soils contaminated with crude be treated off site, for instance, through

contaminated both with TPH and heavy metals, the Tribunal accepts Ecuador's
suggestion of off site soil washing, especially in light of the fact that this kind of

technology has also been applied by other operators in the Oriente region."

Accordingly, the following remediation technologies appear the most appropriate in the
present circumstances: ex situ controlled confinement of soils contaminated with heavy

metals; ex situ bioremediation of soils contaminated with crude; and ex situ soil washing
for soils contaminated both with crude and heavy metals.

On that basis and taking into account all relevant facts and evidence in the exercise of
its discretion in matters of damage quantification, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion
that an average all-in unit cost of USD 300/m® is appropriate in the present
circumstances. This unit cost includes all cost items, including pre-design,
transportation, additional sampling, backfilling, mark-ups etc, but for a contingency
which the Tribunal applies in a range of 20 to 30%. The percentage of the contingency
factor depends on whether there are particular remediation challenges in terms of
accessibility or exposure issues, such as difficulties in the terrain, larger distances
between exceedance points and platform or access road, or proximity to streams and
human settlements. Thus, the Tribunal typically applies a 20% contingency to
exceedances on platforms and a 30% contingency to exceedance points off platform,
unless the latter present no challenges in terms of accessibility or exposure. The all-in
unit price used by the Tribunal is applied to volumes of soil as extracted. The Tribunal
did not add additional volumes of soil to take account of a possible volumetric
expansion, since the all-in unit price already accounts for such expansion.

4.6 Site review
4.6.1 Preliminary remarks

In application of the standards established above, the Tribunal will now review
Ecuador’s soil contamination claim site by site. Although Ecuador included in its claim
for soil contamination the removal of the mud pits, the Tribunal will address that claim
separately.

Ecuador investigated a total of 74 sites, sometimes modelling two platforms together.*?
IEMS collected a total of 2,950 soil samples to assess the environmental condition in
the Blocks, 2,769 in Block 7 and 181 in Block 21.°%* Under its regulatory criteria case,
Ecuador submits that the impacted area in Block 7 and 21 totals 414,506.14 m? and

This is the case for Gacela CPF and Gacela 1/8, Payamino CPF and Payamino 1, Yuralpa CPF

and Yuralpa Pad F, which were modelled together by IEMS. Revised Attachment 35 to IEMS

that a total of 851,093.75 m? of soil must be remediated.®** Ecuador's total claim for soil
contamination for the regulatory criteria case amounts to USD 790,465,298.°°°

The Tribunal notes that Ecuador does not claim any soil remediation at Payamino 9,
Payamino 13, Payamino 18, Zorro, Yuralpa Pad B, Puerto Napo and Waponi-Ocatoe.®**
Neither does it seek soil remedition if regulatory criteria apply at Coca 7, Payamino 6,
Payamino 19, Gacela 3, Lobo 2, Lobo 4, Oso 2, Oso 3, Oso A and Yuralpa
CPF/Pad F.®” In sum, Ecuador claims for soil remediation at 56 sites.

In addition to relying on IEMS samples, Burlington’s experts from GSI collected an
additional 535 soil samples, 482 in Block 7 and 53 in Block 21.°% Burlington disputes
any liability for Ecuador’s soil remediation claims, although it recognizes that 37,555 m*
of non-pit soil may require remediation for a total cost of USD 9,748,000 at 17 sites.°°°
Burlington identifies six principal sites, namely Payamino 2/8, Mono 1/CPF,
Payamino 1, Gacela 1/8, Coca 8 and Jaguar 1, where more than 1,000 m° of soil may
potentially require remediation.™° Burlington also identifies eleven additional sites that
may require remediation of minor quantities of contaminated soil, namely Coca 1, Coca
4, Coca 6, Payamino 23, Coca CPF, Gacela 2, Jaguar 7/8, Mono Sur, Payamino 4 and
Yuralpa Pad A."

Burlington acknowledges its liability for the “reasonable costs of remediating the
pockets of exceedances at the two sites that are possibly attributable to the
Consortium”, namely USD 323,000 to remediate Yuralpa Pad A and Jaguar Area 3T,

Id., lines 44, 48, 54, 62, 66 and 67 (Exh. E-500). This exclusion is explained by the fact that
IEMS excluded exceedance points from its modelling exercise in (i) clusters where the values
did not exceed background values, (ii) clusters where two sample locations were at a distance
beyond 500 meters, and (iii) layers with less than three contaminated samples. See: IEMS ER3,

since it could not “definitively link harm to non-Consortium activities” at those sites. In

addition, Burlington accepts to pay USD 68,000 to close four open and unused pits
(Coca 4, Coca 8 and Payamino 15). Moreover, Burlington accepts to pay USD 700,000
for costs linked to the abandonment of seven platforms (Céndor Norte, Gacela 2,
Gacela 3, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 7/8, Jaguar 9 and Lobo 4).™° Accordingly, Burlington
accepts to pay a total of USD 1,091,000.

The Tribunal will now review the circumstances of the 56 sites for which Ecuador claims
soil remediation, starting with the sites in Block 7/CPUF (4.6.2) before addressing those
in Block 21 (4.6.3). Doing so, it will first address claims for non-pit soil and turn to pit soil
in the following section. In this context, the Tribunal notes that GSI states that a number
of IEMS samples were in reality taken from pits and/or misplaced by IEMS because of
inaccuracies in the assignation of coordinates or in the labelling.** Taking into account
the Parties’ and their experts’ explanations,™® the Tribunal will decide these matters on
a case by case basis where relevant.

Although Burlington disputes that the Consortium caused any exceedances at Coca 1,
it accepts that there is contamination at that site covering 520 m? in Area 1MT and

70 m? in Area 2T (see figure in paragraph 437).°*”

well workover in 2005,°°° although Burlington generally argues that exceedances are
linked to drilling activities pre-dating the Consortium’s time,®°° as evidenced in part by
the fact that there is no pit at Coca 1 implying that drilling muds were discharged into
the environment by prior opertators.°°”

The Tribunal accepts Burlington’s evidence and submissions with respect to Area 1MT.
Considering the depth of the exceedances (up to 2.6 meters) and the fact that there is
no pit at Coca 1, it finds that contamination in Area 1MT is associated to drilling
activities and was thus caused by prior operators. Burlington has thus succeeded in
rebutting the presumption of causation with respect to the contamination found in that
area. By contrast, Burlington failed to convincingly rebut the presumption that it caused
the TPH exceedance in Area 2T.

GSI applied linear interpolation to calculate the impacted area,®** placing certain dirty
borings back into the soil during its stepping out procedure®® — although the Tribunal
notes that GSI’s delineation samples bear relatively low TPH levels.*°

On that basis and in accordance with the guidelines established above (sections 4.4.3.c
and 4.5.2 above), the Tribunal determines that 200 m? in Area 2T are impacted. Since
remediation is required up to 2 meters depth, the total volume of contaminated soil
amounts to 400 m%, for a cost of USD 120,000. Adding a 20% contingency (see
paragraph 428 above), the total cost for which Burlington is liable amounts to
USD 144,000 for Coca 1.

involved the use of chemicals. Well Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated 1992 and 2012, Coca

Coca 9 flow line reaching the CPF manifold and an unreported spill at the washing tank
that occurred on 31 August 2008.°” These appear unrelated to the exceedances
identified above because of their location. It is nonetheless noteworthy that the 2006
biennial audit identified a non-conformity with respect to wastewater discharges.™ It is
further of particular relevance that, between 1989 and 1996, Petroproduccién
permanently discharged produced water, without skimming the oil, into the environment
from the pits to the south of the CPF into the creek flowing southeast towards the Chala
swamp where Area 2T is located."

While Mr. Saltos indicated that Oryx discontinued this practice and the area was
remediated in 1997," he also stated that oil seeping continued thereafter, and that this
state of affairs persisted during the Consortium’s operatorship, and that the Consortium
did not reach an agreement with Mr. Chala because of the takeover in 2009.%*
Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that the Consortium is partially responsible for the

See: CMCC, § 448. The following is stated in a 1994 environmental assessment prepared for
Oryx: “The produced water is gravity discharged from a pipe approximately 200mm in diameter
to two lined earthen retention ponds for disposal into a natural drainage channel. No oil
skimming equipment is in place within the pond system. An oil collection system comprised of a
series of weirs made of palm leaves is utilized within the drainage channel. The oil is manually
skimmed from the pools created by the weirs. The output of the weirs flows down the hillside into
a creek which flows into the Rio Huashito. The system has been successful in the collection of
oil; however, floating oil is still lost into the creek. Oil contaminated material is stored adjacent to
the channel and requires regular disposal”. Ecomapa/Western Oilfield Environmental Services
Ltd., Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company Coca-Payamino Field, May
1994, p. 30 (Exh. CE-CC-12). See also: Saltos WS1, 4 290, 294; Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG),

Saltos WS1, § 297-298.

Mr. Saltos stated the following: “Unfortunately, it continued discharging water from the API
separator, and this water may have had traces of hydrocarbons that ended up in the swamp.
And, logically, they continued to go through the swamp until they reached Chala. And that area,
as it is lower lying, and cannot pass directly to the other side of the road, would become
sedimented and contamination accumulated there. When | lived in Chala, we tried to reach an
agreement with Chala, we tried, with him, to carry out a remediation project. Unfortunately, 2009
came and we could not execute it. That's how it was”. Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 139:17-23

environmental condition in the Chala swamp. In the exercise of its discretion in matters
of the quantification of damages, it determines that Burlington shall pay 50% of the
remediation costs.

450. In addition, the Tribunal sees no elements in the record to rebut the presumption that
Burlington caused the contamination at the other exceedance points mentioned in
paragraph 447. Therefore, Burlington is liable to pay the full costs of remediation of
these other areas.

451. With respect to Area 2T in the Chala swamp, two additional difficulties arise. In this
context, it is useful to refer to GSI’s impacted area designation in the Chala swamp:**

that IEMS sampled south of the culvert,®° whereas Burlington argues that IEMS
sampled north of the culvert.®°° The issue was discussed during the Site Visit. While
IEMS reiterated that it sampled south of the culvert,**’ GSI explained that IEMS did not
use a GPS but a tape measure to locate its samples and that one point was missed
causing a discrepancy of 100 meters. In addition, GSI stated that it found no
indication of sampling to the south of the culvert, that GSI itself took verification
samples there and found no exceedances, and that TPH exceedances in fact exist to
the north of the culvert where GSI sampled.® On that basis, GSI argues that “both the
geographic and the soil data tell us that we were in the right location”.°°°

Because IEMS did not use state of the art (and in fact commonly used) technology to
locate its samples, the Tribunal is inclined to rely on GSIl’s location. Further, the
Tribunal notes that GSI places IEMS’s samples where the creek flowing from the API
separator reaches the swamp area.” Accordingly, the Tribunal will work on the basis
of GSI's locations for IEMS samples.

The second difficulty relates to the fact that Petroamazonas built a pipeline in Area 2T
after IEMS collected its samples in 2012. Because the right of way built by
Petroamaonas partly passes through Area 2T, the Tribunal discarded from its analysis

The Tribunal notes that the maps provided by IEMS in its third and fourth reports indicate
sample locations south of the culvert: IEMS ER3, Annex C, Coca CPF corrected, p. 38; IEMS.
ER4, Att. 38, Coca CPF, p. 46.

GSI ER1, pp. 53-54 and App. D, Annex D.2, p. 14. GSI explained that on the one hand, IEMS
Annex | locates these samples south of the culvert, whereas the IEMS GIS database places
these samples north of the culvert. GSI therefore relied on the GIS database, since these
locations match the locations plotted in IEMS’s second report and the site features in the
swamp. See also: Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 155:3-14 (Tribunal, Connor at Coca CPF); C-

various sample locations, the remediation of which was superseded by the construction
of the pipeline.

On that basis and applying the guidelines set out earlier (section 4.4.3.c and in
particular paragraph 414), the Tribunal determined the following impacted areas: 480
m2 in Area 2T,*** 200 mé? for the cadmium exceedance southwest of the pit area and
200 m? for the cadmium exceedance north of the API separator, for a total impacted
area of 880 m?. The total soil volume is 1,480 m%: 480 m° in Area 2T, 400 ms for the
cadmium exceedance southwest of the pit area and 600 m® for the cadmium
exceedance north of the API separator.

In application of the Tribunal’s approach explained above (section 4.5.2) and adding a
30% contingency (see paragraph 428 above), the remediation cost for Area 2T is
USD 187,200, of which Burlington must bear USD 93,600. Adding a 20% contingency
to the cadmium exceedances, the remediation cost for these locations is USD 360,000.
Accordingly, Burlington is liable to pay USD 453,600 for soil remediation at Coca CPF.

c. Coca4

Ecuador submits that the impacted area in Coca 4 extends over 2,732 m? and claims
the remediation of 3,551.60 m® of soil, for a total cost of USD 3,617,276." Although
Burlington disputes that the Consortium caused any exceedances at Coca 4, it accepts

The Tribunal discards the following samples: 07-CPFCO-SEM18-R, 07-CPFCO-SEM21-R and

07-CPFCO-SEM22-R. Because the Tribunal does not have the exact location of the right-of-
way, and because in the doubt the burden falls on Burlington, the Tribunal maintained in its
analysis the following samples: 07-CPFCO-SEM13-R and MS-COC-C2-CPF.2-0,5. The Tribunal
stresses that the same approach would have been adopted by the Tribunal if it had considered
IEMS'’s samples to be located south of the culvert, since the right of way also traverses that
area.

The Tribunal determined the impacted areas as follows: 150 m? around sample MS-COC-C2-
CPF.2-0,5 due to the high TPH level; 100 m? around sample 07-CPFCO-SEMO09-R(0,0-0,3)m
due to the high TPH level and the site features of the swamp; 80 m? around sample 07-CPFCO-
SEM13-R(0,0-0,3)m due to the relatively low TPH level; and 150 m? around samples 07-
CPFCO-SEM2-R(0,0-0,5)m, 07-CPFCO-SEM4-R(0,5-1,0)m, 07-CPFCO-SEM4-R(0,0-0,3)m, 07-

By reference to the approach set out above (section 4.3.2.c) and applying sensitive
ecosystem use for Area 1M,°°° the Tribunal identified barium, cadmium and nickel
exceedances in Area 1M.°°

The potentially impacted area calculated by GSI which the Tribunal will use as a basis
for its delineation (see section 4.4.3.c and especially paragraph 411 above) is illustrated
below:*

Although IEMS acknowledged that lands adjoining the platform are used for agricultural

activities, GSI conceded that secondary forest borders the eastern part of the platform, where
Area 1M is located. In any event, the Tribunal observes that the satellite imagery of 2010
suggests that secondary forest surrounded the platform and that land use changes have
therefore occurred thereafter. See: C-PHB, § 130; GSI ER1, App. L, L.03, p. 6; IEMS ER4, Att.

drilling activities that pre-date the Consortium.°” There is no specific record of historical
spills.°% Ecuador's witness Mr. Solis testified that Perenco did not report a spill at the
production pipeline on 10 September 2006 affecting approximately 4 m%.°° Accordingly,
the Tribunal considers that Burlington failed to rebut the presumption that the
Consortium caused the exceedances, which appear linked to an overflow of the
oil/water separator rather than to drilling mud discharges, in particular since there are
eight closed pits at that site and all exceedances are at a relatively shallow depth
(<0.7m). Accordingly, Burlington is liable to remedy all exceedances at Coca 4.

On that basis and in application of the approach discussed above (see sections 4.4.3.c

E-0,5 from 20 m? to 100 m2.°°° One must then add 80 m? for the cadmium exceedances
between the oil/water separator and the mud pit, and 400 m? around the nickel
exceedances,°” for a total impacted area of 580 m? and total volume of soil of 580 m°.
Adding a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428 above), the total remediation cost for
which Burlingtom is liable amounts to USD 226,200 for Coca 4.

GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.4.3. However, since all samples with the reference “SEH” (for
instance, SEH1, SEH3, SEH4) are located in the swale of Area 1MT, the Tribunal worked on the
assumption that sample SEH2 is also located there.

demonstrated that the Consortium conducted a well workover at that site involving
drilling and the use of chemicals, which could also be the cause of heavy metal
exceedances.°"® The Tribunal further notes that there was a spill in 2006 and another
one of 10 barrels in 2007.°"° In addition, GSI stated that a remediation program was in
place when the Consortium took over the operations, but that it was never completed
due to unsuccessful negotiations with local communities to gain access to the stream
area. In light of the fact that the Consortium assumed the remediation program for the
1999 spill, but that it failed to conduct the remediation, and considering the 2002
workover and the 2006 and 2007 spills, the Tribunal holds the Consortium fully
responsible for the environmental condition in Area 1MT.

In application of the guidelines set earlier (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal
reaches the following conclusion. Since GSl’s delineation does not include all
exceedance points in Area 1MT,%' and in light of the high TPH values reaching the
creek to the southeast of the swale, the Tribunal determined the impacted area to
extend to 1,100 m? and the total volume of soil to be remediated to amount to 1,100 m°.
Considering a contingency of 30% (see paragraph 428 above), the remediation cost
amounts to USD 429,000 for Coca 6.

e. Coca8

Ecuador submits that an area of 12,457 m? is impacted at Coca 8 and that
36,571.60 m of soil must be remediated, for a total cost of USD 34,628,076."
Burlington argues that the contamination found in Coca 8 is attributable to drilling

knowledge whether Petroproduccién remediated any spill at Coca 6. Saltos WS1, 9§ 282-286.

There are various land uses around Coca 8. With reference to the Tribunal’s approach
explained above (section 4.3.2.c), the platform falls within the industrial land use
criteria. The area northwest of the platform, along the entry road is used for agricultural
purposes. All other areas surrounding the platform are properly classified as sensitive
ecosystem.°” Applying these criteria, there are no exceedances on the platform and no
exceedances to the north of the platform.°*"

Further, applying the sensitive ecosystem criteria to the other areas, the Tribunal
identified numerous barium, cadmium and nickel exceedances in the area visited by the
Tribunal south of the three mud pits bordering the southern edge of the platform, which
includes the areas designated by GSI as Area 4M, immediately adjacent to the mud
pits, and Area 1M further downhill.°% The highest barium level reaches 23,368.3 mg/kg
at the sample location 7-COC-08-TE-104P.°* In addition, there are various barium,
cadmium and nickel exceedances to the west of the platform and the pit area.°**

GSI concedes that secondary forest is immediately adjacent to the platform, with agriculture 50
meters to the north, 100 meters northwest and 120 meters to the south. GSI ER1, App. L.6.1,
p.6. The Tribunal did not give much weight to the statement in 2007 of the landowner Mr.
Notefio, that the lands around the platform were destined for agriculture, in light of the
explanation by Mr. Saltos that the areas immediately surrounding the platform cannot be used
by private owners while oilfield operations are ongoing: “In addition, this area over here is not
used because compensation was paid previously by the private company for the operation of the
platform. And while the operation of the platform is ongoing, they cannot use it”. Tr. Site Visit

The Coca 8 well was drilled by CEPE in 1991 and the Consortium operated the platform
from 2002 until the takeover in 2009.°° There is evidence of a 150 barrel crude spill on
4 March 2000 under the operatorship of Kerr McGee due to equipment failure, which
affected an area of 600 m2, although 145 barrels were recovered.°* On the other hand,
there is no evidence of spills during the Consortium’s time or of workovers undertaken
by the Consortium.**’ As a result, the Tribunal considers that the exceedances must be
deemed due to the activities of prior operators.

As the related analysis will show (see paragraph 820 below), there is evidence that the
mud pits have been leaking into the surrounding environment, in particular in Areas 1M
and 4M. The Consortium was made aware of this situation at the latest in March 2007
when Mr. Notefio, the President of the Corazén de Oriente community, filed a
complaint.°°° The record does not show that the Consortium took action to mitigate the
harm and prevent it from spreading further.°°° As a result, the Tribunal finds that
Burlington shares a responsibility for this damage and must accordingly contribute 50%
to the cost of remediating it. This applies to the area south and west of the pits. By
contrast, the two barium exceedances to the west of the platform are unrelated to the
condition of the pits at issue and are, therefore, not attributable to Burlington.”°

Since GSI applied agricultural criteria, its delineation for Areas 1M and 4M does not

941

encompass all exceedance points.“"' With reference to the approach set out above

(sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal has thus adopted its own approach and finds
that the impacted area south of the pits amounts to 3,270 m? and the total volume of
contaminated soil 6,220 m%.° Considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428),
the total cost to remediate Areas 1M and 4M is USD 2,425,800.

The exceedance points to the west of the pits make up five discrete impacted areas of
1,000 m? in the aggregate (200 m? each) and a total volume of 1,000 m® of soil to be
remediated,*“* for a total cost of USD 390,000 with a contingency of 30% (see
paragraph 428).

The exceedance next to the oil/water separator impacted an area of 80 m? and requires
remediation of 160 m®, for a cost of USD 57,600 that includes a 20% contingency (see
paragraph 428).°*

To conclude, the total impacted area in Coca 8 is 4,350 m2; the total volume of soil to
be remediated is 7,380 m°; and the total cost of remediation of regular soil at Coca 8
amounts to USD 2,873,400, of which Burlington shall bear 50%, totalling
USD 1,436,700.

 

meters, including the nickel exceedance at sample point CO08-4M-05B and the cadmium
exceedance at sample point 7-COC-08-TE-103. In addition, the Tribunal extended the impacted
area to the west of sample point CO08-4M-07 by 8 meters. On that basis the Tribunal extended
the impacted area to 2,600 m? and the total volume of soil to 5,200 m. In Area 1M, the Tribunal
extended GSI’s delineation around sample 7-COC-08-251-MS-B from 110 m? to an impacted
area of 200 m? and a total volume of soil of 200 m®. It also slightly extended the area around
sample CO08-1M-1B from 90 m? to 120 m?, corresponding to 120 m? of contaminated soil, to
factor in the fact that GSI put dirty borings back into the ground at Coca 8. See: R-PHB, {{ 363-
365. Finally, the impacted area around sample 7-COC-08-251-MS-H was significantly expanded
from 10 m? to 350 m? and a volume of soil of 700 m%, in order to factor in the numerous
additional cadmium exceedances (7-COC-08-251-MS-I, 7-COC-08-TE-104, 7-COC-08-TE-105,
7-COC-08-TE-106, 7-COC-08-TE-108).

In accordance with the information in the previous note, the Tribunal determined an impacted
area of 2,600 m? and a total volume of soil of 5,200 m3 in Area 4M, and an impacted area of 670
m? and a total volume of soil of 1,020 m3 in Area 1M.

Ecuador submits that an area of 7,511 m? is impacted at Coca 9 requiring the
remediation of 16,789.50 m® of soil, for a total cost of USD 16,772,147." For its part,
Burlington argues that no remediation is called for at this site, since there are no
exceedances of any indicator parameters and the vanadium exceedance on the

northwestern corner of the platform is a “background metals issue”.°°

Coca 9 was drilled by Oryx in 1992 and 1993,°° and it remains in operation under
Petroamazonas. There are no records of historical spills at that site.°°° In its preliminary
assessment, IEMS identified discoloration of the floor in the northwestern corner of the
platform and signs of contamination in a marshy area located at the southeast corner of
the platform.’ The 2008 audit mentioned the lack of labelling of fuel tanks and
chemical products, the lack of signage concerning industrial safety or the handling of
chemicals, the lack of maintenance of the perimeter ditch, the unmarked oil well, and

evidence of environmental harm, they suggest faulty conduct, which reinforces a finding
of a causation. In light of these facts and of Burlington’s argument described above,
Burlington cannot be held to have rebutted the presumption that the Consortium caused

the harm found at that site.

Applying industrial use criteria to the platform pursuant to its general approach (see
section 4.3.2.c), the Tribunal finds an exceedance with a relatively high level of
vanadium (385 mg/kg) on the northwestern corner of the platform. In reliance on its
methodology explanined above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal calculated an
impacted area of 200 m? and a volume of soil to be remediated of 400 m‘, for a total
cost of USD 144,000 which includes a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428).°°°

Considering sensitive ecosystem land use criteria for off platform locations,°™ there is
one nickel exceedance to the southeast of the platform, amounting to an impacted area

Applying its approach on land use (section 4.3.2.c), the Tribunal observes that there are
no exceedances on the platform. By contrast, using sensitive ecosystem criteria to off
platform locations,®® the Tribunal identified a TPH exceedance and various barium and
cadmium exceedances to the north of the northeastern corner of the platform.°*'

There are no historical records of spills°™

and there is no allegation that the Consortium
conducted any well workovers at that site.°* The 2008 audit apparently did not assess
Coca 10/16, although Annex B contains some pictures of the site and commentaries,
for instance, that the perimeter drain is improperly maintained or that the grease trap is

d,°* which increases the risk that contaminants flow over the

insufficiently cleane
platform into the surrounding environment.*® Because the exceedance points are in the
vicinity of the grease trap and because any overflows from that oil/water separator flow
directly into the swale identified by GSI as Area 1MT,%©° the Tribunal finds that the

Consortium is liable for damage to this site.

Ecuador has not increased its claim for Coca 10/16 after GSI’s site investigation,
although two of GSI’s samples show additional exceedances in Area 1MT. Therefore,
the Tribunal grants Ecuador's request that 175 m* of soil be remediated. With a 30%
contingency (see paragraph 428), the total remediation cost for this site is USD 68,250
for Coca 10/16.

GSI concedes that secondary forest is “immediately adjacent to” the platform at Coca 10/16 “and
beyond”. GSI ER1, App. L.08.1, p. 5.

Ecuador claims USD 36,483,570 for the remediation of 37,329.50 ms of soil from an
area of 11,485 m2.°” Burlington initially classified Coca 18/19 as one of five priority
sites for potential soil remediation with a possibly impacted area of 160 m2.°” After
reviewing the pit closure report for Coca 19, GSI concluded that the exceedances in the
area designated as Area 1M were in fact drilling muds disposed in two off platform
auxiliary pits.°° On this basis, Burlington opposes this claim.

Coca 18 was drilled by Kerr McGee in July 2001 and Coca 19 by Perenco in December
2003.8 As will be discussed in the analysis of mud pits, when the Consortium drilled
the Coca 19 well in 2003, it deposited drilling wastes in four pits adjacent to that well
and in two auxiliary pits located just beyond the southwestern corner of the platform, the
latter two corresponding to Area 1M.°™ Therefore, the Tribunal will address the content
of the auxiliary pits as part of its analysis of mud pits.

In addition to alleged exceedances in Area 1M, the Tribunal identified one barium
exceedance on the platform next to the Coca 18 well.°°
Kerr McGee in 2001, the Tribunal notes that the Consortium conducted some

workovers at that well.°®° It, therefore, holds the Consortium liable to remediate that

While that well was drilled by

exceedance. In application of its methodology (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), it admits an
impacted area of 80 m2°’ and a volume of 80 mé, for a total cost of USD 28,800 for
Coca 18/19, taking into account a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428).

Finally, applying agricultural land criteria to off platform locations, there are no
additional exceedances in areas surrounding the platform.°® Therefore, besides the on
platform exceedance mentioned above and subject to the Tribunal’s analysis of the
mud pits, no additional remediation is required for Coca 18/19.

Considering the relatively low level of barium on industrial land (2031.8 mg/kg) and the fact that
the exceedance is centrally located on the platform, the Tribunal deems a 5 meter radius to be
sufficient in this case.

Burlington classifies Payamino 1 as a priority site, ie. one where it accepts the
existence of contamination potentially requiring remediation for a total cost not
exceeding USD 307,000.°* Burlington submits that the source of contamination in Area
1P is a concrete water basin removed in 2001, which thus predates the Consortium’s
operatorship. According to Burlington, remediating the 800 m® of potentially
contaminated soil would cost no more than USD 243,000.°™ Burlington also accepts
that 210 m® of soil potentially require remediation in Area 2MT for a total cost of
USD 64,000.°* Finally, Burlington rejects all other claims for remediation in Payamino
1/CPF, in particular by arguing that IEMS samples in Area 3MT are in reality misplaced
and were taken from Payamino 2/8.°% With respect to the sample collected close to the
exhaust stack of a diesel-powered compressor at Payamino CPF,°°’ GSI opined that
less than 20 liters (0.02 m*) of soot were collected “as a thin film on the ground surface”
and that the soils beneath were clean. This does not, in Burlington’s eyes, justify a
claim of over USD 5 million to remediate 5,373 mé of soil.

After Coca 1, Payamino 1 is the second oldest operating well in Block 7/CPUF. It was
drilled by BP in 1986 and evidence suggests that 13 workovers were conducted at that
well between 1991 and 2005, including by the Consortium.° The Payamino 1 well is
located north and approximately 30 meters downhill of the CPF, which was put in
operation between 1991 and 1992.

Before addressing the off platform exceedances in the areas designated by GSI as
Areas 1P, 2MT and 3MT, the Tribunal will address the on platform exceedance of TPH

(5,138 mg/kg) adjacent to the diesel-powered compressor at the CPF.'°° Since
Petroamazonas operated the compressor after the takeover without addressing that
situation, the Tribunal deems it correct to apportion the liability between the Consortium
and its successor and, in its discretion in assessing the evidence and quantifying
damages, finds that Burlington shall bear 50% of the remediation costs. Because the
impacted area appears to be localized, the Tribunal determines that remediation of
30 m*%, for a total cost of USD 10,800 including a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428),
is adequate and reasonable. Burlington shall thus pay 50% of that cost, i.e. USD 5,400.

Turning now to off platform locations, it is undisputed that sensitive ecosystem land use
criteria apply to areas surrounding Payamino 1/CPF, notably because this site is part of
a designated protected area under the SNAP system (see section 4.3.2.c above).'°"
On that basis, the Tribunal identified two TPH exceedances in Area 1P'°?
TPH and barium exceedances in Area 2MT.'° In light of the fact that IEMS confirmed
that it mislabeled samples 07-PAY28-SDB3-R and 07-PAY28-SDB4-R and that they
were indeed collected in Area 3MT at Payamino 1/CPF,'™ the Tribunal finds that TPH
and barium contamination has been shown also in Area 3MT.

In light of the fact that Area 1P hosted a former concrete produced water basin that was

GSI explained the following: “Area 1P, located directly south of the well platform, corresponds to
the former location of aboveground concrete basins used for management of produced water
from 1996 to 1999. Residual petroleum found in subsurface soils at this location is potentially
associated with leakage from the base of these former basins, which were removed from service
by 1999 and demolished in 2001. Soil test results indicate that the elevated TPH levels are
present beneath only a portion of the former footprint of the produced water basins”. GSI ER1,

that the exceedances were not caused by the Consortium but are liabilities of prior
operators. Accordingly, Burlington is not liable for the condition of Area 1P.

The situation is the opposite as concerns the catchment area labelled Area 2MT, which
appears to be a workover pit located some 120 meters southwest of the Payamino 1
platform in the proximity of the River Afango. This pit was unreported and thus served
as a concealed location to dump industrial wastes in the middle of a protected area

adjacent to a water body. GSI indicated that 13 workovers had been conducted at

1006 1007

Payamino 1 until 2005, including by the Consortium,"””’ which Mr. Saltos confirme
GSI opined that it was unable to determine the cause of the exceedances in Area
2MT.'°°8 Neither Burlington nor its key witness, Mr. Saltos, appeared to dispute that the
Consortium used that workover pit. Accordingly, the Tribunal holds Burlington liable to
remediate Area 2MT. By reference to the methodology set out above (sections 4.4.3.c
and 4.5.2), the impacted area is 500 m2,’ the total volume of soil 500 m®, for a total
cost of USD 195,000, which includes a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428).

Finally, Burlington argues that the samples showing TPH exceedances in Area 3MT
were mislocated, but does not provide an alternative explanation as to the possible
cause of these exceedances. Further, the spill record for Payamino CPF, including the
area formerly known as Payamino 22, both of which overlook Area 3MT, reveals
numerous spills during the Consortium’s operations, including an oil runoff from
Payamino 22 in 2002, a 0.1 barrel crude spill in 2004,'°"° a 2.4 barrel crude oil spill on

GSI ER1, App. K. See also: Payamino — 1 Well History (Exh. E-245). In particular, the

Mr. Saltos’ testimony on Payamino 1 workovers, see also: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1226:8-1235:12
(Cross, Saltos).

GSI indicated the following: “Consequently, the date of construction and use of this apparent
workover pit is unknown, based upon currently available information”. GSI ER1, {| 271(3).

GSI calculated a total impacted area of 210 mz, including 110 m? within the catchment area,
corresponding to a little more than half its size, and an additional 100 m? outside the area to
remediate the TPH exceedance at sample location 7-PAY-CPF-166-MS-Q. The Tribunal holds
that the entire catchment area must be remediated, amounting to 200 m2, and further increased
the impacted area outside to catchment area from 100 m? to 300 mz, in order to remediate the
entire northern flank outside of the catchment area.

and a 2009 crude spill
some 10 meters away from the CPF along the Payamino 19 flowline.'°"* These facts
support a determination that the exceedances were caused during the Consortium’s
operatorship, which Burlington has not rebutted. This view is reinforced if one looks to
the definition of “affected areas” in the settlement agreement of 11 May 2010 between
Mr. Jungal, Ms. Cardenas Hernandez and the Consortium, which includes “landslides
on the slope of well Payamino 22” and “erosion and sliding of the slope at Payamino
Station”."°>

In light of the high levels of TPH present and by reference to its approach explained
above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal determines a total impacted area of
400 m?, a total volume of soil of 1,000 m®,'°"° and a remediation cost of USD 390,000,
including a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428).

In conclusion, the Tribunal determines that Burlington must bear the remediation cost
for Areas 2MT and 3MT and half of the cost for the TPH exceedance at Payamino CPF,
for a total amount of USD 590,400 for Payamino 1/CPF.

Payamino 2/8 is one of the most contentious sites and the Parties have extensively
debated the potential causes for the environmental condition encountered in the
swampy area known as the Jungal swamp. The Tribunal will address Ecuador's
submissions on the pits in its analysis of mud pits below. Here it will only deal with the
off platform sampling locations to the west, north and east of the Payamino 2/8 platform
and adjoining pits.’ In its review, the Tribunal also considers the samples collected for
the Walsh report as GSI relies on these samples (shown as red boxes in the preceding
figure).'°*

It is undisputed that the land to the east of the Payamino 2/8 platform is located in a
designated protected area under the SNAP system that qualifies as sensitive
ecosystem.'°”> Burlington disputes, however, that the area to the west of the designated
area falls within that same category and calls for the application of agricultural land use
criteria. In accordance with its methodology (see section 4.3.2.c above), as the areas in
question are immediately adjacent to a designated protected area, the Tribunal will
apply the sensitive ecosystem criterion to all areas surrounding the platform (except for
the access road, where no samples were in any event taken).

On that basis, the Tribunal identified various TPH, barium and cadmium exceedances
in the area of the Jungal swamp identified by GSI as Area 2MT,'*° with the highest
TPH level reaching 10,661 mg/kg."°*” The Walsh samples identify numerous TPH and
barium exceedances, with TPH levels reaching 64’616 mg/kg and the highest barium

It is not seriously disputed that a major environmental incident occurred in connection
with the drilling of the Payamino 2 and Payamino 8 wells between 1987 and 1992. It
can be left open for present purposes whether it was caused by the discharge of test
crude into the Jungal swamp or by the rupture of the Payamino 2 pit.'”° In any event, it
occurred prior to the Consortium’s operatorship. While it is true that successive
operators did not indicate the presence of contamination at that site,'°° thus suggesting
that the area was remediated when Oryx so requested in 1994, the Tribunal notes that
Ecuador has provided no evidence of any remediation.’ Therefore, the Tribunal
cannot rule out that the environmental harm identified above was caused by prior
operators and continues to be present in the swamp until today.

Nonetheless, there are several reasons for the Tribunal to hold the Consortium partially
liable to remediate the exceedances in the Jungal swamp. First, there is contradictory
expert evidence generated on the Consortium’s behalf regarding the age of the crude
found in the swamp. On the one hand, a report by Griintech dated 2 June 2010
estimated that age to be 4 to 7 years, which suggests that the contamination occurred
during the Consortium’s time, although the report specified that exact dating was
impossible without a patron sample and that other factors influenced the dating

See, for instance: Reply, §§ 101-105. Ecuador points to various environmental audits conducted
by prior operators that do not mention the existence of an environmental liability in the Jungal
swamp. Laboratory result for water sample from swamp nearby Payamino 2& 8, 6 October 1992

take remedial actions without delay. Claimant has not even entertained the possibility that
Petroproduccion took such actions”. Reply, J 99; R-PHB, § 781.

procedure.'°” On the other hand, a report by Mr. Douglas from NewFields assessed
Griintech’s conclusion and opined that the rate of degradation of petroleum is “highly
variable” depending on numerous factors not considered by Griintech, and finally
concluded that any attempt to date the crude oil would be a guess and that it was

“equally as possible that the crude oil was released more than 20 years ago”.'°%*

Second, the Consortium was aware of claims of environmental pollution at the latest

since early 2007,"

when Mr. Eduardo Greta Cerda, Political Lieutnant of the Parrish
San Luis de Armenia, lodged a complaint with the Provincial Council of Orellana. That
council ordered an inspection which took place on 4 April 2007 and discovered “[o]n the
#02-08 platform (point 4) and to the side of it, a large area of approximately 20,000 m?
[..-] containing crude oil residues in large quantities”.'°*> Burlington's silence about that
inspection in these proceedings and its conclusion that crude oil was found on the
platform and to its eastern side are disturbing.'°°° The same is true of the fact that the
Consortium apparently took no immediate action and that no samples were taken for
the 2008 audit."°”

characterization of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8” following a renewed

Ecuador also pointed to a complaint by Mr. Jungal in 2005, which was discussed before an
Ombudsman with a Consortium lawyer in attendance. Mr. Saltos’ attempts to justify that the
Consortium took no action, on the grounds that Mr. Jungal always was a rather difficult person,
does not appear convincing. See: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1288:20-1289:12 (Cross, Saltos); R-PHB,

Even assuming that, as Mr. Saltos testified, neither the Consortium nor himself were notified of
the inspection or report of the Provincial Council, the report does confirm that the Consortium
could not have been unaware of the existence of crude on the platform. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG),

complaint by Mr. Jungal,'°%

states that “we [the Consortium] know the true extent of the
problem” just as Mr. Jungal. It continues saying that Petroamazonas’ health, safety and
environment department knows the existence, but not the location and extent of the
contamination, and that the local ombudsman knows the location but not the extent.
The memorandum then goes on setting out three “possible solutions”, namely (i) to
remedy the site, (ii) to confine the problem by buying the land, or (iii) to dismiss any
liability.°° About this last option, the memorandum is quite explicit:

“- very probably, Mr. Jungal would sue us before the [criminal] courts for
pollution (this crime has already been defined) and will seek multimillion
dollar compensation

- the State (Ministry of the Environment and/or Petroamazonas (sic)) will
force us to remedy the site under their conditions

- the cost will reach amounts very difficult to estimate now

- the reputational cost to Perenco is also going to be very high

- probably the State will assume that we are hiding many more damages

and will scrutinize the operations area in search of more damages and it

will probably find them.
This memorandum shows that the Consortium was aware of and concerned about the
existing liabilities in the Jungal swamp.'™' In 2010, it eventually reached a settlement
agreement with Mr. Jungal for an amount of USD 110,000, which agreement contained
a confidentiality clause." It is only thereafter that, on 11 June 2010, the Consortium
notified the Ecuadorian authorities of the existence of contamination in the Jungal

swamp. 1

These facts lead the Tribunal to conclude that the Consortium indeed played some role
in causing the environmental condition, or at least in not mitigating the harm when it
became aware of it in 2005 and 2007, a role which is much more important than what
Burlington would have the Tribunal believe. As a result, on the basis of the record and
in the exercise of its powers in the assessment of the evidence and in the quantification
of the damage, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Burlington must bear 60% of
the remediation cost for that site.

As mentioned above, IEMS estimates the impacted area at 21,600 m?, while GSI
accepts 15,850 m?. More specifically, GSI resorted to linear interpolation to calculate
the impacted area for barium in the layer 0-1 meter (7,460 m?),'° the impacted area for
TPH in the layer 0-1 meter (13,090 m?),'“° and the impacted area for TPH in the layer
1-1.5 meters (4,990 m?).'“° These areas partly overlap and yield a maximum impacted
area of 15,850 m?.

Considering that only one exceedance contains TPH to a depth of 1.5 meters, the
Tribunal accepts GSI’s calculation of the impacted area for TPH in the layer 1-1.5
meters, namely 4.990 m?,'“” amounting to a total volume of 4,990 m? of soil to be
remediated in the 1-2 meter layer. Considering the TPH and barium levels of clean
samples, the Tribunal is also in agreement with GSI's delineation of the impacted area
of the 0-1 meter layer, considering that GSI extended the potentially impacted areas by
20 meters further to the north of the Walsh samples, which in turn are further north of
IEMS’s samples (see figure in paragraph 514).'“* In accordance with its general
approach set out earlier (section 4.4.3.c), the Tribunal nevertheless extends GSI's
maximum impacted area of 15,850 m? to 17,000 m? to take into account the relatively
high cadmium exceedance at sample point 07-PAY28-SDB8-R.

In light of the foregoing and of its methodology on assessing remediation costs
(section 4.5.2), the total volume of contaminated soil is 21,990 m° and the total cost of

remediation, including a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), is USD 8,576,100, of
which Burlington shall pay 60%, i.e. USD 5,145,660 for Payamino 2/8.

o. Payamino3

Ecuador claims USD 2,207,021 to remediate 2,453.10 ms of soil from an impacted area
estimated at 1,258 m?.'“° Burlington disputes any liability, since the alleged barium
exceedance is located in a pit and any other exceedances are related to pre-
Consortium drilling discharges in 1987.'°

Leaving aside pit soil, there are no off platform exceedances under any regulatory
criteria.’ On the platform, there is a high TPH exceedance (10,364 mg/kg) in the
south corner “in an area near a soil stockpile”.'°* There is no indication that the
exceedance is due to pre-Consortium drilling activities.‘ Ecuador also pointed to the
fact that no samples were collected at that site for the 2008 audit," although the audit
noted that the platform was lacking anti-pollution devices such as perimeter ditches and
grease traps. ‘°°

On this basis and by reference to its methodology explained above (sections 4.4.3.c
and 4.5.2), the Tribunal accepts that Burlington is liable to remediate this area, which it
sets at 80 m? and 2 meters in depth for a total volume of soil of 160 m%. With a 20%
contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost amounts to USD 57,600 for

Ecuador claims USD 20,502,145 for the remediation of 20,529.60 m° of soil covering an
impacted area of 10,807 m2.'% Burlington accepts that 510 m? are impacted
corresponding to 730 m® of soil requiring remediation for an estimated USD 261 ,000.'°%”
It argues, however, that Ecuador “ignores the operational history of the site” and points
to the discharges of oil-based drilling muds by CEPE in the unlined pit to the west of the
platform.'°®. More specifically, Burlington submits that two areas make up the impacted
510 m?, namely 230 m? in Area 1MT (PA04) corresponding to 230 mé of soil and a cost
of USD 82,000, and 280 m? in Area 1MT (PA14) corresponding to 500 m® and a cost of
USD 179,000.'°? Area 1MT (PA14) is in fact closer to Payamino 14, since it is on the
other side of a creek flowing along the Payamino 14 platform, but Burlington alleges
that any exceedances in that area result from the leaking Payamino 4 pit.'°© Finally,
GSI indicates that exceedances in Area 1MT (PA04) were caused by oil residue from a
produced water spill dating back to 1997.‘

By reference to its approach to land use (see section 4.3.2.c above), since the
Payamino 4 platform is located immediately adjacent to a protected area and to the
Payamino River, the Tribunal applies sensitive ecosystem land use criteria to the off
platform locations.‘ Sampling results reveal no exceedances on the platform. There is
one IEMS sample location in Area 1MT (PA04) with a high TPH level (12,839 mg/kg) as
well as barium and cadmium levels exceeding regulatory criteria.‘ One GSI sample

level is 514 mg/kg."°”' It further appears that the creek adjacent to these exceedances
and flowing into the Payamino River is impacted at two locations with cadmium
exceedances. '°”

In view of the proximity of Payamino 4 and Payamino 14/20/24 and the fact that Area
1MT(PA14) is close to both platforms, the Tribunal reviewed the operating history of
both sites together. The spill history compiled by GSI for Payamino 4 reveals a
12 barrel crude spill in 1994 at a frac tank and a 7 barrel crude spill in 1995 at the
transfer pump."°* GSI also mentioned without providing supporting evidence the
presence of oil residue remaining from a produced water spill in 1997.'° The record
also shows that the Consortium conducted a workover in 2005 on the Payamino 4 well,
which involved the use of chemicals."°” In addition, GSI referred to an unreported spill

occurred to the west of the northeast corner of the platform “when a contractor was
relocating a former produced water discharge line”.'°’° According to GSI, Perenco only
later learned of this spill and was told “that the spill area was covered with clean dirt by
the contractor”.'°””

Regarding the Payamino 14/20/24 platform, the record reveals a 4.8 barrel diesel spill
in 2000 at Payamino 14. In addition, Mr. Saltos confirmed that Payamino 14 was a
stand-by well drilled by prior operators which the Consortium put back into operation,
notably by conducting a well workover.'°’ There are also indications that diluted
effluents were discharged by the prior operator Kerr McGee into the Payamino River
during the Payamino 24 pit closure in 2002.'°”°

With respect to Area 1MT (PA04), the Tribunal notes that GSI provides no supporting
evidence for its assertion that a produced water spill in 1997 caused the
exceedances.'° The fact that Perenco apparently learned of (another) undated
produced water spill, which was simply covered with clean soil, and left the situation
unremediated reinforces the presumption that the Consortium caused the exceedances
in the northeastern corner of the platform. Finally, considering the distance between
Area 1MT (PA04) and Payamino 24, there is nothing to indicate that the diluted effluent
discharges by Kerr McGee in 2002 in relation with the Payamino 24 pit closure affected
the northeastern corner of the Payamino 4 platform. Accordingly, the Tribunal comes to
the conclusion that Burlington failed to rebut the presumption that it caused the harm.

GSI ER1, App. L.17, p. 3. Although GSI stated that the spill location is “west of the northwest
corner of the platform”, GSI thereafter referred to that same spill location in relation to a former
produced water line “located just east of the road” and IEMS sample 7-PAY-04-114-MS-A-1.0,
which clarifies that GSI was in fact referring to the northeast corner of the platform.

The impacted area in Area 1MT (PA04) covers five sampling locations,
amounting to 200 m®%, for a total area of 1000 m?. Contamination reaches a depth of
2 meters for all locations, except for one where contamination has only been confirmed
in the first 1 meter layer. Accordingly, the total volume of soil to be remediated is
1,800 m’ and, considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is

USD 702,000.

With respect to Area 1MT (PA14), Burlington speculates that “[gliven the presence of
these oily, diesel-based muds and the lack of a liner, drilling mud containing oil could
easily have leaked out and contaminated the surrounding soil’.'°°* However, the
Tribunal notes that Burlington provides no evidence for its contention that the Payamino
4 pit had leaked. It conducted no tests and its expert GSI observes, quite to the
contrary, that “[b]ased on field observations, if this was a former pit, it was properly
closed”.'°®* Therefore, the Tribunal holds the condition of the pit to be neutral in respect
to the presumption of causation.

On the one hand, the evidence of diluted effluent discharges conducted by Kerr McGee
during the Payamino 24 pit closure could serve to rebut the presumption of causation.
On the other, the fact that the Consortium put the Payamino 14 stand-by well back into
service and thus conducted well workovers suggests that the Consortium also caused
the environmental condition to the north of the Payamino 14/20/24 platform, in the area
corresponding to Area 1MT (PA14),'° which reinforces the presumption. Under the
circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that Burlinton partially rebutted the
presumption. Since Burlington bears the burden to disprove causation, the Tribunal
holds that the Consortium shall bear half of the cost of remediation for Area 1MT
(PA14).

As to the extent of contamination, in accordance with its general approach (section
4.4.3.c), the Tribunal increases GSI’s delineation around IEMS samples 7-PAY-04-113-
MS-A and 7-PAY-04-113-MS-B from 280 m? to 300 m? so as to remediate the other

The Tribunal notes that GSI’s revision of IEMS coordinates of sample 7-PAY-04-114-MS-A does

not change the extent of the impacted area. See GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 31.

bank of the creek. In addition, because of the high level of the vanadium exceedance,
the Tribunal adds an impacted area of 300 m? around the vanadium exceedance, and
200 m? around each of the three additional cadmium exceedances.’ The total
impacted area in Area 1MT (PA14) is thus 1,200 m?.

The volume of soil for the area delineated by GSI as increased by the Tribunal is
900 m’. Around the vanadium exceedance it is 300 m° and for the three additional
cadmium exceedances 1,000 m’.'% The total volume of soil is thus 2,200 m°.
Accordingly, considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428 and section 4.5.2
more generally), the total cost for the remediation of exceedances in and around Area
1MT (PA14) amounts to USD 858,000, of which Burlington shall pay USD 429,000.

In sum, the total cost of remediation incurred by Burlington with respect to Payamino 4
is USD 1,131,000.

q. Payamino5

Under its regulatory case, Ecuador claims USD 4,908,735 to clean up an area of
1,600 m? and a volume of soil of 5,375.50 m?.'®” Burlington responds that there are no
exceedances at that site when applying correct regulatory criteria and, if there were,
they would be related to pre-Consortium drilling activities.‘

Leaving aside pit soil," there are no exceedances at Payamino 5 under any
regulatory criteria."°°° Accordingly, no remediation is warranted at this site and
Ecuador's claim with respect to non-pit soil is dismissed.

The Tribunal already addressed some aspects of Payamino 14/20/24 in its analysis of
Payamino 4, more specifically in connection with Area 1MT (PA14). It noted that
Payamino 14 was a stand-by well put into operation by the Consortium, which involved

workovers.''™ It further noted that there had been a 4.8 barrel diesel spill in 2000 and

diluted effluent discharges in 2002 during Kerr McGee operations."'®

2000 diesel spill. In addition, due to their location, the exceedances situated beyond the
southern edge of the platform appear unrelated to the 2002 effluent discharges which

reached the Payamino River.

As the documentary record shows
conducted workovers on the Payamino 14 well, the Tribunal finds that Burlington failed
to rebut the presumption of causation in respect of the exceedances on the platform

and beyond the southern edge of the platform.

Considering the effluent discharges by Kerr McGee in 2002 and the workovers
conducted by the Consortium on the Payamino 14 well, the Tribunal holds that
Burlington partially rebutted the presumption in respect of the exceedances to the
northeast of the platform along the creek flowing into the Payamino River, and that the
Consortium shall bear half of the cost of remediation for these exceedances.

Taking account of, on the one hand, the relatively low levels of exceedances of some
samples and, on the other, the fact that other samples are close to a protected area or
in the immediate proximity of a creek, the Tribunal determines the total impacted area
to extend to 560 m?''"* and the total volume of soil to be remediated to 1,000 ms.'""°

The impacted area is composed of 80 m? for the platform exceedance point 14-18-MS-D; 80 m?

exceedances to the northeast of the platform, including a 30% contingency (see
paragraph 428), is USD 78,000, of which Burlington shall pay half, i.e. USD 39,000. In

559. Applying sensitive ecosystem criteria, in reliance on its methodology on land use

(section 4.3.2.c), the Tribunal identified several exceedance points to the south of the
platform with barium, cadmium and nickel." Further, on the basis of the pit
dimensions, the Tribunal finds that sample 7-PAY-15-111-MS-K-1,5 is not located

"et GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.24.3.

GSI concedes that the platform is surrounded by secondary forest. GSI indicates that a marsh is
“immediately adjacent” to the north of the site extending 25 meters, and that a stream some
20 meters to the south-southeast of the platform flows to the north-northeast. See: GSI ER1,

15-109-MS-D-1,5 and 7-PAY-15-109-MSD-B-0,5. The Tribunal also notes a relatively high level
of vanadium (264.5 mg/kg) at one point on the platform (sample 7-PAY-15-110-MS-B-1,5),
although it falls below the adjusted permissible limit. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.24.1; GSI

According to available records, there was a 30-barrel spill on 10 June 2001 at the
wellhead, due to vandalism, of which some 20 barrels were recovered by Kerr
McGee.'"”° There also was an equipment failure at the power oil unit on 31 May 2003
causing a 2-barrel crude spill, all of which was recovered by Perenco.'"”” In addition,
the record shows that the Consortium conducted well workovers at that site which
involved perforations and the use of chemicals.''” Finally, the Tribunal notes that no
soil samples were taken at this site for the 2008 Environmental Audit.''”? Since the
contamination is of heavy metals only and considering the Consortium’s workovers, the
Tribunal holds that Burlington has not rebutted the presumption of causation and,
hence, is liable for remediating all exceedances.

The impacted area is 1,000 m?, made up of five areas of 200 m? each. Considering that
two exceedance points extend to a depth of 1 meter and the other three to a depth of
2 meters, the total volume of soil to be remediated is 1,600 m%. Considering a 30%
contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost amounts to USD 624,000 for
Payamino 15.

prepared by Mr. Grizzle and commissioned by Oryx, which mentioned that the
Payamino 16 diesel tank was overflowing, affecting on and off platform locations. ''%

to a contrary conclusion. Indeed, the record shows that the Consortium used Payamino
16 to store muds from other platforms.''?’” Mr. Saltos explained that “[sJince Payamino
16 had stopped operations, we made these pits in order to put in them the muds
coming from other areas, and that we had like too much mud”.'"%® He added that the
Consortium operated five unreported off platform pits at Payamino 16. As a
consequence of this practice, the Tribunal holds Burlington liable for exceedances

As can be seen from the figure above, IEMS only collected samples at one off platform
location and the results show no exceedances under any regulatory criteria.’ With
respect to the platform, where industrial criteria apply, there is one TPH exceedance
with a level reaching 23,818 mg/kg close to the power oil pump and diesel fuel storage
tank.''46

There is no record of historical spills,'"” but Burlington’s explanation that the TPH
exceedance is related to pre-Consortium drilling activities is unconvincing because of
the proximity of the exceedance to the power oil pump and the diesel fuel storage
tank.'"*® In addition, if the cause were drilling activities, one would expect to find barium,
not TPH. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that Burlington failed to rebut the
presumption of causation and holds it liable to pay for the remediation of that
exceedance.

The impacted area is 80 m2 and the volume of soil 320 m°.'"*° Applying the remediation
standards set out earlier (section 4.5.2), the total cost is USD 115,200, which includes a
20% contingency (see paragraph 428). Since this exceeds the sum claimed by
Ecuador, the Tribunal reduces the amount awarded to USD 111,683 as claimed for
Payamino 21.

Tribunal also notes that no soil samples were taken at Payamino 21 for the 2008 audit. See: 2
SMCC, § 233; Block 7 Environmental Audit, November 2008, p. 40, Table 3-3 (Exh. E-252).

Sample location 7-PAY-21-222-MS-B still has a TPH level of 6,533 mg/kg at 3 meters depth and
a level of 2,930 mg/kg at 4.5 meters depth. Accordingly, the Tribunal deems that remediation up
to 4 meters is sufficient here.

For barium, GSI calculated an impacted area of 270 m? in the layer 0-1 meter, 190 m? in the

layer 1-2 meters, and 180 m? in the layer 2-3 meters. These areas partly overlap and yield a

In application of the Tribunal’s general approach (section 4.3.2.c) and consequently in
reliance on sensitive ecosystem criteria,''®’ the Tribunal identified various TPH, barium,
cadmium and nickel exceedances in an area off the northeast corner of the platform
going in the direction of the designated protected forest.''®* In addition, the Tribunal
identified one cadmium exceedance in an area further to the southwest of the
platform.""°

With respect to the exceedances around the northeastern corner of the platform, the
Tribunal notes the presence of a chemical storage area and an unused concrete pad
that according to GSI was “possibly [used] for a former power oil pumping system or
electrical generator and diesel fuel storage tank." The 3-barrel crude spill in 2000
mentioned by Burlington weakens the presumption of causation. However, it is
noteworthy that GSI refers to various allegedly reported and remediated spills “due to
failures in the power oil units” at various times in the past, without providing further
details.""*' Burlington did not allege that the power oil unit was removed by prior
operators. The Tribunal therefore understands that the Consortium also used it. In the
same vein, the Tribunal is also inclined to find that at least some of the failures of the
power oil unit and ensuing spills alluded to by GSI occured during the Consortium’s
time. The Tribunal futher notes that the 2008 Environmental Audit indicated that the
perimeter drains and grease traps were in poor condition and that not a single soil
sample was taken at that location at that time.’ These elements tend to confirm the
presumption that the Consortium caused the exceedances. At the very least, they fail to
rebut the presumption. In addition, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Solis referred to ruptures
on the Payamino 23 flowline “on at least four occasions”, presumably during the

Payamino 23 is adjacent to a protected forest area designated under the SNAP system. See, for
instance: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.29.3.

Consortium’s time.''®* However, he did not recall the exact dates of the ruptures nor did
he specify the impact of the ruptures on the environment and the measures taken.''®
The evidence of Mr. Solis is therefore too vague, although, if anything, it would rather
confirm the presumption. As a result, the Tribunal concludes that Burlington did not
rebut the presumption of causation and must pay the cost for remediating the area to

the northeast of the platform.

With respect to the area to the southwest, Burlington provided no specific explanation.
As a consequence, the Tribunal considers that it failed to discharge its burden to rebut
the presumption of causation and shall pay the full costs of remediation. The impacted
area to the southwest of the platform around sample 7-PAY-18-218-MSD-B extends to
200 m?. The total volume of soil amounts to 200 m® and the total cost is thus
USD 78,000, which includes a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428).

In respect of the impacted area to the northeast of the platform. GSI divided this
location in two, namely Area 1M surrounding the heavy metals exceedances and Area
2T around the TPH exceedance.''® During its second field trip, GSI put a dirty boring
back into the ground without taking any sample in the 2-3 meter layer southwards of
sample location PA23-1M-02, just east of the oil/water separator.''® Considering the
topography, in particular the ridge to the east of Area 2T, the Tribunal generally accepts
GSI's delineation in Area 1M.''®’ Considering that GSI put a dirty boring back into the
ground instead of testing it, the Tribunal will, however, collapse the three 1-meter layers
taking the largest surface, namely 350 m? and increase that area by 50 m? to include
the piece of land between the oil/water separator and the area designated above, which
in total yields 400 m?.

By contrast, the Tribunal does not adopt GSIl’s delineation in Area 2T. Indeed, GSI
collected a confirmation sample between 2.2 to 2.5 meters with a TPH level of
28.37 mg/kg to discard the two IEMS samples with TPH exceedances taken at
1.5 meters and 2.5 meters." Because the expanded Area 1M partly overlaps with
Area 2T,"'® the Tribunal adds 100 m? to the 400 m? above, for a total area of 500 m?.
The volume of soil requiring remediation is 1,500 m%, and adding a 30% contingency
(see paragraph 428), the total cost is USD 585,000.

In sum, the total impacted area at Payamino 23 is 700 m?. The total volume of soil to be
remediated amounts to 1,700 mS for a cost of USD 663,000 for Payamino 23.

x.  Payamino Sanitary Landfill

Ecuador claims USD 26,488,219 to remediate 30,517.50 m* of soil to be taken from an
area of 4,634 m?.''”° Burlington opposes that claim and contends that various samples
located on the platform were in fact misplaced and were actually taken from the mud
pits further south on the platform.'"”'

In light of GSI’s statement that its inspection discovered “several abandoned soil
borings in the southern portion of the platform” and that there was “[n]o evidence of
borings” at a small distance further to the north, still within the confines of the platform,
the Tribunal accepts that the disputed samples were indeed taken in the mud pits.'"”
Accordingly, the Tribunal will address these samples in its analysis on mud pits further
below (paragraphs 797 and 801). On that basis, the Tribunal finds no non-pit soil
exceedances at the Payamino Sanitary Landfill under any regulatory criteria."'”
Therefore, no remediation for non-pit soil is warranted at that site.

The Punino 1 well was drilled by Petroproduccién in 1990 and was converted into an
injection well by Oryx in 1995.''®° There is no record of historical spills."'®' The Tribunal
notes, however, that during its inspection in 2012 GSI observed that the oil traps were
all “plugged, full of water, and needed basic maintenance”.'"® Interestingly, this was
already the case at the time of the 2008 Environmental Audit which noted: “Lack of
maintenance in perimeter drains and grease traps”.''®? In addition, no samples were
taken for the 2008 audit and it appears that no verification list was generated.
Accordingly, Burlington failed to rebut the presumption that it caused the exceedance in
question. For these reasons, the Tribunal holds Burlington liable to remediate the TPH

exceedance.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s methodology (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the

and the second to the south of the platform with slight barium and cadmium
exceedances. ''%*

Since the Consortium drilled the Céndor Norte well in 2003 and stopped to operate it in
2005, it is clear that the harm was caused during the Consortium’s time."'® Burlington
is thus liable to remediate the two exceedances identified above. The Tribunal will
further address the pit collapse (paragraphs 809-810) and Burlington’s duty to properly
abandon the platform below (paragraphs 883-888).

Under the Tribunal’s approach discussed above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the
impacted area is 400 m? and the total volume of soil to be remediated is 800 m%.

Applying agricultural criteria to off platform locations pursuant to its land use approach
set forth above (section 4.3.2.c), the sampling results show environmental harm in two
areas and at other discrete sampling points, with TPH, barium, cadmium, lead and
vanadium exceedances scattered around the western flank of Gacela CPF and the
Gacela 1/8 platform.

The first area is linked to Gacela 1/8. It is a marshy, low-lying area to the southwest with
a creek flowing in a plain to the west of Gacela CPF. GSI identified this area as 2M. The
following compounds are found there in excess of permissible limits: barium, cadmium
and vanadium."'®’ The vanadium exceedance reaches a level of 460 mg/kg.'"%® Above
Area 2M is another designated by GSI as 3M, which hosts various barium
exceedances. ''%°

The second area is linked to Gacela CPF and designated by the Tribunal as Area 1TR.
It is located in the plain mentioned above along a small creek below the westernmost
oil/water separator at Gacela CPF. There, the Tribunal identified various cadmium
exceedances and one vanadium exceedance reaching the level of 373.5 mg/kg. 7

In addition, there are several exceedances in the area designated by GSI as Area
1T,'*"' as well as a little further to the west'*” and northwest. 7°

converted Gacela 8 into an injection well.'2°° A review of the historical record of spills
confirms that Gacela CPF saw various spills over the years.'*” The pre-Consortium
spills weaken the presumption of causation. By contrast, the record also includes
several major unreported spills under the Consortium’s operatorship, which Mr. Saltos
sought to justify by explaining that the crude was contained within the retention walls of
the CPF.'?°° However, there are indications in the record that the unreported 100 barrel
spill of formation water and crude on 20 January 2007 partly reached the API separator
on the west of the CPF and was thus in close proximity to Area 1TR.'*°° GSI also
mentioned an allegedly remediated spill west of the API separator in 2007 of 3 barrels
of produced water and 26 liters of oil.'*'° In addition, there was another unreported
crude spill of 17 barrels on 12 June 2008 at an unspecified location, of which 15 barrels
were apparently recovered.'*"' Finally, the Tribunal notes that not a single sample was
collected for the 2008 Environmental Audit, notwithstanding these numerous and
occasionally large spills."*'* These elements reinforce the presumption of causation in
respect to Gacela CPF, and in particular as regards Area 1TR.

With respect to Gacela 1/8, the evidence of pre-Consortium drilling and workovers
tends to rebut the presumption of causation. Yet, various other events during the
Consortium’s operatorship do reinforce the presumption. A 3-barrel spill of produced
water on 2 October 2004 was reported to DINAPA on 5 October 2004"?"? and a spill of

2-3 gallons of crude occurred on 2 October 2005 due to a technician incorrectly opening
a valve.'?"* The record reveals further that the Consortium conducted three workovers
on the Gacela 1 well between 2002 and 2007 involving the use of chemicals during the
repair or replacement of pumps.'?'® The Consortium also drilled in the Gacela 8 well in
2004 when converting it into an injection well.'?'® Finally, the Tribunal notes that not a

single sample was collected for the 2008 audit.'?'”

In light of this record, the Tribunal assesses the rebuttal of the presumption of causation
and the ensuing apportionment of liability as follows:

Burlington is fully liable for the environmental condition in Area 1TR, mainly
because of the unreported spills in 2007 and 2008.

ii. Burlington is partly liable for the environmental condition in Areas 2M and 3M ina
proportion of 50%. This proportion is chosen because Burlington is deemed to
have partially overcome the presumption. Indeed, pre-Consortium drilling is likely
to be an important cause of the contamination, but spills occurred at Gacela 1/8
under the Consortium’s watch in addition to various workovers, and no samples
were taken on the occasion of the 2008 audit.

iii. Burlington is fully liable for the environmental condition in Area 1T. It is true that

Petroamazonas built a pipeline and maintains a right of way at that location, '*"®
but there is no proof of its exact location or that it is located in such a way that it
impacted Area 1T.'2'° In any event, the Site Visit confirmed that the alleged right

of way is not as large as the one seen at Mono CPF.

Finally, Burlington is liable to remediate all other exceedance points to the northwest of
Area 1T, because it failed to rebut the presumption that it caused the observed harm.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s general methodology (sections 4.4.3.c ad 4.5.2), the
remediation costs for these areas are as follows:

i. The impacted area in Area 1TR is 600 m? and the total volume of soil to be
remediated is 1,000 m%.'*"° Considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428),
the total cost payable by Burlington is USD 390,000.

ii. Although the Tribunal principally agrees with the interpolation undertaken by GSI
in Area 2M,'”*" it increases the impacted area from 570 m? to 700 mé to include
the remediation of both banks of the creek and the piece of land where the creek
reaches the culvert. Since the impacted area at 2 meters of depth is larger than in
the layer above, but does not totally overlap,'”” the Tribunal decided to collapse
both layers for a total volume of soil to be remediated of 1,400 m°%. The cost of
remediation is thus USD 546,000, which includes a 30% contingency (see
paragraph 428). Out of this amount, Burlington shall pay 50%, i.e. USD 273,000.

iii. In principle, the Tribunal also accepts GSI’s delineation of Area 3M.'”° However,
it extends the impacted area around sample GACPF-3M-3-(1.0-2.0) by 110 m? to
include an area on the downward slope, for a total impacted area of 500 m?. Since
barium contamination reaches 4 meters in depth and the lowest layer is the
largest in terms of impacted area,'** the Tribunal collapsed all four layers for a
total volume of soil of 2,000 m’. With a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the

The impacted area around samples 7-GAC-1Y8-196-MS-I-0,5 and 7-GAC-1Y8-196-MS-I-1,5 is

200 m?. With a depth of 2 meters, the volume of soil is 400 m’. The impacted area around
sample 7-GAC-1Y8-196-MS-H-1,5 is 200 m? and, with a depth of 2 meters, the volume of soil is
400 m’. Finally, the impacted area around sample 7-GAC-1Y8-196-MSD-G-0,7 is 200 m? and,
with a depth of 1 meter, the volume of soil is 200 m3. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.33.3.

cost of remediation totals USD 720,000, of which Burlington shall pay 50%, i.e.
USD 360,000.

iv. The impacted area in Area 1T is 200 m? and the volume of soil is 200 m°.
Considering a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the remediation cost at that
location amounts to USD 72,000.

v. The impacted area around the discrete exceedance points to the northwest of
Area 1T totals 280 m2, comprising 200 m? around the lead exceedance to a depth
of 2 meters'”*> and 80 m? around the slight cadmium exceedance to a depth of
1 meter.'?*6 The total volume of soil is 480 m? and the total cost, including a 30%
contingency (see paragraph 428), is USD 187,200.

In conclusion, considering the apportionment of liability, Burlington shall pay at total of
USD 1,282,200 to remediate Gacela 1/8 and the CPF.

bb. Gacela 2

Ecuador claims USD 17,434,730 to remediate 19,962.80 m° of soil covering an area of
14,785 mz2.'”’ Although Burlington recognizes that an area of 340 m? is impacted
outside the southwestern corner of the platform, amounting to 340 m° of soil to be
remediated for a cost of USD 158,000, it disputes that it caused the exceedances
observed. It argues that “Perenco and Burlington never operated this platform — didn’t
drill, did not put a mud pit in, and so any contamination that we’re speaking of was not

from the Burlington/Perenco Consortium’”.'?°

Although during the Site Visit the Tribunal witnessed agricultural land use scattered
around the platform, it regards the area immediately surrounding the platform to the
west and to the north as sensitive ecosystem, in particular because it is marshy land as
is shown by the stagnant water below the southwestern corner of the platform and the
creek flowing around the platform.'** Contrary to this, the Tribunal applied agricultural
criteria to three sample locations further to the northwest, where the land is cleared and
used for agricultural purposes by local residents. °°

On that basis, the Tribunal identified one exceedance point on the platform to the east
of the pit designated by GSI as Area 2P with TPH, barium and vanadium levels in

Id., Figure L.34.8.

The Tribunal also notes that GSI concedes that secondary forest is “immediately adjacent” to the
west, north and east of the platform, with some agriculture-livestock pasturage to the west and to
the south. GSI ER1, App. L.34.1, p. 6.

TPH level is just under 20,000 mg/kg.'**° It further identified four barium exceedances in
the area designated by GSI as Area 1M.'°° Finally, there are five exceedance points to

the north of the platform showing that the soil is contaminated with cadmium, the

highest level reaching 4.62 mg/kg. '7°”

Gacela 2 was drilled in 1992 by Oryx. In 1994, Gacela 2A underwent directional drilling
and Gacela 2B underwent horizontal drilling in 1997.'*° The walls of the pit containing
oil-based mud on the southwestern corner of the platform were remediated, the pit’s
contents were cemented, and it was eventually closed in 1998. '**° One well was shut in

1999" and, although Burlington argued that the Consortium never produced oil at that

site, it appears that the latter conducted a workover on the Gacela 2B well by

Sample 07-GAC02-SDA2-R. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.34.1; GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3,
pp. 51-53. The Tribunal accepts GSI’s explanation that sample MS-GAC-C1-2.1-1 is located in
the pit in Area 2P. See: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 11. The Tribunal further notes
Burlington’s explanation at the Site Visit that GSI revised the dimensions of the pit in Area 2P
after reviewing the pit closure report of 1998, where it is stated that the pit is in fact 40 meters
long. Having reviewed the closure report, the Tribunal accepts this position, although it observes
that sample 07-GAC02-SDA-2 still appears to be located outside the pit area, based on the
scale in GSI’s maps. Accordingly, sample 07-GAC02-SDA3-R is deemed to be within the pit.

The historical record of spills shows a 1-barrel crude spill in 1994, a 0.1-barrel crude
spill in 1998 and a 0.24-barrel crude spill in 2003.'** IEMS also pointed to a number of
complaints by affected individuals.'*° According to an interview conducted by IEMS
with Mr. Cesar Angamarca, the breakdown of a surface pipe affected the stream to the
south of the platform.'° Further, on 29 June 2007, Mr. Angel Verdezoto filed a
complaint with the Ministry of Energy and Mines about drainage discharges that
occurred on 25 April 2007.'47 Moreover, the owner of the surrounding land,
Ms. Narcisa Gutiérez, filed a complaint with the ombudsman on 15 October 2007 “for
failure to compensate and remediate contamination resulting from hydrocarbon
activities developed on her land”.'** Equally, on 18 December 2007, several individuals
filed a complaint with the ombudsman regarding “contamination caused on 3 July 2006
to rivers and surrounding lands”.'*“°

Seeking to minimize the importance of these complaints, GSI essentially opined that
IEMS relied on “vague anecdotal claims”.'*° Yet, in the view of the Tribunal, these
instances tend to demonstrate that Gacela 2 may not in fact have been properly
operated. It is also noteworthy that not a single soil sample was collected for the 2008
Environmental Audit of Block 7.'7°' The 2008 audit actually mentions that the perimeter

drains and grease traps are not held in good condition. Finally, the Consortium adopted
an abandonment plan that was never carried out.'*5*

Taking all these elements into account, in particular the fact that the pit located in the
southwestern corner was remediated and compacted with cement prior to the
Consortium’s time, and that the Consortium conducted a workover at that site, the
Tribunal considers that Burlington did not rebut the presumption of causation and holds
Burlington liable for the environmental condition in Area 1M and on the platform.
Burlington is also liable to remediate the exceedances to the north and northwest of the
platform, since it provided no explanation on these exceedances and, therefore, left the
presumption intact.

For these different areas, in accordance with its general approach (sections 4.4.3.c and
4.5.2), the Tribunal establishes the extent of contamination and the remediation costs
as follows:

i. GSI proposed an impacted area in Area 1M of 340 m2.’ The Tribunal increases
the surface to 400 m? to include all soil between that area and the platform, and in
particular the oil/water separator.'*°* Hence, the total volume of soil amounts to
400 m° and, considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is
USD 156,000.

ii. The area impacted by the exceedance on the platform is 80 m?, the volume of soil
160 m%, and, with a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is
USD 57,600.

iii. Finally, the impacted area for the five discrete cadmium exceedances to the
northwest of the platform is 1,000 m?, with a total volume of soil amounting to

1,400 m3,'5 and a remediation cost of USD 546,000, which includes a 30%
contingency (see paragraph 428).

In total, the remediation cost payable by Burlington for Gacela 2 amounts to
USD 759,600.

at that site.'°°” Burlington also pointed to the construction of the Oso-Gacela pipeline by

Petroamazonas along the Gacela 4 platform. '*°*

The impacted area is 200 m? around each exceedance point. The depth of contamination is 1

witness, Mr. Solis, mentioned an unreported 2 to 3 gallon crude oil spill on 3 August
2008 “affecting an area of 40 sq. mts. of land and vegetation, due to a failure in the
operation of the Gacela 4 well’.'*°° In addition, the record shows that the Consortium
conducted various workovers at that well, including a workover in 2003 with drilling in
the Napo “U” reservoir involving the use of chemicals." Finally, the Tribunal notes that
no soil samples were taken for the 2008 Environmental Audit and that the audit
reported that the perimeter drains and grease traps were in poor condition. '*°”

On that basis, the Tribunal holds Burlington fully liable to remediate the exceedances at
Gacela 4 identified above. This applies to the TPH exceedance on the platform and the
off platform exceedance, in an area that does not appear affected by Petroamazonas’
expansion activities. 7°

The impacted area on the platform extends over 80 m?; the volume of soil amounts to
160 m°; and applying a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the remediation cost
totals USD 57,600. The impacted off platform area extends to 200 m?; the volume of
soil to be remediated amounts to 400 m3; and, with a 20% contingency (see
paragraph 428), the remediation cost totals USD 144,000. In conclusion, the total
remediation cost at Gacela 4 payable by Burlington amounts to USD 201,600.

Disregarding pit soil for the time being, there are no off platform exceedances under
any regulatory criteria. However, there is a lead exceedance (587.3 mg/kg) next to the

Gacela 5 well.'*”"

Burlington did not report any historical spills at that site.'*” However, the record shows
an unreported 3.14-barrel oil spill close to the power oil unit that occurred on 7
September 2007 “due to severe corrosion of the Gacela 5 flowline”.'*”* In addition, the
Consortium conducted two workovers at that well site, the last one involving the use of
chemicals.'?” Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that Burlington has not succeeded in
rebutting the presumption of causation and is thus liable for the platform exceedance.

The impacted area is 80 m?, the volume of soil 80 m°.'*”5 With a 20% contingency (see

Gacela 6/9 was drilled by Oryx in 1994." Burlington mentioned three spills at this site:
a 6-barrel crude oil spill at the chemical injection nipple on 16 March 1995; a 110-barrel
crude oil spill at the hydraulic unit on 5 April 1996; and a 3-barrel crude oil spill due to
vandalism along the Gacela 6/9 pipeline on 27 October 2008.'** Ecuador's witness,
Mr. Solis, further referred to an unreported discharge of crude oil and water near the
power oil unit affecting 21 m® of soil."°* The Tribunal further notes that the Consortium
conducted a workover at the Gacela 9 well in 2008 to convert it into an injection well, ‘7°
in addition to a workover at the Gacela 6 well in November 2002 involving the use of
chemicals." Finally, the Tribunal also observes that no soil samples were collected for
the 2008 Environmental Audit, which otherwise indicated that the perimeter drains and
grease traps were in poor condition at this site.'*°”

Considering that all spills mentioned above were crude oil spills, that there are no
exceedances of TPH at this site, and that the Consortium conducted a workover, the
Tribunal holds Burlington liable for the barium exceedance on the platform and for the
cadmium exceedances off the platform.

In reliance on the Tribunal’s methodology set forth above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2),
the impacted area on the platform is 80 m?; the volume of soil is 80 m3; and, with a 20%
contingency (see paragraph 428), the cost of remediation is USD 28,800. As to the five

Saturday, we detected a crude oil and water spill close to the Power Oil unit of GA 06-09. We
proceeded to excavate and determined that the contamination came from cracks in the sewer of
the power oil tile. We withdrew approx. 21 m3 of contaminated material towards the land farming
at Pay[amino] CPF. We replaced the withdrawn material with scraps and the sewer was left for
repair. We cannot estimate the crude/oil/water volume that spilled out towards the platform.

off platform exceedances, the impacted area is 1,000 m?. Considering a depth of two
meters at two of theses exceedance points and one at the others, the total volume of
soil to be remediated is 1,400 m®, for a total cost of USD 546,000, which includes a
30% contingency (see paragraph 428).

In conclusion, the total remediation cost at Gacela 6/9 for which Burlington is liable
amounts to USD 574,800.

Ecuador claims USD 995,206 to remediate 920.40 m° of soil from an area of 708 m2.'8%
Jaguar 1 is one of the two sites where Burlington accepted liability because it “cannot
definitively link harm to non-Consortium activities”.'*®° Burlington concedes that there
was an oil spill in 2005 affecting an area designated by GSI as Area 3T and accepts to
pay USD 213,000 to remediate 430 m in that location."° By contrast, Burlington
attributes the exceedances in Areas 1M and 2M to pre-Consortium drilling activities in
1987.'**' It thus disputes its liability for the remediation of an area where according to

GSI 1,110 m$ would have to be recovered from an area of 370 m?.'2?

exceedance in Area 1M,'*° and another one between Areas 1M and 2M, which is close

to the school of La Delicia.'°"'

There is no record of historical spills prior to the Consortium’s takeover of the
Blocks."%°? There was an unreported spill in 2005 that the Consortium did not
remediate. ‘°°? Burlington’s witness, Mr. Saltos, confirmed that Jaguar 1 was a stand-by
well shortly put back into operation by the Consortium after a workover." Accordingly,
the presumption of causation stands and Burlington must bear the costs of remediating

all the exceedances.'°”

Turning now to the measure of contamination and remediation costs, the Tribunal first
notes that Ecuador brings no claim for Area 3T when Burlington admits liability in an
amount of USD 213,000. To the extent that the amount awarded for this site does not
exceed the amount claimed, the Tribunal accepts to grant the amount conceded by
Burlington, in particular because the latter admitted a spill in 2005.

In connection with the impacted areas and remediation costs of the other contaminated
locations, the Tribunal makes the following findings:

i. For Area 1M, the impacted area is 200 m? and the volume of soil 600 m°. The
same measurements apply to the sample point between Areas 1M and 2M,

is 400 m? and 1,200 m°.

ii. | Area 2M is in close proximity to human dwellings and located in the neck of a
stream that flows away from the residential area. GSI estimated an impacted area
of 370 m? and a total volume of soil of 1,110 ms.'%°° Considering in particular that
GSI put dirty borings back into the soil'®*” and that it did not account for sample
JA01-2M-10, which exceeds the limit for residential land use for barium, the
Tribunal sets the impacted area at 500 m? and the soil volume for remediation at
1,500 ms.

iii. In respect of the seven exceedance points on or close to the platform, the
Tribunal admits an impacted area of 560 m?. Considering a depth of two meters,
this brings the volume of soil to be remediated to 1,120 m°.

iv. With a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost incurred to remediate
Area 1M and 2M, as well as the barium exceedance between these two areas, is
USD 1,053,000. With a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the cost incurred
to remediate the exceedances on or around the platform is USD 403,200. To this,
the Tribunal adds the amount conceded by Burlington for Area 3T, i.e.
USD 213,000, for a total amount to remediate this site of USD 1,669,200.

As the total remediation cost claimed by Ecuador for Jaguar 1 is lower than the
aggregate of the sums just established, the Tribunal awards the full amount claimed by
Ecuador, i.e. USD 995,206.

Ecuador claims USD 14,201,806 to remediate 15,403.70 m° covering an area of

GSI ER2, Table 4 and App. D, Tables D.7.2.4.a, D.7.2.4.c and D.7.2.4.d. The Tribunal notes that
this soil volume exceeds the one claimed by Ecuador. Yet, again to the extent that the total
amount that should be awarded according to the Tribunal's determinations for this site does not
exceed the amount claimed, the Tribunal does take it into consideration.

In line with its methodology (section 4.3.2.c), since Jaguar 2 formed part of the

Consortium’s Final Abandonment Plan,'*"* the Tribunal applied agricultural land use

criteria to the platform,”’° as well as to areas to the northeast, east, southeast and

south of the platform. On that basis, it identified one nickel exceedance just west of the

wellhea and three cadmium and nickel exceedances on the eastern side of the

platform close to the former crude oil storage tank vault.'*"”

Applying sensitive ecosystem criteria to sampling locations to the west, northwest and

north of the platform'*"® (leaving aside pit soil in Area 3P at this stage),'°"® the Tribunal

identified numerous cadmium and nickel exceedances, as well as four separate TPH,

IEMS indicates that jungle is located to the north of the platform and that agriculture is
approximately 250 meters to the west. For its part, GSI accepts that secondary forest is located
to the north of the platform, with some agriculture immediately adjacent to it, and that agriculture
is located to the west. Based on a review of aerial photographs and satellite imagery, the
Tribunal deems that subsequent land use at the sampling locations in Areas 1M, 2M and 4T is
properly classified as sensitive ecosystem. See: IEMS ER3, Annex C, Jaguar 2, p. 1; GSI ER1,
App. L.40.1, p. 6, Figure L.40.6 and Att. L.40.A-L.40.B.

In light of the very high barium, cadmium, lead, nickel and vanadium values, the Tribunal
accepts that Area 3P is a mud pit. This does not appear to be disputed by Ecuador, since IEMS
identified an area “to the southwest of the platform [...] presumed to be a potential mud pit due
to the resistivity contrast seen in the area” (REC No. 7-JAG-2-301). IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Jaguar

also indicate that production resumed between July 2001 and February 2005.‘

There is no record of historical spills other than a 10 barrel crude oil spill on 6 April 2005

remediated,'* but GSI noted that not a single barrel of crude oil was recovered,
1329

without further specifying what remediation technology was used, if any.
The record does not show the exact location of that spill. From GSl’s general
description, the Tribunal infers that it affected Area 4T and therefore most likely also
Area 1M which lays further downhill.'*°° This understanding is reinforced by the fact that
IEMS heard from local residents of a crude oil spill to the northwest of the platform,
which was apparently only superficially cleaned.'®*' The Tribunal further notes that no
samples were taken at Jaguar 2 for the preparation of the Abandonment Plan, '** and
only one soil sample for the 2008 Environmental Audit.'*° Finally, GSI’s explanation
that the weathered crude found in Area 4T may have been caused by “natural oil seeps,
which are known to occur in this area” appears speculative and is not supported by
other evidence. As a consequence, the Tribunal considers that Burlington has not
rebutted causation and is liable to remediate the exceedances in Areas 4T and 1M.

As for the exceedances in and around Area 2M, they appear related to prior discharges
into the pit located in Area 3P, since they have similarly high — sometimes even higher
values — than the ones in Area 3P.'*** These exceedances therefore appear connected
to pre-Consortium drilling operations and Burlington must be regarded as having
rebutted the causation presumption in this respect.

Saltos WS1, Annex A.
GSI ER1, App. B.3, line 79.

GSI provided the following observations: “GSI investigated an area about 120 m northwest of the
platform, where a hillside dropped down toward the northwest into a steep ravine. In this
location, the GSI team found a recently cleared area with crude oil on the ground surface and
buried at shallow depths at the southeast edge. The crude oil was localized and distributed over
an approximately 7 m by 7m area. Available information suggested that these spots may be from
a natural oil seep, which are known to occur in this area”. GSI ER1, App. L.40, p. 3.

REC No. 7-JAG-2-298. See: IEMS ER4, Att. 38, Jaguar 2, p. 6.

The reason provided in the Abandonment Plan was that there was no evidence of areas
contaminated by TPH. See: Plan de Abandono Definitivo y Entrega de Areas Utilizadas para la

Finally, with respect to the discrete heavy metal exceedances located on the platform,

the record shows that the Consortium did operate Jaguar 2 from 2002 through 2005. As

a result, the Tribunal holds that Burlington failed to rebut the presumption of causation

in this regard and, hence, must bear the costs of remediation.

Proceeding now to measure the impact and remediation costs for these three locations,

the Tribunal makes the following findings:

in respect of Area 4T, GSI delineated 30 m? around the TPH exceedance (see
figure in paragraph 646 above), although it is surrounded by heavy metals
exceedances. This delineation appears clearly insufficient.'*° In reliance on its
methodology set out above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2), the Tribunal considers
that the impacted area in and around Area 4T is 2,400 m? and the total volume of
soil 4,800 m%. Considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total
remediation cost amounts to USD 1,872,000.

In Area 1M, GSI delineated an area of 100 m?. Doing so, it incorrectly drew the
outer edge of that area at the sample locations with chromium and _ nickel
exceedances.'**° Seeking to better align the delineation with the contamination,
the Tribunal determines an impacted area of 300 m? surrounding these additional
exceedance points, which also lies further upwards the hill, from where the
contamination would appear to have flown down. Consequently, the total volume
of soil is 600 m%. With a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total
remediation cost is thus USD 234,000.

For the four platform exceedance points, the Tribunal determines the impacted
area to be 800 m?. Considering a depth of two meters at three exceedance points
and of one meter at the fourth point, the volume of soil is 1,400 m3’. With a 20%
contingency (see paragraph 428), the costs amount in consequence to
USD 504,000.

In sum, Burlington is liable to compensate Ecuador for Jaguar 2 in an amount of
USD 2,610,000.

use approach (section 4.3.2.c),'%“ there is a vanadium exceedance next to the oil/water
separator at the southeastern corner of the platform.'*** There would also be an
exceedance under agricultural land use criteria.

The Jaguar 3 well was drilled by Oryx in 1994 and was active until 2005. '*“* There is no
record of historical spills for this site.'*° GSI only mentioned a “small crude oil spill of
approximately 3 barrels” in 2002 next to the power oil unit, flowing to the west of the
site.'*“ According to GSI, contaminated soil was removed and replaced with clean
soil.'**” Further, the Tribunal notes that no soil samples were taken on the occasion of
the 2008 Environmental Audit."“® Neither were samples taken for the 2006
Environmental Audit, although the well had stopped producing one year before; it would
thus have been the appropriate time to verify the environmental condition of that site.'%“°
Finally, the Tribunal notes that the 2008 Environmental Audit mentioned that perimeter
drains and grease traps were poorly managed.'*°°

Because the barium and vanadium exceedances are situated in a different location than
the 2002 spill, the Tribunal holds that Burlington did not rebut the presumption that it
caused these exceedances and shall bear the cost of remediation.

As to the measurement and costs, the total impacted area is 280 m?; with a 2-meter
depth at the platform exceedance, the total volume of soil 360 m°. Including a 20%
contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost is USD 129.600 for Jaguar 3.

GSI concedes that secondary forest with scattered agricultural use surrounds the platform. In the
Tribunal’s view, aerial photographs and satellite imagery show that the platform is generally
surrounded by dense forest. See: GSI ER1, App. L.41.1, p. 5, Figure L.41.3 and Att. L.41.A-

regulated under RAOHE (TPH, cadmium, lead and nickel) and residential use for
barium.'*° It otherwise applied agricultural land use criteria to other locations off the
platform. On that basis, it found no exceedances to the west of the CPF, but identified a
series of cadmium, lead and nickel exceedances in three pockets to the east and
southeast of Jaguar 5/CPF. The first pocket is located to the east of the CPF and shows
cadmium and nickel exceedances."**’ The second is adjacent to the southeast corner of
Jaguar 5 with a lead and a cadmium exceedance.'** The third pocket is yet further

southeast with six sampling points showing cadmium exceedances. '*°°

The historical record of spills evidences four relatively minor crude oil spills in 1996, two

at an API separator, one at the sump, and a fourth one at an unspecified location. °° In

this context, the Tribunal is struck by an e-mail written by Mr. Saltos to his supervisor in
2008. That communication relates to water releases and requests “immediate corrective
actions” before an inspection to avoid having “to regret unfavorable reports”. It further
recommends not to create “too much attention around these works (military?), so that
there is no resistance, and so that it cannot be documentea’."**' The e-mail continues
referring to the need to clean the banks of the creek for about 100 meters in the
following terms:

“Discharge of served waters from a plant (grey water????)... We have to
clean the banks of the canal, about 100 meters below the discharge,
clean the grease trap, confirm parameters; we have to take into account
that we already have NC+ included in the 2008 audit, precisely due to

Accordingly, the Tribunal did not apply, as GSI did, industrial limits to the following sample

ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD and FINE which we have yet to know who

will pay (7) or who we will impose it on (?)”."9
In his e-mail, Mr. Saltos also mentioned the need to review the “site destined to
treatment of contaminated soil” so as to ensure that “the containment ditches and
grease traps are operating well’, or else — so he suggested — “we have to construct
them immediately’."°°°
In light of this evidence, the Tribunal finds Burlington fully liable for the exceedances
identified at this site, i.e. the vanadium exceedance and the off platform exceedances to
the east and southeast of Jaguar 5/CPF.

Since the volumes of soil to be remediated and the remediation costs as calculated by
the Tribunal exceed the amount claimed by Ecuador,'* the Tribunal grants the full
amount claimed for Jaguar 5/CPF, namely USD 307,302.

Ecuador claims USD 1,101,436 to remediate 1,017 m® covering an area of 790 m2,‘
Although Burlington recognizes that 110 m° of soil may require remediation for a cost of

1996.'° This said, Burlington accepts to pay USD 100,000 for well site abandonment

As seen in paragraph 662 above, Ecuador only claims the remediation of 230.10 m% of soil
covering an area of 177 m?. The Tribunal identified one vanadium exceedance on the platform
and a series of nickel and cadmium exceedances in three pockets to the southeast and east of
the platform. The remediation of the exceedance, for instance, at sample point 7-JAG-5-229-MS-
B-1,5 would already have warranted recovering 400 mé of soil, exceeding the volume claimed by
Ecuador.

In line with its land use methodology (section 4.3.2.c), since the Consortium had
committed to abandon the platform, the Tribunal applied agricultural criteria to all
sampling locations at this site. On that basis and accepting that the area designated by
GSI as Area 2P is a mud pit,'*”' the Tribunal identified three barium exceedances along
a creek to the east of the platform in the area designated as Area 1M.'°”

Id., Figure L.42.8.

The pit closure report of 1996 mentions that the pit is located outside the platform. At the Site
Visit, IEMS confirmed that Area 2P is indeed a pit. See: Pasos y procedimientos ejecutados para

Burlington relies on Mr. Saltos’s testimony to argue that Area 1M was impacted during
the drilling of the Jaguar 7 and 8 wells by Oryx in 1996.'°”° The historical record shows
a 30 barrel crude oil spill on 1 December 1996 at the hydraulic unit, of which all 30
barrels were recovered.'*” On the other hand, Ecuador alleges that the Consortium

conducted a workover on the Jaguar 7 wel
November 2005 the Consortium carried out workover # 5 at that well, which involved
drilling into the Napo “U” reservoir.'*”° GSI moreover notes that “an oil spill from Jaguar
8 occurred in approximately 2008 [from an on site power oil unit], but did not extend
beyond the platform area”.'°” In addition, according to Ecuador's witness, Mr. Solis and
contemporaneous documentary evidence, an unreported spill occurred on 1 February
2004 when 20 gallons of a “blend of crude, oil and water were discharged into the sump

of the Jaguar 7-8 and the surrounding area’.'°”* The Tribunal finally notes that no soil

1379
it,

samples were taken for the 2008 Environmental Audi although the audit noted that

1380
d

the perimeter drains and grease traps were poorly maintaine and that the flow lines

lacked cleaning. '**"

Faced with this record, the Tribunal holds that Burlington has not rebutted the
presumption of causation. As a result, Burlington is fully liable for the environmental
condition at Jaguar 7/8 and Burlington shall therefore pay the amount for remediating
Area 1M.

Mr. Saltos also presented evidence showing that he conducted authorized water discharges into
the environment in 1996, when he was working for Oryx. See: Saltos WS2, 4 89; Acta de
certificacion de agua tratadas del pozo Jaguar 7-8, 24 August 1996 (Exh. CE-CC-288).

Coming now to the assessment of the impacted soil and remediation costs, GSI
delineated an area of 110 m?2'%® (as shown in the picture appearing in paragraph 671
above), which the Tribunal increases to 200 m? to include a part of the cliff going up to
the oil/water separator. The volume of soil is 200 m°. Adding a 30% contingency (see
paragraph 428), the remediation cost thus amounts to USD 78,000 for Jaguar 7/8.

Ecuador claims USD 38,317,842 to remediate 38,411.10 m° of soil covering an area of

IEMS are situated in a pit and that otherwise there are no exceedances at this site.'**

that there are no exceedances at this site under any regulatory criteria."°°° Accordingly,
Ecuador's claim is dismissed.

explanation that sample MS-LOB-C3-1.3-1,20 is in reality located within the mud pit to
the northwest of the platform. '%®?

On that basis and without regard to pit soil at this stage of the analysis, the Tribunal
finds that no exceedances exist at this site under any regulatory criteria. Accordingly,
Ecuador's claim for non-pit soil remediation is dismissed.

During the Site Visit, the Tribunal was able to see first hand the land use at the
allegedly impacted areas around Mono CPF. On such basis and in accordance with its
methodology (section 4.3.2.c), it applied sensitive ecosystem criteria to off platform
sampling locations to the southeast, east and northeast of the platform of Mono 1-
5/CPF."°°° Because sampling points to the northeast of the platform are in proximity of a
residential area of the San Justo community, the Tribunal applied residential criteria
governed by TULAS for barium.’ Finally, the Tribunal also applied sensitive
ecosystem criteria to sample points at the northwestern corner of the platform along a

drainage flowing into a creek.'“*"

The sampling results show the poor environmental condition of a drainage area at the
southeast corner of the platform designated by GSI as Area 3MT and of another area
further north just uphill on the other side of a ridge identified as Area 2M.'*” There are

disposal well by injection”. GSI ER1, App. L.50, p. 3.

first to Area 2M. Indeed, GSI initially explained that these muds and cuttings “were
possibly discharged to the land surface east of the facility’, corresponding to Area
2M." During the Site Visit, Mr. Chaves from IEMS suggested that Area 2M is a pit,
and that it is leaking its contents into Area 3MT, which lays further southwards and
downhill.'*"" In view of the statement of Mr. Chaves on the existence of a pit, the high
levels of metal concentrations (the barium level exceeds 10,000 mg/kg, the cadmium
level is above 11 mg/kg and the lead level exceeds 938 mg/kg), and the depth of the
contamination (down to the lowest samples at 2.6 meters),'*’? the Tribunal accepts
IEMS’s statement that Area 2M is a pit. It will thus address this area in its analysis of
mud pits (see paragraph 811 below).

Turning now to the other areas where exceedances have been identified, the Tribunal

starts out by noting that the Mono 1 well was put on standby and then reactivated by

1413

the Consortium following a workover,’ which may also explain the presence of barium

and other chemicals in areas surrounding the platform.'*’* In addition, Mr. Saltos
confirmed at the Hearing that Mono 1 was used as an injection well, meaning that

produced water was injected into the well by using the power oil unit located next to the

grease trap on the southeastern corner.'*"

GSI ER1, App. L.50, p. 3. GSI further suggested that, in addition to the exceedances in Area 2M
allegedly caused by drilling mud discharges in 1989, that exceedances in Area 3MT were
caused by drilling mud discharges and an oil spill in 1996. See: GSI ER1, § 271(2) and Table 4;
GSI ER2, Table 4. For Burlington's submission on causation at the Site Visit, see: Tr. Site Visit

electrosubmersible pumps, but also involving the use of chemicals, such as workovers ## 10-12.

The historical record of spills shows numerous incidents at Mono 1/CPF over the years,
quite a few more during the Consortium’s time than under prior operators.'*'® For
instance, GSI only mentions a 1 barrel spill in 1997 at the API separator pump under
the operatorship of Petroproduccion.'*'” By contrast, the record evinces a 12 barrel
crude oil spill at the Mono 4 well pad on 29 March 2005,‘"® a 7 barrel crude oil spill at

the power oil unit on 8 October 2005,'4°

and a 30 barrel crude oil and produced water
spill at the booster pump on 7 July 2008.'*”° In addition, Ecuador's witness, Mr. Solis,
testified to an unreported (but documented) 11 barrel crude oil spill which happened on
28 April 2008 as a result of a mechanical failure in the power oil unit.'“" Finally,
Burlington made reference to a spill in 2011 under Petroamazonas, but the record
shows that this last spill affected the area to the northeast of the platform, where the
Tribunal did not identify any exceedances.‘

With respect to Area 3MT more specifically, it is noteworthy that GSI initally reported no
impact at that location and that prior spills had all been remediated. It in particular noted
as follows:

“Historical spills prior to and in 2007 occurred at the oil trap in the
southeast corner of the facility and were reported and remediated
appropriately. At the time of GSI inspection, this area (located
approximately 50 m to the east of the CPF fence line) was covered by
dense grass, low brush, and trees. GSI found no evidence of oil staining
or sheen on the water or sediments, even when sediments were
disturbed”."*7°

GSI further added:

“Further downstream, in an area near the southeast corner of the CPF,

natural/organic iron bacteria was present and visible in the base of the

stream. No evidence of impact was observed and the area appeared to

be properly remediated”."“
The cross-examination of Mr. Saltos, however, brought to light a number of relevant
facts. First, Mr. Saltos stated that the Consortium conducted workovers at the Mono 1
well.'*?° Second, he testified that there “is a certain tendency to problems” with power
oil pumps, which are “problem-prone”.'“”° Third, Mr. Saltos confirmed that the power oil
unit is close to the grease trap on the southeastern corner of the platform."“”” Fourth, he
agreed that, if a spill occurred due to problems with the power oil unit, then the
production water mixed with crude oil flows towards that grease trap." This is in
particular so because the grease trap on the southeastern corner of the platform is at
the “lowest end of the platform”.'*” Fifth, Mr. Saltos stated that five barrels of oil
migrated outside the platform on 5 July 2008." Sixth, he explained that Annex A of his
witness statement does not list “all of the spills that were not to be reported”, meaning
spills which discharge less than 5 barrels or which remain within the confines of the
platform were not listed.'“*' When asked whether there were other incidents at Mono
CPF during the Consortium’s operations, Mr. Saltos responded — in an open manner
that the Tribunal appreciated — “Yes, unfortunately”. Finally, Mr. Saltos did not
dispute Mr. Solis’ characterization of the situation at Mono CPF as “critical” and
acknowledged that Mr. Solis had requested “urgent repairs” at that site in 2008. ‘°°

In light of this record, the Tribunal cannot but hold Burlington liable for the
environmental condition in Area 3MT. Even if the drainage and creek were remediated
by the Consortium, as Burlington alleges, this remediation obviously was insufficient.
Burlington’s liability also covers the pockets of exceedances in Area 3MT on the other
side uphill of the creek. Indeed, since these exceedances are uphill, they cannot be
linked to the exceedances in the creek and the only explanation seems to be that they
are the product of willful discharges in the environment, rather than the product of
accidental spills. '4%*

Finally, Burlington has not sought to dispute causation in respect of Area 1M. As a
result, it must be deemed liable for the environmental condition of that location and bear
the remediation cost.

Going over to the assessment on impacted soil and remediation costs, the Tribunal
makes the following findings always in accordance with its general approach explained
above (sections 4.4.3.c and 4.5.2):

i. GSI estimated that Area 3MT comprises two impacted pockets of 700 m? in total
(see picture in paragraph 685 above).'*°° In light of the elevated exceedance
levels and considering that GSI put dirty borings back into the ground instead of
testing them," the Tribunal extended the impacted area of 3MT to 1,000 m? to
cover both sides of the creek. Moreover, considering that GSI discarded its own
delineation sample with a chromium exceedance when delineating the impacted
area uphill on the other side of the creek, the Tribunal added an impacted area of
300 m? at that location. The total volume of soil in the creek area is thus 1,000 m°

Although GSI suggested during the Site Visit that the samples may be mislocated, GSI accepted
these exceedance points and delineated around them. Tr. Site Visit (Day 3) (ENG), 100:20-
101:2 (Tribunal, Bianchi at Mono CPF). See also: C-PSVB, 9§ 33, 43 and note 108. The Tribunal
agrees with IEMS that these exceedances most likely occurred during a separate incident,
unrelated to the other exceedances in the creek in Area 3MT. See: Tr. Site Visit (Day 3) (ENG),
81:21-82:17 (Tribunal, Chaves at Mono CPF). In any event, GSI’s theory that IEMS’s samples
may be mislocated is proven wrong by GSI’s own delineation sample which revealed a
chromium exceedance (sample MOCPF-3MT-11-(1.0-2.0)). See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.50.5
and Figure L.50.5.

More specifically, GSI calculated for Area 3MT an impacted area of 700 m? for barium in the 0-1
meter layer, and of 630 m? in the 1-2 meter layer. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.50.8 and Att.
L.50.E, Table L.50.E.1 and Figures L.50.E.A.1, L.50.E.B.1; GSI ER2, Table 4.

GSI noted the following in its field forms: “Had to move up the bank and upstream (about
1 meter each). First location had a moderate to strong chem odor (Mono CPF)”. See: R-PHB,
4 365; GSI Log Book for sample MOCPF-3MT-04, 8 March 2012, p. 1 (Exh. E-475).

and in the area uphill 600 m3. With a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the
total remediation cost for Area 3MT thus amounts to USD 624,000.

ii. | The impacted area around the two exceedance points in Area 1M is 400 m?; the
total volume of soil 400 ms; and, with a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the
total cost is USD 156,000.

In sum, the total cost payable by Burlington for Mono 1-5/CPF is USD 780,000.

will address pit soil separately below, it already notes that this one barium exceedance
is insufficient to prove Ecuador's allegation that the pit is leaking. Indeed, barium could

well have spilled over during the closure process.'““*

a GSI concedes that secondary forest borders the southern edge of the platform, but noted in

2012 that a “[rJecently cleared area” to the east is used for agriculture. Satellite imagery of 2010

Furthermore, there is no record of spills during the operations of the Consortium, except
for a spill in 2009 which IEMS located to the northwest of the platform near the oil trap
and which is thus unrelated to the barium exceedance situated next to the pit. On that
basis, the Tribunal holds that Burlington bears no liability for this site as regards non-pit
soil.

Applying its general approach to land use (section 4.3.2.c) and thus sensitive
ecosystem criteria in this instance,'**' the Tribunal identified one exceedance point in
the area designated by GSI as Area 1MT, located to the north of the platform and
beyond the northeastern corner of a mud pit, with levels of TPH, barium, cadmium and
lead exceeding permissible limits. In addition, one sample collected by GSI has a
chromium level of 65 mg/kg and thus complies with permissible limits. “°°

The Mono 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 wells were drilled by Oryx between 1996 and 1997."** Oryx
also built and closed the mud pit on the northern side of the platform.'*° The historical

1456

record of spills shows several pre-Consortium spills and two relatively minor

unreported spills during the Consortium’s operatorship, namely a 1 barrel crude oil spill
in 2006 at the Mono 6 high pressure line and a 2.5 barrel crude oil spill on 12 July 2007
at the Mono 6 tank."“*” In addition, Mr. Solis mentioned a rupture in the flow line from

Mono Sur, although he was unable to recall the exact date of that incident."4°*

In light of the high barium levels at the IEMS sample location, the exceedances
identified above appear unrelated to these crude oil spills. Considering further that the

GSI states that secondary forest is located to the west of the platform, but observes that
agriculture is located to the north. IEMS notes that the platform is “mainly surrounded by jungle
and estuary”. The satellite imagery does not confirm the presence of agriculture to the north of
the platform, in particular in Area 1MT. Accordingly, the Tribunal applied sensitive ecosystem
criteria to Area 1MT and to sampling locations to the west and southwest of the platform. See:

Consortium conducted well workovers at this site’

and that the heavy metals
exceedance levels are highest in the upper soil layer implying that contamination is
relatively recent, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the presumption of

causation is not rebutted and Burlington’s liability is established.

Applying linear interpolation, GSI calculated a depth-integrated impacted area of 250 m?
and a volume of soil of 610 m® (see picture in paragraph 705 above). More
specifically, GSI calculated for barium an area of 220 m? in the 0-1 meter layer, 240 m?
in the 1-2 meter layer, and 130 m2 in the 2-3 meter layer.'“* In addition, GSI calculated
for TPH an area of 10 m? in the 0-1 and 1-2 meter layers within the area of the barium
exceedance.

Since the depth-integrated area calculated by GSI reaches clean sample points, the
Tribunal accepts in principle the size of the impacted area. This said, it collapses all
three layers to calculate the volume of soil, since there is not much difference between
the respective areas of the three layers.

As a consequence, the total impacted area is 250 m? and the total volume of soil is
750 ms. Considering a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost payable by
Burlington is USD 292,500 for Mono Sur/6-9, 11.

Ecuador claims USD 22,624,698 to remediate 22,694.10 m® of soil covering an area of

parameters exceed correct regulatory criteria.'“°*

The record confirms that the Consortium conducted two workovers at the Mono 9 well, the first
involving drilling activities. In 2003, workover # 5 was unsuccessful in its attempt to change the
zone from the Upper Hollin to the Napo “U” reservoir; and in 2007, workover # 6 involved
another evaluation of the Napo “U” reservoir. See: Well Workovers on Blocks 7 and 21 dated

714. — Applying its general approach to land use (section 4.3.2.c) and leaving pit soil aside for
present purposes, there are no exceedances on the Oso 1 platform or the other
facilities of the CPF measured at industrial land use criteria. Further, referring to

 

 

 

sensitive ecosystem criteria to off platform areas to the northwest, north, northeast and
east of the CPF,"®” the Tribunal identified several cadmium exceedances in two
discrete sampling locations to the northwest'*® and in two locations to the east.'*®

Finally, applying agricultural land use criteria around the flare, the Tribunal identified
1470

two locations with cadmium exceedances.
The exact date when Oso 1 was drilled is unclear. GSI indicated that it was drilled by
BP in 1970, but it appears more probable that BP drilled it in 1988 as stated by
IEMS."*”' Be this as it may, it is largely irrelevant for present purposes, since Mr. Saltos
testified at the Hearing that this was a standby well which the Consortium put back into
operation, notably by conducting workovers.'*” In addition, there is evidence of a 14
barrel crude oil spill on 24 April 2003 at the Oso 1 storage tank, a 7 barrel crude oil spill
on 25 January 2004 at the Oso CPF tank pit, and a 4 barrel crude oil spill on 22 July
2004 at the Oso CPF tank.'*” The record also shows that equipment failure caused a
35 barrel spill on 6 August 2004 at the transfer pipeline in the Oso field, although the
exact location is not clear.'4” Finally, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Solis mentioned a
post-Consortium diesel spill on 1 September 2009 “apparently caused by an improperly
closed valve on the tanker truck” along the road some 300 meters away from the
CPF.'475

The Tribunal also observed that Mr. Solis testified that he informed his superior in 2007
and 2008 that production levels at Oso CPF had reached a “critical point” and that none
of his suggestions to limit the risk were followed, which resulted in a “series of incidents
at the Oso CPF station around the beginning of September (including a spill from one of

the tanks — which one operator did not close correctly)”."4”°

Since the Oso Field was primarily developed and operated by the Consortium and the
diesel spill on 1 September 2009 appears unrelated to the cadmium exceedances
identified above, the Tribunal holds Burlington liable for remediating the environmental
condition around the CPF.

In line with the Tribunal’s methodology, the total impacted area around exceedance
points to the northwest and east of the CPF is 800 m? and the total volume of soil is
1,400 m3.'*”’ With a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total remediation cost
for these locations is USD 546,000. The impacted area around the flare is 400 m? and
the total volume of soil 800 m3. With a 20% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total
remediaton cost is USD 288,000.

In sum, the total remediation cost awarded amounts to USD 834,000 for Oso 1/CPF.

 

tr. Oso 9, 12, 15-20

Ecuador claims USD 22,257,459 to remediate 25,599.60 m? covering an estimated area
of 7,566 m2."*” Burlington disputes this claim arguing that IEMS collected nearly all its
samples within mud pits and that otherwise all sample results comply with regulatory
criteria.'4”

The Tribunal notes that IEMS collected 127 samples at Oso 9'®° and that Ecuador
does not dispute that only one was taken outside the pit area. It will deal with pit soil at
this location separately (see paragraphs 797-798, 800, 826-830 below). With respect to
non-pit soil, and applying agricultural land use criteria to off platform locations, the
Tribunal observes that there are no exceedances at this site.'“®’ Accordingly, Ecuador's
claim as it relates to non-pit soil is dismissed.

The impacted area to the northwest of the platform is 400 m? and with a depth of 2 meters the
volume of soil is 800 m%. The impacted area to the east of the platform is 400 m? and with a
depth of 2 meters at one sample location and 1 meter at the second, the volume of soil is
600 m°.

Yuralpa Pad A is one of the two sites where, according to Burlington, GSI cannot
definitively exclude that the Consortium caused the observed exceedances in an area
designated as Area 2M." For Burlington, the exceedances are either due to drilling
activities in 1997 or to Consortium operations between 2003 and 2006."*** Burlington
also observes that Petroamazonas has been drilling on Yuralpa Pad A." As to
quantification, Burlington estimates the impacted area to be 100 m?, the volume of soil
100 m3, and the remediation cost USD 110,000."

Yuralpa Pad A was initially developed by Oryx in 1997 and further expanded by the
Consortium when it put the standby Centro 1 well back into operation and drilled wells
A2 to A11."? Burlington did not refer to post-Consortium activities and could not
exclude the Consortium’s liability, but suggested that exceedances may be related to
Oryx’s drilling activities.“ In view of the fact that the Consortium developed this
platform and that the exceedances are likely linked to an overflow of the oil/water
separator, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Burlington did not rebut the causation
presumption and is liable for the environmental condition in Area 2M.

To quantify the impact and costs, GSI calculated an impacted area of 100 m? (see
picture in paragraph 724 above) and estimated a volume of 100 m*® requiring
remediation."“°° The Tribunal considers that the impacted area must be increased to
200 m”. It extends the area downhill because GSI’s delineation sample YUPA-2M-3 on
the downward slope shows a barium level above permissible limits. The total volume of
soil is thus 200 m*. With a 30% contingency (see paragraph 428), the total cost of
remediation to be borne by Burlington is USD 78,000 for Yuralpa Pad A.

Yuralpa Pad D was drilled by the Consortium in 2006.'® The record evinces that the
Consortium conducted workovers on wells D1 to D3." At the same time, Mr. Saltos
testified that Petroamazonas had expanded operations by drilling new wells at
Pad D,'® which Ecuador did not challenge. On that basis, the Tribunal considers that
Burlington’s liability is engaged, but that the consequences of Petroamazonas’s
expansion cannot be disregarded. Accordingly, it holds Burlington liable for 50% of the
remediation costs.

The impacted area is 240 m? and the total volume of soil is 480 m°.'°°° Adding a 20%

In line with its land use approach (section 4.3.2.c) and thus applying sensitive
ecosystem criteria," the Tribunal identified elevated TPH levels at two exceedance
points around the oiljwater separator.'©*° At one exceedance point, TPH levels reach
23,219 mgj/kg.'’ It is true that GSI could not confirm these TPH levels in its
confirmation samples.'°** However, the Tribunal notes that these confirmation samples
were taken at a distance of 0.86 and 1.36 meters respectively from IEMS sample

The Nemoca injection well was drilled by Oryx in 1999.'°*' There are no records of
historical spills. Nor are there barium exceedances that would indicate contamination
caused by drilling activities. This said, because the exceedance points are close to the
oil/water separator, the most likely cause would appear to be an incident involving
crude oil overflowing from the oil/water separator on the southeastern corner of the
platform. On this basis, the Tribunal considers that Burlington has not rebutted the
presumption that the Consortium caused this harm. Therefore, the Tribunal holds
Burlington liable for these remediation costs.

Considering the proximity of sample 21-NEMOC-SD02-R to the oil/water separator, and
also considering GSI’s sampling,’ the Tribunal determined a total impacted area of
350 m? and a total volume of soil of 850 m®.'®** With a 30% contingency (see paragraph
428), the total cost amounts to USD 331,500 for Nemoca.

Ecuador claims USD 523,648 to remediate 447.20 m° of soil covering an area of
344 m2.‘ Burlington challenges this claim arguing that there are no exceedances of
regulatory criteria at that site.'5*

Applying sensitive ecosystem land use criteria to off platform locations and leaving pit
soil aside in this context, the Tribunal identified no exceedances at that site.‘
Accordingly, Ecuador's claim for the remediation of non-pit soil is dismissed.

5. Mud pits
5.1. Ecuador’s position

Ecuador claims that all the mud pits in the Blocks, to the exception of those built and
maintained by Petroamazonas, must be remediated “as any other contaminated soil
within the Blocks”.'®°” According to Ecuador, Burlington accepted at the Hearing that the
mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 contain “significantly high levels of contamination”. °° For
Ecuador, these mud pits are “environmental ticking bombs” that need to be

1539
d,

remediate: in particular since it was demonstrated that “some of the pits have

already collapsed, leaked or leached contamination to the surrounding areas”.'*“°
According to Ecuador, concentrations in the mud pits exceed both background values
and the values for sensitive ecosystems, in some cases even the highest regulatory
levels for industrial soil, as the Coca 8 pits show with concentrations exceeding
103,000 mg/kg of TPH."**' And GSI’s “limited visual assessment” is insufficient to
dismiss “the evidence of breached or collapsed mud pits as well as the risks of further
collapse, leaking and leaching”.'°4?

For Ecuador, there is overwhelming evidence showing that “pits were not properly
constructed, maintained or closed by the Consortium” and that they are releasing
contamination into the environment.’ In addition to checking the design and
construction of mud pits, IEMS took 488 soil samples of mud pits in 37 platforms (32 in
Block 7 and 5 in Block 21) and 126 soil samples in areas close to these mud pits.'“* By
contrast, says Ecuador, GSI acknowledged the existence of only 158 of the 226 mud
pits in both Blocks in July 2009 and limited itself to a visual inspection and to taking
9 leachate samples from 7 closed pits.

Ecuador argues that GSl’s limited leachate testing is premised on four erroneous
assumptions, namely that all pits are constructed with liners, that all liners are intact,
that the pit contents were properly treated before pit closure, and that the Consortium
complied with applicable regulations. Ecuador rebuts these assumptions, submitting as

follows:'5“

(i) GSI adduced no evidence of the proper construction, maintenance and
verification of the mud pits; (ii) the Consortium had no written policy of mud pit
treatment, as admitted by Perenco and evidenced by the fact that Burlington does not
even know the correct number of mud pits located in the Blocks; (iii) Consortium
employees confirmed that pits had not been properly constructed, which is well
illustrated by the mud pit in Coca 8; (iv) the record shows that only 34 out of the
226 mud pits are lined (but not necessarily adequately maintained), Oso 9 providing a
good example of unlined pits;'™“® (v) the pits were not properly maintained; (vi) some
pits were not reported or properly closed, as confirmed by Mr. Saltos in relation to
Payamino 16;'°’ and (vii) the mud pits were not properly monitored, as evidenced by
Mr. Saltos’s statement that the Consortium did not test the mud pits six months after

closure as required by Table 7 of RAOHE."*®

It is further undisputed, according to Ecuador, that there were incidents at a number of
1549,

pits and that some are leaking:
e Individuals have been affected by leaks from pits at Coca 4, Payamino 1, Oso A,
and Gacela 2;

e The Waiponi Ocatoe pit collapsed in 2002/2003 and the Condor Norte pit partially
collapsed in 2006, as acknowledged by Mr. Saltos;

«The eastern part of the Mono CPF platform contains discharges of drilling mud and
cuttings, as admitted by GSI;

R-PHB, {I 460-480.

Id., § 466. Ecuador states that evidence shows that 33 pits are not lined, and that there is no
evidence that the remaining 159 pits are lined.

Payamino 5, Chonta 1, Nemoca 1, Coca 15, Payamino 23, Payamino 24, Jaguar 9, Coca 18,

e The southern part of the closed pit in Coca 8 contains drilling mud beyond the
boundaries of the pit, as admitted by GSI;

¢ The lining is perforated in the pit of the Payamino 8 well, as discovered by IEMS;

«The pits in Coca 18/19 have released their contents; and

¢ The pit in Mono 10/12 is leaking.'**°

These instances thus bely GSI’s assumptions, argues Ecuador, as they show that mud
pits are bound to collapse or leak and thus contaminate the environment for
generations to come, unless tested and restored as regular soil.

Finally, Ecuador submits that Burlington never considered the groundwater effects
around mud pits, notwithstanding the fact that mud pits are usually 4.5 meters deep and
that the water table is between 1 and 3 meters deep.'**' Accordingly, mud pits are in
direct contact with groundwater. Even if the depth of some pits had been reduced, such
as in Oso A, this did not prevent contact with groundwater due to the fluctuation of the
water level and of the risk of leaking or leaching.

5.2 Burlington’s position

For its part, Burlington argues that IEMS improperly passed off mud pit soil as regular
soil. Specifically, IEMS collected samples from closed mud pits and subjected them to
the testing methodology and regulatory criteria applicable to regular soils. As a result,
Ecuador's counterclaims have yet again been grossly inflated.

Burlington contends that one fifth of IEMS’s soil samples were collected from mud pits,
none of which should be used to ascertain purported contamination in the Blocks.'5°?
Thus, Burlington rejects Ecuador's claim to remove all mud pits, but accepts that four
open and unused pits at three sites (Coca 8, Coca 4 and Payamino 5) must be closed

for a total cost of USD 68,000, assuming that “the pits will require placement and

area
More specifically, Burlington argues that mud pits are not to be equated with regular soil
and IEMS erroneously collected 624 samples from within pits."%* Mud pits are
approved containment areas designed precisely to contain the discharge of industrial
substances — such as drilling muds, barium and cuttings. They of course contain higher
levels of potential contaminants than does non-pit soil; that is their purpose. It thus
makes sense to subject mud pits to regulatory criteria different from those for regular
soils. Thus, permissible levels of contaminants for mud pits are provided in the less
restrictive Table 7 of RAOHE, whereas the more restrictive limits for regular soils are
found in Table 6.

In this context, Burlington further argues that Ecuador itself has acknowledged in the
past that Table 7 is the applicable regulatory standard for mud pits. Burlington points to
the fact that IEMS also applied Table 7 to mud pits in its expert report for the City
Oriente arbitration while IEMS incorrectly applied Table 6 to mud pits in the present
arbitration.'®° In any event, Burlington argues that Ecuador’s concerns regarding the
hazards associated with pits are “misplaced” because “[p]its are not inherently harmful
to the environment” since their contents are “stable and non-toxic”.'°°*

For Burlington, IEMS has also applied the wrong methodology to test mud pit samples.
The proper test consists in ascertaining whether the mud pit contents can “leach”
impermissible amounts of substances into groundwater sources.'°°” However, IEMS did
not perform a single leachate test for any of its 624 mud pit samples.'** Further
evincing its biased approach, IEMS omitted testing mud pits built by Petroamazonas.
GSI also indicates that, except for barium, the metal concentrations in the 624 pit

CMCC, 99 318-321.

Rejoinder, § 134 (emphasis in the original).

Accordingly, says Burlington, the regulatory units are different for regular soils and for mud pits.
For regular soils, Table 6 of RAOHE tests solids and hence measures permissible
concentrations in mg/kg. For mud pits, on the other hand, Table 7 of RAOHE tests liquids
leached and thus sets forth maximum limits in mg/l. See: CMCC, § 324.

samples collected by IEMS are below background levels in clean natural soils."5°

Therefore, says GSI, “releases of pit materials to surrounding clean soils could not
cause an increase in concentrations of cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, and vanadium
above levels already present in the soils”, and only elevated barium levels in soils
surrounding pits may signal pit releases.'5°°

Burlington further opposes Ecuador’s argument that each mud pit constructed before
July 2009 must be “dug up, moved off site, and re-buried” as wholly unsupported by
regulations, local practice, and sound science.'®*' The use of pits for permanent on site
disposal is common practice in Ecuador and around the world. In fact, Table 7 was
precisely crafted for this purpose; it conclusively shows that pit soil is subject to different
limits than regular soil.

In Burlington’s view, Ecuador is also mistaken in claiming that all dry pits must comply
both with Tables 6 and 7. Indeed, the introductory paragraph of Article 59, a provision
on pit remediation, clarifies that that provision “applies only to a special category of
pits”, namely those that contain weathered crude or that were poorly managed, which is
not the case of the Consortium’s pits. °°"

For Burlington, properly closed pits, i.e., those that were dehydrated, compacted and
covered with clean soil and new vegetation, “do not fall within the ambit of Article 59
and need not be remediated”.'®® This is confirmed by practice, especially by the fact
that the Ecuadorian authorities have never requested compliance with both Tables 6
and 7 on the ground of Article 59.'°°* Ecuador's attempt to introduce a barium standard
from TULAS so as to apply it to pits “blatantly disregards RAOH’s supremacy in

(p. 16), Coca 13 (p. 17) and Payamino Sanitary Landfill (p. 32)). For a comparison of IEMS
samples to the regulatory criteria applied by GSI, see: GSI ER1, App. F.4.

regulating matters specific to hydrocarbons operations”, especially since TULAS
1565

contains no provisions on pits.
Finally, in Burlington’s submission, Ecuador is also wrong to claim that all pits should be
subject to the more stringent Table 7a for unlined pits, since it was the Consortium’s
practice to build all pits with synthetic liners, as Mr. Saltos confirmed, and historical pits
do not leak since they are lined with clay soils, as GSI indicated.'®® In sum, Ecuador is
seeking to impose remediation costs on Burlington which have never been applied to
date.'®°” Accordingly, Burlington requests the Tribunal to dismiss Ecuador's claim to

have all pits removed or remediated.

5.3 Discussion

The Parties essentially diverge on whether mud pits must be removed from the Blocks,
whether Table 6 applies in addition to Table 7, and whether Consortium pits were
always lined. The Tribunal will start by discussing the applicable regulatory framework
(5.3.1). It then addresses the condition of the pits in the Blocks (5.3.2 to 5.3.6), before
drawing conclusions with respect to potential remediation and the costs thereof (5.3.7
and 5.3.8).

5.3.1. Regulatory framework

RAOHE expressly regulates the use of mud pits for hydrocarbons operations. Article 12
provides that oilfield operators must undertake internal monitoring, including by
remediating contaminated mud pits. Article 16 further provides that mud pit remediation
programs must be authorized by the Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection at
DINAPA. Article 28(c) prohibits the uncontrolled disposal of any types of wastes,
specifying that pits used for final disposal must include an appropriate canalization
system to control leachates.'*® Article 58(b) prohibits any disposal of production test
fluids in pits.

The Glossary in RAOHE Annex 6 defines leachates (“lixiviado”) as follows: “Solution resulting
from the transport of water through the pores or cracks in the soil or other solid and porous
media and the physico-chemical interactions of this water with the mineral and organic
components of the soil” (Translation by the Tribunal) (Exh. EL-174).

Article 52(d.2) is entitled “[o]f the treatment and final disposal of drilling fluids and
cuttings”. Article 52(d.2)(2.1) provides that any drill site must include a system for the
treatment and disposal of fluids and solids generated during drilling operations. More
specifically, Article 52(d.2)(2.3) states that, during and after the drilling, all solid wastes,
including muds and cuttings “can be disposed once they comply with the parameters

and limits in Table 7”.'°®

Article 59 specifically deals with the treatment and closure of pits. It specifies that, in
case of pits containing weathered crude or badly maintained pits, the operator must
proceed to cleaning and treating the pit content, recuperating the crude, and then
sealing and revegetating the area with native species. For pits containing crude and/or
water, Article 59 provides that the crude will be recuperated for subsequent use, that
any crude that could not be recuperated would be treated either in the pit or ex situ
preferably through bioremediation, that the floor and walls of the pit must be treated
until they comply with Table 6 before rehabilitating the site. For dry pits containing crude
but no water, Article 59 stipulates that they must be remediated until they comply with
Tables 6 and 7.

Table 7 is entitled “[pJermissible limits for leachates for the final disposition of drilling
muds and cuttings on the surface”. In its opening paragraph, Table 7 states that drilling
muds and cuttings destined for “final disposal on the surface” must comply with the
parameters and permissible limits in the table “depending on whether the site of final
disposal contains an impermeable base or not’.'®”? The second paragraph specifies
that, in addition to initial testing, the mud pits must be periodically monitored by taking
leachate samples seven days, three months, and six months after final disposal.

Table 7 is divided into two parts. Part a) applies to pits without impermeable liner and
Part b) applies to lined pits. Table 7 contains the following criteria:

Burlington contends that only Table 7 applies to properly managed mud pits.®”? The
Tribunal has no difficulty finding that Table 7 applies to mud pits and not Table 6
(subject to the provisions in Article 59 to which the Tribunal will revert below). This
follows not only from Article 52(d)(2)(3) which refers only to Table 7,'°”° but also from
the fact that Table 6 applies to soil remediation in general and Table 7 to drilling muds
and cuttings destined for final disposal in pits specifically. This is further confirmed by
the fact that Table 6 provides no criteria for barium, which is the compound most
commonly used to drill wells and thus most commonly found in mud pits, whereas Table

The Tribunal notes IEMS's different point of view when contemplating recourse to either Table 6
or 7 depending on the “timing and purpose of the study”, although IEMS ultimately opined that all
pits should be tested against Table 6 in the present case. “The concentrations of contaminants
in mud pits can be analyzed as per the Table 6 of RAOHE (total concentration) or Table 7
(concentration of contaminants on leachate) depending on the timing and purpose of the study”.

7 specifically regulates barium, in addition to other parameters not contemplated in
Table 6 that are also used in drilling operations, such as chromium and vanadium.

In this context, the Tribunal cannot follow Ecuador’s interpretation of Article 59. It
shares Professor Bedon’s opinion that this provision is not of “general application” to all
mud pits.'°”* The introductory paragraph shows that Article 59 applies to two discrete
situations, namely to pits containing weathered crude and to poorly managed pits. In
these two situations, Article 59 requires the complete remediation of such pits, including
the cleaning of the floor and walls. In such instance, the floor and walls must comply
with Table 6. Further, if a pit is totally removed and backfilled with clean soil, the new
location must comply with Table 6 in addition to Table 7. Or, as Professor Bedén put it,
“the area after the remediation must comply with Table 6 because it becomes regular
soil; but it must also be in accordance with Table 7 to ensure that there are no remnants
of drilling muds that might leach into the subsoil”.'°”°

For all other situations, only Table 7 applies to mud pits."”° Indeed, Table 7
contemplates a different method of analysis than Table 6, since it requires the testing of
leachates “to determine the extent to which barium and other metals in the muds could
potentially be dissolved and carried outside the confines of the pit by water”.'°”’ And as
GSI put it, RAOHE “sets no limit on the total barium concentration in the solidified mud
and soil cuttings enclosed within the pit and does not require the contents of a
mud/cuttings pit be tested in the same manner as non-pit soils, as this would require
these materials to be removed from the very pit in which they were disposed — an
illogical requirement and contrary to accepted practice in the oil industry”.'°”° The fact
that Perenco’s abandonment plan for Block 7 spoke of testing three pit samples from

Id., 4152.

The Tribunal notes IEMS’s mention that, in addition to crude or heavy metals, mud pits might
contain hazardous wastes such as “potassium hydroxide, quicklime, iridium (190), uranium
(191), thorium, strontium (90)”. However, as IEMS concedes, “[t]he contamination of drilling mud
with several of these substances in Blocks 7 and 21 has not been studied”. IEMS ER4, p. 27.
Thus, there is no claim for contamination with hazardous substances other than those listed in
RAOHE Table 7.

Tribunal’s conclusion that only Table 7 applies under applicable law, a conclusion which
is reinforced by Ecuador’s own approval of the Consortium’s pit closure reports that

tested mud pits only against Table 7.'%°°

5.3.2 Removal of pits

This review of the applicable legal framework evinces that the use of mud pits is
common practice in oilfield operations to permanently dispose of drilling muds or
cuttings produced during the drilling of wells or subsequent well workovers. This
follows, for instance, from the term “final disposal” (disposici6n final) in Table 7, making
clear that mud pits serve as permanent disposal grounds.'**' Such practice is also
confirmed by IEMS, according to which the use of mud pits is a common practice in the
oil industry and is a method approved by the Government of Ecuador for the
management and disposal of drilling mud associated with well development.'® The
lawfulness of the practice is also clear when one considers that Petroamazonas has
continued to build mud pits and discharge drilling muds and cuttings into them, for
instance, in Yuralpa Pad G or Oso A (it being noted, once more, that IEMS chose only
to identify the Consortium pits at these locations as RECs).'*** These findings do away
with Ecuador's claim that all mud pits in the Blocks need to be removed.‘

notes that the pit remediation reports for Sacha referred to by Ecuador apply Table 6 precisely
because the pits had to be remediated. They therefore do not support the contention that normal
pit closure requires testing pits against Table 6. See: Letter of 31 August 2006 from Eng.

The conclusion that pits need not be removed is further strengthened by the fact that
Ecuador, although it calls mud pits “ticking time bombs”,'®® has not adduced evidence
of even a single instance where an oilfield operator has been required to remove all
mud pits after the end of operations.

Consequently, there is no reason to remove properly constructed, managed and
approved pits from their actual location. This applies also to approved mud pits located
at the edges of platforms, which are at a higher risk of collapsing due to erosion, such
as the mud pit at Yuralpa Pad A, which the Tribunal had a chance to see during the Site
Visit. Absent proof to the contrary, it must be assumed that these pits are correctly
managed and that any deterioration over the course of time will be adequately
addressed by the current operator.

The situation is obviously different for pits that are demonstrated to have been badly
built or managed, in particular pits that collapsed or were leaking their contents into the
environment during the Consortium’s operatorship. The situation is also different for the
Consortium’s unreported pits, such as the “workover pit” at Payamino CPF (which the
Tribunal has addressed in its analysis on regular soil) or the “auxiliary pits” at Payamino

16, which must be removed since they have never been approved by Ecuadorian

authorities. "°°

R-PHB, § 449; Tr. (Day 1) (ENG), 112:7-8 (Opening, Garcia Represa); Ecuador's Opening
Statement, Slide 79. Ecuador's contention is partially contradicted moreover by IEMS's evidence
that the “use of synthetic liners is an appropriate engineering control for the protection of the
environment, provided they are installed, inspected and maintained properly, as they are not
leak-proof. Synthetic liners provide an impermeable barrier that avoids the direct contact of the
contaminants with the underlying soil and the direct mobilization of these contaminants when
conditions suitable for contaminant transport are present (as with earthen pits). The RAOHE
recognizes that synthetic liners increase the level of protection of the environment [...]". IEMS
ER4, p. 39.

With respect to Payamino 16, Mr. Saltos confirmed that five pits had never been reported: “Q.
[...] they also say that there were more than five mud pits that were never reported to the
authorities. Do you see that? A. Yes, that is correct. Q. So there are more than five pits in
Payamino 16; right? A. Yes. Q. That were never reported to the authorities; yes? A. Yes, that is
correct. [...] The pits here, however, were very small pits that were three to 4 meters by 2
meters, and two or 3 meters deep. So, these were small auxiliary pits”. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG),
1333:19-1334:18 (Cross, Saltos).

5.3.3 Pit construction

With respect to the construction of pits, Burlington indicated that the Consortium had no
written policy for the construction, cleanup, monitoring, testing and closing of pits. Mr.
Saltos, however, explained that, while it had no “specific little book”, the Consortium
had procedures in place which were regularly followed.'*°” He added that it was the
Consortium’s policy to place geomembranes in the pits (an issue to which the Tribunal
will revert below)."®* In this context, IEMS points to the Municipal Ordinance over the
Control and Monitoring of Waste Discharges of the Municipality of Francisco de
Orellana. Ecuador, however, did not invoke this regulation in its submissions, which
regulation does not in any case apply to mud pits for oilfield operations, but to pits in
general, and includes requirements such as “a) the distance from the edge of the pit to
residential, agricultural and recreational areas and surface water bodies; b) the depth of
the groundwater table; c) the geology and hydrogeology; d) the risk of flooding,
subsidence and landslides at the site; and e) the protection of the natural and cultural
heritage of the area”.'*®° Although informative, the Tribunal deems that this ordinance is
not sufficiently specific to be helpful in the present context when dealing with mud pits
built during oilfield operations.

IEMS also pointed to eyewitness evidence suggesting that Consortium pits had not
been appropriately constructed.'°°° However, the evidence of Mr. Cesar Andrade to
which IEMS refers does not support the contention of poorly constructed pits. In fact, he

Mr. Saltos responded as follows during his cross-examination: “Q. Perenco said that it does not
have a written specific policy for the construction, cleanup, monitoring, testing and closing of
pits. Did you know that? A. A specific policy, no, but for the construction of pits, we knew the
dimensions they should have, the depth they should have, what kind of liner or geomembrane
should be used in order to protect the pit, and then when the covering of the pits was contracted,
we specified the kind of products to be used when there were exceedances, and how to cover
these, how thick the layer should be, and how we should compact everything so that no failures
arise out of that pit [...] There wasn’t a specific little book, but we had all the procedures that had
to be applied in place”. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1328:2-20 (Cross, Saltos).

Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1347:8-14 (Cross, Saltos). This is further corroborated by IEMS's interview of
Mr. Cesar Andrade, a construction supervisor employed by Perenco, who indicated that the
Consortium used liners “in all the pits with which he was involved”. IEMS ER4, Att. 17, p. 27.

IEMS ER4, p. 24. See also: Municipal Ordinance over the Control and Monitoring of Waste
Discharges of the Municipality of Francisco de Orellana, 29 January 2001, Article 6(1)(1)(a)-(e).

stated that he was not aware of leaks in pits, only adding that “geological and
hydrological studies were not performed”."5*"

In addition, while Ecuador complains that GSI provides no evidence of the proper
construction of pits, for instance by opening pits, it is equally the case that IEMS did not
open any of the pits either to ascertain how they were built (even though Ecuador bears
the burden to prove harm originating from pits closed before the entry into force of the
2008 Constitution in October 2008).

Therefore, Ecuador's contention that construction requirements “may not have been
met by the Consortium” remains speculative and unpersuasive."* Specifically, in
respect of the Nemoca and Payamino CPF pits, the pits were constructed by prior
operators and were remediated in 2000 and 2001 respectively. '*** As a consequence,
there can be no claim against the Consortium on the ground that these pits were poorly
built. There could only be an allegation that they have been poorly managed by the
Consortium, which Ecuador has, however, not specifically put forward.

5.3.4 Pit management

Under Article 12 of RAOHE, oilfield operators are bound to regularly monitor the
environmental conditions around existing pits, including historical pits built by previous
operators. Moreover, if the condition of the pits deteriorates and poses a threat to the
environment or to human health, then pursuant to Articles 16 and 59 of RAOHE the
current operator is under an obligation to remediate that situation, even if the defective
pit was built by a prior operator. The Tribunal agrees with IEMS’s position that “[s]ound
environmental management practice would have been to monitor the conditions of the

Id., Att. 17, p. 27 (interview with Mr. Cesar Andrade). The Tribunal notes, however, that Mr.
Andrade indicated that the Oso A pit was built close to the river and that the Gacela 2 pit was
built in a “very high area”, without providing any further information as to whether these pits were
leaking. See also: /d., Att. 17, p. 34 (interview with Fernando Herrera), and p. 36 (interview with
Jorge Lara). Only Mr. Ramirez stated that liners “lacked maintenance” and that crystallized liners
leaked, pointing to Coca 4 and the concrete pits in “Payaminos”. See: /d., Att. 17, p. 29
(interview with Marco Ramirez). And Mr. Coro stated that he did not know if any pit leaked. /d.,
Att. 17, p. 32 (interview with Marco Coro). See also: Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slides 148-
149.

For instance, IEMS indicated that “[a]t this point, the construction methods and procedures used
by Oryx, Kerr McGee and the Consortium remain unclear. There is no evidence on how these
pits were built”. IEMS ER4, p. 38.

Id., p. 24 and Att. 5 (Nemoca) and Att. 6 (Payamino CPF).

mud pits installed by the previous operators in order to assure that there are no leaks or
negative impacts to the environment”.'6 The Consortium appeared to understand
being under such a duty as even Mr. Saltos acknowledges that it engaged in the
remediation of contamination left behind by prior operators. "°°

In addition, the Tribunal reads Article 59 as incentivizing oilfield operators to use water-
based drilling muds, as opposed to oil-based drilling muds that are still permitted under
RAOHE, '® but which come with the duty to remediate pits containing weathered crude.
The Tribunal has more difficulty in accepting Ecuador's contention that Article 59 further
imposes on current operators the duty to remediate any historical pits containing
weathered crude left behind by prior operators. This difficulty primarily derives from the
text of Article 59 and from the fact that there is no evidence in the record showing that
Ecuadorian authorities have ever requested any oilfield operator, and in particular the
Consortium (or previous operators regulated under RAOHE since 2001), to remedy
historical pits containing weathered crude built by prior operators.

As to Ecuador's argument that mud pits are indiscernible from the surrounding
environment and thus can no longer be located with the passing of time, the Tribunal
agrees that this is indeed a worrying situation, '®®” but here again the Tribunal notes that
RAOHE does not require operators to clearly demarcate existing pits, and on the
contrary requires that they be revegetated with local flora. Ecuador has not pointed to

Id., p. 32.

Mr. Saltos stated that “as a policy, Perenco had to remedy the soils, regardless of their origins”
and “regardless of who caused the problem in the soil”, before carrying out “an investigation to
determine final liability’. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1180:9-15 (Cross, Saltos). With respect to mud pits
more specifically, Burlington did not challenge IEMS’s statement that the Consortium
remediated, for instance, oil outcroppings from the Coca 4 pit that was improperly built by a prior
operator. See: IEMS ER4, p. 32.

Oil-based drilling muds must comply with Table 4 of Annex 2 and be disposed in the earth, while
the other drilling fluids must comply with Table 7 of Annex 2. Article 52(d.2.5) reads as follows:
“Where mineral oil-based muds are used, their final disposal shall be onshore, complying with
the permissible limits of Table No. 4 of Annex 2 to this Regulation; any decantation muds
resulting from the treatment of fluids shall be treated and disposed of, complying with the
permissible limits of Table No. 7 of Annex 2 to this Regulation” (Translation by the Tribunal)
(Exh. EL-174). The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ experts have not tested any samples against
Table 4, and that there is no claim that any limit under that table has been breached.

GSI also indicated that “[flollowing closure, these pits are commonly indiscernible from the
surrounding terrain and contain a solidified mixture of drilling mud and soil/rock cuttings
(generally comparable to natural soils), overlain by a cover of clean soil and vegetation”. GSI
ER1, p. 17.

any other potentially relevant provision stipulating such a requirement. What RAOHE
requires is that all mud pits must be approved, properly constructed and sealed,
monitored and finally revegetated. This leads the Tribunal to turn its attention to the
methodology for testing mud pits.

5.3.5 Method for testing pits

In the Tribunal’s opinion, IEMS’s argument that the “best approach” is to evaluate mud
pits “per analytical methods for soil contamination”, since leachate testing is only limited
to six months under Table 7, is unconvincing.'®® IEMS explains that “if samples are
collected several years after being buried and exposed to rainwater infiltration, the
mobile fractions of contaminants have already leached” and thus contaminated the
surrounding soil.'°°° Therefore, says IEMS, “collecting samples for determining the
residual mobile fractions of contaminants would not provide clear results on whether the
drilling mud should have been disposed of into the pit or even remediated several years
earlier”.'° The Tribunal does not find this argument convincing, because operators
wishing to make use of pits must submit to the Ecuadorian authorities the results of the
three leachate tests under Table 7 during the pit closure process. They thus provide the
data to determine whether the pits in question comply with applicable standards at and
shortly after the time when the pits were actually closed.'®' Furthermore, Table 7

IEMS ER4, p. 28.
Id., p. 27.
Ibid.

The Tribunal notes that Ecuador pointed to the closure report for the Jaguar 9 pit showing that
leachate testing was only conducted three years after closure instead of following the timeline
provided in Table 7. While this deficiency reflects on the Consortium’s contention of being a
model operator, it does not overcome the Consortium’s evidence that the pits in question comply
with regulatory criteria, which Ecuador could only have done by analyzing the relevant pits per
Table 7. See: Reply, § 39(d); IEMS ER4, p. 33. IEMS further pointed to Oso 3, Oso 9 and Oso A
as examples where leachate testing was not in accordance with Table 7. IEMS ER4, p. 33. With
respect to Oso 3 and Oso A, mentioned by IEMS as other examples where the Consortium
monitored the pits in 2007 and 2008, the Tribunal notes that the closure reports of these pits
were not reviewed by IEMS and that it is therefore speculative whether the Consortium
exceeded the timing requirements under Table 7 during the pit closure process or whether
additional monitoring took place in 2007 and 2008. The Tribunal is further mindful that, when
interrogated about the Oso 9 pits, Mr. Saltos conceded at the Hearing that in some cases the
Consortium failed to comply with the monitoring procedure under Table 7, as the following
excerpt show: “Q. Now, you make a reference to the exhibit, Table 7b of RAOHE. But there is no
six-month test. Do you know why? A. Well, in some cases there is no six-month test. These are
some mistakes we made”. The Tribunal will deal with the Oso 9 pits further below. See: Tr. (Day
4) (ENG), 1349:4-8 (Cross, Saltos); R-PHB, 9] 479-480.

prescribes three leachate tests in the six months following closure and no recourse to
other testing.

As to the actual methodology for leachate testing, Annex 5 of RAOHE states that the
applicable analytical method is USEPA Method 1311 TCLP (toxicity characteristic
leaching procedure), with a footnote allowing for equivalent procedures.’ GSI
undertook its leachate analysis through the TCLP method as well as the USEPA
Method 1312 SPLP (synthetic precipitation leaching procedure), which RPS argues is
not equivalent to TCLP, since TCLP estimates “potential mobility of materials placed in
landfills’, whereas SPLP is used to “determine the potential for leaching of chemicals
from contaminated soils”.'°° The Tribunal can dispense with entering into this
discussion, since GSI provided analytic results under both methods,"®™ i.e. TCLP and
SPLP, and the Consortium itself previously conducted leachate tests applying the TCLP
method.'®> As a result, the Tribunal will rely on the results obtained via the TCLP
method.

5.3.6 Lined v. unlined pits

The opening paragraph of Table 7 provides that mud pits must comply with the
permissible limits indicated in the table “depending on whether the site of final disposal
[i-e., the pit] has an impermeabilization at its base or not’."%° Accordingly, Table 7 is
divided in two parts with Table 7a applying to unlined and Table 7b to lined pits.

GSI considers Table 7b applicable in all cases since in its view all pits in the Blocks
have a clay base that effectively functions as a natural liner."°’ The Tribunal disagrees;

See, for instance, GSI’s testimony at Coca 8: “Q. Does the pit have a liner? [...] A. Yes. The pit
was constructed in the time period of 1991. It has a clay liner beneath it. It's the soil we are
standing on. You could see it's of low porosity because it’s muddy. [...] This is exactly the kind of
soil that's used for lands [sic] fills and pits and ponds throughout the world, and that’s the type of
liner it has. The pit is not leaking”. Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 118:1-10 (Tribunal, Connor at

it understands Table 7b to refer to impermeable synthetic liners (such as
geomembranes) and not to natural soils with a high degree of impermeability such as
clayey soils. This also appears to be the understanding of Burlington’s witness Mr.
Saltos, who worked in the Blocks since 1995 and was responsible for environmental
and industrial safety.'°°

The application of stricter standards for unlined pits under Table 7a as opposed to
Table 7b makes sense, knowing that slope failures or underground roots may perforate

the subsurface soils; and thus can
potentially come into contact with the groundwater;
not clayey soils (such as Payamino 14/20/24 and Coca CPF/Coca 2).'*” Finally, there
is evidence in the record that the Consortium also tested several of its pits against

Table 7a, as the pit closure reports for Coca 19 and Jaguar 9 demonstrate, for
1613

some pits are located in sandy

instance.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that leachate samples must be tested against Table 7b
if they come from pits with a synthetic liner or geomembrane, unless the liner is
demonstrably defective. In this latter case, the samples must be tested against Table

Referring to Oso 9, Mr. Saltos testified that pits were tested against Table 7a in cases where the
condition of the geomembrane had been altered: “Q. But all of them have geomembranes? A.
Yes, geomembranes were placed there. Now, during the operations, at some points, there may
have been an alteration of the condition of the geomembrane. That could have happened. And
in those specific cases there was a possibility of resorting to Table 7a. Why? Because it was not
an obligation to actually put a geomembrane there. Table 7 says either with or without
impermeabilization”. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1346:4-13 (Cross, Saltos). See also: Saltos WS1, J 177.

R-PSVB, § 174.

For instance, Perenco provided the following information to DINAPA in 2007 with respect to the
Oso A platform: “On the Oso A platform and in reference to the pit system, the hydrogeological
characteristics of the area have not been favourable due to the phreatic levels present; in other
words, it was necessary to reduce the initial intended depth of 4.50 meters to 3 meters (a 40%
reduction in capacity)”. Letter of 17 October 2007 from Eric D’Argentré (Perenco) to Consuelo
Hernandez (DINAPA), p. 9 (Exh. CE-CC-142); Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 146.

For instance, Mr. Saltos confirmed that the phreatic level in the Blocks was between 1 and 3
meters deep. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1257:21-1258:2 (Cross, Saltos); Ecuador's Closing Statement,

7a. In case of doubt in this regard, the Tribunal considers it reasonable and appropriate
to resort to the most environmentally protective standards of Table 7a.

5.3.7. Remediation methodology and cost

For pits containing weathered crude or which have been poorly managed, Article 59 of
RAOHE provides that crude that cannot be recuperated will be treated either in the pit
or ex situ, preferably through bioremediation.'®"* It further stipulates that the site must
be rehabilitated once the crude has been evacuated and the pit walls and floor comply
with Table 6.'°® Solid wastes found in the pit must be disposed of temporarily in pits
with a geomembrane with a recollection and leachate control system, while inorganic
solid wastes shall be treated and recycled ex situ.'*"®

In application of Article 59, the Tribunal will thus assume ex situ bioremediation to
compute remediation costs. Doing so, it will apply the same unit remediation cost as for
regular soil, namely USD 300/ms, since the Parties did not put forward any specific cost
estimates specifically relating to pit remediation.

5.3.8 Assessment of mud pits in the Blocks

Ecuador essentially argues that all pits in the Blocks require remediation (to the
exception of the pits built by Petroamazonas after July 2009), whereas Burlington
argues that not a single pit needs to be remediated.'°"’ The Tribunal hence needs to
analyze the results of the Parties’ sampling. It notes here that the Parties diverge on the
actual number of pits in the Blocks (226 for Ecuador'®® v. 156 for Burlington).'*° Be
this as it may, the total figure does not appear pertinent in light of the sampling exercise
undertaken by both Parties.

IEMS sampled mud pits at 37 platform and off platform sites (32 in Block 7 and 5 in
Block 21), analyzing a total of 488 pit samples‘?

surrounding mud pits.'®*' For its part, GSI collected 28 samples in 20 closed pits from

and 126 samples from soil

16 different platforms, of which 11 samples are leachate samples (including 2 duplicate
samples) taken at seven sites (Coca 15, Lobo 3, Oso 9, Payamino 14/20/24, Yuralpa

soil layer covering mud pits.'°*

Because mud pits must be tested against Table 7, as the Tribunal established earlier,
and because IEMS tested its pit samples exclusively against Table 6, the Tribunal
cannot consider IEMS’s sampling for purposes of ascertaining the condition of the pits
under Table 7. Indeed, the values under both tables are incompatible and cannot be
transposed from one to the other, as both Parties agree.'®* The use of IEMS’s mud pit
data is therefore limited to determining whether the pits contain crude.

In the absence of relevant data on the conditions of the majority of the pits, the Tribunal
will focus on the specific instances where Ecuador alleged that environmental harm was

that Area 2M at Mono CPF was a pit, although Ecuador did not so argue. Tr. Site Visit (Day 3)
(ENG), 87:19-21 (Tribunal, Chaves in Area 3MT at Mono CPF): “And you see the topography: It
is declining. The flow of the contamination comes from that, which is a pit, because the
records...”. For its part, Burlington argued that contamination in Area 2M was caused by mud
discharges in 1989: “How did it get here? We know exactly how it got here. In 1989, when BP
drilled the Mono 1 well that’s on the east side of the platform, in those days mud pits were not
constructed. They had not been required yet, and so the practice by BP in those days, in 1989,
was to simply discharge the drilling mud, the barium drilling mud, off the side of a platform’.

caused by defective or poorly managed mud pits. The analysis will first turn on whether
mud pits containing weathered crude require remediation and then assess the position
with regard to allegedly poorly managed pits. Finally, the Tribunal will review GSl’s
leachate tests and determine whether these call for remediation.

a. Pits containing weathered crude

Article 59 provides no answer to the question of what TPH value in pits calls for
remediation. It appears clear to the Tribunal that relatively low TPH values do not justify
remediation, i.e. values that fall within the permissible limits for regular soil under Table
6. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that prior operators were subject to a contractual
remediation criteria set at TPH< 1%, corresponding to 10,000 mg/kg TPH.'©° The
Parties did not articulate any specific values, although Ecuador took the position that all
pits must be remediated back to sensitive ecosystem criteria, which cannot be correct if
mud pits host industrial wastes. In the absence of any specification in the PSCs and in
the light of the evolving standards for increased environmental protection, the Tribunal
deems it reasonable to resort to the 4,000 mg/kg limit prescribed in Table 6 for
industrial soil.

On that basis and looking at IEMS’s sampling data,'®° the Tribunal identified elevated
TPH values in pits at the following sites: Coca 2,'” Coca 8,"°° Jaguar 2,'°° Mono

10,'°° Oso 9,'°' Payamino Transfer Station/Sanitary Landfill,"°* Payamino 5'°°° and

Dayuno.'**

In particular: IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1.

At Coca 2, the following pit samples have TPH exceedances: 7-COC02-SDB4-R(0.5-0.7)m
(7'320.36 mg/kg) and 7-COC02-SDB4-R(0.3-0.4)m (6'728.45 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.2, p. 1;

101-(1.5-1.7) is located in the pit. See GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, p. 6.

At Jaguar 2, the following pit sample has a TPH exceedance: 7-JAG-2-N3-MS-A-1.5 (7'912

At Oso 9, the following samples have TPH exceedances: 07-OSO09-SDD3-R(1.4-1.6)m (4020
mg/kg), 07-CPFOS-SDB6-R(2.2-2.4) (4'084 mg/kg), 07-CPFOS-SDC5-R(2.5-2.7)m (4'559

(29'701 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, pp. 25-26; GSI ER1, App. Other IEMS samples identifying
TPH exceedances, but without coordinates and which are located by GSI in the Oso 9 pits, are:
07-OS009-SDX2-R(1,5-1,8)m (54’878 mg/kg) and 07-OSO09-SDY-2-R(2,0-2,2)m (4'026
mg/kg). Finally, GSI identified the following IEMS samples as pit samples: MS-OSO-C1-9.1-2,3
(10'165 mg/kg), 07-OSO09-SDD2-R(1.5-1.7)m (18'596 mg/kg) and 07-OSO09-SDD2-R(1.8-
2.0)m (29701 mg/kg). See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.54.1.

At Payamino Transfer Station/Sanitary Landfill, the following pit sample has a TPH exceedance:
7-PAY-RES-999-MS-D-3.5 (5'956 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, p. 31. In addition, GSI indicated
that the following samples with high TPH levels were mislocated by IEMS and are in reality
located in the pits on the southeastern edge of the platform: 7-PAY-RES-999-MS-A-1,5M (4'934
mg/kg), 7-PAY-RES-999-MS-A-2,5M (4'759 mg/kg) and 7-PAY-RES-999-MS-C-2.5 (91'207
mg/kg). According to GSI, “GSI personnel inspected the area and encountered several
abandoned soil borings in the southern portion of the platform. No evidence of borings was
present in the areas defined by the [IEMS] Annex | coordinates”, further stating that the “revised
boring locations are consistent with the IEMS boring location identified in the field by GSI
personnel. This revised location is also consistent with the description of sample locations in
[IEMS] Annex C”. See: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 32 and App. L, Figure L.30.3. Although
IEMS made some corrections in its fourth report, it appears that IEMS did not respond to GSI’s
specific explanations regarding the Sanitary Landfill. See: IEMS ER4, pp. 108-109 and Table 2.
In light of GSI’s explanations on borings and the fact that IEMS did not respond, the Tribunal is
satisfied that the samples are in fact located in the two pits.

At Payamino 5, the following pit samples have TPH exceedances: 7-PAY-5-156-MS-F-2.1
(22'850 mg/kg), 7-PAY-5-156-MS-G-2.1 (49'729 mg/kg), 7-PAY-5-156-MS-G-0.5 (8'687.4
mg/kg), 7-PAY-5-156-MS-G-1.5 (17'430 mg/kg), 7-PAY-5-156-MS-H-1.5 (13'294 mg/kg) and 7-
PAY-5-156-MS-D-1.1 (14'256.49 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, p. 36 and Att. 10.2, p. 12; GSI
ER1, App. L, Table L.30.1. The Tribunal notes that Ecuador did not challenge GSI’s assertion
that sample 7-PAY-5-156-MS-D-1.1 is located in a pit. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.18.1.

At Dayuno, the following pit samples have TPH exceedances: 21-DAY01-SDD1-R(0,0-0,2)m
(32'791 mg/kg), 21-DAY01-SDDO-R(0,0-0,2)m (30'932 mg/kg) and 21-DAY01-SDD1-R(1,4-
1,6)m (38'310 mg/kg). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1, p. 39; GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.59.1.

Coca 2 was drilled by CEPE in December 1988, although the pit closure date is unknown to both
Parties. Coca 8 was drilled by Petroproduccién in August 1991, but the pit closure date is
unknown. Jaguar 2 was drilled by PB in December 1988, but the pit closure date is unknown.
Mono 10 was drilled by Oryx in January 1997, but the pit closure date (for Mono10 and Mono
12) is unknown. Payamino 5 was drilled by Oryx in December 1991, and although the original
closure date is unknown, the three closed pits containing oil-based muds were remediated in
1997. Dayuno was drilled by Esso Hispanoil in November 1987, but the pit closure date is
unknown. See: GSI ER2, App. B.5; Ecuador’s Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 —- Schedule

point even exceeding 54,000 mg/kg.'®° It is further undisputed that the Consortium
used the pits at the Payamino Transfer Station/Sanitary Landfill and therefore
remediation is warranted at that site. But except for Oso 9 and the Payamino Transfer
Station/Sanitary Landfill, the Respondent has not alleged that the Consortium reused
pits at the other sites just referred to.

During the Site Visit, the Tribunal also had the opportunity to see the large trees and
other vegetation covering the Coca 8 pits to the south of the platform, which appeared
to confirm that these pits had not been reopened or reused by the Consortium. On that
basis, the Tribunal can only dismiss Ecuador's claim for the remediation of TPH in mud
pits, except for the pits containing TPH at Oso 9 and at the Payamino Transfer Station,
which must be fully remediated.

With respect to Oso 9, the review of the location of the exceedance points reveals that
all five central pits in the main pit area immediately to the south of the platform have
TPH exceedances. Accordingly, all five pits must be completely remediated ex situ. The
dimensions of the five pits are identical (approximately 53x14 meters) amounting to an
impacted area for each pit of 742 m? and, with a depth of 5 meters, to a total volume of
soil of 3,710 m? per pit.'©*’ Therefore, the total volume of soil in the five pits requiring
remediation at that site is 18,550 m%, amounting to a total remediation cost of
USD 5,565,000.

With respect to the Payamino Sanitary Landfill, two pits must be remediated up to
5 meters depth with an impacted area for the first pit of 720 m? (40x18 meters) and a
total soil volume of 3,600 m°, and an impacted area of 630 m? and total soil volume of
3,150 m* for the second pit (35x18 meters), for a total volume of 6,750 m° to be
remediated, and a total cost of USD 2,025,000.

In its review of IEMS’s sampling data, the Tribunal further noticed that GSI states that

1638

various IEMS samples are misplaced and in reality located in pits,'*“" a statement that

See note 1631 above. See also: R-PHB, § 479.

The Tribunal chose a depth of 5 meters in light of Perenco’s explanation that they transferred the
muds from Oso A to Oso 9 precisely because the depth at Oso A could only comport 3 meters
due to the phreatic level instead of the 4.5 meters initially contemplated. See: Letter of
17 October 2007 from Eric D’Argentré (Perenco) to Consuelo Hernandez (DINAPA) (Exh. CE-
CC-142). See also: Saltos WS1, ¥ 184.

Ecuador did not challenge.'®* This is the case at the following sites where high TPH
values are identified: Gacela 2,'° Punino,"®' and Oso CPF.’ Again, all these pits

were built by prior operators'**°

and Ecuador has not alleged that they were re-used by
the Consortium.'®* Accordingly, the Consortium is under no obligation to remediate

these pits.

b. Poorly managed pits

The Tribunal now turns to Ecuador's claim that pits were poorly managed. It will
particularly review whether there is evidence that pits are leaking their contents into the
surrounding environment. Ecuador refers to the following evidence in support of its
claim. First, Messrs. Andrade and Ramirez, both Consortium staff, stated that
individuals had complained of being affected by leaking pits at Coca 4, Oso A, Gacela 2
and Payamino 1.'°° Second, Mr. Saltos admitted that the Waponi-Ocatoe pit collapsed
in 2003 and that the pit at Condor Norte partially collapsed in 2006."° Third, GSI
testified that contamination related to past drilling mud discharges was found in two

IEMS ER4, pp. 108-109 and Table 2.

This is the case of sample MS-GAC-C1-2.1-1 with a TPH level of 34'907 mg/kg. The Tribunal
notes that two other samples to the east of the pit have high TPH levels (namely, 07-GAC02-
SDA2-R(1,0-1,2)m and 07-GAC02-SDA3-R(0,5-0,7)m). These exceedances are considered by
the Tribunal in its analysis of regular soil contamination under Table 6 of RAOHE (see above
note 1234). See also: GSI ER1, App. D, Annex D.2, p. 11.

This is the case of sample 7-PUN-01-71-MS-H-3,0 with a TPH level of 6'590 mg/kg. The Parties
agree that the Punino well was drilled in 1990 and that the site has one closed pit to the north of
the platform. See: GSI ER1, App. L, Table L.31.1 and Figure L.31.3. The Tribunal notes that
sample MS-H is not identified in the map in Figure L.31.3, but it is otherwise satisfied that it is
located in the pit on the basis of the sample ID (71-MS). IEMS ER4, Att. 10.1 contains no
reference to pit samples taken in Punino.

This is the case of sample 07-CPFOS-SDB8-R(2,1-2,3)m with a TPH level of 8'789 mg/kg and
sample 07-CPFOS-SDZ5-R(2,5-2,7)m with a TPH level of 7'005 mg/kg. See: GSI ER1, App. L,
Table L.56.1. The sample locations are not identified in Figure L.56.3.

Gacela 2A was drilled by Oryx in 1992 with oil-based muds, and Gacela 2B in 1997. The Gacela
2 pits were closed in 1998. Punino was drilled by Petroproduccién in 1990 and the pit closure
date is unknown. Oso 1/CPF was drilled in 1970 according to GSI and, according to Ecuador, by
BP in 1988; the closure dates of the 3 pits are unknown. See: GSI ER2, App. B.5; Ecuador's
Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 - Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009
(Exh. E-563).

However, Ecuador stressed that Mr. Saltos conceded that Oso 1 was a stand-by well that was
put into service by the Consortium following a workover. There is, however, no evidence
showing that the Consortium reopened the Oso 1/CPF pits. See: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1239:1-2
(Cross, Saltos); R-PSVB, § 198.

areas to the east of Mono CPF."*” Fourth, IEMS indicated that the Payamino 2/8 pits
are perforated by roots and leaking."** Fifth, GSI acknowledged that drilling muds
extend to the south of the closed pit at Coca 8.'° Sixth, Ecuador also alleges that the
Coca 18/19 pits are releasing their content and that the Mono 10/12 pit is leaking.'°°
The Tribunal first turns to the allegedly leaking pits at Coca 4, Payamino 1, Oso A and
Gacela 2.

With respect to Coca 4 and Oso A, Ecuador has not provided any specifics regarding
the complaints mentioned by Messrs. Andrade and Ramirez and there are no other
elements showing that the mud pits at Coca 4 and Oso A are leaking. Coca 4 has two
pits and IEMS collected one sample from the pit to the southeast of the platform, with
no exceedance even under Table 6.'®' The only exceedance at Coca 4 would appear
to be related to the oil/water separator rather than to the mud pit, and does not support
a finding that the pit in question is leaking.’ Similarly, IEMS only took one sample
from the Oso A pit and provided no clear information on how or where the alleged
leaking is coming from.'®°°

With respect to Gacela 2, the Tribunal notes that IEMS accepted that Portland cement
mixed with oil-based drilling mud prevents TPH from migrating outside of the pit,
although IEMS stressed that this was not the case of heavy metals.'* GSI disagreed

1655

with IEMS’s position that Portland cement does not stabilize heavy metals, adding

IEMS stated the following: “Portland cement. So, what that does specifically is work with the
TPH, but it doesn’t perform the same as with metals. And in the same study, for example, on the
sealing of these two pits it clearly says that the risk may exist due to the base of metals highly
associated with TPH, mainly in this case it cites vanadium, lead, and cadmium; that in the case
of vanadium and cadmium we have the presence of highly significant contamination at this site.
So, it may be very safe for TPH, for not perhaps for metals [sic]”. Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG),
18:33-19:5 (Tribunal, Chaves at Gacela 2).

GSI stated as follows: “In the other case with the solidified material, the TPH, the oil, and any
metals that are in there are very securely stabilized. | would give you a point of view that’s very

361

807.

808.

that the Gacela 2 pit at issue also had a plastic liner beneath it.'®°* The Tribunal is not
convinced that the exceedances surrounding the pit are due to a leak in the pit, as
opposed to other causes such as spills during workovers. In particular, Oryx took
samples from the Gacela 2 pit during the stabilization and solidification procedure in
1998 and the results show that heavy metals were properly fixated in the mixture."°°”
This procedure was furthermore approved by Ecuadorian authorities.'%® Most
importantly, the Tribunal notes that IEMS has provided no evidence suggesting that the
pit is poorly constructed or any analysis on the pit’s structure showing that there is a
leak. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses Ecuador's claims for remediating the pits at
Gacela 2.

With respect to Payamino 1, and leaving aside the unreported workover pit in Area 2M
which the Tribunal addressed in its analysis on contamination of regular soil, the
Tribunal notes that the above-surface concrete pit in Area 1P inspected during the Site
Visit was removed by the prior operator Oryx in 2001."*° Accordingly, there is no issue
of pit leakage at Payamino 1, since any exceedance surrounding or below the concrete
pit forms part of the Tribunal’s analysis of contamination of regular soil.

Second, with respect to collapsed pits, the Tribunal starts its analysis with the pits in
Waponi-Ocatoe. Waponi-Ocatoe was drilled by Kerr McGee in 2000 and Ecuador does
not know if it was operated by the Consortium."%° The three mud pits on the

opposite of what Mr. Chaves offered, that cementing completely retains the metals because
Portland Cement is aluminium silicate and other agents that attract and tie those metals up. You
don’t get metals escaping that material”. Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 19:21-27 (Tribunal, Connor
at Gacela 2).

Tr. Site Visit (Day 4) (ENG), 21:6-9 (Tribunal, Connor at Gacela 2).

Soil Analytical Services Inc. indicated the following: “The low values of oil, grease and chloride
obtained in leaching tests, and the low values of heavy metals obtained in EP toxicity tests, are
related to the quality of mixing designs and clearly show the usefulness of solidification for the
treatment and disposal of ‘oil-based’ drilling mud” (Translation by the Tribunal). See:

southeastern edge of the platform were closed by Kerr McGee in December 2000.
Ecuador alleged that two pits were lined, but could not provide information on the third,
further arguing that “[t]he use of a synthetic liner does not mean that it was properly
installed, not damaged, and is effectively serving as an “impermeable” barrier”.'°' At
the Hearing, for the first time, Mr. Saltos indicated that a pit in Waponi-Ocatoe collapsed
in 2002 or 2003.'° However, there are no other elements in the record providing
information on the circumstances of the alleged collapse and the remedial action taken

1663

by the Consortium,’ and Ecuador did not further comment on the matter in its Post-

Hearing Brief.'® The Tribunal further notes that IEMS did not take any sample from the
mud pits or immediately adjacent areas to the mud pits, with the exception of four
samples taken to the northeast of the northern most pit, which do not show any

1665

exceedance. Indeed, IEMS concluded that the platform is free of soil

1666

contamination"®®* and Ecuador does not claim remediation for this site.'°°” Accordingly,

no remediation is warranted for the Waponi-Ocatoe pit.

The situation is different for Condor Norte, especially because the pits were built by the
Consortium in 2005.'°® It is undisputed that an area of three pits partially collapsed in
2006'°® and Mr. Saltos acknowledged that the Consortium did not properly remediate

For instance, even the field investigation conducted by IEMS does not mention the allegedly
collapsed pit, but refers to an open pit with water discovered in 2010 by Envirotec (REC 21-

the situation prior to July 2009."°” Although Mr. Saltos testified that the contents of the
pits did not leak,'®”’ GSI stated otherwise.'®” It is also unclear whether the pits are

properly lined.'®”° The Tribunal does not accept the explanation of Mr. Saltos that the
Consortium could not properly remediate the pits due to the takeover in July 2009,"°*
since the 2008 abandonment plan makes no mention of problems with the pits and
does not contemplate remediating the area.'®”> Although it would be sufficient for a
finding of liability that the pits were built by the Consortium, the Tribunal in addition finds

that the Céndor Norte pits were poorly built and managed.

Therefore, the Tribunal holds that complete ex situ remediation of the three pits is due
at this site, to a depth of 3 m, corresponding to a total area of 1,300 m? (approx. 65 x 20
meters), for a total soil volume of 3,900 m® and a total cost of USD 1,070,000. "°°

GSI stated the following: “A spill occurred at this site in 2005 when a corner of the mud pits
failed, causing mud to run over the adjacent cliff. The pits were closed shortly thereafter, as the
well never produced oil. The spill of about 300 barrels of mud reached a stream below. Perenco
Ecuador Limited reported the spill and completed remediation”. GSI further stated that it
“conducted a visual/physical inspection at this location and found erosion and slope failure
(landslide) of the pit area, but there was no evidence that the pits had been compromised”. GSI!

light of the dimensions of the pits (65 x 20 meters) and the depth at which IEMS identified
elevated barium levels (up to 3 meters), the Tribunal reached a total volume of soil of 3,900 m%.

already accepted in its analysis on regular soil at Mono CPF the statement of IEMS that
Area 2M is a historical pit used by BP when drilling Mono 1 (see paragraph 688
above).'°’° However, the Tribunal notes that IEMS’s statement that the pit is leaking its
contents into Area 3MT is speculative, since it is not supported by any evidence on the
pit's structure showing that there is a leak. Accordingly, Ecuador’s claim regarding the
pit in Area 2M is dismissed.

Fourth, the Tribunal addresses IEMS's opinion that the Payamino 8 pit is perforated by
roots and leaking. '®’° At the Hearing, IEMS stated that “part of the material [...] covering
the pit has been broken by roots that have grown through it’, and that “to this day, it is
leaking”.'©° Burlington’s position is that the Payamino 8 pit ruptured before 1992, thus
explaining the still extant contamination in the Jungal swamp.'®' To this, Ecuador
objected that “Burlington does not entertain the possibility that Petroproduccién
remediated the area and that a spill during the Consortium’s operations coupled with
migration of contaminants from the mud pits would explain the fresh crude found on the
surface of the Jungal swamp in 2007”.'6%

Apart from pointing to a piece of fractured liner visible at the edge of the cliff at the
Payamino 8 mud pit during the Site Visit,'°°* which incidentally led the Parties to
disagree on the exact dimensions of the pit, the Tribunal has received no evidence
suggesting that the Payamino 8 pit is presently leaking. In particular, there was no
sampling in the proximity of the pit, for instance, along the cliff above the Jungal

swamp. The closest IEMS sample in the Jungal swamp is some 50 meters away. '°*

broke and the test crude and drilling muds flowed downhill and into the swamp”. Saltos WS2,

Finally, IEMS’s pit samples are not located at the eastern edge of the pit and, in any
event, do not show any TPH exceedance and only one sample with a high barium
value."®> In the Tribunal’s view, this evidence is insufficient for a finding that the pit is
leaking. Accordingly, no remediation is granted for the Payamino 8 pit.

Fifth, the Tribunal now turns to the three Coca 8 pits located to the south of the platform
that were discussed during the Site Visit."*°° Ecuador complains that the Coca 8 pits are
leaking."®°’ For its part, GSI agrees that the contamination originated from the mud pits
and was caused by an overflow when the pits were compacted during the closure
process and not by leakage.'®* In response, IEMS rejected GSI’s remediation proposal
calling it “unreasonable” and further argued that even “if they remediated, how long will
we have to wait for that pit to continue leaking, to continue draining contamination and
reach the point of having to be remade? Because it comes from the pit, that’s obvious.
So are we going to cover the wound with a bandage without healing it from within?”.'©°
IEMS relied on field observations and analysis of laboratory results to conclude that “the
release of contaminants from leaching and leaks from the pit would occur towards the
hydraulic gradient and follow the topography of the area, placing the body of water at
risk of contamination”."®°° IEMS further opined that it found that “the portion of the pit
located opposite the wellhead had collapsed” and that the material “lacked firmness and

The high barium level was found in sample MS-PAY-C2-2/8.1-2,5 (11'085 mg/kg). See: IEMS

R-PHB, § 482(d).

GSI stated as follows: “Q. Is there any doubt as to where this contamination may have
originated? Did it come from the mud pits? A. Yes, we believe it came from the mud pits. The
mud pits contained oil-based drilling mud, which is a mixture of diesel with barite and other
materials. Mr. Garcia Represa was correct in saying that there was TPH in that pit, but there are
no TPH exceedances out here. There is only barium. Our understanding from looking at the
records on this site is that at some point in time there was an overflow from that mud pit which
followed the drain in this area, but all the data is consistent with that. We have superficial
impacts from barium sulfate”. Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 87:14-22 (Tribunal, Connor at Coca
8). GSI further stated that the pit would not leak because it has a natural “clay liner beneath it’.

was high in moisture”.'©"' According to IEMS, the results of five samples collected

outside of the pit “show clear evidence that the contents of the mud pit are leaking”."°°?

Applying regulatory criteria for sensitive ecosystem, IEMS notes the following
exceedances:

e Sample 07-COC-08-TE-101 has a TPH level of 9,461 mg/kg and a barium level
of 11,614.8 mg/kg in the 1.5-1.7m interval, and a barium level of 10,940.7 mg/kg
in the 2-2.2m interval;

e Sample 07-COC-08-TE-103 has a barium level of 946.1 mg/kg in the 0.5-0.7m
interval;

e¢ Sample 07-COC-08-TE-104 has a barium level of 23,368.3 mg/kg in the 0.5-
0.7m interval, and a barium level of 1,557.9 mg/kg in the 1.2-1.4m interval. °°

For IEMS, these results “demonstrate a catastrophic failure of the Coca 8 pit, which has
released hazardous contents into the surrounding sensitive environment’. IEMS
attributes this state of affairs to the “poor engineering and construction of the pits,

combined with a lack of monitoring and maintenance”.'°*

GSI responds that the Coca 8 pits did not collapse and do not leak, since (i) physical
inspection did not reveal “exposed drilling materials, leaks, or seeps’, (ii) the impacted
soils are “solid materials, with no liquid-phase drilling mud or oil’, and (iii) there is no
sign of disturbance of vegetation."® It also considered that IEMS sample TE-101 with
the high TPH level was located in the pit, thus suggesting that IEMS got the dimensions
of the pits wrong."®°° GSI therefore concluded that the soil impacts “are most likely

associated with a historical release of the pit contents, either during the pit operation or

at the time of the closure process, which are the only times when the pit would have
» 1697

contained liquid or semi-solid materials”.
The Tribunal starts by observing that the Coca 8 well was drilled by Petroproduccién in
1991 and that the pit closure date is unknown."®? According to available information,
the westernmost pit is a water treatment pit, the one in the centre a decantation pit and
the easternmost pit a drilling mud pit.'©* It is undisputed that the Consortium operated
the well,'”° but that it did not close the mud pits or undertake workovers having the
effect of deepening the well.'”°' Since both Parties agree that the contamination to the
south of the pits originates from the pits, the Tribunal must determine whether it is
caused by leaks, as Ecuador alleges, or by an overflow of the pit contents during the
closure process, as Burlington contends.'”*

For a variety of reasons, the Tribunal is inclined to accept Ecuador’s view that the Coca
8 pits are leaking and were poorly managed by the Consortium:

e First, the Coca 8 pits do not have a synthetic liner, as GSI conceded when it
testified that in its opinion the clay base _ provided sufficient

impermeabilization.'7°

e Second, although the easternmost pit contains oil-based drilling muds, there are

1704

no TPH exceedances outside of the pit area,'’”” which one may have expected

to find if there had been an overflow.’ In other words, Mr. Saltos’s so-called

GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 6-10.

The Tribunal has noted Ecuador's argument that “contradictions in the record as to the
existence, location, size and state of mud pits”, including the Coca 8 pits, “exacerbates the
environmental and health risks”. R-PSVB, § 108. However, during the Site Visit, IEMS accepted
GSI's dimensions of the pits, and thus accepted that sample TE-101 is located within the pit: “If it

368

“sandwich effect” leading to overflows during the compacting process was

disproved, since there are no TPH exceedances southwards of the pit in Area

1M as Mr. Saltos expected.'7°°

e Third, the exceedances to the south of the pit are heavy metal exceedances
(i.e., barium, cadmium and lead), which, due to their mobility, could very well
have leaked over the years into the surrounding environment.

e Fourth, the Tribunal is not convinced by GSI’s opinion that the exceedances are
only superficial, since barium exceedances extend at least 1.4 meters deep and

cadmium exceedances are at least 1.7 meters deep.'””

e Fifth, IEMS pointed to a complaint filed on 22 March 2007 by Mr. Notefio,
President of the community Corazén del Oriente, indicating that the three Coca
8 pits had been seriously affecting the surrounding environment, including the
river Huachito.'”°° While Mr. Saltos sought to downplay the significance of this
type of complaint,” there is no indication that the Consortium ever acted upon
that complaint to verify the environmental condition of the mud pits and
surrounding areas.

weren't for the fact that they had a diagram, which we did not, we never would have known the
actual dimensions of the pit”. See: Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 90:13-14 (Tribunal, Chaves at
Coca 8).

Tr. Site Visit (Day 2) (ENG), 107:6-18 (Tribunal, Saltos at Coca 8).

For instance, samples 7-COC-08-TE-104(1.2-1.4)P and 7-COC-08-251-B-29 for barium; and
samples 7-COC-08-TE-104-(1.50-1.70) and 7-COC-08-TE-105-(1.50-1.70) for cadmium. See:
GSI ER2, App. D, Table D.3, pp. 6-10.

The complaint reads in relevant part: “The wells that the company refers to as Coca 6 and Coca
8 are seriously affecting the environment 24 hours a day; at present, these fields are being
operated by Perenco Consorcio B7-B21; in a part of the Coca 8 platform there are three closed
pits of approximately 10 to 12 meters each, oil flowing into the surface from each side; this
affectation finds itself within the property of Mr. Alberto Tanguila, which is also used for
agricultural purposes” (Translation by the Tribunal). Letter of 22 March 2007 from the President
of the Corazon del Oriente Community to Salvadore Quishpe (Exh. E-285). See also: IEMS

(Day 2) (ENG), 84:10-14 (Presentation of Mr. Garcia Represa at Coca 8) and 84:19-85:10
(Tribunal, Puente). While Mr. Notefio argued that the area was “destined for agriculture”, the
Tribunal decided that Area 1M is located in a sensitive ecosystem for purposes of Table 6 of
RAOHE, also keeping in mind the statement made by Mr. Saltos that while oilfield operations are
ongoing, that area cannot be used by the private owners: “In addition, this area over here is not
used because compensation was paid previously by the private company for the operation of the
platform. And while the operation of the platform is ongoing, they cannot use it’. Tr. Site Visit

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Consortium’s management of these pits
was inadequate and that Burlington is at least partly liable for the remediation of these
pits. In the Tribunal’s assessment, all three mud pits should be remediated ex situ,
amounting to an impacted area of approximately 2,500 m?, a total volume of 7,500 m
(depth 3m), and total costs of USD 2,250,000, of which Burlington shall pay half since
the pits were not built by the Consortium,'’”° i.e. USD 1,125,000.

Sixth, with respect to Coca 18/19, Ecuador argues that the four pits on the southern

edge of the platform are releasing their contents, '”"'

insisting in particular on the alleged
off platform exceedances to the southwest of the pits in the area designated by GSI as
Area 1M."”" In its first expert report, GSI delineated contamination in Area 1M by
stating that “the exact source of the apparent drilling mud discharge at Area 1M is
unclear”,'”* to which Ecuador replied that “[a] more logical conclusion would have been
that the contamination is caused by leakage from the pits used by the Consortium”. '”*
After reviewing the Coca 19 pit closure report,'”° GSI then expressed the view that
there were two auxiliary pits located to the south of the platform, in addition to the four

pits located on the platform, and that the exceedances identified by IEMS are actually

The Tribunal has no information on the exact dimensions of the pits (except for Mr. Notefio’s

indication that each pit is 10-12 meters wide and long) (Exh. E-285), and therefore the Tribunal
relied on the figures provided by GSI showing that the pit area is approximately 100x25 meters.
Since IEMS sampled 2.5 meters deep, the Tribunal held that the pits were 3 meters deep. See:
GSI ER1, App. L, Figure L.6.6.

than the one estimated by IEMS. The new samples show good correlation with the prediction of

GSI's. From the data and modeling it can be inferred that the source of contamination is related
to the existing pits at the south of this field in 2004 according to the pit closure report for Coca

auxiliary pits were built south of the platform, corresponding to Area 1M.'”° It is
therefore striking that, while IEMS acknowledged the existence of the two auxiliary pits,
Ecuador persisted in arguing that contamination in Area 1M was evidence that the pits
on the platform were leaking.'’*' The Tribunal also notes that all the pits were tested
and complied with Table 7a for unlined pits.'”? Except for elevated barium levels not
exceeding 8,000 mg/kg, the samples taken in Area 1M, that is at the location of the
auxiliary pits, do not show any high levels of heavy metals.’ The same can be said
about the samples taken within the pits on the platform.’ In addition, the samples
collected by IEMS to the south of the pits do not show any exceedance of regulatory
criteria for agricultural land use.'’*° Finally, IEMS took no leachate samples for any of

the pits. On this basis, the Tribunal finds that the weight of the evidence is that the pits
in Coca 19 are not leaking. Therefore no remediation is due for these pits.

Seventh and last, with respect to Mono 10/12, the Tribunal considers that, without
more, a single sample with a relatively minor barium exceedance (765 mg/kg) located
just outside the southern edge of the pit is insufficient to prove Ecuador's allegation that
the pit is leaking, since barium could very well have spilled over during the closure
process.'””° Therefore no remediation is due for this pit.

c. Leachate test analysis

The Tribunal now turns to the leachate tests, which GSI conducted at the following
sites: Coca 15, Lobo 3, Oso 9, Payamino 14/20/24, Yuralpa Pad A, Pad F and
Pad G.'”’ A review of these leachate tests shows that there are no exceedances under
either Table 7a or 7b at Lobo 3, Payamino 14/20/24, Yuralpa Pad F and Pad G.'7*
Since the pit closure report for Coca 15 indicates that the pit was lined,’ the results
must be measured on Table 7b and they evince no exceedance.'”” Similarly, since
Ecuador accepts that the pits in Yuralpa Pad A have been lined and there is no

evidence that the liner is damaged,'”*' there are no exceedances at this site when

judged against Table 7b.”

Consequently, there remain the allegations in connection with Oso 9. As already
mentioned above, the 23 Oso 9 pits were constructed by the Consortium and 20 of
them were closed at the latest in October 2007.'’** According to GSI, there are three
pits on the platform, nine pits to the south and another pit area yet further south of the
platform. The Parties only sampled in the area hosting the nine pits to the south of the
platform and, therefore, the Tribunal will concentrate on these pits.

Among these nine pits, there is documentary evidence that four are lined with an

impermeable base,'”* and Mr. Saltos confirmed that all pits in Oso 9 are in fact

lined,'’*> although he did concede that liners may have been removed in cases of pit

failure.'”°° GSI further stated that plastic liners are in fact visible at “some of the pits”.'"°”

The handwritten field forms drawn up by GSI, filed following a document production
order, provide the following indications: “[Some of the pits have plastic liner; others no.

GSI ER1, App. D, Table D.12.A and App. L, Table L.66.6.A.

The Parties agree that Oso 9 hosts 23 pits, including 20 closed pits and 3 open pits. See:
Ecuador's Opening Statement, Demonstrative 2 — Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of
2009, line 65 (Exh. E-563); GSI ER2, App. B.5, p. 2.

Letter of 29 April 2008 from Eric D’Argentré (Perenco) to Marcelo Mata (DINAPA), p. 4
(Exh. CE-CC-162). Ecuador also accepts that the 2008 biennial audit confirms that a fifth pit is
lined, although the Tribunal could not verify this since there is no clear information in that respect
in the exhibits provided by the Parties. For instance, the verification list attached by Ecuambiente
merely states that drilling muds and cuttings are treated in mud pits in the “posterior part of the
platform”, without specifying whether the pits are lined. See: Block 7 Environmental Audit,
November 2008, p. 367 (Exh. E-252). For the other pits, Ecuador stated that “[n]o evidence of
liners could be found in relation to the other 18 pits. Ecuador's Opening Statement,
Demonstrative 2 — Schedule of mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, line 65 (Exh. E-563).
The Tribunal further notes that the leachate test taken from an Oso 9 pit for the 2006 biennial
audit was compared to Table 7b for lined pits. See: Biennial Environmental Audit of Block 7,
including the Coca-Payamino Unified Field, November 2006, Table 4-15, p. 70 (Exh. CE-CC-
182); Saltos WS1, 9 128.

Mr. Saltos also attached a picture of a lined pit at Oso 9. See: Saltos WS1, § 185; Tr. (Day 4)
(ENG), 1346:4-5, 1347:8-10 (Cross, Saltos).

Mr. Saltos stated the following: “Now, during the operations, at some points, there may have
been an alteration of the condition of the geomembrane. That could have happened. And in
those specific cases there was a possibility of resorting to Table 7a”, further explaining that: “I
must repeat, perhaps in one of the pits there might have been a failure, it may have been
withdrawn, it could have happened. But the policy was to place them there always”. Tr. (Day 4)
(ENG), 1346:6-10, 1347:11-14 (Cross, Saltos).

GSI stated as follows: “Plastic black liner was visible at the corners of some of the pits”. See:

But all contents tested by Perenco [are] shown to meet appl. Stds. of [...] Table 7 —
work conducted 2006-2007]’.'”* In light of this statement and because Burlington did
not specify which pits are lined, the Tribunal will apply Table 7a to GSI’s leachate
samples.

The leachate results for the northernmost pit at Oso 9 show a barium level of 22 mg/l
for sample OS09-1P-01-1.5-1.7 exceeding both Table 7a and 7b.'”* In addition, sample
OS09-1P-02-0.8-1.8 has a pH value of 10. While just at the limit, this requires no extra
remediation since that pit must in any event already be remediated because of the
presence of TPH (see above paragraphs 797-798). Finally, sample OS09-1P-03-1.0-2.4
has a level of electrical conductivity of 5,600 umhos/cm, above the 4000 umhos/cm
limit of Table 7a. In consequence, barium remediation is required for the northernmost
pit and electrical conductivity for the southeasternmost pit, in addition to the TPH
remediation already ordered above for the five centrally located pits (see above
paragraph 800).

In view of the high level of barium, the Tribunal finds that ex situ remediation is
appropriate in the circumstances for the northernmost pit, which represents an
impacted area of 629 m? (37x17 meters) for a total volume of 2,516 m° (4 meter depth),
and a total cost of USD 754,800. Finally, the Tribunal grants USD 540,000 to remediate
the pit (30x15x4) containing the electrical conductivity exceedance. In sum, the Tribunal
grants a total amount of USD 1,294,800 to remediate the pits in Oso 9.

d. Unreported pits

Further, as the Tribunal has already stated, the Consortium also is responsible for the
remediation costs associated with unreported mud pits, in particular the five unreported
pits at Payamino 16.'° Mr. Saltos conceded that the Payamino 16 pits were reopened
to deposit drilling muds from other platforms and that these five pits, which GSI was

In addition to the workover pit in Payamino 1, which the Tribunal addressed in its analysis on
regular soil contamination, Ecuador has specifically alleged the existence of unreported pits only
at Payamino 16. R-PHB, § 907.

able to locate on the northwest of the platform, were not reported to the authorities. '7""

Mr. Saltos indicated that the dimensions of these five auxiliary pits were three to four
meters by two meters each and two to three meters deep, amounting to an impacted
area of 35 m? and a total volume of 87.5 m%. Accordingly, the Tribunal grants an amount
of USD 26,250 to remediate the unreported pits at Payamino 16.

e. Re-opened and re-used pits

Since Mr. Saltos confirmed at the Hearing that the Consortium re-used the mud pit at
Jaguar 9 to store muds from other platforms,'” the Tribunal verified the condition of
that pit, although Ecuador makes no specific claim with respect to that pit other than to
include it in its general claim that all pits need to be removed.'”* As the samples taken
by IEMS show that the pit contains no crude oil, relatively low levels of barium, and no
other elevated heavy metals concentrations,’ the Tribunal finds that no remediation is
required for this pit.

f. Closure of open and unused pits

Finally, Burlington accepts that four open and unused pits at Coca 8, Coca 4 and
Payamino 5 must be closed for a total cost of USD 68,000.'° Ecuador did not
challenge this amount. Accordingly, the Tribunal grants this amount to backfill the pits
with clean soil and re-vegetate the area.

In conclusion, the Tribunal determines that Burlington is liable for the remediation costs
of mud pits at Oso 9, Payamino Sanitary Landfill, Condor Norte, Coca 8 and Payamino

6. Groundwater
6.1 Ecuador’s position

Ecuador claims that the groundwater is contaminated at all the 18 sites it tested and
thus seeks compensation for the remediation costs.'“° As a general matter, Ecuador
alleges that the Consortium,'’””

ignored the need to protect water resources, which is particularly worrying in light of the

as well as GSI in the context of the present arbitration,

population’s dependence on ground and surface water at home and for their
livestock.'® Ecuador further submits that, since IEMS was not in a position to
determine background values, it relied on the standards set out in TULAS Annex 1
(Table 5), which was also used by GSI.'° On that basis, IEMS found heavy metal

contamination (zinc, barium, copper, chrome and nickel) at all 18 sites and

contamination with hydrocarbons at six sites.'7°°

during its four sampling campaigns (12 during the first campaign, 49 during the second
campaign, 30 during the third campaign and 24 during the fourth campaign) at the following 18
sites: Payamino 1, Payamino 2/8, Payamino 4, Payamino 13, Payamino 14, Payamino 15, Coca

Block 7; and the Yuralpa Waste Management Area, Dayuno and Waponi in Block 21. Ecuador's

Ecuador explains, for example, that no groundwater samples were collected for the 2002, 2006
and 2008 biennial audits undertaken by the Consortium. Tr. (Day 1) (ENG), 122:5-10 (Opening,

Ecuador's Closing Statement, Slide 175; RPS ER2, App. C, Item 4. At the Hearing, RPS
explained human water consumption needs as follows: “It is common sense that with respect to
Block 7 and Block 21, people could also contact subsurface soils, use water, groundwater
domestically, and use surface water domestically. Livestock could also be contacting subsurface
soils and drink water in streams and creeks. It's also common sense that ecological exposure is
possible”. Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1050:17-1051:3 (Direct, Kerr).

TULAS, Book VI, Annex |, Table 5 (Exh. EL-173). Ecuador explained IEMS’s “more

the complex, lengthy and detailed studies needed to determine background values”. R-PHB, §

the groundwater at Payamino 2/8, but then stated at the Hearing that TPH exceedances exist in
six locations. With respect to the first results at Payamino 2/8, the Tribunal further notes that

According to Ecuador, Burlington’s allegation that the groundwater claim is the
consequence of flawed field procedures is “unfounded and unsupported”.'”*' Ecuador

1752

refutes Burlington’s critique of IEMS’s sampling procedure, starting with the

observation that GSI only tested 15 facilities for groundwater contamination.'’®
Ecuador also contends that GSI failed to assess numerous locations with contamination
on the “misguided pretext” that IEMS samples were taken from soil with 25% clay
content and thus not subject to regulatory control.’ Since the geologic logs on which
GSI relied do not determine the percentage of clay at a given location,'”° GSI failed,
according to Ecuador, to undertake any studies assessing the clay content in the areas
where groundwater was tested. Ecuador further argues that, even if the content were
above 25%, this would not mean that “this same clay content extends to the depths at
which groundwater may be found and wells accordingly drilled”.'7°°

Ecuador also states that GSI improperly dismissed IEMS’s samples on the erroneous
basis that they should have been filtered.'”” Specifically, Ecuador argues that filtering
samples is not in “accordance with Ecuadorian regulations”, since it leads to biased
results, in particular by removing colloidal particles which may have contaminants.'” In
this context, GSI relied on Annex 5 of RAOHE, when that regulation does not apply to

groundwater but only to surface waste water.'”®° Groundwater, by contrast, according to
1760

Ecuador, is regulated by TULAS, which does not require filtration of samples.
With respect to filtering, Ecuador argues that Burlington’s reference at the Hearing to
the INEN guidelines to support the use of 0.45um filters is incorrect.'”"' Indeed, RPS
confirmed that these guidelines apply to surface not groundwater sampling.” In
addition, IEMS indicated that it tested for the total concentration of heavy metals,
including colloidal and suspended fractions, and not for their dissolved concentration,
thus making the use of 0.45 um filters a “fundamental methodological error by GSI”.'7
As IEMS stated, “[fliltering the samples prior to acidification would result in only the
dissolved fraction being analyzed, and produce erroneously low results”.'”* In any
event, although IEMS opined that using 0.45 um filters would have “resulted in a
serious manipulation of the samples”,'”° IEMS considered filtering its samples when
turbidity was greater than 5 NTUs (nephelometric turbidity units),'°° and IEMS took
both filtered and unfiltered samples on two separate occasions, i.e. in December 2012

Reply, 4 159; IEMS ER4, p. 76. IEMS stated: “RAOHE only regulates water quality for superficial
water bodies and wastewater discharges, but not groundwater. The methods listed in RAOHE,
which require filtration, are intended for analysis of these types of waters, but not of
groundwater. This is due to the differences in water chemistry and other physical parameters.
Surface water for example is often highly turbid and contains organic matter while groundwater
on the other hand often has much higher levels of dissolved solids, and lower levels of organic
matter. These differences can make sample preparation much different to accomplish”.

Reply, § 159. Ecuador further states that TULAS expressly provides that analyses of
groundwater samples for arsenic, cyanide and mercury should be ‘total’ analyses, i.e. not
filtered. Moreover, TULAS requires that groundwater sampling be done according to specific
standards set by the Ecuadorian Standardization Institute, which provide for the analyses of
‘total metals’, i.e. not filtered. See: IEMS ER3, Section 3.3; RPS ER2, Section 3.4, p. 22.

R-PHB, 9547.

Id., § 548, referring to: Tr. (Day 4) (ENG), 1113:19-22 (Cross, Crouch) (‘[...] if you're collecting a
surface-water sample, standard protocol is to collect those and use a .45-micron filter. That is
not the same for a groundwater sample”).

IEMS ERG, p. 75.
Id., p. 76.
Id., p. 75.

R-PHB, {| 541. Ecuador further explains that “IEMS’ sampling plan was to collect samples after
purging if turbidity was less than 5 NTUs, and if greater than 5 NTUs, to collect the samples
when NTUs and other parameters had been stabilized. Nonetheless, according to the USEPA,
‘natural turbidity in groundwater may exceed 10 NTU.’ Hence, where the natural turbidity in the
monitoring wells exceeded 5 NTUs, it was simply not possible for IEMS to collect samples with
lower NTUs given that groundwater will not ‘clear up’ at the moment of sampling. Therefore,
stabilization criteria calls for expecting a minimal change between two turbidity measurements,
even in excess of 5 NTUs” (emphasis in the original).

and January 2013, where filtering showed no significant impact on the results.'’°” In

addition, Ecuador indicates that IEMS collected non-turbid, unfiltered and contaminated
samples from 6 facilities in Block 7, namely Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Payamino 13,
Payamino 15, Gacela 1 and Payamino 14.'7°

Ecuador further rejects GSI’s contention that TPH or drilling muds cannot dissolve in
groundwater by pointing to TPH contamination in groundwater at six facilities in Block 7,
namely Coca CPF, Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Payamino 13 and Payamino 2/8.'° Among
these, Ecuador particularly points to Coca CPF where there is a thick sand aquifer and
where the wells are adjacent to pits, thus unsurprisingly showing groundwater
contamination."’”° In this context, Ecuador stresses that GSI conceded at the Hearing
that fresh crude has a soluble portion. And IEMS indicated that GSI failed to measure
TPH as per TULAS provisions, since the laboratory was instructed to divide the
hydrocarbons in three different parameters, i.e. Gasoline Range Organics, Diesel
Range Organics and Oil Range Organics, instead of considering the sum of the total
petroleum hydrocarbons.'””"

For Ecuador, GSI’s attempts to downplay the risk of groundwater contamination are ill-
founded. The studies on which it relies were undertaken in arid regions and do not
apply to Blocks 7 and 21 with far higher average annual rainfall. Mr. Saltos confirmed at
the Hearing that the groundwater in the Oriente is found close to or just below the
surface." GSI also failed to consider the seasonal effect on groundwater
contamination and dilution.'””* In the same vein, Burlington’s explanation that the thick,
compact layer of clay found in the Blocks prevents contamination caused by oilfield
operations from reaching the groundwater is contradicted by the record. GSI’s own field

studies undertaken by prior operators of Block 7 also “disprove this notion of a thick,
uniform layer of protective clay being present throughout the Blocks”.'””° In addition,
Mr. Chaves explained that platforms are built on highly porous materials that facilitate
infiltration.'7”°

In sum, Ecuador proposes two techniques for groundwater remediation, namely ex situ
pump-and-treat (“P&T”) or permeable reactive barriers (“PRBs”).'”” On that basis,
Ecuador calculated a “worst case scenario” using the most expensive technique, i.e.
P&T, of USD 9,879,000 per location for a total cost of USD 177,660,000; and a “best
case scenario” using the less costly technique, i.e. PRBs, of USD 1,680,000 per
location for a total of USD 30,240,000.'* Adding related costs and a contingency of
30%,'”° Ecuador submits a total claim for groundwater remediation of
USD 265,601,700 in the worst case scenario and USD 14,277,600 in the best case
scenario,'”° in addition to USD 3,380,000 to complete further studies at 52 other
locations." In this context, Ecuador defends its use of US costs, since “local
remediation providers in Ecuador do not have the necessary expertise to perform these

remediation works”. ‘7

USA costs (given that no information from local providers was available) this estimate is very
conservative if we take into account the specificities of doing groundwater remediation in the
Amazon region which will be much more expensive than working in the USA (e.g. due to the lack
of local experience and the difficulties of getting supplies and equipment). It is very likely that the
real costs of implementing groundwater remediation would be higher than IEMS’ estimates in the

6.2 Burlington’s position

Burlington submits that there is no groundwater contamination in the Blocks and that
Ecuador's allegations of contamination are entirely a product of faulty testing
procedures.'’® In any event, the Site Visit confirmed that residents in the Blocks have
“absolutely no need to exploit underground water’, since they mostly rely on
rainwater.’ According to Burlington, IEMS’s alleged findings are “inconsistent with
oilfield operations”, since minerals used in drilling operations “exhibit very low levels of
solubility and mobility’, thus rarely causing impacts to water quality.’ Burlington
essentially argues that Ecuador “ignored its own regulations”’”®® and that IEMS applied
improper sampling techniques in areas with clay content above 25% and failed to filter
its samples.

Burlington first criticizes IEMS’s sampling procedure, particularly IEMS’s use of well
screens during its first two campaigns which it cut by hand with a saw instead of using
factory-machined well screens.'”” IEMS also compromised its samples through cross-
contamination, allowing extraneous sediments to enter into the groundwater samples,
which resulted in false barium and TPH concentrations.’ Burlington further indicates
that IEMS collected groundwater samples in clayey soil, contrary to TULAS which
recognizes that groundwater drawn from soils with clay over 25% “is not really true
groundwater’, since it is “not usable for any purpose, and it’s not even regulated”.'”°°

With respect to filtration, Burlington argues that unfiltered samples lead to “biased,
unreliable results”.'° In order to properly test groundwater, argues Burlington, the

samples must be clear of soil particles.'”"' Burlington considers it undisputed that turbid
groundwater samples, like IEMS’s samples, must be filtered.'”* This results from
RAOHE Annex 5, according to which the procedure for testing heavy metals in water
must include filtration.'”°° Pointing to IEMS’s field notes showing the presence of heavy
sediment in the samples,‘ Burlington notes that IEMS failed to filter its groundwater
samples and thus reached unreliable and scientifically unsupported results “due to the
nitric acid preservative added to groundwater samples in order to stabilize dissolved
metal concentrations prior to testing”.'° RPS’s testimony that the goal is to obtain
sediment-free samples “undermines the validity of IEMS’s samples”.'7%

Burlington also submits that IEMS failed to filter out solid particles from its groundwater
samples as required under RAOHE Annex 5 and TULAS.'”” IEMS’s improper field
procedure led to “scientifically impossible” results, “yielding levels of metals greater than
could naturally be dissolved in water”, a point IEMS has not denied.'’* For instance,
Burlington observes that IEMS reported barium concentrations in groundwater of 8.28
mg/l, when groundwater cannot retain barium above 3.1 mg/I.'”°° This result means that
barium was present in the water in solid form, which should have been filtered out in
advance. IEMS thus tested sediment suspended in the water and not groundwater

itself."°

Furthermore, Burlington stresses that Ecuador's criticism of GSIl’s filtration is
inconsistent with Ecuador’s other assertion that filtration made little difference in the
results. "°°"

Moreover, Burlington refers to RPS’s statement at the Hearing that it took no issue with
filtering per se, but that it objected to the filter size used by GSI.'°” It argues that
Ecuadorian regulations require the size of the filter, namely, 0.45um, employed by
GSI."®° Specifically, Burlington refers to Section 5 of Annex 1 of Book VI of TULAS
(and not anymore RAOHE Annex 5), which applies to surface water, freshwater, as well
as groundwater."** This regulation cites to NTE INEN 2169:98,"°°° which in turn
mandates the use of 0.45ym filters “for all metals at issue in this case”.'°°

In addition, Burlington argues that Ecuador's reference to a single unfiltered sample
collected by Oryx in 1996 cannot disprove the appropriateness of GSI’s filtration, since
that sample was collected before RAOHE or TULAS came into force.'®”” Burlington also
points to the fact that IEMS’s additional testing in January 2013 showed lower

results, "°°

and that Ecuador's explanation that this might be due to increased rainfall
fails since the concentration of one analyte — cobalt — actually increased and the rainfall

was higher in January 2013 than in December 2012.'%°°

In respect of the objection raised by RPS that GSI insufficiently analyzed the presence
of TPH in groundwater, Burlington calls attention to the fact that RPS accepted IEMS’s
conclusion at the Hearing that no hydrocarbon contamination was found:'*"°

A. Yes. [...]""3"

Finally, with regard to Ecuador's discussion of surface water contamination during the
Site Visit, Burlington stresses that such contamination is “beyond the record evidence
and the scope of the Tribunal’s decision making”, since Ecuador asserted no claim for
surface water contamination and that there is in any event no evidence in the record of
such contamination or any health risks attributable to surface water.'*? Specifically,
Ecuador’s claim that the Jungal swamp at Payamino 2/8 communicates with the
Payamino River is an unsupported new allegation, which the Tribunal should not

consider. '®"

6.3 Discussion

The Tribunal will start by setting out the legal framework for groundwater remediation
(6.3.1). It will then address the areas of contention between the Parties, namely the
experts’ sampling procedures (6.3.2), the need for groundwater remediation in clayey
soils (6.3.3), and filtration (6.3.4). Finally, the Tribunal will discuss remediation costs
(6.3.5).

6.3.1 Legal framework

The Parties agree that TULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Table 5 (“TULAS Table 5”) sets forth

1814

the quality criteria for groundwater,'~'” which reads in relevant part as follows:

Moreover, Article 4.1.3.6 of TULAS specifies that any “proven alteration” of groundwater
must be remediated. Section 5 further provides that groundwater concentrations must
be determined by considering NTE INEN Guidelines 2169:98 and 2176:98, which
include specifications for filtration methodology.

The Parties disagree on the relevance of RAOHE for groundwater contamination.
Ecuador argues that ROAHE is irrelevant and that the reference to filtration in Annex 5
only applies to surface waters or effluents, not to groundwater. Burlington replies that
no such limitation exists in RAOHE, and notes that Article 16 RAOHE, for instance,
refers to groundwater.

Annex 5 RAOHE spells out certain testing methods for waters, soils, and air emissions.
Regarding waters, Annex 5 specifies that when analyzing barium, total chromium, lead

Section 4.0; GSI’s Direct Presentation, Slide 68. The Tribunal notes that Table 5 expresses units
in g/l, but the Parties have assessed their samples in mg/l. For instance, TPH value in TULAS
is 325 yg/l, corresponding to 0.325 mg/l.

and vanadium, samples must be filtered and acidified.'®'® This suggests that filtration of
samples as such is an approved, and indeed a required, element of testing. Another
question is whether RAOHE applies to groundwater. Article 16 relating to the monitoring
of remediation programs mentions both surface waters and groundwater. Similarly, the
glossary in RAOHE Annex 6 defines, aquifers (as extending to groundwater) as well as
“groundwater” or “phreatic level” (Translation by the Tribunal). These references tend to
demonstrate that Ecuador's limited reading of RAOHE is incorrect and that RAOHE

provides support for filtration of groundwater samples.

6.3.2 Sampling procedures

During its first two sampling campaigns, IEMS did not measure various key elements,
such as turbidity, pH, electric conductance, temperature, or total dissolved solids. It
stated indeed that it started doing so after its first two field trips. '*"° Moreover, the use of
hand-sawn rather than machined well screens does not appear in line with standard
practice. As a consequence, the Tribunal does not find the results from these two field
trips reliable and will thus discard them.

6.3.3 Testing in clayey soils

The next question is whether groundwater testing is warranted in soils with clay
contents exceeding 25%. TULAS Table 5 applies to soils with clay content between 0
and 25% and organic material content between 0 and 10%.'®!” Accordingly, GSI
appears to be correct when stating that no groundwater remediation is required at all
where the clay content is above 25%, mainly because such soils are “not capable of
producing groundwater in sufficient quantities (due to low permeability) or of appropriate
natural quality (due to mineral or organic content) to serve as a usable water supply for
domestic, agricultural, or industrial use”.'*® Hence, TULAS Table 5 restricts the

applicability of groundwater quality criteria to soils capable of producing groundwater.

RAOHE, Annex 5 reads in relevant part: “Filtration and acidification of the sample, direct
determination by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)” (Translation by the Tribunal) (Exh. EL-
174).

IEMS ER3, Annex A.10, p. 3, paragraph 6.

The title of Table 5 reads: “Reference quality criteria for groundwater, considering a soil with clay
content between (0-25.0)% and organic material content between (0-10.0)%” (Exh. EL-173 (EN)
0002).

IEMS concedes that TULAS Table 5 does not apply to clayey soils above 25%. It also
testified that “a number of monitoring wells may be located in areas with a content of
clay greater than 25%, and that therefore the TULAS regulation may not apply”.'°’°
Quite astonishingly, IEMS then continues asserting that background values apply if
Table 5 is inapplicable.'*”° As GSI rightly pointed out, clayey soils protect groundwater
better than permeable sandy or silty soils. Thus, applying stricter standards to such
soils would make no sense, especially in the absence of express wording to that effect
in TULAS.'®*! Accordingly, the Tribunal understands that TULAS Table 5 does not apply
to soils with a clay content above 25%. Consequently, no groundwater remediation is
called for in such areas. This finding requires the Tribunal to determine, next, which
sites are therefore excluded from groundwater remediation.

GSI indicated that 30 out of 46 IEMS groundwater sampling locations (at 18 sites), i.e.
over 65%, are reported as having clayey or silty soils." This said, the measurable
indications in the record of the clay content of the soils where groundwater samples
were taken are sparse at best. IEMS’s notes from its third field trip do not specify the
percentage of clay in the soils.'**° Neither have the Parties made their submissions on
the basis of concrete levels of clay content. Only GSI’s observations for its own sample
locations — often at a considerable distance of IEMS sample locations — provide some
relevant data.

GSl's field notes do not specify consistently a precise percentage of clay. Yet, as noted,
they do contain some useful information. For its groundwater sampling at Jaguar 1
(boring well JA01-GW1), for instance, GSI indicated that soil between 0.0-0.3 and 0.3-
2.0 meters is silty clay, suggesting no groundwater testing warranted there,'*™ and that

Jaguar 1 Field Form, Phase 1 (Exh. E-476). If the Tribunal’s reading is correct, soil between 0.0-
0.3 meters is 100% fine particulate (clay) and soil between 0.3-2.0 meters is 60% fine particulate
and 40% with larger grain size. The field form reads: “0.0-0.3: Greenish Gray, Moderately
Humid, 100% fines, medium/low plasticity, no odor, silty clay (CL). 0.3-2.0 m: Light brown,
saturated, 60% fines and 40% coarse material, hard ran. Subangular blocks of max. diameter of
0.060 m block are composed of sediments/cemented clays”.

turbidity was lowered to 353 NTU (down from 777 NTU, suggesting need for filtering, as
will be seen further below).'®*° As a further illustration, the Payamino 14-20-24 GSI field
form is more precise: at sample location PAY14-GW1, soil between 0.0-0.8 meters is
clayish (“arcilla ligera’) and soil between 0.8-1.8 meters is sandy (“arena pobremente
graduada’), groundwater testing being warranted at this site.'*° A third example shows
that the composition of the soil may vary according to layers. The GSI boring log at
Payamino 1 (sample PAY01-GW1) states that the soil between 0.0-0.3 and below 0.5
meters is clayish (usually 100% and 90% between 1.4-1.8 meters) and that the soil
layer between 0.3-0.5 meters is sandy (80%).'®*”

GSI has provided field forms from its groundwater sampling campaigns in respect of 12
sites.'®*° For these sites, on the basis of the information provided by GSI, the Tribunal
concludes that no groundwater testing is warranted due to clay contents above 25% at
Payamino 1, Jaguar 1, Jaguar 2, Gacela CPF, Gacela 2 and Yuralpa Sanitary Landfill.
The Tribunal further concludes that the clay content is lower than 25% and that
groundwater testing is therefore needed at the following sites: Coca 2, Coca CPF,
Payamino 4, Payamino 13, Payamino 14/20/24 and Gacela 1/8. With respect to
Payamino 15, the Tribunal notes that groundwater is found at the surface level with a 2-
meter clay layer, but that sandy soil is found 2 meters below. Accordingly, the Tribunal
accepts to consider samples taken at depths below 2 meters.

Among the sites at which IEMS tested for groundwater, GSI did not provide
groundwater sampling forms for Payamino 2/8, Mono CPF, Oso 9, Dayuno and
Waponi-Ocatoe. Because the field forms for soil contamination at Payamino 2/8 show
the presence of clayey soil and the samples were taken within a swampy area (i.e., the
Jungal swamp),'®” the Tribunal is inclined to hold that the clay content of the soil is

above 25%. The same applies to Mono CPF, where the field forms for 14 soil sampling
locations, mostly mention a soil composition of clay or silty clay and only rarely mention
the presence of sandy silt."*°° With respect to the other sites, i.e. Oso 9, Dayuno and
Waponi-Ocatoe, the Tribunal rejects IEMS’s data, because Ecuador did not provide
evidence of the soil content at these locations, which makes it impossible to determine

whether groundwater sampling conforms to TULAS Table 5."°°"

Accordingly, and subject to the following, the Tribunal will review the groundwater
sampling results for Coca 2, Coca CPF, Payamino 4, Payamino 13, Payamino
14/20/24, Payamino 15 and Gacela 1/8.

6.3.4 Filtration

The Parties and their experts defended opposite positions about filtration, although
each expert also at times employed practices advocated by the other. For instance,
IEMS started filtering the samples from its third campaign onwards, whereas GSI
filtered its samples with 5um filters together with 0.45um filters during its second
campaign (but not 10um filters as suggested by RPS). At any rate, the Parties agree
that INEN Guideline 2169:98 is the relevant source to determine whether filtration is
required. '°

The Tribunal starts by noting that the experts on both sides concur that 0.45um filters
are appropriate for testing dissolved metals concentrations. '®° GSI and RPS also agree
that sediments in suspension should be filtered, although RPS favors using a 10m

moist content; increasing plasticity with depth. (1.0-2-0): Orange-brown clay (CH); with minor silt
content, high plasticity, “sticky”; mod stiff, low-mod clay moist content, gray mottling, no chem
odor’. For sample PA28-2MT-3B, the field form states: “(0.0-0.5m): Dark grey coarse sand
combined with gravel. Material resembles same soil as the one used to fill the wellpad. (0.5-
0.9m): Grey silty sand of medium-grain size. Homogeneous consistency. Low cohesion.
Resembles selected material. Clean appearance. Low moist. (1.0-2.0m): Brown/grey silty claim.
Medium hard texture. Homogeneous consistency. Low moist. High plasticity. No odor”.

Ecuador only provided some comments on the presence of a “thick sand aquifer” at Coca CPF,
but did not otherwise provide evidence on the clay content at this or any other site. R-PSVB, §
175.

GSI ER2, 9§ 121-122; IEMS ER4, p. 75; RPS ER2, pp. 23-24. The Tribunal notes, however, that
RPS stressed that TULAS Table 5 requires that samples for arsenic, cyanide and mercury
should be “total” analyses, not “dissolved” analyses.

389

1836

filter. They do not agree on whether groundwater sampling should only test for
dissolved metals, as argued by GSI, or whether it should also test for colloids or “total”
metal concentrations, as IEMS purported to do. According to RPS, a 10pm filter would
allow testing for colloids as well, which is important, because colloids may still carry
metals that might dissolve into the groundwater. '**

The experts thus essentially disagree on whether metals should be tested for their
“total” or “dissolved” values. A 0.45ym filter would filter all sediments and colloids,
leaving only the metals dissolved in the groundwater. According to GSI, filtration with a
0.45um filter is essential, since the acidification of the sample dissolves the metals
attached to the sediment and/or colloids and therefore artificially increases the metals
concentration in the sampled water.

As was seen above, filtration is addressed in TULAS and INEN Guideline 2169:98.
Section 5 of Annex 1 of TULAS states that INEN Guideline 2169:98 and INEN
Guideline 2187:98 “must be considered” to determine the values and concentrations of
groundwater samples. Table 5 of TULAS sets the criteria for groundwater remediation
in soils with clay content below 25% and requires the measurement of total
concentrations for arsenic, cyanide and mercury. By contrast, with respect to chromium,
the Tribunal agrees with GSI that Table 5 specifies total chromium since chromium has
two valence species, i.e. Cr(+3) and Cr(+6), thus calling for the analysis of the “full
chromium mass, without speciation”.'*° Article 4.5.1 of INEN Guideline 2169:98
provides that “suspended matters, sediments, algae and other microorganisms should
be removed when taking the sample or immediately afterwards, by filtration through
filter paper, filtration membrane or by centrifugation”."® It follows from these provisions
that filtration is the regular methodology in groundwater sampling and that TULAS
requires the analysis of dissolved (not total) metals concentrations, with the exception
of arsenic, cyanide and mercury.

Article 4.5.1 further specifies that there should be no filtration where the filter is capable
of “retaining one or more of the components that will be analyzed”. Since RPS agrees

GSI ER2, § 124. However, the Tribunal disagrees that such is the case for arsenic, cyanide and
mercury, although GSI has not made specific arguments with respect to these compounds.

1838

that a 0.45um filter is appropriate for dissolved metals analyses, it appears that the
filters employed by GSI do not fall into the prohibited category, save for arsenic,
cyanide and mercury. The Tribunal thus agrees with RPS that TULAS Table 5 indicates
that “total analyses” are to be carried out for arsenic, cyanide and mercury.

Table 1 of INEN Guideline 2169:98 outlines the general techniques for sample
conservation. The methodology specified for barium, cadmium, total chromium, copper,
lead, nickel, and zinc is cross-referenced to the methodology for aluminum. For
aluminum, Table 1 distinguishes between (i) analysis for dissolved aluminum, for which
filtration with a 0.45ym filter is required prior to acidification, and (ii) analysis for total
aluminum without filtering the samples. However, it is unclear when analysis for
dissolved as opposed to total aluminium is called for.

Article 4.5.2 provides some more clarity by stating that “the analysis can involve the
separation of both soluble and insoluble forms by filtration (for example: of a metal)”.
This provision is couched in permissive terms, which suggests that GSl's filtration
method was not improper.

RPS concedes that INEN 2169:98 provides that “dissolved samples include the use of
0.45um filters prior to acidification”, but specifies that “total analyses should not be
filtered in the field but only acidified”.'*°” Since RPS also concedes that under TULAS
Table 5 “total analyses” are only required for arsenic, cyanide, and mercury, it follows
that INEN Guideline 2169:98 does not require “total analyses” for barium, cadmium,
copper, total chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, or TPH. Accordingly, GSI’s use of 0.45um
filters appears appropriate, especially because the regulations provide no basis for the
use of a 10um filter as advocated by RPS.

The experts seem to agree that filtration — independently of filter size — is necessary
where turbidity exceeds 10 NTU. IEMS even appears to agree that samples must be
stabilized to a turbidity of 5 NTU.'*® As noted above, IEMS did not measure the
turbidity during its first two sampling campaigns, and its field forms for the third
sampling campaign are not of much assistance, since they either do not address NTU
or provide a zero value which cannot reflect reality throughout the sampling process

RPS ER2, p. 23.

(even with low-flow).'®° Moreover, IEMS’s fourth campaign shows that unfiltered
samples typically have higher turbidity with levels frequently above 15 NTU."*° Finally,
IEMS’s observations with respect to turbidity appear to be unreliable, since (i) IEMS’s
own field notes show that the samples had turbid water (for instance, “turbid water,
brown, with presence of solids”),'®*' (ii) GSI demonstrated that water with 200 NTU is

1842

still relatively clear, and (iii) GSI field forms shows significant levels of NTU

variations during the sampling process.'®*

Accordingly, since IEMS did not filter its samples during its third sampling campaign,
the Tribunal cannot rely on these results either as they relate to the metals for which the
dissolved concentration was supposed to be analyzed. Indeed, IEMS should at least
have used a filter to remove the sediments as RPS conceded and as required under
Article 4.5.1 of the INEN Guideline 2169:98.

During its fourth field trip, IEMS apparently used both 0.45 um and 5m filters to
compare the results with unfiltered samples. However, that campaign was limited to
Payamino 2/8, Payamino 14/20/24, and Payamino 15. As stated earlier, the Tribunal
considers that groundwater testing was unwarranted at Payamino 2/8 because of the
elevated clay content at that site. The Tribunal therefore reviewed the results for
Payamino 14/20/24 and Payamino 15. The filtered samples show barium and lead
exceedances at these sites.’ Sample 7-PAY-14.20.24-TE-100MW-F at Payamino
14/20/24 has a barium level of 1.07 mg/l in excess of the 0.338 mg/l limit, and a lead
level of 0.06 mg/l in excess of the 0.045 mg/l limit. With respect to Payamino 15,

The unfiltered samples also show mercury exceedances at these two locations.'*° The
issue still arises whether, under Article 4.5.1 of INEN Guideline 2169:98, filtration of
sediments is still required, so that only colloids are kept for the “total analyses”. Since
RPS concedes that sediments should be filtered,"*“° the Tribunal relies on IEMS’s
filtered samples, which only show mercury exceedances at Payamino 15.'°”

The Tribunal also reviewed GSI’s sampling data, which reveals that remediation is
required for TPH at Coca CPF.'® At that site, the Tribunal identified a TPH
exceedance at sampling locations COCPF-GW1 and COCPF-GW1Dup, which have
been tested by GSI for gasoline, diesel and oil range organics. The addition of the three
values provides the TPH value. COCPF-GW1 thus has a TPH value of 0.53 mg/l and
COCPF-GW1Dup has a TPH value of 0.67 mg/l, both in exceedance of the 0.325 mg/I
limit under TULAS Table 5.

The data also shows a nickel exceedance at Payamino 14/20/24 at sampling locations
PAY14-GW1 and PAY14-GW1Dup, with a value of 0.05 mg/l exceeding the limit of
0.045 mg/l.

For the three locations where exceedances are established, there are no elements in
the record that would allow to rebut the presumption of causation that arises from the
findings of harm. Therefore, Burlington is liable to remediate these exceedances.

In sum, the Tribunal finds that groundwater remediation is required (i) for nickel, barium
and lead at Payamino 14/20/24, (ii) for barium, lead and mercury at Payamino 15, and
(iii) for TPH at Coca CPF.

6.3.5 Remediation costs

Having reviewed the Parties’ arguments with respect to remediation, the Tribunal finds
that in situ remediation applying permeable reactive interceptor trenches is the most
appropriate method in the present circumstances since it filters compounds out of the

groundwater over several years. It therefore accepts IEMS’s estimated capital cost
(based on US price comparisons) of USD 1,680,000 for each contaminated site, which
includes USD 350,000 for research and feasibility costs, USD 730,000 capital cost, and
USD 600,000 for operation and maintenance for a period of six years.'®“° The Tribunal
notes that Burlington has not provided alternative cost figures. The total cost of
remediation of the three sites identified above thus amounts to USD 5,040,000. Since it
is Ecuador's burden to prove the existence of groundwater contamination, the Tribunal
rejects Ecuador's further request that Burlington pay the cost to complete groundwater

studies in 52 other sites in the Blocks.'°°

7. Well site abandonment
7.1 Parties’ positions

Finally, relying both on the Block 7 PSC as well as on Articles 53 RAOHE and 24 ROH
(Reglamento de Operaciones Hidrocarburiferas),'°°' Ecuador requests that Burlington
pay the costs of abandonment of the wells in Block 7. It estimates the costs per site to
be at least USD 500,000 and claims a total of USD 3,500,000 for the seven sites
contemplated in the Consortium’s Abandonment Plan of 2008.'% Although the
Consortium’s Abandonment Plan was approved by the authorities in March 2009,
Ecuador argues that the budgeted costs of USD 929,772 “is extremely low’, since IEMS
estimated the costs for concrete sealing of a well only at USD 500,000.'** Therefore, if
the Tribunal were minded to consider only the seven sites mentioned in the
Abandonment Plan, it should grant at least USD 3,500,000.'®* In addition, Ecuador
complains — though without making a specific claim — that “there are other areas that

should have been abandoned that were not part of the Abandonment Plan”."®°°

Burlington accepts to bear the cost of USD 100,000 per site for properly abandoning
seven sites that stopped producing under the Consortium’s operation.'* These sites
are Condor Norte, Gacela 2, Gacela 3, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 7/8, Jaguar 9 and Lobo 4."8”

7.2 Discussion

There is no dispute between the Parties that non-productive sites must be abandoned
following a proper procedure. Article 53 RAOHE provides that, in case of definitive
abandonment of an area of influence, the operator must remove all equipment and
infrastructure, process all wastes, seal the wells, and restore the site by reforesting the
area, ‘5

The Consortium submitted an Abandonment Plan to the Ecuadorian authorities in
December 2008,'®° which was approved on 20 March 2009 by the Subsecretariat of
Environmental Protection.'* That plan covered the seven sites enumerated above

(paragraph 882).

It is true that Ecuador alleges that other areas “should have been abandoned”. ‘°°
However, it does not specify which sites are at issue nor does it present any other fact
allegations, not to speak of evidence. As a result, the Tribunal will not further entertain
this complaint.

By the time the Consortium left the Blocks in July 2009, no action had been taken
towards the abandonment of these seven sites.'°* Thus, Burlington must bear the
costs involved in abandoning these seven sites, which it does not dispute. The question
to be resolved by the Tribunal is merely one of quantum. Burlington accepts liability for
USD 100,000 per site and Ecuador claims at least USD 500,000.

In this context, the Tribunal notes that the Subsecretariat of Environmental Protection
approved the budgeted abandonment costs of USD 929,772 for the seven sites. "°°
IEMS, for its part, stated that it “did not have sufficient information to calculate the cost
of full restoration”. It added that the abandonment costs “should be calculated by a third
party, through an assessment of market characteristics’, since the Consortium’s
estimate of USD 929,722 was “extremely low’.'®%*

IEMS also refers to an assessment it performed in 2008, which estimated at
USD 500,000 the costs to cap one well operated by the City Oriente petroleum
company, adding that this did not cover “soil reconfiguration, dismantlement of
infrastructure and cleanup and reforestation”.'®° The Tribunal is unable to rely on this
cost figure, as IEMS did not provide any details in respect of City Oriente’s services. It
also notes that IEMS itself acknowledges that it lacked sufficient information to compute
restoration costs. By contrast, the Tribunal has available the costs budgeted by the
Consortium and approved by the Ecuadorian authorities which did state that the
proposed abandonment plan contemplated “/as medidas necesarias para asegurar la
recuperacion de las condiciones ambientales del sitio” or in English, “the measures
required to ensure the restoration of the environmental conditions of the site”.'°° These
costs amount in total to USD 929,722. Accordingly, the Tribunal grants such amount as
costs for abandonment of the seven well sites mentioned above.

C. Infrastructure Counterclaims
1. Parties’ positions
1.1. Ecuador’s position

Ecuador claims that when the Consortium abandoned Blocks 7 and 21 in July 2009 and
Ecuador (through Petroamazonas) took control of the operations, it became apparent
that the Consortium had failed to maintain the Blocks’ infrastructure in good working
condition in accordance with best industry practices, as required by the PSCs. As a
consequence, says Ecuador, Burlington failed to return to Ecuador all equipment, tools,
machinery and installations in good condition, thus breaching the provisions of the
Hydrocarbons Law.

Ecuador argues that, under both the PSCs and Ecuadorian law, the Consortium was
under a dual obligation (i) to construct, maintain and replace the infrastructure on
Blocks 7 and 21 in accordance with industry standards and (ii) upon contract
termination, to return the Blocks to the State in good working condition. According to
Ecuador, the Consortium breached both obligations and Burlington is accordingly liable
for the remedial costs.'°°”

More specifically, Ecuador contends that, under the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21, the
Consortium was under an obligation to “use personnel, equipment, machinery,

materials, and technology in accordance with the best standards and practices
generally accepted in the international hydrocarbons industry’.'° Further, the
Consortium was required to deliver to the State “at no cost and in good condition all
wells in production at that time, together with all equipment, tools, machinery,
installations and other items acquired under the terms of this Contract, and all items
must be in good condition except for normal wear’.'®° Article 29 of the Hydrocarbons
Law, incorporated by reference in the PSCs, also provides for an obligation to turn over

the infrastructure to the State “in good condition”."®”°

Ecuador agrees with Burlington that the PSCs and Ecuadorian Law refer to generally

accepted standards'®”'

and practices in the hydrocarbon industry."®” Burlington's
expert Intertek and Ecuador's witness, Mr. Pablo Luna, explain in detail the contents of
these standards with respect to building, maintaining and replacing upstream
infrastructure in the hydrocarbon industry.'®*

Ecuador submits that the Consortium breached its obligation to invest in, maintain and
return the infrastructure in good condition and in accordance with industry standards, by
following a “run to failure” maintenance strategy.'®’* According to Mr. Solis, Perenco’s
maintenance policy was driven by an “obsession [...] with reducing costs and making
only the most indispensable minimum investings’, which “translated into a lack of
operational safety”.'°”> The same witness also gave evidence that Perenco exerted “a

lot of pressure to extract the highest quantity of oil” in the shortest possible time.'®” It

was therefore unsurprising that, when Ecuador took over the operations in July 2009,
the infrastructure on the Blocks, and especially in Block 7, was in poor working
condition. Mr. Diego Montenegro, another witness of Ecuador, adds that the condition
of the infrastructure did not measure up “to international petroleum industry
standards”.'°””

Specifically, Ecuador contends that the Consortium failed to maintain and revert the
infrastructure in good condition because (i) it operated and built sub-standard facilities
(platforms and CPFs); (ii) it failed to repair, replace and/or properly maintain fluid lines
and pipelines; (iii) it damaged power generators through the use of a cheap and
potentially harmful blend of crude oil and diesel (rather than diesel fuel alone) and
through the failure to perform timely overhauls; and (iv) it failed to replace obsolete
equipment and systems, install appropriate back-up systems, hold a sufficient stock of
spare parts and maintain roads.'®” Ecuador's specific arguments are summarized
below.

Ecuador dismisses Burlington’s arguments regarding the Consortium’s alleged
successful operation of Blocks 7 and 21 and Petroamazonas’ continued operation as
mere rhetorical defenses:

i. With respect to Burlington’s argument that the Consortium had the economic
incentive to maintain and develop production and thus it made “no economic
sense for the Consortium to ignore maintenance”, Ecuador denies that this was
the case for Block 7.'°”° Ecuador notes that the Block 7 PSC was to expire in
2010, and a proactive maintenance program would only pay off in the long term.
According to Ecuador's witnesses, “the Consortium’s maintenance was driven by

a ‘fix it when it breaks’ philosophy”. "°°

Ecuador denies the Consortium’s statement that it “could not have successfully
operated for seven years if the construction and the maintenance of its
infrastructure were inadequate”.'®' As explained by Messrs. Luna and Solis, the
fact of producing crude oil does not necessarily mean that the equipment and
facilities were in good condition.'* According to Ecuador, ‘[iJt is a fact that
Burlington’s alleged ‘successful’ operations and production were obtained at the
expense of the environment [...] and the safety of its own personnel”, as
Mr. Solis’s testimony confirms. '®*

While it is true that Petroamazonas has managed to increase production in
Block 7, it is not true that this has been achieved by using the very same
infrastructure used by the Consortium. According to Ecuador, “this increase has
been made possible by a massive investment in new infrastructure to replace the
obsolete and/or worn-out infrastructure left by the Consortium (the cost of which is
included in Ecuador's infrastructure claim) as well as new infrastructure strictly
devoted to expanding the crude processing capacity in Block 7 (the cost of which
is not claimed by Ecuador) as well as a radical change of the underlying
philosophy of the maintenance program (from a corrective to a proactive

approach to maintenance)”.

According to Ecuador, “the reality is that the Consortium’s alleged comprehensive

maintenance ‘program’ was inexistent or flawed and failed to ensure that the

infrastructure in Blocks 7 and 21 was maintained and replaced in accordance with

international industry standards”.'°*° Ecuador alleges in particular that the Consortium

(a) did not devote sufficient resources (whether human or material) to ensure a proper

maintenance program, and that (b) in any event its maintenance program was either

non-existent or dysfunctional.

With respect to (a), Messrs. Luna and Solis have testified that the Consortium had only

about 60 employees (including third party contractors) entrusted with maintenance

(rather than 200, as Burlington claims), and that these employees worked on 14-day
shifts, meaning that only half of them were on the Blocks at any given time.'®®° Nor did
the Consortium devote sufficient material resources to maintenance, as is
demonstrated when one compares Petroamazonas’ spending with that of the
Consortium, and when one looks at the lack of spare parts for maintenance repairs.'*”
With respect to (b), the evidence and especially the testimony of Messrs. Luna and
Solis demonstrates that “neither the Consortium’s maintenance inspections nor record
keeping practices ever met the requirements of international industry standards and
practices”, and the Consortium did not carry out sufficient preventive maintenance
tasks.'®®° In particular, Ecuador alleges that (i) the Consortium’s own data show that
from 2007 to 2009, 81% of its maintenance activities were corrective;'®® (ii) the
Consortium failed to carry out the necessary inspections, and when it did, they did not
meet international standards; (iii) similarly, the Consortium’s inspection reports did not
meet international standards (for instance, by failing to contain recommendations as to
maintenance); and (iv) the Consortium failed to carry out the proactive maintenance
tasks required by international standards and practices (for instance, by failing to use
“pigs” to clean pipelines and flow lines before injecting chemicals, to maintain tanks and
power oil pumps, and to carry out overhauls for engines used for power generation). "°°°
Ecuador adds that the Consortium’s SAP system could not correct the failures in the
Consortium’s maintenance policy.‘

For Ecuador, the Consortium’s “run to failure” strategy is confirmed inter alia by the
email of 11 March 2009, in which Mr. D’Argentré instructed the Consortium’s
maintenance managers to focus only on urgent and indispensable services and put

everything else on standby. '**

Ecuador also denies that the evidence contemporaneous to the Consortium’s
operatorship demonstrates the good condition of the Blocks’ infrastructure. While
Ecuador recognizes that “it is true that these documents include some statements in
passing to the effect that most of Block 7 and 21 infrastructure was in good condition”, it
argues that “none of them were intended to constitute a proper basis for assessing the
true technical condition of Block 7 and 21 infrastructure at that time”.'°%° Ecuador
contends in particular that (i) the 2009 SGS Report was “nothing more than an
inventory of the field equipment and facilities for accounting purposes”, and was not a
technical inspection that could serve to establish the state of the equipment and
facilities;'®™ (ii) the 2008 Block 7 environmental audit lasted only one week, which
would not have been sufficient to assess the condition of all of the Block’s
equipment;'®* and (iii) as far as the 2008 Block 21 environmental audit is concerned,
while it appears to have required more working hours, its conclusions are limited to
assessing the Block’s facilities and equipment in light of its environmental impact, and
as a result does not provide useful information on their physical condition. '*° In any
event, Ecuador argues that environmental audits are of limited value to assess the
technical condition of equipment and facilities. °°”

Similarly, Ecuador dismisses the relevance of Dr. Egan’s testimony. Ecuador argues in
particular that Dr. Egan’s factual testimony is of limited value because he only visited
the Blocks once in 2012 for a period of one week. Thus, his testimony on the condition
of the infrastructure postdates the takeover or relies on the review of documents, which
Ecuador characterizes as hearsay. Ecuador further submits that Dr. Egan’s expert
evidence is unreliable, because “to assess whether equipment is in ‘good condition’ and
whether there has been ‘normal wear’ the actual rates of degradation need to be
assessed”, and “[t]hat assessment can only be done contemporaneously; it cannot be
gleaned from by an inspection undertaken three years later in 2012 (which is what

Dr. Egan did) and not by reference to generic industry practices (which is what
Dr. Egan‘s Expert Reports purport to do with respect to all of the key categories of
equipment and _ infrastructure)’. Accordingly, Messrs. Luna and_ Solis’s
contemporaneous evidence should be preferred. '*%

According to Ecuador, the evidence in the record establishes beyond doubt that many
of the Blocks’ equipment and facilities were either obsolete or in bad condition
exceeding normal wear and tear. Ecuador's specific arguments in this respect are
summarized further below.

Ecuador quantifies the damages suffered as a result of the Consortium’s breaches of its
infrastructure obligations for Blocks 7 and 21 at USD 17,231,458.85. It describes this
amount as modest, given that it represents “only 28% of the Consortium’s maintenance
budget during the operatorship, or a USD 2 million maintenance shortfall for each year
of the Consortium’s six and a half year operatorship”."°°°

Contrary to Burlington’s contention, Ecuador submits that it has duly substantiated all of
its claims for infrastructure damage and is not claiming costs related to the expansion of
Blocks 7 and 21.'°°

1.2 Burlington’s position

According to Burlington, Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims should be dismissed
along with its environmental claim. The Consortium complied with its obligation to
maintain the Blocks’ infrastructure in accordance with international engineering
standards and in compliance with the PSCs. Indeed, Ecuador has failed to provide
credible evidence to the contrary. Burlington describes Ecuador's infrastructure
counterclaims as concocted and “alternatively unsubstantiated or irrelevant to
refurbishing or replacing substandard equipment”. '°'

Prior to this arbitration, Ecuador had never alerted the Consortium to any major defect
in its maintenance practices or the condition of the Blocks’ infrastructure. Even though

the expropriation thwarted any prospect of an orderly handover of the Blocks, the
condition of the infrastructure as of July 2009 complied with all of the Consortium’s
contractual and legal obligations.

Burlington draws attention to Clause 5.1.8 of the Block 7 PSC and to Clause 5.1.7 of
the Block 21 PSC, under which the Consortium was under an obligation to use the
infrastructure “in accordance with the generally accepted norms and practices of the

international petroleum industry”.'°~

The Claimant further notes that Ecuador adopted the American Petroleum Institute
(API) standards. API is one of several international standard-developing agencies
establishing industry consensus on best practices regarding the construction and
maintenance of equipment. API standards combine preventive and_ predictive
maintenance techniques. Preventive maintenance techniques refer to “time-based,
planned maintenance activities or scheduled tasks, irrespective of the conditions under
which the equipment operates”, whereas predictive maintenance techniques are used
“to tailor maintenance activities to individual pieces of equipment in operation”.'°°° By
adopting both, as the Consortium did in the present case, operators ensure compliance

with best industry practices. '°*

Burlington also stresses that Clauses 18.6 of the Block 7 PSC and 18.6 of the Block 21
PSC provided that the Consortium was to return the equipment in good condition
except for normal wear. Article 29 of the 1978 Hydrocarbons Law also refers to “good
condition”. Contrary to what Ecuador implies, good condition does not require the return
of new or upgraded equipment. Ecuador wrongly asserts that the infrastructure present
in the Blocks shows more than mere normal wear and tear. There is no obligation under
the PSCs or Ecuadorian law to replace equipment simply because it is old.

Burlington further claims that Ecuador’s notion of “obsolescence” is misconstrued. As
the Claimant's expert Dr. Egan has explained, Ecuador's concept of obsolescence does
not accord with the commonly used definition in the oil industry.'%° As stated in a

document on which Ecuador relies, “the ‘key is not the age of existing equipment, but its
x 1906

condition’
Burlington affirms that it has complied with international petroleum industry practices.
Indeed, had the Consortium not used equipment in compliance with international
practices, it would not have been able to operate the fields for over seven years. '°°”
First, the equipment was built in accordance with international standards. This was
confirmed by Moody International, for instance, which inspected the tanks and attested
that they had been built in compliance with API 650."°° It is further confirmed by
Dr. Egan and the 2008 Environmental Audit." Second, approximately 200 qualified
employees followed a comprehensive maintenance program set up by the Consortium,
combining preventive and predictive strategies.'°'° Third, the Consortium kept detailed
maintenance records and was subject to extensive reporting obligations (yearly
budgets, annual reports, quarterly reports).'°""

Accordingly, the Claimant submits that Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims have no
legal merit and should be dismissed. Not content with reaping over US$ 4 billion in
revenue from the Blocks since their seizure, Ecuador now seeks an additional US$ 17
million “to upgrade the infrastructure taken from the Consortium”.'*? Considering that
they do not amount to more than 1% of the total amount claimed by Ecuador in these
proceedings, Burlington argues that the infrastructure counterclaims have been
fabricated by Ecuador in order to “provide foundation to its environmental

allegations”,'®"* and “set off against Perenco and Burlington's claims for the loss of their

investments in the Blocks”.'*"*

Burlington also asserts that the abundant evidence in the record is unequivocal in
showing that the Blocks’ infrastructure was in good working condition in July 2009. This
was expressly confirmed by the two reports drafted by Société Générale de
Surveillance conducted in 2009 and 2010 (the “SGS Reports”).'*> In this respect,
Ecuador's “self-serving inspection reports” prepared several years after the seizure are
irrelevant. Moreover, Ecuador’s damages claim includes costs related to its decision to
increase production in the Blocks as well as other costs unrelated to this arbitration.'*"®
Contemporaneous assessments of the infrastructure used in Blocks 7 and 21, argues
Burlington, contradict Ecuador’s thesis of obsolescence and lack of maintenance, as
shown by the following reports:

i. The 2008 Environmental Audits of Blocks 7 and 21 refute Ecuador’s allegation
that the infrastructure was in “sub-standard conditions”. The Block 7 audit reached
the conclusion that “[i]n general the installations and equipment are in good
condition”, identifying only minor issues of normal wear and tear.'°*"” Similarly, the
Block 21 audit concluded that the facilities were “appropriately maintained and are
subject to an ongoing maintenance program”.'°"®

ii. The assessment carried out by SGS shortly before the seizure in July 2009 also
refutes Ecuador's claims. All of the equipment on the Blocks was examined at that
time, resulting in a 9,000 page report. SGS concluded that approximately 92% of
the equipment in Block 7 and 99% of the equipment in Block 21 was in “good” to
“very good” condition."*'® Thus, this report provides no support to Ecuador's

exaggerated accusations of disastrous and dangerous conditions. ‘°°

ii. The SGS Report commissioned by Ecuador after the seizure once again

confirmed the good condition of the infrastructure in both Blocks.
All this evidence was further corroborated at the Hearing, during which Mr. D’Argentré
explained how the equipment used in both Blocks was subject to “intensive oversight”
by the Government during the entire duration of the Consortium’s operations. '°”*
According to Burlington, the Hearing showed that Ecuador’s witnesses lacked credibility
or relevant knowledge. Whereas Burlington chose to commission a leading oil and gas
infrastructure expert, Dr. Egan, to assess the infrastructure counterclaims, Ecuador
decided to rely exclusively on factual witnesses, who lacked credibility and first-hand
knowledge of the operations on the Blocks.'°*
Burlington submits that, in any event, Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims are wholly
unsubstantiated and in fact comprise a thinly disguised claim for regular maintenance
(of the type that Petroamazonas as operator as of July 2009 must bear) and betterment
of the Blocks beyond what the Claimant was contractually required to hand over. The
Consortium maintained and returned the infrastructure in accordance with the PSCs
and Ecuadorian law. Ecuador has failed to provide credible evidence to the contrary
and instead has fabricated infrastructure claims that are unsubstantiated or unrelated to

the alleged sub-standard condition of the equipment on the Blocks. '°**

2. Analysis

The Tribunal will start by setting out the applicable legal framework (2.1) as well as
some general considerations applying to all infrastructure counterclaims (2.2).
Thereafter, it will discuss each of Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims, i.e. the claims
in respect of tanks (2.3), fluid lines and pipelines (2.4), power generators (2.5), pumps,
equipment and systems, back-up systems, spare parts and roads (2.6), and other
claims (2.7) before reaching a conclusion (2.8).

2.1 Legal framework
It is common ground between the Parties that certain clauses of the PSCs establish the
Consortium’s particular obligations with respect to the Blocks’ infrastructure, both during
the operation of Blocks 7 and 21 and upon termination of the PSCs.

Clause 5.1.8 of the PSC for Block 7 and Clause 5.1.7 of the PSC for Block 21 require
the Consortium to use qualified personnel and suitable equipment and technology
during the operation of the Blocks. Clause 5.1.8 reads as follows:

“5.1 Obligations of the Contractor: [...]

[J

5.1.8 Use qualified personnel, as well as suitable equipment, machinery,
materials and technology, in accordance with generally accepted
international petroleum industry practices”.

Clause 5.1.7 similarly provides:

“5.1 Contractor’s Obligations: [...]

[J

5.1.7. To use personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, and
technology in accordance with the best standards and_ practices
generally accepted in the international hydrocarbon industry”."°°
Upon termination of the PSCs, Clauses 5.1.22 and 18.6 of the PSC for Block 7 and
Clauses 5.1.21 and 18.6 of the PSC for Block 21 provide that the Consortium shall
return the wells and equipment to PetroEcuador in good condition, except for normal
wear and tear, and at no cost. Specifically, these provisions are worded as follows:

Block 7 PSC

“5.1.22 Upon termination of the Contract, deliver the wells, property,
installations, equipment and infrastructure related to this Contract to
PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good condition, pursuant to the
provisions of Article twenty-nine (29) of the Hydrocarbons Law’.

“18.6 Upon termination of this Contract, either due to expiration of the

Production Period or for any other reason during the same Period, the
Contractor will deliver to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good

Block 7 PSC (Exh. C-1; Exh. CE-CC-28) and Block 21 PSC (Exh. C-2; Exh. CE-CC-13).

condition, all wells in production at that time, together with all equipment,
tools, machinery, installations and other items acquired under the terms
of this Contract, and all items must be in good condition except for
normal wear’.

Block 21 PSC

“5.1.21 Upon termination of the Contract, the Contractor shall deliver to
PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good condition, the wells, property,
facilities, and equipment that were acquired for the purpose of the
Contract in accordance with article 29 of the Law on Hydrocarbons’.

“18.6 Upon termination of this present Contract at the end of the
Production Period or for any other cause occurring during the same
Period, the Contractor shall deliver to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and
in good production conditions, the wells that are active at such time as
well as, in good conditions except for normal wear and tear, all other
equipment, tools, machinery, facilities, and other movable and
immovable property acquired for the purposes of this present
Contract”."°6
924. The provisions cited above essentially restate the obligations set out in Article 29 of the

Hydrocarbons Law, to which both provisions refer:

“[U]pon termination of an exploration and exploitation contract, due to
expiration of its term or for any other reason arising during the
exploitation period, the contractor or associate must turn over to
PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in a good state of production, the oil
wells that are in activity at the time; as well as, in good condition, all
equipment, tools, machinery, installations and other real or personal
property that were acquired for the purposes of the contract [...]”."

925. In the Tribunal’s view, these provisions set out two separate but related obligations: the
first one is an obligation de moyens, which would be met if the Consortium employed
generally accepted standards and practices in the petroleum industry in the operation of
the Blocks, while the second is an obligation de résultat, which would only be met if the
Consortium delivered the Blocks in a certain condition at the expiration of the PSCs.
Whether the Consortium complied with the first obligation will depend on its standard of
diligence, whereas whether it complied with the second will depend on an objective
assessment of the state of the infrastructure, regardless of diligence. Ultimately,

however, the amount of any compensation is to be determined on the basis of damage
actually caused.

With respect to the first obligation, the obligation de moyens, the Parties agree that the
“best standards and practices generally accepted in the international hydrocarbon
industry” referred to in the clauses quoted above include in particular the American
Petroleum Institute (API) standards, which are endorsed by Ecuadorian legislation. '°*
For example, Article 10 of the ROH provides that contractors “shall apply, at least” the
API standard “and any other rule or standard of the petroleum industry”:

“Norms and standards: In hydrocarbon operations, PETROECUADOR
and contractors shall apply, at least, the practices recommended by the
American Petroleum Institute (API) particularly the following: ‘Exploration
and Production Standards’ and the ‘Manual of Petroleum Measurement

Standards’ and any other rule or standard of the petroleum industry”.'°°

In addition, the RAOHE sets specific standards related to infrastructure and contains
several references to the API standards.'°° It is similarly undisputed that the API
standards combine preventive and predictive maintenance techniques.

With respect to the second obligation de résultat, Burlington’s obligation was to return
the equipment in good (working) condition, except for normal wear and tear. For
Ecuador, this obligation is informed by the Consortium’s obligation to comply with best
standards and practices, as follows:

“[T]he content of the Consortium‘s positive hand-back obligation is plainly
informed by the Consortium's ongoing obligation to operate the
equipment to “best standards and practices generally accepted in the
international hydrocarbon industry’. Accordingly, for the reasons
explained by Dr. Egan under cross-examination: (i) “Good condition”
means that the equipment and infrastructure has both been maintained
in accordance with best international practice and is performing in
accordance with its expected industry standard performance levels for
equipment and infrastructure of that type and age; and (ii) “Normal wear’
means that the equipment is only degrading at the industry-expected rate
for equipment that has been maintained in accordance with best
international practice (assessing actual rates of degradation, not merely
maintenance in accordance with manufacturer maintenance intervals, is

the relevant enquiry). “Good condition’ does not simply mean “no
problems” at the moment of termination”. ‘°°

Ecuador also submits that, according to the best standards and practices in the
international hydrocarbon industry, upstream infrastructure must be replaced when (a) it
has become obsolete, or (b) it is no longer fit for service. The Parties appear to agree
that equipment that is no longer fit for service must be replaced, but differ in their

definition of obsolescence:

Burlington, relying on Dr. Egan, submits that “properly-functioning equipment that
can be serviced is not considered obsolete in the upstream oil industry. Instead,
oil field equipment becomes obsolete when it no longer operates and can no
longer be maintained because (i) the manufacturer is no longer in business, (ii)
spare parts are no longer available, or (iii) service providers for maintenance are
no longer available”.'*** Dr. Egan does not cite to petroleum standards, but to an

article commenting on obsolescence in air force equipment.‘

Ecuador, relying on Mr. Luna, contends that “obsolescence is a rule of efficiency
which considers both the technology of the equipment as well as the availability of
parts, the cost of maintenance (which is based on the quality of the maintenance),
whether the useful life [of the asset] has ended [...] Operational safety should be
included in the concept of obsolescence”.'®** Ecuador thus finds Dr. Egan’s
criteria too restrictive “and even absurd as they imply that equipment is not
obsolete (and accordingly, need not be replaced as long as it does not fail) even
though a newer and more efficient technology has become available and / or the

equipment is no longer safe to operate”.'**°

The Tribunal notes that neither Dr. Egan nor Mr. Luna have cited to standards in the

hydrocarbon industry to make these assertions. It has thus considered each position in
the context of Burlington’s contractual obligation, which was to return equipment in

R-PHB, § 936 (emphasis in the original).

good (working) condition, except for normal wear, without requiring Burlington to
upgrade it to the newest and most efficient technology. It thus finds that Burlington had
to replace equipment when it was no longer fit for service, when it could no longer be
operated or be maintained, when it had exceeded its useful life, or (even if the above
conditions were not met), when it posed an operational safety risk.'°°°

With these standards in mind, the Tribunal will now turn to Ecuador’s infrastructure

counterclaims.

2.2 General considerations on the assessment of the infrastructure
counterclaims
Prior to analyzing each of the infrastructure counterclaims below, the Tribunal wishes to
mention three points.

First, both Parties challenge the credibility or relevance of each other's witnesses and
experts. The Tribunal recognizes that the witness and expert testimony submitted by
both Parties has some limitations. With respect to witness evidence, the Tribunal notes
in particular that only one of Ecuador's witnesses (Mr. Solis) was present in the Blocks
during the Consortium’s operatorship, and Burlington has challenged his credibility.'°°”
Similarly, Ecuador challenges the relevance of Mr. D’Argentré’s testimony, because he
was only present in the Blocks from 2007 on. With respect to expert evidence, Ecuador
challenges the testimony of Dr. Egan. It argues that, because he only visited the fields
in 2012, he cannot attest to the state of the infrastructure in 2009 as a factual matter,
nor can he provide an expert opinion on the degradation of the infrastructure on that
date. The Tribunal agrees that Dr. Egan is not a factual witness, but it sees no reason
to dismiss outright Dr. Egan’s expert opinions based on his review of contemporaneous
documents.

As a result, to the extent possible, the Tribunal will primarily rely on contemporaneous
documents to determine the state of the infrastructure on the date of the takeover. If it
nevertheless relies on witness evidence, the Tribunal will take into consideration the
The Tribunal has noted in particular the article cited by Mr. Luna at Annex 48: R. L. Hughes,
Reasons to Replace Equipment, 2001, www.Reliability.com (“So how do we know when
equipment has actually reached, or is approaching, the end of its useful life cycle. [...] First and

foremost is safety. [...] When the equipment presents an unacceptable safety risk to the plant,
plant personnel or the environment — replace it!”).

actual knowledge of the particular witness. Similarly, if it relies on expert evidence, the
Tribunal will consider whether such evidence is based on an objective assessment of
contemporaneous documents in light of the applicable industry standards and practices.

Second, there are two contemporaneous reports in the record prepared by an
independent third party, SGS, in 2009 and 2010 (the “SGS Reports’).'%® Both
documents assess the condition of the infrastructure (including equipment, facilities and
other assets) of Blocks 7 and 21 according to five categories: very good, good, fair,
bad, and very bad." According to those reports, a significant majority of the
infrastructure was considered to be in a good or very good condition. Indeed, this
seems confirmed by some of Ecuador's claims, such as those related to tanks and
pumps: the Respondent seeks compensation for what it claims was the sub-standard
condition of only 3 tanks out of the 89 present on the Blocks, and of only 5 pumps out of
the 160 on the Blocks. It is true that Ecuador dismisses the SGS Reports on the
grounds that they are mere asset inventories.'° The Claimant's expert Dr. Egan, for
his part, considers these reports “very important” “as a_ starting point’, but
acknowledges that they are not the equivalent of a technical audit of the condition of the
equipment.'°""

Bearing these limitations in mind, the Tribunal will take account of the SGS Reports
where appropriate, especially where contemporaneous or other compelling evidence is

lacking.

Third, it is undisputed that Petroamazonas expanded operations and increased drilling
and production on both the Blocks from at least January 2010 onwards.'“? To any
outside observer, this expansion and increase in production would entail a need to

improve the existing infrastructure. Here again, Ecuador seeks to diminish the
importance of this fact. It in particular stresses that none of the amounts claimed is
associated with the expansion of production in the Blocks.'** The amounts claimed —
approximately USD 17 million — confirms this, says the Respondent, when one
compares this figure with Petroamazonas’s average annual maintenance costs of
USD 25 million."

As a general matter, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt Ecuador’s statement that the
amounts claimed here are unrelated to the expansion of the activities in Blocks 7 and
21. It remains though that the evidence of Petroamazonas’s expansion activities make it
sometimes difficult to establish the facts as they stood when Burlington left the Blocks.
The Tribunal will keep this in mind when assessing the evidence and will now review

each type of claim individually.

2.3. Claims related to tanks
2.3.1 Ecuador’s position

Ecuador argues that the Consortium operated and built sub-standard facilities (referring
mostly to platforms and CPFs). It continued to use facilities that had been built “more
than 15 years” ago without replacing them.'* It even built new facilities “using old
pumps and tanks recycled from older facilities that were dismantled for this
purpose”,'®* including pieces of equipment that were “too old”'™’ to be recycled.
Ecuador submits that the storage tanks are a salient example of how the Consortium
used and built facilities that did not comply with industry standards.'* First, Ecuador
contends that the Consortium purchased sub-standard tanks to avoid the costs of more
expensive tanks from established suppliers. In addition, Ecuador emphasizes that the
Consortium did not build a single tank in Block 7 with new materials. While recycling
parts of old tanks is not prohibited, it must comply with strict requirements that were not

met in this case. As a consequence, these tanks posed a safety and environmental risk.
As for Block 21, the tanks were bought at a discount from an inexperienced company,
and it is thus not surprising that they were sub-standard.

Second, the Consortium failed to properly maintain these tanks. Inspections carried out
from 2010 onwards show that several tanks in Blocks 7 and 21 were in need of repair
given their bad condition, which exceeded normal wear and tear. These tanks posed
significant safety and environmental risks. A 5,000 barrel storage tank in the Oso CPF,
for instance, “only allowed for a 30-minute reaction time from pump failure before a
spill”.'“° The Consortium also wrongly sought to minimize the seriousness of the
situation in its 2008 Environmental Audit.'°°

Ecuador specifies that the following tanks were in bad condition beyond normal wear
and tear as follows:

i. The Yuralpa CPF T-400 tank. According to Ecuador, the bad condition of this tank
was reported in two inspections in 2010 and 2011. The 2011 inspection reported
that 71% of the tank’s internal coating had deteriorated and recommended

exhaustive repair of the tank’s interior, which was done by a third party."°°"

ii. The Gacela CPF T-101 (T-72130A), T-102 (T-72130B) and T-104 (now T-72400)
tanks. According to Ecuador, various inspections between 2010 and 2012
detected serious corrosion at levels exceeding normal wear and tear, and
recommended full repair of tank T-104, which was done in 2012. The inspection
reports for tanks T-101 and T-102 also indicated that parts of these tanks were
worn out beyond normal wear and tear and had to be replaced.'** According to
Ecuador, this shows that the Consortium’s maintenance was insufficient.

iii. | The Coca CPF T-101 (T-71130), T-102 (T-71400A) and T-106 (T-71400B) tanks.
Ecuador alleges that inspections carried out in 2011 and 2012 identified corrosion
levels exceeding normal wear and tear on the shells and roof, as well as leaking

carried out by the Consortium in T-101 and T-102 were insufficient. '***

iv. The Payamino CPF T-101 (T-70130), T-102 (T-70100) and T-105 (T-70400)
tanks. Ecuador notes that inspections carried out between 2010 and 2011
identified issues of abnormal wear and tear, including the fact that four rings and
the roof of the T-101 tank should have been replaced before July 2009 (at the
then corrosion rate).'°°°

Out of those tanks, Ecuador claims the amounts spent to repair Gacela T-104,

Payamino T-102 and Yuralpa T-400, for a total of USD 902,962.'9%°

2.3.2 Burlington’s position

By contrast, Burlington contends that the Consortium had a suitable tank maintenance
program which included cathodic protection and frequent inspections to check for
external corrosion, dents and leaks. '°”

Burlington also notes that Ecuador's claim relates to a mere three tanks out of the 89
tanks on the Blocks. The small percentage of tanks that are the subject of this claim
(3.3%) shows that the vast majority of the tanks were in good working condition at the
time when Ecuador took over the Blocks and is proof that the Consortium’s
comprehensive tank maintenance and repair program was effective. '°°*

Furthermore, Burlington argues that the Block 7 tanks which, according to Ecuador,
needed to be replaced or repaired, underwent comprehensive repairs between 2005
and 2008 or were taken out of service with governmental approval.'°°° In respect of the
Block 21 tanks, they were built in accordance with industry standards and adequately

maintained with a cathodic protection process.'®° In particular, Burlington asserts that
the reported degradation and corrosion in the three tanks on which Ecuador bases its
claim occurred under Petroamazonas’s watch, well after the Consortium left the
Blocks." As a consequence, concludes Burlington, Ecuador's tank claims are
groundless and should be rejected.

2.3.3. Discussion

Ecuador takes issue with the Consortium’s practices for the building and maintenance
of storage tanks. It also asserts that 10 tanks out of 89 were in a bad condition beyond
normal wear and tear when Ecuador took over the Blocks, but limits its damages claim
to the cost of repairing three tanks.

The Tribunal finds that Ecuador has not substantiated its claim that the Consortium
failed to construct or maintain tanks in accordance with industry standards and
practices.

First, Dr. Egan has confirmed that, in his expert opinion, these tanks were constructed
and maintained in accordance with industry standards. Dr. Egan notes (and Mr. Luna
does not disagree) that oil storage tanks are built in accordance with API 650, while
their maintenance is governed by API 653 and bolted storage tanks for oil processing
are governed by API 12B.'% After reviewing a selection of the tanks in the Blocks
(between 15 to 20) during his visit in 2012, as well as maintenance records, Dr. Egan
confirmed that the Consortium abided by these standards. Specifically:

i. With respect to construction, Dr. Egan confirmed that all of the tanks which he
examined had the manufacturers’ name plates attached, indicating that the tanks
were manufactured in accordance with API 650.'%°°

ii. With respect to maintenance, Dr. Egan confirmed that “the Consortium (1)
regularly inspected the tanks and kept records of observations made during those
inspections; (2) monitored the corrosion of the tanks according to API 653; (3)

implemented an effective cathodic protection program; (4) worked with
independent contractors to conduct periodically comprehensive assessments in
order to identify necessary repairs; (5) devised plans to repair the large tanks on
the Blocks; (6) kept Ecuador apprised of tank repair plans; and (7) implemented
these plans”.'° Dr. Egan then concluded that “[iJn light of the Consortium’s
diligence in inspecting the tanks, the corrosion control and monitoring, the
thorough assessments, and the creation and implantation of tank repair plans, |
believe the Consortium was a responsible operator and complied with best
industry practices”.'%° To support this conclusion, Dr. Egan cited numerous
inspection reports and maintenance records. ‘°°

The Tribunal is aware that Dr. Egan’s physical inspection was limited to 15 to 20 tanks
out of 89, and that Mr. Luna has objected to his assessment of the Consortium’s
inspection records. However, the fact that Ecuador has limited its comments to 10 out
of 89 tanks (i.e., 11%), and claims damages with respect to only 3 of them (3%),
suggests that the Consortium’s maintenance plan was generally adequate, and that
problems were the exception.

Second, as Dr. Egan has pointed out, the inspections carried out by Petroamazonas
took place between 2010 and 2012, i.e. between one to three years after the takeover
of the Blocks, and the type of corrosion identified by Petroamazonas in the tanks is one
that normally occurs quickly. As a result, inspections carried out one year later or
thereafter would not be able to demonstrate whether the alleged corrosion was caused
by the Consortium. Dr. Egan explains this as follows:

“Ecuador is relying on ‘tank inspections’ conducted ‘from 2010 onwards’
to demonstrate that a certain degree of corrosion plagued the tanks in
July 2009. This is a risky approach because corrosion can develop and
propagate rapidly due to internal vapors of the liquid contained in the
tank. As Mr. Luna discusses in his third witness statement, there are two
types of corrosion: ‘homogenous’ corrosion, which impacts equipment
uniformly, and ‘localized’ corrosion, which appears in the form of ‘pitting’
(holes) and fissures. While homogenous corrosion results in normal wear

and can be more easily addressed and repaired, localized corrosion ‘is
insidious and often results in failure or even total destruction of
equipment without warning’.

‘Localized’ corrosion can occur very quickly and is often unanticipated.
This type of corrosion generally occurs from the inside of tanks, as tanks
of stored fluids contain a fair amount of oxygen, carbon dioxide and
acids, which form a corrosive substance. As acid condenses on the roof
of the tank, it gains greater concentration when evaporation occurs and
can become extremely corrosive (as seems to have occurred in the
Gacela T-104 tank, for example).

It is therefore incorrect to assume, as Mr. Luna does, that corrosion

condition at one point in time accurately reflect the condition a year or

more earlier”.'°°”
On this basis, Dr. Egan concludes that “[nJone of the inspection reports submitted by
Ecuador, some of which were conducted two and a half years after Ecuador took over
the Blocks, suggests that the current damage to the tanks was caused by the
Consortium’s operations. Rather, it appears that the tanks have fallen into much worse

condition since Petroamazonas took control of the Blocks”. '°

Having considered both Mr. Luna’s and Dr. Egan’s testimony as well as the documents
in the record, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that Ecuador has not established that
the Consortium breached its obligation to construct and maintain tanks according to
industry standards.

The Tribunal turns now to Ecuador's claim that the Consortium returned certain tanks
evidencing deterioration beyond normal wear and tear. As Ecuador claims damages for
only three specific tanks, the Tribunal will focus its analysis on these items.

a. Gacela T-104 tank

The record shows that the Gacela T-104 tank was inspected in December 2010,
December 2011 and February 2012.'% The December 2010 inspection detected
problems with the tank roof, which had a hole and presented high level of
oxidization.'”° The December 2011 inspection reported that “the damages caused by

the corrosive processes have increased in a significant manner since the records held
for the month of March” and called for a complete change of the roof, among other
measures.'®”' The February 2012 inspection concluded that the tank roof and bottom
had to be replaced and a cathodic protection system needed to be put in place.'*” The
SGS Reports are of no assistance in this context as they make no mention of this tank.

Dr. Egan agrees that the pictures taken during these inspections “clearly demonstrate
significant levels of corrosion”, but opines that “Ecuador fails to explain how the pitting
corrosion located on the Gacela T-104 tank at the time of the inspections is attributable
to the Consortium’.'*”* According to Dr. Egan, the fact that the tank was in good
condition when it was inspected in December 2008 and April 2009 suggests that it was
also in good condition in July 2009.

The Tribunal is not persuaded by Dr. Egan’s explanations. The corrosion of the tank
roof reported in 2010 was already signaled during inspections of the Consortium in
December 2008 and April 2009, although the roof was still considered in good condition
then.'° Dr. Egan recognizes that “it is entirely possible that the minimal corrosion
identified in April 2009 rapidly progressed and became visible in December 2010”.'°”°
As a result, the Tribunal finds it reasonable to consider that the cause of the corrosion
can be traced back to the Consortium’s operatorship.

The Tribunal thus grants damages in the amount of USD 293,442.00, which Ecuador
spent to repair the Gacela T-104 tank."®”* It notes that Burlington has not challenged the
quantification of this claim as such.

b. Payamino T-102 tank

Ecuador submits that inspections of the Payamino tank took place between 2010 and
2011. In support, it provides the contract signed between Petroamazonas and Conduto

to perform the repairs on tank T-102 which focused mainly on cleaning and painting the
tank both internally and externally."*’”” This document does not contain a description of
the state of the tank at that time.

The documentary evidence regarding the state of this tank before July 2009 is found in
a document prepared by the Consortium in April 2008 setting out the basis for the
bidding process to repair the Coca and Payamino tanks.'°”* It shows that, in March
2008, this tank was not in a critical condition but was in need of further inspection and
reparation. The document specifically mentions that the T-102 tank should be cleaned
and painted.'*”? Dr. Egan recognizes this, but notes that “[bJased on this repair report,
the Consortium developed a project plan with a proposed start date of October 2009
and a duration of eight weeks to conduct the necessary repairs”, but by that time the
Consortium was no longer operating the Blocks. ‘°°

This may have been so, but the record shows that this tank developed corrosion
beyond normal wear and tear during the Consortium’s watch and that on the date of the
takeover it had not been repaired. Ecuador claims USD 322,960.42 for the repairs done
to this tank,'%®' an amount that Burlington does not dispute as such. However, the
Tribunal notes that the amount claimed by Ecuador includes repairs made to pipelines
and other items. While the Tribunal considers that Ecuador's pipeline claim is justified
(see Section 2.4 below), it finds that Ecuador has not justified the claims for other
repairs and improvements itemized in Mr. Montenegro’s Annex 3. After a review of this
document, the Tribunal grants this claim in an amount of USD 210,130.76, which is the
amount that in the Tribunal’s view may be attributed to repairs made to tank T-102 and

pipelines. "°°?

c. Yuralpa T-400 tank

In connection with the Yuralpa T-400 tank, two inspections were carried out in March
2011. The first inspection recommended a complete repair of the interior of the tank and
identified some punctures in the body and roof of the tank that did not pose “an
immediate risk to the mechanical and structural integrity of the vessel”.'°*° The second
inspection carried out in the same month after having “sand blasted” the tank concluded
that “[djespite punctures present in the roof slaps and beams, there is no evidence of
any problems that could put mechanical and structural integrity of the container at
immediate risk. We recommend carrying out a careful application of the lining [...] as
well as keeping an annual monitoring program for the thickness of the tank roof”.'°*
The repairs were subsequently carried out by Conduto.'*®° However, all references to
Yuralpa T-400 in the SGS Reports indicate that the elements composing this tank were
in “good” or “very good” condition. °°

Since the first inspection identifying a defective condition of this tank dates from March
2011, which is about 20 months after the Consortium had left the fields, and the SGS
Report of June 2009 describes the condition of the components of this tank as “good” or
“very good”, the Tribunal considers that Ecuador has not established that any damage
to this equipment and costs incurred in relation to the condition of this equipment were
caused by the Consortium. As a result, it dismisses this claim.

In conclusion, the Tribunal grants the claim related to tanks in part in respect of the
Gacela T-104 and the Payamino T-102 tanks in an aggregate amount of
USD 503,572.76.

2.4 Claims related to fluid lines and pipelines
2.41 Ecuador’s position

Ecuador submits that the Consortium failed to repair, replace and/or properly maintain
fluid lines and pipelines. According to the Respondent, fluid lines transport production
fluid (a mixture of crude, gas and formation water, a very corrosive water) from the
wellhead to the CPF, where it is filtered, while pipelines transport the crude from the
CPF to the main pipeline through which the crude leaves the block.'%°”

Ecuador argues that the Consortium did not have a proper pipeline and fluid line
maintenance program. Block 7 had more than 100 kilometers of old and badly
maintained fluid lines and pipelines, and neither of the two most important pipelines in
Block 7 was replaced or properly maintained. The Consortium did not even have the
specialized personnel required to monitor the state of its fluid lines and pipelines. ‘°°

Mr. Solis described the poor state of the Consortium’s fluid lines and pipelines as “one
of the most serious problems we had”.'®®° According to Mr. Solis, Repsol performed
fluid line and pipeline maintenance on a weekly basis, whereas no maintenance was
ever done by the Consortium. Fluid lines and pipelines were thus in a state of decay by
July 2009, with no maintenance records or corrosion data.'°° Mr. Solis notes in
particular that the Consortium failed to “pig” its pipelines. ‘°°

As a result, when Petroamazonas arrived on the Blocks in July 2009, it “inherited a
network of decayed pipes, especially in Block 7, with no maintenance records or data
as to the state of corrosion of the pipes, with the corresponding operational and
environmental risks. Petroamazonas had, therefore, at great expense, to commission
technical studies and replace portions of the pipelines”.'°?

Specifically, Ecuador explains that Petroamazonas commissioned technical studies for
two pipelines: (i) the 12-kilometer pipeline connecting the Gacela and Coca CPFs,

commissioned to SETE (March 2011, the “SETE Report”),'°°? and (ii) a 37-kilometer
section of the pipeline connecting the Mono/Jaguar/Oso CPF with the Gacela CPF,
commissioned to Petroenergy (January 2012, the “Petroenergy Report”).'®* According
to Ecuador, the SETE Report concluded that various sections of the Gacela-Coca
pipeline needed to be urgently replaced due to severe corrosion and physical damage,
while the Petroenergy Report identified 296 defects in the Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela
pipeline, of which 44 were considered critical and thus requiring immediate repair.'°°°
As a consequence, several replacement and repair works were carried out.

Ecuador thus seeks to recover USD 1,667,655.83, i.e. the amount spent on the
assessment and repair of the pipelines and fluid lines. ‘°° In addition, the Respondent
alleges that it built two new pipelines, although this cost is not included in its claim.

2.4.2 Burlington’s position

Burlington contends that the Consortium had a comprehensive pipeline and fluid line
maintenance program that adequately addressed both external and internal corrosion.
For Burlington, this is confirmed by the fact that Ecuador's pipeline claim concerns only
a very small percentage of the entire pipeline network of the Blocks. It follows that the
vast majority of the pipelines were in good working condition.’ In any event,

Burlington argues that the Consortium’s proper maintenance of the pipelines is

confirmed by its maintenance records. '*%*

Burlington argues that Ecuador advances two main criticisms to its maintenance of
pipelines: (i) that the Consortium failed to carry out a comprehensive inspection of the
pipelines between 2004 and 2009, and (ii) that it did not use “pigging” as a method for
cleaning pipelines.'°°° Burlington rejects each of these claims.

With respect to (i), Burlington contends that it was not required to conduct a
comprehensive inspection of the pipelines prior to the end of 2009. The Consortium
carried out a thorough pipeline inspection in 2004 and, as the API standards only
require such inspections every 5 years, the next comprehensive inspection of the
pipelines was not due until the end of 2009.7 In any event, in the 2004-2009 period
the Consortium performed regular visual inspections, and employed standard industry
methods in its maintenance practices.?%"'

With respect to (ii), Burlington observes that the practice of pigging is only one of
several methods to clean pipelines and is not required under industry standards.
Indeed, due to their configuration, many pipelines were “unpiggable”.~ The
Consortium’s decision to use chemical injection was thus reasonable and in any event
equally effective.°

Burlington denies that the SETE and Petroenergy Reports provide evidence that there
were serious problems with the pipelines at the time when Ecuador took over the
Blocks. Burlington argues that these reports (i) do not actually report “decayed pipes”;
(ii) to the contrary, they report problems that amount to typical wear and tear which

conditions of the pipelines over a year after Ecuador’s takeover.
According to Burlington, the Respondent's claim is for costs that relate to routine
maintenance activities. The inspection carried out by SETE was part of a normal
pipeline maintenance schedule under API standards that only came due after the
Respondent took over the Blocks. Similarly, the corrosion inspection carried out by
Petroenergy is an inspection that any operator must conduct as part of routine
maintenance. Burlington further contends that the objective of both inspections was to
determine whether the existing system could handle Petroamazonas’ increased

production.7°°°

2.4.3. Discussion

Ecuador argues that the Consortium failed to carry out proper maintenance of the fluid
lines and pipelines and, as a result, the Consortium must compensate Petroamazonas
for the cost of assessing and repairing the pipelines.

The Parties’ positions differ widely as to whether the Consortium complied with its
obligation to carry out proper maintenance for fluid lines and pipelines. While Ecuador
and its witnesses emphatically assert that the Consortium did not have a maintenance
program in place, and “never” carried out maintenance activities, Burlington and its
witness and expert strongly affirms that it did have a maintenance program in place,
citing numerous maintenance records in support.

The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that Burlington did not appear to have a “written,
forward looking maintenance plan” in place for the Consortium’s pipelines and fluid
lines.”°°° Mr. D’Argentré was unable to point to a specific document in the record, and
contended instead that the pipeline management plan was ‘“live”.*°°” One can only
speculate as to what Mr. D’Argentré meant by “live”, but if a pipeline maintenance
program was in place in an operation such as the Consortium’s, it is implausible that
there would have been no comprehensive record of such a program. Mr. D’Argentré

clarified that he was not saying that no written plan existed, but rather that he did not
have access to it.2° It remains, however, that no written maintenance plan has been
submitted into the record.

Contrary to what Dr. Egan suggests,”°° the manual entitled entitled “Program of
Inspection and Integrity Management” to which he refers does not appear to be a
pipeline maintenance program, but rather a report on the details of the different

pipelines in Block 7.%°"° Indeed, despite its name, this document indicates that no
“integrity management programme” is available for any of the pipelines recorded.”>"'
And as Ecuador points out, had this document indeed been a pipeline management

program, Mr. D’Argentré would have referred to it.2°

That being said, Burlington has submitted numerous maintenance records showing that

it carried out maintenance of the pipelines, including (i) visual inspections and ultrasonic

thickness measurements;”°"* (ii) chemical injection programs designed to prevent

internal corrosion of pipelines;”°* (iii) cathodic protection of pipelines;2°° and (iv)

inspections and repairs of buried pipelines.”"® The Tribunal thus concludes that the
Consortium did carry out maintenance activities with respect to fluid lines and pipelines.

Whether these maintenance activities were in accordance with industry standards is a
different question. Dr. Egan affirms that they were:”°"” Mr. Solis strongly disagrees.”
The Tribunal is satisfied that, pursuant to the industry standards, the Consortium did not
need to carry out another comprehensive inspection of its pipelines until late 2009 (i.e.,
after the takeover), as the relevant standard (API RP570 - Piping Inspection Code)
requires major inspections to be carried out every 5 years. It also finds that the
Consortium’s failure to use “pigging” to clean its pipelines was not in breach of industry
standards.

Whether the Consortium complied with industry standards in its other maintenance
activities is more difficult to establish. The Tribunal notes that a 2011 Petroamazonas
report on the mechanical integrity of the transfer pipeline between Oso/Mono and
Gacela, to which Mr. Luna refers, notes that several parts of that pipeline had not
received preventive maintenance since its entry into service.”°'* While this report refers
to a single pipeline, it suggests that the Consortium’s maintenance of pipelines was
substandard.

Ultimately, however, what matters here is whether the pipelines that Petroamazonas
received at the takeover were in a condition beyond normal wear and tear. The Tribunal
has noted the emphatic testimony of Messrs. Luna, Montenegro and Solis, all of whom
attested to the dire conditions of the pipelines at the time of the takeover.?”° The
evidence of these three witnesses with direct, contemporaneous knowledge of the state
of the pipelines is a relevant indication which must be assessed together with the
documentation in the record.

There are three comprehensive studies of the state of the pipelines in Block 7 on
record:

i. The report prepared by the Consortium in November 2004 (the “Consortium
Report”);27!

ii. The SETE Report commissioned by Petroamazonas in March 2011 (the “SETE
Report’);”°” and

iii. | The Petroenergy Report commissioned by Petroamazonas in January 2012 (the

“Petroenergy Report’).?°

While none of these reports is contemporaneous to the takeover, they provide evidence
with respect to the state of the pipelines at various points in time.

The Consortium Report was prepared nearly five years before the Respondent took
over the Blocks. It covers part of Block 7, in particular the Gacela, Payamino, Coca and
Oso fields and applies standards API 570, ASME B31.3, ASME B31.4, ASME B36.10M,
and NACE RP-01-75. Out of all the lines examined, nothing of relevance is signaled,
except for a recommendation of regular re-inspection and monitoring in respect of
formalities.°*

Drafted 18 months after the Blocks were taken over by Petroamazonas, the SETE
Report relates to a 12 km pipeline connecting Gacela CPF to Coca CPF. The purpose
of this report was among others to:

- “Determine the current state of the line [...]
- Identify the areas that require repairs or replacement of sections [...]

- Assess the results obtained applying the standards provided by ASME

B31.4 — ASME B31G — API 570”.

989. The SETE Report concluded that the pipeline had suffered no “severe” internal
corrosion, but that sections of the line showed general external corrosion that in some
instances required urgent attention. Specifically, the report observed:

“L...] the line during the operating period of 19 years did not suffer severe
internal corrosive processes, as in average the percentage of loss of
thickness does not exceed 30% with respect to its nominal thickness. It
must be clarified that if no severe corrosive processes exist, this value
should not represent immediate risks for the integrity of the pipeline”.”°

- “There are several sections with generalised external corrosion
representing up to 50% of material loss in respect of nominal thickness.
These corrosive processes were due to the lack of a coating system that
allows to delay the line’s corrosion aggravated by the direct contact of
the line [...] with the ground [...]”.?°”

- “From the inspection of the 11439m that form the pipeline [...] 64
sections showed generalized external corrosion”.

- “Due to the existence of internal and external corrosive processes that
coincide in various points, there is a reduction in thickness of up to 70%
with respect to the nominal thickness, as is the case with tube 980 in the
Coca station, which require urgent attention”.

“It is possible to observe 16 buried sections, where it is necessary to

inspect and repair if required the areas of air-ground interphase. In the

majority it is possible to observe that the protective coating of the

interphase is completely deteriorated”.”°°°

990. As a result of these findings, the SETE Report recommended a number of actions,
including the replacement of certain sections and parts, as well as cleaning and
maintenance:

- “As a first step the right of way (the clearings along which the lines are
located) must be cleaned [...].

- Following the ASME B31.G recommendation, the sections of the transfer
line with several external corrosion (pittings of 4mm in depth) should be
replaced. [...]

- Taking into consideration ASME B31.4 and 451.6.2 (Ed. 2002), the
sections with dents should be replaced.

- Ageneral maintenance of the transfer line should be conducted [...].

- Carry out the complete restoration of the interphase areas of the buried
lines [...]”.2°3"
Dr. Egan has sought to downplay the SETE Report's conclusions on external corrosion,
stating that “apart from a few isolated areas that have external corrosion, the pipe wall
thickness is close to the nominal (original) wall thickness” and that most of the wall
thicknesses reported by SETE falls within this range.*°* Dr. Egan also notes that “[t]he
report, which incorporates these measurements, concludes that the remaining life of the
vast majority of the pipes would be 25 years”.*°* The Tribunal notes however that the
relevant section of the SETE Report leads to a different conclusion. The report states:

“Considering a homogenous loss of thickness of the remaining wall and

assuming that there will be no problems of external corrosion, the

remaining life calculated in these conditions would be 25 years. Given

that in this particular case there are problems of severe external

corrosion added to a loss of thickness of the wall, [which is] normal in this

type of lines due to the time of service and to the type of fluid. One

observe [sic] sections with a reduction in thickness of 70%, which would

represent a remaining life of 0 years in the sections affected by corrosive

processes”.70%
While the drafting of this paragraph is awkward, the Tribunal understands it to be saying
that, assuming a homogeneous loss of wall thickness and no external corrosion, the
useful life of the pipelines should be of 25 years. However, given that in this particular
case there are severe problems of external corrosion, added to a the loss of wall
thickness (the latter being normal in this type of pipelines due to the years of service
and the type of fluid), there are sections with a reduction of wall thickness of up to 70%,
which implies 0 years of remaining useful life for the sections affected by the corrosive
processes. While the report acknowledges that the loss of wall thickness is due to
normal wear and tear, it is less clear whether the same applies to external corrosion.
Seen together with the report's conclusion that external corrosion is caused by a lack of
external coating, the Tribunal concludes that the deterioration of these particular
sections was caused by a lack of proper maintenance and cannot be attributed to
normal wear and tear. Although the report is dated March 2011, i.e. over one year and

a half after Petroamazonas’ takeover, the Tribunal finds that the lack of external coating
can be attributed to the Consortium’s operatorship for the following reasons.

Dr. Egan acknowledges that there are “isolated” instances of severe corrosion, but
opines that Ecuador's claims are exaggerated. Dr. Egan explains that “there were only
two pipe sections out of a total number of 981 pipe sections in the 12 km long pipeline
that had external corrosion that required replacement”, which “represents approximately
0.2% of the pipe sections”.?° He adds that “[eJach of the pipe sections is about 12
meters in length, and it is most likely that the external corrosion is concentrated in an
area of approximately one foot long, which means the amount of the pipeline that would
need replacement is closer to 0.02%”. In addition, he asserts that “[t]hese two
affected pipe sections appear in a pipe section that was intentionally designed to have a
thinner wall, as demonstrated by the green line in Figure 6-2”, so “the fact that the wall
was thin is in part due to the original design of the pipeline system, rather than
corrosion”.”°*” Dr. Egan further asserts that “external corrosion and coating damage are
easily repaired by sand blasting to bare metal and recoating to inhibit the corrosion”.?%°
By contrast, Mr. Luna asserts that all 64 sections that evidenced external corrosion
must be replaced.”°%

The Tribunal notes that the SETE Report only recommends the replacement of those
sections affected by “severe” external corrosion:

“Following the recommendation of ASME B31.G, the sections of the fluid

line with severe external corrosion must be replaced. There are pittings

of a depth of up to 4mm [...]”.”
The SETE Report also notes that these sections are identified in “reporte UT-002-
SETE-2011, Anexo 1”,?' but this document is not in the record. Dr. Egan has not
explained which sections of the pipeline he considers to have shown severe corrosion

requiring replacement, but a review of the graphs included in the SETE Report appear
to confirm that only two sections were close to the withdrawal limit of the pipeline due to
external corrosion: (i) tubes 692, 693 and 694, and (ii) tube 980.2

GRAFICA 2. Corrosion Externa con Respecto al Espesor Nominal

ee mmeehehe  ————eias

Absent other evidence in the record, the Tribunal accepts Dr. Egan’s assessment that
each of these sections refers to approximately 12 meters of pipeline (24 meters in total),
representing approximately 0.2% of the length of the pipeline. Dr. Egan also opines that
“it is most likely that the external corrosion is concentrated in an area of approximately
one foot long, which means the amount of the pipeline that would need replacement is
closer to 0.02%”.*° This latter opinion appears unsubstantiated and thus the Tribunal
concludes that approximately 0.2% of the Gacela-Coca pipeline requires replacement.

The Tribunal also notes that there appears to be one instance of severe internal
corrosion (tube 908), as shown in the figure below.?™* As a result, it also considers that
this tube was beyond normal wear and tear.

998. Mr. Luna also emphasizes that the SETE Report indicatated that there were 16 buried
lines, in which 32 interphase sections were “completely deteriorated”. As a result, it
recommended “a comprehensive recovery of the interphase areas of the buried lines,
including welding of covers if the case so requires and a subsequent application of a
system of external coating together with a system of protection with mechanic tape”.?>4°
Dr. Egan does not respond to this point. Be this as it may, SETE’s observation that the
protective coating of the interphases is “completely deteriorated” indicates that it was
indeed beyond normal wear and tear.

999. The Tribunal now turns to the results of the Petroenergy Report, which was issued in
January 2012, almost two and a half years after Petroamazonas took over the Blocks.
Based on standard NACE SP0619-07, this report studies the corrosion levels of part of
the Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela CPF pipeline, in particular the 37 km connecting
Jaguar to Lobo. It identified a number of defects which it classified in terms of severity

and need for intervention as follows:2%”

In addition, the Petroenergy Report concludes that there is severe corrosion in 91.1% of
the 37 km or pipeline reviewed.7>

In Dr. Egan’s opinion neither of the tests carried out by Petroenergy (the ACVG test nor
the pH test) can be used to draw conclusions on the current condition of the pipeline or
its state of corrosion; rather the ACVG test “is an indicator of whether active corrosion
will become an issue in the future”, while the pH test “analyzes the activity of the
hydrogen ion in the soil in which the pipeline is buried in order to identify an
environment conducive to corrosion”.”°° According to Dr. Egan, the defects identified in
the report “are not defects in the sense that they will impact the structural integrity of the
line but rather are indications of coating breaches”.”°°' Indeed, Dr. Egan notes that the
report concludes that “99.90% of the cathodic protection levels complied with the
second criterion of NACE International Standard SP0169”.2°%*

Mr. Luna does not address these explanations, but emphasizes the following aspects:

i. “The results of the alternating current gradient measurement (ACVG technique),
which shows the condition of the external casing of the buried pipe: 296 defects,
of which 44 were critical, 62 should be repaired in a period of not more than 3
months, 97 should be repaired in 8 months, and 93 in one year’;

ii. | “The results of the hydrogen potential (HP) concentration level study: 91.1% with
severe external corrosion, 7.9% with moderate corrosion and only 1.1% had a
neutral tendency”.2%°°

The Tribunal has noted Dr. Egan’s opinion, but cannot overlook the fact that

Petroenergy identified 296 defects in the pipeline, 15% of which required immediate

attention and another 21% required short-term attention (within 3 months). While it is

true that a period of two and a half years had elapsed since the takeover, the Tribunal
finds it likely that the defects requiring immediate or short-term attention were caused
before Petroamazonas’ takeover. It thus finds that Ecuador has proved that a significant

part of the Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela CPF pipeline was beyond normal wear and

tear.

Ecuador seeks USD 1,667,655.83 for this claim,*°™ relying on Mr. Luna’s testimony.

However, the Tribunal notes that, in his last witness statement, Mr. Luna quantifies the

damages related to pipelines at USD 1,462,553.43, broken down as follows:

2055

The cost of retaining SETE to perform the inspection of the Gacela-Coca pipeline
(USD 272,560.41).20%

The cost of retaining Petroenergy to perform external corrosion tests on the
Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela CPF pipeline (USD 151,300).?°°”

The cost of engaging PEC to repair 106 out of the 296 defects identified by the
Petroenergy Report in the Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela CPF pipeline
(USD 489,404.44).7°5° Mr. Luna emphasizes that PEC has repaired only the
44 defects identified as urgent as well as the 62 defects identified as requiring an
intervention within three months.?°°°

The cost of engaging Sertecpet S.A. to maintain fluid lines, including changes of
pipes, sleeves and welding in Block 7 (in the Gacela, Payamino, Coca and Jaguar
fields) between April and August 2012 (USD 355,422.98).?0°°

The cost of engaging Sachatechnology Multiservicios Cia. Ltda. to perform
excavation services for the maintenance of pipelines and support to Sertecpect in
Block 7, and the maintenance of tubes in Block 21 (USD 193,865.60).

Indeed, he also states that 97 Category 1 defects and 93 Category 2 defects (a total of
190 defects) still remain to be repaired (Luna WS4, {| 168). As Petroenergy identified a total of
296 defects, this must mean that only 106 defects (296-190) have been repaired.

The Tribunal has found that significant parts of both the Gacela-Coca and
Mono/Jaguar/Oso to Gacela pipelines were beyond normal wear and tear. In reliance
on this finding and on the testimonies of Messrs. Luna, Solis and Montenegro, the
Tribunal considers it reasonable to extrapolate this observation to the remainder of the
pipelines in the Blocks. Even if the Consortium had a maintenance program in place
and had carried out comprehensive inspections in a timely fashion, the Consortium’s
maintenance efforts were clearly insufficient to maintain the pipelines in good working
condition. The Tribunal also notes that Ecuador is not requesting the replacement of the
pipeline system, but has limited its claims to the cost of two inspections and urgent or
necessary repairs. The Tribunal thus grants this claim in the amounts identified by
Mr. Luna, for a total of USD 1,462,553.43. Awarding this amount, it notes that
Burlington did not dispute the quantification of this claim for itself.

2.5 Claims related to generator engines

According to Ecuador, as a result of the Consortium’s substandard maintenance of a
number of power generator engines in Blocks 7 and 21, the engines were in an
appalling state when it arrived on the Blocks. Ecuador’s claim focuses on Wartsila
engines 2, 3, and 4 in Block 21 and on all 27 Caterpillar engines in Block 7.7°° Ecuador
accuses Burlington in particular of (i) a lack of proper overhauls to these engines, and
(ii) the inappropriate use of a harmful crude-diesel fuel mix in the Block 7 engines.

Ecuador claims that these deficiencies caused significant harm to the engines and
resulted in Ecuador incurring damages in the form of costs associated with the
performance of overdue overhauls, reduced engine life, and the purchase of a new
alternator for Wartsila engine 4. Ecuador claims the total of these costs amounting to
USD 6,540,010.57, of which USD 4,744,733.75 relate to Block 21 and
USD 1,795,276.80 concern Block 7.

Burlington dismisses Ecuador's claims as grave accusations unsupported by the
evidence.

The Tribunal will first address the claims with respect to overhauls (2.5.1), and then
those related to the use of the crude-diesel mix (2.5.2).

2.5.1. Overhauls
a. Ecuador’s position

Ecuador explains that, because Blocks 7 and 21 are in remote areas, the power
required for the operations must be generated locally. The Consortium thus installed
several Caterpillar diesel engine generators at every platform or CPF in Block 7, and
four Wartsila engines in Block 21. The engines must run 24 hours a day. To ensure
their proper performance, they must undergo routine maintenance and also regularly
scheduled major maintenance or overhauls.?°*

Ecuador alleges that the individualized assessment which it carried out upon arrival in
the Blocks (which was necessary because the Consortium appeared to have kept no
engine maintenance records) showed that the Consortium had failed to perform regular
overhauls to the engines prior to July 2009. It asserts that “the state of the engines in
both Blocks was appalling’. As a result, says Ecuador, it had to overhaul all 27
Caterpillar engines of Block 7, and Wartsila engines 2, 3 and 4 of Block 21, in addition
to buying a new alternator for Wartsila engine 4 and supplementing the existing stock of
spare parts.?°%

Ecuador rejects Dr. Egan’s assessment of the Consortium’s maintenance of the
engines. According to Ecuador and Mr. Luna, the Consortium’s own documents show
that Ecuador’s claim regarding delayed overhauls on the engines listed above is

“grounded and duly documented”.?%”

b. — Burlington’s position

Burlington denies that it failed to perform regular overhauls of the engines. It contends
that the Consortium had “a robust maintenance program in place” as Wartsila overhauls
were carried out by Wartsila engineers at the intervals prescribed by the manufacturer,
and Caterpillar engine overhauls were done by Consortium engineers in accordance
with Caterpillar’s recommended guidelines.” Burlington also alleges that it submitted
annual activity reports to the Government which included information on its

2069 2070

overhauls,” and provided extensive records of maintenance activities.

Burlington’s expert, Dr. Egan, confirms Burlington’s position. Specifically:

i. With respect to the WArtsila engines in Block 21, after having reviewed the
Consortium’s service contract and its maintenance records, Dr. Egan concluded
that the Consortium had performed overhauls in a timely fashion and in a manner
consistent with the manufacturer’s recommendations.”°”' Relying on Dr. Egan’s
testimony, Burlington argues that “[gliven that the Wartsila engines were to be
overhauled every 12,000 hours (i.e., every 1.36 years if constantly running),
Ecuador's claims for the overhaul of these engines are nothing more than a
disguised attempt to obtain reimbursement of post-July 2009 regular maintenance
costs for which the Consortium cannot be held liable”.”°”

ii. As to the Caterpillar engines in Block 7, after reviewing the Consortium’s
maintenance records and Mr. Luna’s witness statement, Dr. Egan concluded that
the Consortium did not delay overhauls; rather, Ecuador claims for several

engines that had been recently overhauled by the Consortium and as a result

could not have been due for overhaul at the time of the takeover.”°”°

In his second report, Dr. Egan dismisses Mr. Luna’s criticisms and confirms his
2074

conclusions, both with respect to the Caterpillar and Warstila engines.
Burlington argues that, because the Consortium performed the required maintenance,
Ecuador’s claim for the increase of maintenance costs and decrease in the engines’
useful life should be dismissed. However, even assuming quod non that it did not carry
out the required maintenance, Burlington, relying on Dr. Egan, contends that “Ecuador
has not provided any scientific or engineering basis for concluding that any hypothetical
delay would create such an increase in subsequent overhaul costs or reduction of the
useful life”.*°”> The claim for the costs of purchasing and installing a new alternator must
also be dismissed, because such costs do not qualify as “overhaul” costs.?”

More generally, Burlington argues that, had it not performed regular overhauls on the
engines, it would not have been able to maintain or increase production levels, because
without the engines there is no power, and without power there is no production. For
this reason, it asserts that between December 2005 and July 2009 it spent almost

USD 3 million in spare parts for the Caterpillar engines alone.””””

c. Discussion

It is undisputed that engines require preventive maintenance such as monitoring and
testing and overhauls, in which engines are taken apart to be examined and repaired if
necessary.2°

After reviewing the evidence, including in particular Mr. Luna’s witness statements,
Dr. Egan’s expert reports, and the Consortium’s maintenance records, the Tribunal
concludes that Ecuador has failed to provide sufficient evidence of the Consortium’s

alleged failure to perform timely overhauls to its generator engines, or to prove that
such failure increased the maintenance costs or reduced the useful life of the engines.

With respect to the Caterpillar engines in Block 7, the record shows that the Consortium
put in place appropriate preventive and corrective maintenance programs. The
Consortium’s Annual Environmental Report for Block 7 for 2002, which was sent to the
Ministry of Energy and Mines, contained a summary of preventive and corrective
maintenance programs for engines and other Block 7 equipment.” There was no
objection or protest from Ecuador to this letter at the time. Similarly, the Consortium’s
maintenance program in place since 2005 explained the parameters to be used for the
maintenance of engines and other equipment, and specified in particular when
Caterpillar engine overhauls must be carried out.%°° Specifically, this program
explained that “[mJaintenance of the Perenco equipment installed in Block 7 has been
based on the recommendations of those equipment manufacturers, and according to
the situation and environmental conditions in which they are operating”, and set out the
periodicity in which the engines should be overhauled."

As to whether the Consortium performed overhauls to its Caterpillar engines in a timely
fashion and the consequences of such alleged untimeliness, the Tribunal has noted the
differing opinions and evidence presented by Mr. Luna and Dr. Egan. Having reviewed
their respective statements and the evidence on which they rely, the Tribunal reaches
the conclusion that Ecuador has not established that the Consortium delayed these
overhauls, and more specifically:

According to Dr. Egan, “Caterpillar recommends that operators perform overhauls
of Model 3406 engines every 6,000 hours and of Model 3412 every
10,000 hours”.? After reviewing the Consortium’s maintenance records,

According to Dr. Egan, the logs generated by the Consortium’s SAP database, as
well as the Consortium’s work orders, demonstrate that the Consortium performed
overhauls in its Block 7 engines in a timely fashion.2%

Mr. Luna alleges that, with respect to 14 engines (specifically, engines Nos. 1, 5,
7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 26), there is no indication of any
overhaul between September 2007 and July 2009.7° Dr. Egan notes however
that Mr. Luna failed to take into account major overhauls and other maintenance
activities performed by the Consortium in this time period.’ As a result,
Dr. Egan provided a revised version of Mr. Luna’s Overhaul List for Caterpillar

engines,?°°”

which he asserts “clearly demonstrates that the Consortium
adequately maintained the 14 Caterpillar engines cited by Mr. Luna”, showing that
the Consortium either carried out a major overhaul of the engines at issue or
performed other maintenance activities in accordance with its ongoing
maintenance program.”°® The Tribunal accepts this revised list of maintenance
activities. It also agrees with Dr. Egan that whether the Consortium carried out a
proper maintenance of its engines is not limited to whether it performed “major”
overhauls, and that consideration should also be given to other maintenance
activities.?°°°

Mr. Luna also states that the Consortium did not comply with the manufacturer's
specifications with respect to 13 other engines by not performing overhauls within
the appropriate time.”°°° Mr. Luna accepts that the Consortium carried out

overhauls to these engines within a period of approximately one year prior to the
takeover of the Blocks (and thus no further overhauls were due before the
takeover), but argues that the failure to perform overhauls before that period
resulted in damage that increased the maintenance costs of these engines.
Dr. Egan rejects this theory and the Tribunal agrees. As Dr. Egan explains,
“[o]Jnce an engine has been overhauled and the worn parts replaced or
refurbished, there is no lasting damage to the engine that would result in
increased maintenance costs for subsequent overhauls. If, in fact, there had been
any increased overhaul cost from some earlier neglected or deferred maintenance
in 2006 or 2007 for instance, it would have been borne by the Consortium when it
conducted the most recent overhauls in 2008 or 2009. Only at that time would it
be necessary to replace or repair more parts than normal”.?°°'

As for the engines on Block 21, the Maintenance Services Agreement between the
Consortium and Wartsila, entered into on 30 May 2008, set out the guidelines for

routine and scheduled maintenance.”

As Dr. Egan explains, Wartsila recommends that overhauls start at 8,000 hours and
major overhauls be performed every 12,000 hours thereafter.*°* Mr. Luna agrees,”
but asserts that the Consortium failed to abide with these parameters for Wartsila
engines No. 2, 3 and 4, which Dr. Egan denies. After reviewing the evidence in the

record, the Tribunal agrees with Dr. Egan, for the following reasons:

i. With respect to Wartsila engine No. 2, Mr. Luna accepts that it was (correctly)
overhauled at 24,000 hours, but asserts that in April 2010 Petroamazonas was
forced to overhaul this engine at 32,000 hours (instead of at 36,000, which was
the next scheduled overhaul). Mr. Luna alleges that this overhaul had to be
brought forward due to leaks in the engine, but he does not explain how these

leaks could have been attributed to an earlier lack of maintenance by the

Consortium.

ii. | With respect to Wé€rtsil4 engine No. 3, Mr. Luna acknowledges that the
Consortium conducted a 12,000 hour overhaul in October 2006. Mr. Luna argues
that no other overhaul was performed since then, but as explained by Dr. Egan
the next overhaul was not due until July 2009. Given Ecuador's physical takeover
on 16 July 2009, the Consortium cannot be held responsible for failing to carry out
this overhaul. In any event, the record shows that the Consortium carried out
additional maintenance at 16,000 hours.2°%

iii. | The Tribunal reaches a similar conclusion with respect to Wartsila engine No. 4.
As Mr. Luna recognizes, this engine was only put into service in 2007. The record
shows that the Consortium carried out various preventive maintenances, including
a 4,000 hour overhaul in January 2008, but the first major overhaul (at 12,000
hours) was not due until January 2010, after Petroamazonas’ takeover.7°°”

On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that the Consortium adequately complied with its

maintenance obligations and that the costs incurred by Petroamazonas in the

maintenance of the engines were due to regular maintenance or caused by normal
wear and tear.

The Tribunal also finds that Ecuador has not proven that any reduction in the useful life
of the engines can be attributed to a failure by the Consortium to carry out proper
maintenance. Indeed, even if the Tribunal had found evidence of untimely overhauls, it
finds that Ecuador has failed to establish that such delays would have caused the
increased costs which it claims. The Tribunal accepts Dr. Egan’s explanation that

“[allthough a delay in overhauls may affect the performance of the engine (primarily
power output and emissions levels), this will not necessarily increase the maintenance
costs or reduce the useful life of the engine. At most, a delay in overhaul will affect the
top part of the engine (i.e., valves, combustion chambers and injectors). However,
these parts need to be replaced during overhauls regardless of the delay. In other
words, there is no penalty for delaying overhauls’."°° The record does not support a
different conclusion.

Consequently, this aspect of the engine claim is denied.

2.5.2 Use of crude-diesel fuel blend
a. Ecuador’s position

Ecuador contends that the Consortium failed to use the engines pursuant to the
manufacturer's specifications. Instead of using diesel fuel as required, the Consortium
altered the engines on Block 7 in order to use a cheaper diesel/crude mix containing

crude produced in the Block (first a 50/50 blend, settling on a blend of 40% crude and

60% diesel after testing).?°°°

Ecuador submits that the effect of these modifications was disastrous. Only a few
weeks after making these modifications one of the engines broke down and eventually
all of the engines were damaged.’ As explained by Mr. Montenegro in his
memorandum of 9 January 2011:

“The effect of this new fuel in the engines was immediately felt and was a
disaster; exhaust gases changed color, the temperature of exhaust
multiples increased and the fuel filters were saturated very soon. [...]
Few weeks later the first block of a Cat 3406 Engine for the Power Oil
Units in the Coca Station broke; when the engine was taken apart we
saw a great accumulation of crude in the internal walls, piston rods
blocked, detached rod’s bearings and bed caused by the lack of internal
lubrication, [and] severe damage to the turbos and injection pumps. This
happened again in various engines since it was not possible to predict
when failure would occur [...] After this event, all of the engines without

exception were affected [...] This fuel system was in place until March/09
[...] but the engines were left damaged”.?"""

b. — Burlington’s position

Burlington accepts that it used a crude-diesel fuel blend in Block 7, but contends that
this choice was a reasonable one and had government approval, and in any event was
carried out during a limited time, thus having no lasting impact on the engines.

Due to the sharp increase in diesel prices at the end of 2007, the Consortium began
studying the possibility of using a crude-diesel fuel mix in the Caterpillar engines in
Block 7. It tested the blend for six months. According to Burlington, this trial period
showed that it was an appropriate fuel for the engines.

Burlington also argues that the use of such a blend was consistent with international
industry practice, and that Perenco had used the blend before in other countries such
as Turkey. Dr. Egan notes in particular that Caterpillar provides guidelines for using
blended fuel in its engines, and that the Consortium complied with these guidelines:
Caterpillar recommends that the blended fuel used in its engines have a maximum
crude-to-diesel ratio of 45%, and the Consortium used a 40% crude-to-diesel blend
ratio."

Burlington also emphasizes that not only was the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum
aware of this practice and of the Consortium’s intent to use the blend in the Blocks, it
also gave its approval to build the required fuel mixing plant, and Ministry
representatives were present during the short period of time when the blend was used.
Burlington further submits that, in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines, the
Consortium conducted more frequent maintenance on the engines using the blend, thus
avoiding any damage. It adds that, given that the blend was used only from August
2008 to February 2009, this practice could not have had, and in fact did not have, any
lasting impact on the engines.?"°

c. Discussion

The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that Burlington's use of a crude-diesel fuel blend in
the engines in Block 7 may have impacted the engines’ life and potentially led to higher
maintenance costs for Ecuador after it took control of the Blocks. This is supported by
Caterpillar’s 2001 fuel recommendations, in which the engine manufacturer warns that,
while permissible, the use of “blended fuels” can increase maintenance costs and
reduce engine life:

“Diesel engines have the ability to burn a wide variety of fuels. These
fuels are divided into two general groups. [...] The preferred fuels provide
maximum engine service life and performance. The preferred fuels are
distillate fuels. These fuels are commonly called diesel fuel, [...]. The

permissible fuels are crude oil or blended fuels. Use of these fuels can
result in higher maintenance costs and in reduced engine service life”.'°*

It is true that Burlington alleges that the Consortium adopted an increased maintenance
routine as recommended by the manufacturer.?"°° Yet, the Tribunal notes that the
Consortium decided to stop using the blend after seven months because of “serious
problems with the engines” and “an average of three engines a month that failed
completely”, as explained by Mr. Solis at the Hearing:

“We stopped using [the crude-diesel blend] because we had serious
problems with the engines, all of the engines, at Block 7 when we used
this mixture. This mixture may be used, but with engines that are
manufactured to that end rather than the engines that we had back then
at Block 7. Those engines were manufactured to operate only with diesel
oil -- with diesel rather than a combination of crude oil and diesel.
Perenco tried out that mix so as to reduce production costs. We had

several failures with the engines, and | remember that we had an
average of three engines a month that failed completely’.?"°

As regards Burlington's contention that the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum knew of
this practice, the Tribunal notes that the record indeed shows that the Ministry was
aware that the Consortium was building a mixing plant at the Gacela CPF in August
2008 in order to use this blend in the Block 7 engines. For example, there is
correspondence between the Consortium and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum
between November 2007 to June 2008 referring to the trial period and the financial

motivation behind the Consortium’s choice. The Ministry's letters show no opposition to
the use of the blend.?!°’ To the contrary, in February 2008, the National Hydrocarbons
Directorate even authorized Perenco “to use the crude oil coming from the percentage
of its share set in the Participation Contract for Hydrocarbons Exploration and
Production, combined with diesel as fuel for power generation in Block 7 and Coca
Payamino Unified fields”.?"

That being said, although Ecuador was aware of and did not object to the Consortium’s
use of the blend, it remains that the responsibility for the good condition of the
equipment lay with the Consortium. The record shows that the use of the blend,
although permissible according to the manufacturer, could lead to higher maintenance
costs and affect the engines’ life. It also establishes that the Consortium itself
discontinued its use of the fuel blend because it experienced problems with the
operation of the engines.

For these reasons, the Tribunal considers it sufficiently established that the use of the
blend affected the condition of the engines.

Ecuador claims a total of USD 1,795,276.80 in connection with the engines in
Block 7,7" out of which USD 1,123,800 account for a reduction in the engines’ useful
life due to lack of regular maintenance and to the use of the crude-diesel blend.?'"°
Burlington does not dispute Ecuador's quantification as such, but argues that the claim
has no technical support. As noted in paragraph 1026 above, the Tribunal has already
rejected Ecuador's argument that Burlington’s alleged lack of regular maintenance
reduced the useful life of the engines, and Ecuador does not explain what portion of the
reduction in useful life can be attributed to the use of the blend. In the exercise of its
discretionary powers in matters of assessing the evidence and quantifying damages,
the Tribunal deems it appropriate to grant Ecuador half of the amount claimed for the

reduction of useful life of the Block 7 engines. The Tribunal thus grants this claim in an
amount of USD 561,900.00.

2.6 Claims related to pumps / electrical systems / IT equipment / road
maintenance

Ecuador alleges that, when Petroamazonas took over the operations in July 2009, it
discovered that the Blocks’ pumps, electrical systems, IT equipment, spare parts, and
roads were in sub-standard condition. It thus argues that the Consortium failed to
replace obsolete equipment and systems, install appropriate backup systems, hold a
sufficient stock of spare parts, and maintain roads, and claims for the costs that
Petroamazonas has had (or will have) to incur to upgrade these items." Burlington
opposes all of these claims. Due to their specific character, the Tribunal will address
each claim separately.

2.6.1 Pumps
a. Ecuador’s position

Ecuador claims that the Consortium (i) operated with too few pumps and that those that
it employed were obsolete, (ii) did no preventive or predictive maintenance, (iii) had
either no or insufficient backup systems, and (iv) lacked the necessary stock of spare
parts. Petroamazonas must thus purchase new pumps to replace the ones currently in
place. However, since this is a costly and protracted process, at the time of its Post-
Hearing Brief, it had not yet done so. At that time, it had performed overhauls in pumps
2 and 4 of Coca CPF, which it claims have cost USD 33,662.45.2"!?

b. — Burlington’s position

Burlington stresses that Ecuador's damage claim focused initially on only 5 out of the
160 pumps on the two Blocks. Once it admitted that it had not yet replaced any pumps
with new purchases, it reduced its claim to seek merely the costs of the overhaul of two
pumps.?""8

In response to Ecuador’s four arguments summarized in paragraph 1041 above,
Burlington asserts that (i) the pumps were not obsolete in July 2009, pointing to the fact
that Ecuador continued to use them well into its own operation period, (ii) it did have a
comprehensive preventive and predictive maintenance program in place that complied
with manufacturer guidelines, and conducted daily visual inspections, (iii) Ecuador's
backup claim is “yet another claim for equipment needed to handle Ecuador's
increasing production activity, not to remedy the Consortium’s lack of proper

maintenance”, and (iv) the Consortium kept an adequate inventory of spare parts.?""*

c. Discussion

At the time of the Hearing, Ecuador was still operating the pumps it claims are obsolete,
but for two pumps in Coca CPF. On these latter two pumps, Ecuador in fact performed
overhauls, the cost of which is quantified by Mr. Luna at USD 32,662.45 and claimed
here.?""® The fact that 158 of the 160 pumps that were present in the Blocks when
Petroamazonas took control of the operations in July 2009 have not been overhauled or
replaced after the takeover leads the Tribunal to infer that these pumps were not in the
dire condition that Ecuador alleges.

As for the two overhauled pumps in Coca CPF, while it is true that Ecuador has
submitted an inspection report showing that the pumps suffered from a number of
problems, this report is dated September 2012, over three years after Petroamazonas
took over the Blocks.?""® It is consequently of little value to assess the state of the

pumps in July 2009. Burlington, by contrast, has submitted environmental audits that
were sent to the Ministry of Energy and Mines from 2003 to 2006, showing the pump
maintenance program in place during its operation of the Blocks, which included
overhauls every 300 hours.?''” Moreover, the Claimant presented a summary of the
maintenance accounts of Block 7, where Coca CPF is located, from 2003 to 2009,
which shows that USD 2,500,139.25 were spent on “Pump Maintenance”.?""® Finally,
the Tribunal notes in addition that the SGS Reports contain no references to pumps in
bad condition at the Coca field.

This claim is consequently dismissed.

2.6.2 Electrical systems
a. Ecuador’s position

As regards the electrical systems, Ecuador submits that the Consortium did not comply
with the relevant standards applicable in the petroleum industry, such as those
contained in the National Electrical Code. Specifically, Ecuador argues that the
Consortium (i) used technologically obsolete equipment, such as variators and
switchgear boards that caused problems in the operation of the Blocks, and (ii) had
inadequate electrical fittings. Ecuador quantifies its damages for this claim at
USD 2,120,254, the cost of the new variators.?"'

b. — Burlington’s position

According to Burlington, Ecuador's replacement of 23 variators and other improvements
to the electrical facilities were not directed to repair substandard infrastructure, but to
support Ecuador's expansion plan. Burlington argues that “the variators could not have
been obsolete, as even spare parts were still available from the supplier at the time of
the expropriation and continue as of June 2013 to be available”.*!”° By contrast,

Letter of 31 January 2003 from Luis Cobos (Perenco) to Vincente Juepa (Ministry of Energy and
Mines) (Exh. CE-CC-213), specific references to the Coca CPF pumps can be found at pp. 29-
30, 67 and 112.

Burlington points to two documents (Luna Annex 13 and Exhibit CE-CC-280) which
suggest that Ecuador incurred these costs to improve its profitability.

c. Discussion

While Ecuador criticizes the Consortium’s upkeep of electrical equipment and fittings in
general, its claim is limited to the purchase of 23 variators for Block 7 for a price of
USD 2,120,254.7!*" However, the memorandum submitted as Luna Annex 13 does not
show that the purchase was necessary as a consequence of the bad state of the
existing equipment. To the contrary, it states that “technical and financial advantages”
underlie a decision to migrate to a different model of variator:

“There are technical and financial advantages that justify the migration

from the ICS model to the GCS model. /t is for this reason that the

replacement of 23 of the 26 frequency variators of block 7 has been

planned [...]”.2'7
In addition, Exhibit CE-CC-280, entitled “Repowering the Electrical System in Station
Coca B-7” refers to the “repotentiation” (in the original Spanish: repotenciacidn) of the
electrical system in Block 7 through a project (in fact, the second phase of a project)
whose scope is defined as “Development of Basic and Detailed Engineering for the
Improvement of Electrical Facilities and Control of the Coca Station”. The very first
sentence of that document explains that the repowering was necessary “[d]ue to
increased production”.

As a result, the Tribunal dismisses the claim for lack of proof that the expenses related
to the purchase of the new variators were caused by the Claimant's improper
maintenance, or by a bad condition beyond normal wear of the electrical systems of the
Blocks in July 2009.

This is the amount claimed by Ecuador. The Tribunal notes however that neither of the
documents cited by Ecuador in support of this claim exactly matches this figure. Luna Annex 13
refers to a cost of USD 2,120,262, while Exh. E-308 contains an invoice for the purchase of
23 generators for a total of USD 2,374,684.48.

2.6.3. IT equipment and software
a. Ecuador’s position

Ecuador alleges that the Consortium did not have a proper maintenance software in
accordance with industry standards. As a result, after the takeover, Petroamazonas
incurred costs in order to upgrade the technology used in its offices and implement
“Maximo”, a new Computered Maintenance Management System (CMMS).?"5 Mr. Luna
highlights that Petroamazonas had to implement the system from scratch, because the
Consortium did not transfer the information from its SAP system or other maintenance
archives when Petroamazonas took over the Blocks.?"**

Ecuador now seeks to recover these costs, which Mr. Luna quantifies at
USD 151,601.96, including the purchase of computers, cameras, and the cost of hiring
specialized personnel to implement the system.?"° Excluding the purchase of
computers, Ecuador quantifies this claim at USD 81,384.96.7"

Ecuador also separately claims for the additional costs of purchasing (additional) new
software and computers.*"?’ Ecuador includes this in a global claim for other
equipment,?"”° but has clarified that its total claim for new software and computers
(including Maximo) amounts to USD 470,565.01.2' The Tribunal thus understands that
its claim for additional computers and software (other than Maximo) amounts to
USD 389,180.05 (USD 470,565.01- USD 81,384.96).

b. — Burlington’s position

For Burlington, the claim related to the Maximo software is another illustration of
Ecuador seeking payment for upgrades. Burlington contends that the Consortium
owned the software management program known as SAP, which complied with industry
standards and was programmed with the information on the Block’s infrastructure.

Burlington thus argues that, even if Ecuador had chosen to switch from SAP to Maximo,
it could have done so at a minimal cost by transferring the data contained in the SAP
database to the Maximo database.°"°° However, Ecuador chose not to participate in
technical meetings with the Consortium to facilitate the transfer of data. As a result, it is

solely responsible for any associated costs.?"*"

Burlington further argues that an upgrade in technology does not require new or special

computers.?!°?

c. Discussion

With respect to Ecuador’s claim for the implementation of the Maximo CMMS, the
Tribunal notes that the Consortium had another management software in place (the
SAP system), which Dr. Egan characterizes as a “comprehensive” and “internationally
recognized management system” complying with industry standards.*'** Dr. Egan
explains that:

“The Consortium’s SAP program was populated with maintenance
information relevant to the Block 7 and Block 21 infrastructure. Based
upon the maintenance information entered, the SAP program alerted the
Consortium when additional maintenance was needed, according to pre-
determined time intervals. Once the maintenance was completed, the

SAP program generated a work order to document that the required
maintenance was complete”.?"*

Mr. Luna does not dispute these statements, but rather argues that, because the
Consortium did not leave its SAP database when it left the Blocks, Petroamazonas had
to program the Maximo system from scratch.?"*° However, as Burlington has pointed
out, after the takeover, the Consortium wrote to Petroamazonas to, inter alia, “propose
a technical meeting to assure an orderly post-takeover transition [...]’, but
Petroamazonas did not reply.?"%° While it is true that the Consortium’s letter referred

specifically to the transition of employees and contractors, this letter shows the
Consortium’s willingness to collaborate towards an adequate transition. As a result, the
Tribunal finds that Ecuador must bear its costs of implementing a new CMMS.

As to Ecuador’s claim for new computers, other than Mr. Luna’s assertions that the

Consortium did not have sufficient computers to implement the Maximo system?'*” and

Ecuador's allegation that Petroamazonas thus had to purchase new computers,”'*
Ecuador has not advanced any evidence that the IT equipment and computer software
were in need of replacement. Indeed, Ecuador itself characterizes these expenses as
an upgrade, rather than a repair.?"° In addition, both SGS Reports consider most of the
computers and software examined to be in “good” or “very good condition”.?"*°

As a result, the Tribunal dismisses this claim for lack of sufficient evidence that these

expenses were caused by Burlington’s negligence.

2.6.4 Road maintenance and vehicles
a. Ecuador’s position

Ecuador seeks to recover the amounts which it has spent in the purchase of new
vehicles (USD 98,187.16) and road maintenance (USD 381,127.64).?""

According to Ecuador, contemporaneous evidence shows that the Consortium’s
vehicles had exceeded their useful life. Ecuador alleges in particular that in March
2008, 72% of the vehicles were more than 10 years old and 51% had run over 250,000
kilometers. For this reason, Ecuador argues that it is entitled to be reimbursed for the
costs of the replacement vehicles it acquired.?"“*

Ecuador also contends that the Consortium did not invest sufficiently in road
maintenance, as proved by the discrepancy between Petroamazonas’ and the

Consortium’s spending. According to Ecuador, in 2010 Petroamazonas spent
USD 4,264,318.05 on road maintenance, while the Consortium only spent
USD 435,051 in 2008.2" Ecuador emphasizes that it only seeks road maintenance
costs which it incurred on account of the Consortium’s lack of past maintenance during

its operatorship of Blocks 7 and 21.2"

b. — Burlington’s position

Burlington opposes the claims concerning road maintenance and new vehicles on the
ground that Petroamazonas attempts to charge the Consortium for regular maintenance
and for improvements necessary for its expanded operations and growing workforce on
the Blocks.?"“

Relying on Dr. Egan, Burlington argues that its obligation was limited to maintaining the
roads that provided access to the pads and that Ecuador has not shown evidence of a
lack of maintenance in any of these roads.”"“ In addition, Dr. Egan notes that the total
amount invested in road maintenance on the Blocks from 2006 to 2009 was an average
of USD 649,595 per year. While Dr. Egan recognizes that “it is difficult to interpret the
trends (the need for road maintenance may be affected by weather causing wash outs
for example)”, he concludes that “it is clear that the Consortium invested substantially in
road maintenance through its operating period”.?"*” Burlington also notes that the
annual expenses allegedly incurred by Petroamazonas cover its total spending on the 6
blocks which it operates. Adjusted for two blocks the figure is comparable to that of the
Consortium.?"“*

Burlington also denies that the vehicles left by the Consortium had exceeded their
useful life and argues that it was therefore unnecessary to buy new vehicles. According

to Burlington, Ecuador’s purchase of four new vehicles corresponds to an upgrade in

view of Petroamazonas’ growing workforce.*"*°

2.6.5 Discussion

With respect to Ecuador's claim for new vehicles, the Tribunal notes that, according to
“the National Transit Commission of Ecuador, the useful life of a double cabin truck is
15 years, and the larger vehicles such as tractors and trucks have a useful life of 32
years”.*®° The Tribunal also notes that Ecuador has put forward no documentary
evidence supporting the need to repair or replace specific vehicles. That being said, the
SGS reports identify at least two vehicles (both of them Toyota Landcruisers) that are
either in “very bad” or “good” but damaged condition.*'"' Since Ecuador is claiming the
cost of purchasing four similar vehicles for a total of USD 98,187.16*"* and Burlington
has not challenged this amount as such, the Tribunal grants Ecuador half of this claim,
i.e. USD 49,093.58.

In respect of roads, Ecuador claims that the amounts spent on road maintenance were
due to a lack of past maintenance by Burlington without pointing to any supporting
evidence. No mention of the allegedly bad state of the roads is found in either SGS
Report, and while the 2008 Environmental Audit refers to a lack of signposting, this can
hardly be considered sufficient to support Ecuador's claims.*'* Therefore, the claim
regarding road maintenance expenditures is dismissed for lack of proof that these
expenses were caused by Burlington's negligence.

2.7 Other claims

Ecuador also seeks compensation for other repairs and the upgrade of facilities and
purchase of back up equipment, spare parts and materials to bring the Blocks’
operations in line with industry standards. These works include the reconditioning of
wells, the refurbishment of camps and a new communications tower in Gacela CPF.

1074.

Burlington contends that these claims should be dismissed, because it maintained and
returned the Blocks’ infrastructure in good condition and in accordance with industry
standards. For the Claimant, Ecuador's refurbishment works and any increase in the
maintenance budget are attributable to its expansion of the Blocks and the resulting rise
in production levels, and are unrelated to Burlington’s operation of the Blocks.

The Tribunal finds that these claims have not been sufficiently particularized or proven
— in certain cases they were not even pleaded — by the Respondent. As an example,
Ecuador claims USD 122,540.77 to build a new communications tower in Gacela CPF.
However, there is no reference to this item in the Respondent's submissions. The only
mentions of this tower which the Tribunal has been able to identify are in Exhibit E-301
and slide 137 of Ecuador’s Opening Statement on Counterclaims. Yet, these provide no
explanation for the claim nor any indication that the construction of the tower was
necessary due to the Consortium’s conduct. This is but one example to illustrate that
these claims are insufficiently established.

Moreover, as noted above, the Tribunal has found that the infrastructure on the Blocks
was generally in proper condition, and that the Respondent's expansion plans and
increases in production were bound to require (and in certain cases have in fact been
shown to be the cause of) improvements to the existing equipment and facilities.

For all these grounds, these further claims are thus dismissed.

3. Conclusion

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides to grant a total of
USD 2,577,119.77 in respect of Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims, itemized as
follows:

i. USD 503,572.76 for the Gacela T-104 and Payamino T-102 tanks, as well as
minor repairs to pipelines;

ii. USD 1,462,553.43 for repairs related to pipelines and fluid lines;
iii. | USD 561,900.00 for Block 7 engines; and

iv. USD 49,093.58 for new vehicles.

D. Conclusion On Counterclaims

In conclusion, the Tribunal decides to grant a total of USD 41,776,492.77 in respect of
Ecuador’s counterclaims, comprising:

i. USD 39,199,373 for the environmental counterclaims (see paragraph 889
above); and

ii. USD 2,577,119.77 for the infrastructure counterclaims (see paragraph 1074
above).

In this context, the Tribunal notes Burlington’s request for relief raised in its Post-
Hearing Brief seeking a declaration that “beyond the exceedances assessed by the
Tribunal, Burlington has no further liability for environmental harm in Blocks 7 and
21”'* The declaration sought is in line with the agreement of 26 May 2011 by which
the Parties submitted the counterclaims to this Tribunal.

Whereas Clause 9 of such agreement records that this arbitration is “the appropriate
forum for the final resolution of the Counterclaims arising out of investments made by
Burlington Resources and its affiliates in Blocks 7 and 21, so as to ensure maximum
judicial economy and consistency”, Clause 1(b) extends the binding force and res

judicata effects of the present decision as follows:

“The decision of the Arbitral Tribunal constituted in the Arbitration on the
Counterclaims shall be final and binding on the Parties and have full res
judicata effect with respect to: (i) Burlington Resources and Ecuador
(including its emanations, agencies, instrumentalities, subdivisions and
controlled corporations including, without limitation, Petroecuador); and
(ii) all affiliates of Burlington Resources, Burlington Oriente and
Burlington Resources International, including ConocoPhillips and all of its
subsidiaries and affiliates (together, the ConocoPhillips Group) as if
such claims had been brought and resolved against them’”.?®

C-PHB, {[ 277(c). Burlington’s earlier memorials do not contain a request of the same content. Its
Rejoinder seeks an indemnification from third party claims, a request not later repeated and
distinct from the one discussed here. See: Rejoinder, § 426(b).

International and Ecuador, 26 May 2011 (Exh. E-251) (emphasis in the original).

462

1078.

1079.

1080.

1081.

Clause 1(c) then provides for a waiver by Ecuador of further actions in the following
terms:

“Ecuador (including its emanations, agencies, instrumentalities,
subdivisions and controlled corporations including, without limitation,
Petroecuador) formally waives its right to bring the Counterclaims,
including, but not limited to any claims based on alleged environmental
liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21 (including under the Block 7 PSC
and Block 21 PSC) against Burlington Resources, Burlington Oriente and
any other corporation in the ConocoPhillips Group, before any jurisdiction
whatsoever whether arbitral or judicial, national or international except for
this Arbitration”.?'%
In view of this waiver, the Tribunal considers that a ruling is not necessary. It takes
formal notice, however, of the content of the agreement of 26 May 2011, especially of

the waiver which it contains, as recorded above.

As a final matter, the Tribunal must address the issue of double recovery. As mentioned
in paragraph 70 above, Burlington has called the Tribunal’s attention to the potential
risk of double recovery in respect of the Respondent's counterclaims since Ecuador
“made a full claim for the alleged environmental harm in each of the Burlington and
Perenco cases”.*'*” Burlington requests that the Tribunal address the “potentially
pernicious consequences” deriving from that risk so that “if the dispositive part of either
of the awards on counterclaims provides for any compensation, Ecuador would be
prevented from enforcing the second award to the extent that it has already been
compensated by the first”.?"5*

The Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties on the issue of double
recovery. More specifically, first, there is no question that Ecuador claims compensation
for the same damages in these and in the parallel Perenco proceedings. For Burlington,
Ecuador is “twice seeking 100% recovery of precisely the same alleged damages, for
precisely the same alleged injury, on precisely the same legal and factual bases”.?'°
Ecuador, for its part, does not deny that it seeks compensation for the same harm in
both cases, although it distinguishes the two arbitrations in various ways, stating for

instance that the arguments or the evidence in both cases are not “exactly the
same”.”"® Ecuador actually relies on the joint and several liability of the Consortium

partners to justify its claim against Burlington, although only Perenco operated the

Blocks.?"°"

Second, it is also common ground that claiming compensation for the same damage in
parallel proceedings creates a risk of double recovery.*"© In this context, Ecuador
submits that whichever tribunal issues the later award on Ecuador’s counterclaims can

readily address this risk and thus Burlington’s fear of “pernicious consequences” is

misplaced:?'®

“Ecuador [...] adds that its counterclaims will not result in ‘pernicious
consequences.’ If Claimant alludes to the issue of double recovery, the
prohibition thereof exclusively applies when a party has already been
indemnified by a third party. In addition, Claimant cannot pretend to
ignore that any second award in the present cases against the
Consortium members ‘could be fashioned in such a way as to prevent
double recovery.’ International law, Ecuadorian law and _ international
decisions offer numerous mechanisms for preventing double recovery,
including by taking into account the monetary relief granted by any prior
award”.?'64

Third, there is common ground between the Parties that a creditor can only be
compensated once for a given harm, and rightly so, as a number of arbitral tribunals

have acknowledged that the “prohibition of double recovery for the same loss is a well-

established principle”.?"®

See, for instance: Tr. (Day 7) (ENG), 2357:13-20 (Tribunal, Silva Romero).

For instance, Ecuador stated that: “Pursuant to Ecuadorian law, all the authors of a tort (such as
environmental harm) are jointly liable to its victim. Accordingly, Ecuador is entitled to claim for
the total amount of damages from Burlington or Perenco or any other author of the
environmental harm caused, including CEPE and Petroproduccion, which are entities different
from the Ecuadorian state”. Reply, {| 8. See also: R-PHB, § 603.

Fourth, the Tribunal takes note that, prior to the end of the Hearing on counterclaims,
counsel for Ecuador clearly stated that Ecuador does not seek double recovery in its
claims against the Consortium members:

“The second comment | am specifically instructed to make today is that

we don’t want the Burlington Tribunal to have any concern regarding
double recovery. This is not what Ecuador is looking for”.?"°

The Tribunal takes due notice of Ecuador’s representations, which are in line with the
general principle prohibiting double recovery.

As of the date of the present Decision, the Perenco tribunal has issued no decision yet
on the counterclaims before it. Therefore, this Tribunal lacks the necessary information
or basis to adopt any specific measures — to fashion its decision, to borrow Ecuador's
phrase — to prevent double recovery, a task that it must leave to the Perenco tribunal as
the one deciding in second place. This being said, this Tribunal nonetheless states that,
as a matter of principle, the present Decision cannot serve and may not be used to
compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage.

INTEREST
A. Parties’ Positions

In its Post-Hearing Brief quoted in paragraph 0 above, Ecuador claims interest on all
sums awarded at an “adequate commercial interest rate” from the date of the Award. In
addition, on sums awarded based on the infrastructure counterclaims, it also requests
pre-award interest, to run from the “date of disbursement” of the amounts for which
damages are awarded. While in earlier submissions on the counterclaims, the
Respondent sought compound interest,?"*” the requests for relief in the Post-Hearing
Brief contain no indication whether simple or compound interest is sought. Nor does
Ecuador provide any arguments on the entitlement and computation of interest in
connection with the counterclaims, unlike in the context of Burlington’s claims. That

said, in its submissions on Burlington’s claims Ecuador has clarified that it seeks simple
2168

interest for both claims and counterclaims.
Burlington opposes Ecuador’s claims on the merits, but does not take issue with the
request for interest as such. For itself, it claims interest on costs and expenses involved
in the context of the counterclaims at a rate of 4 percent p.a. compounded annually or
any other rate and compounding period that the Tribunal may consider “just and
appropriate”.?"?

The Tribunal further notes that, in its costs submission, Ecuador claimed simple interest
at an adequate commercial rate, which it equated to a “reasonable commercial rate”
and specified as LIBOR plus two percent.”'” Burlington claimed interest on costs upon
the same terms as those set out in the preceding paragraph.

B. Discussion

It is common ground between the Parties that amounts due and paid late must earn
interest. It is equally undisputed that interest must accrue at a reasonable commercial
rate. For reasons further explained in the Award and because this solution is in line with
both Parties’ requests, the Tribunal sets such rate at LIBOR for three month borrowings
plus two percent.?"”"

There is no controversy either that interest on sums awarded for Ecuador's
counterclaims must run from the date of this Decision. As an exception, in connection
with the infrastructure claims, Ecuador claims interest from the “date of disbursement”
of the amounts expended to remediate the poor condition of the infrastructure.
Burlington does not appear to have expressed a view on this claim for pre-award
interest. This said, Ecuador has not indicated the relevant “dates of disbursement” that
the Tribunal is asked to take into consideration. As a result, the Tribunal cannot but
consider that these dates are insufficiently established and, therefore, sets the dies a
quo of the interest on the date of this Decision.

There remains the question whether interest should be simple or compound. While
Ecuador has argued for simple interest in the context of Burlington’s claims, in its
submissions on counterclaims it has first sought compound interest and then remained
silent (save in relation to costs, which will be addressed in the Award).

In its submissions in respect of Burlington’s claims, Ecuador has argued that

2172
t,

Ecuadorian law prohibits compound interes and has clarified that, in accordance

with Ecuadorian law, it is limiting its claim for interest on the amounts sought under its

counterclaims to simple interest." The Tribunal has rejected this argument in respect

of interest accruing on the claims because these are subject to international law.?'”*

Ecuador's counterclaims, however, are governed by Ecuadorian law. Burlington objects

to the application of Ecuadorian law to interest awarded on its claims, but is silent with

respect to the law governing interest on the counterclaims.*'”°

The Tribunal notes that, as a general rule, Ecuadorian law prohibits compounding.

Pursuant to Article 2113 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, “[i]t is forbidden to stipulate
interest on interest’.’"° That being said, the Ecuadorian Commercial Code

exceptionally appears to allow compounding in certain cases, as follows:

“In commercial loans or other kinds of commercial debt, no returns are
owed over accrued returns, but from, once they are settled, the
moment in which they are included in a new contract as an increase in
the principal, or from the moment when, pursuant to a mutual
agreement, or by a judicial declaration, outstanding accounts are
settled; settlement that must include the returns accrued up to that
moment, and which cannot take place but when the obligations the
returns derive from are due and payable in cash”.?"””

Motion for Reconsideration and Counter-Memorial on Quantum, § 562, citing: Article 308 of the
Constitution, Articles 1575 and 2113 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, and Article 561 of the
Ecuadorian Commercial code.

Motion for Reconsideration and Counter-Memorial on Quantum, § 563.
See: Section VII.D (5.3.3) of the Award.

Burlington declines to comment on whether Ecuadorian law prohibits compounding, arguing that
“[elven if true (which must at least be questionable given Ecuador's prior pleadings), the
treatment of interest under domestic Ecuadorian law is irrelevant” in the context of Burlington’s
international law claims. See Reply on Quantum, § 244.

Article 2113 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code (Translation by Ecuador) (Exh. EL-182).
Article 561 of the Ecuadorian Commercial Code (Translation by Ecuador) (Exh. EL-296).

In the Tribunal’s view, it is not sufficiently clear whether the interest to be awarded in
this Decision falls under the exception provided in Article 561 of the Ecuadorian
Commercial Code. The Tribunal thus defers to Ecuador's interpretation of its own law,
according to which compound interest is prohibited, and to its request for relief, which
seeks simple interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal will award simple interest on Ecuador’s
counterclaims.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that it will deal with the matter of interest on the Parties’ costs
claims in the context of its review of costs in the Award.

In conclusion, the Tribunal deems it just and appropriate to award simple interest at
LIBOR for three month borrowings plus two percent, from the date of this Decision until
payment in full.
