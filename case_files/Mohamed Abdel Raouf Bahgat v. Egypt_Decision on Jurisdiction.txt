INTRODUCTION

A. THE PARTIES

The claimant in the present arbitration is Mr Mohamed Abdel Raouf Bahgat (“Claimant”), a
businessman who was born in Egypt and later acquired Finnish nationality. Questions

concerning his nationality are at issue in the present phase of the dispute.

Claimant is represented by Mr Stephen Fietta, Mr Jiries Saadeh, Ms Laura Rees-Evans, Ms Zs6fia
‘Young, and Ms Fanny Sarnel of Fietta LLP, London; Professor Andrew Newcombe of the
University of Victoria; and Mr Samuel Wordsworth QC and Mr Peter Webster of Essex Court

Chambers. Previously, Claimant was also represented by Mr Subir Karmakar of Saunders Law Ltd.

The respondent in the present arbitration is the Arab Republic of Egypt, a sovereign state

(“Egypt’ or “Respondent”, and together with Claimant, the “Parties”.

Respondent is represented by H.E. Counselor Hussein Khalil Hamza, President, Counselor
Mahmoud El Khrashy, Counselor Mohamed Khalaf, Counselor Amr Arafa, Counselor Fatma
Khalifa, Counselor Lela Kassem, and Counselor Nada El Kashef of the Egyptian State
Lawsuits Authority; and Mr Louis Christophe Delanoy, Mr Raed Fathallah, Mr Tim Portwood,

and Ms Veronika Korom of Bredin Prat, Paris.

B. THE DISPUTE

The present dispute is an arbitration initiated by Claimant against Respondent under the
Agreements between the Government of the Republic of Finland and the Government of the
Arab Republic of Egypt on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, respectively dated
5 May 1980 (1980 BIT”) and 3 March 2004 (“2004 BIT”, collectively referred to as the
“BITs”), and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade

Law 1976 (“UNCITRAL Rules”).

Claimant is the founder of and principal investor in the Aswan Development and Mining
Company (“ADEMCO”) and the Aswan Steel and Mining Company (“AISCO”, and together
with ADEMCO, the “Companies”). He founded the Companies after he was selected by
Respondent to develop the iron ore resources located near Aswan, Egypt (the “Project”) and to
build a facility to develop the Project. ADEMCO was granted a thirty-year mining concession
and AISCO was created in order to run the steel operations. According to Claimant, he invested

up to USD 40 million of his own funds in the Project.

Case 1:20-cv-02169-TNM Document 1-9 Filed 08/07/20 Page 8 of 105

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Developments in the Project were underway when, on 5 February 2000, the police arrested
Claimant. Claimant’s personal assets as well as the assets of the Companies were frozen
pursuant to an order of the Public Prosecutor that was confirmed by the Cairo Criminal Court
on 20 March 2000 (the “Freezing Order’). The police raided the offices of Claimant and the
Companies, and shut down and took over the Project site. Claimant was incarcerated for over

three years. The freezing order over the Companies’ assets was lifted by a court in October 2006.

Claimant contends that the actions taken by Respondent with respect to the Project are in
violation of the investor protections contained in the BITs; specifically, that Respondent’s
actions amounted to an unlawful expropriation, unfair and inequitable treatment, and a failure

to accord full and constant protection and security.

Respondent argues in the first instance that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the
present claim. According to Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae and

ratione temporis.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION

On 3 November 2011, Claimant initiated arbitration proceedings against Respondent for breach
of the BITs, through a Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Article 9(2)(d) of the 2004 BIT. In
addition, and/or in the alternative, Claimant brings claims against Respondent for violations of

the 1980 BIT, under Article 7(2) of that treaty.!

B. CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

In its Notice of Arbitration, Claimant appointed Professor W. Michael Reisman, a national of
the United States of America, as the first arbitrator. Professor Reisman’s address is Yale Law

School, P.O. Box 208215, New Haven, CT 06520-8215, United States of America.

On 6 February 2012, Respondent appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuiia, a national of
Chile, as the second arbitrator. Professor Orrego Vicufia’s address is Avenida El Golf 40,

C. INITIAL PROCEDURAL STEPS

On 22 June 2012, the Tribunal directed the Parties to establish an initial deposit of
EUR 150,000 pursuant to Article 41 of the UNCITRAL Rules.

On 27 June 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties signed the Terms of Appointment, thereby agreeing

that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) will act as registry in the proceedings.

On 18 July 2012, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was temporarily not able to pay the
deposit since the Egyptian Parliament, whose approval is required to make such payment, was

dissolved at that time.

Claimant made payment of EUR 75,000, representing his share of the initial deposit, on
25 July 2012. Since no payment was received from Respondent, the Tribunal requested
Claimant to make a substitute payment in lieu of Respondent pursuant to Article 41(4) of the

UNCITRAL Rules, which Claimant did on 24 August 2012.

D. PRELIMINARY PROCEDURAL HEARING

On 29 August 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties held a preliminary procedural hearing by

telephone conference.

On 19 September 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. | (“Procedural Order No. 1”),
setting out the procedural timetable with regard to the interim measures phase, a potential
bifurcation phase, as well as the jurisdiction phase. Under paragraph 3.1 of Procedural Order
No. 1, the Parties and the Tribunal may use, as additional guidelines, the IBA Rules on the

Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2010).

E. APPLICATION FOR INTERIM MEASURES

On 19 September 2012, Claimant filed an Application for Interim Measures requesting the
Tribunal to order Respondent (i) to return certain documents that, according to Claimant, had
been seized by Respondent from Claimant’s offices and private residence in Egypt in February
2000 and were necessary for him to prepare his case, and (ii) to pay Claimant an amount equal

to Respondent’s share of the deposit that had been paid by Claimant on 24 August 2012.

On 17 October 2012, Respondent filed its Answer to the Request for Provisional Measures, to
which Claimant filed his Reply on 31 October 2012.

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

On 10 November 2012, Claimant filed his Statement of Claim together with accompanying

materials (“Claimant’s Statement of Claim’).
On 21 November 2012, Respondent filed its Interim Measures Rejoinder.

A hearing on interim measures was held by telephone conference on 1 December 2012

(“Interim Measures Hearing”).

On 7 and 17 December 2012, the Parties made costs submissions related to the applications

heard on 1 December 2012.

On 21 December 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, addressing Claimant’s
Application for Interim Measures (“Procedural Order No. 2”). With regard to Claimant’s
request for the return of certain documents, the Tribunal took note of the fact that Respondent
neither denied that the documents were in its possession nor objected to producing them in the
course of the arbitration, but merely stated that the documents were dispersed among various
State agencies in Egypt and that they were difficult to locate due to the passing of time. The
Tribunal accepted Respondent’s undertaking to locate the documents and directed Respondent
(i) to exercise its best efforts in this undertaking; (ii) to inform Claimant and the Tribunal of the
status of the documents as soon as possible; and (iii) to provide the documents to Claimant by
15 January 2013. In respect of Claimant’s request that Respondent pay him an amount equal to
the share of the deposit, which Claimant had paid in lieu of Respondent, the Tribunal referred
to the political and financial circumstances in Egypt, and directed Respondent to monitor its
financial situation on a continuous basis and to comply with its deposit obligations under the

UNCITRAL Rules as soon as practicably possible.

On 11 January 2013, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had managed to gather the
seized documents referred to in Procedural Order No. 2 and filed copies of them with the PCA

on 15 January 2013.

F. TELEPHONE CALLS TO MR MOHAMED EL ASHRI AND REQUEST FOR BIFURCATION

On 16 January 2013, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal with regard to telephone calls which one
of Claimant’s witnesses, Mr Mohamed El Ashri, had received in December 2012. According to
Claimant, the caller claimed to be Mr Sadiq Azmi from Respondent’s Ministry of Petroleum.
The caller allegedly urged Mr El Ashri to alter the testimony he had previously given in his
affidavit dated 31 October 2011.

Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Claimant expressed his concerns regarding the purported attempt to induce Mr El Ashri to give
false evidence and requested that Respondent disclose the identity of the caller, the identity of
the person directing or guiding the call, and whether any other calls or contacts had been made
to any other of Claimant’s witnesses. Claimant attached a Second Affidavit of Mr El Ashri

dated 15 January 2013, which reported in more detail on the incident.

On 26 January 2013, Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation in accordance with the

procedural timetable in Procedural Order No. | (“Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation’).

On 8 February 2013, Respondent replied to Claimant’s letter of 16 January 2013, stating that
the Ministry of Petroleum and the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority had confirmed that
Mr Sadiq Azmi was not a current or former employee of either department. Respondent
strongly rejected the idea that it was trying to exert pressure on Mr El Ashri and requested the
Tribunal to (i) strike Mr El Ashri’s Second Affidavit from the arbitral record; and (ii) draw

adverse inferences from Claimant’s “blatant attempt at trying to mislead the Tribunal”.

On 15 February 2013, Claimant commented on Respondent’s letter dated 8 February 2013,
rejecting the contention that Mr El Ashri’s Second Affidavit was fabricated in order to mislead

the Tribunal.

On 18 February 2013, the Presiding Arbitrator informed the Parties that Mr El Ashri’s Second
Affidavit would remain on the record and that the weight to be given to it as well as any other
documents submitted with regard to the alleged December 2012 incident would be evaluated in

light of the Parties’ further submissions.

On 26 February 2013, Claimant replied to Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation stating that, in
order to reduce avoidable costs and expenses, Claimant did “not oppose the Respondent’s
application for bifurcation” and proposed to proceed in line with the bifurcated jurisdiction
timetable envisaged in Procedural Order No. 1. On 6 March 2013, Respondent agreed with the
course of action suggested by Claimant. On 8 March 2013, the Presiding Arbitrator confirmed
that the arbitration would proceed in accordance with the procedural timetable established for

the jurisdictional phase in Procedural Order No. 1.

G. SUBMISSIONS ON JURISDICTION

On 25 March 2013, Respondent informed the Tribunal about the political unrest that had
persisted in Egypt since 25 January 2013, which impacted the office of the Egyptian State
Lawsuits Authority (“ESLA”) in such a way that Egypt foresaw that if the situation in Egypt

did not improve significantly, it might be compelled to request an extension of the deadlines.

On 15 July 2013, Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction in accordance with
Procedural Order No. | (“Respondent’s Memorial on Jurisdiction”). Respondent noted that,
because Claimant had agreed to bifurcate the proceedings, he had not yet addressed any of
Respondent’s objections on jurisdiction already raised in Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation.
As a consequence, Respondent referred the Tribunal back “to Sections II and III of its Request
for Bifurcation, which present the relevant facts of the case and Respondent’s objections on

jurisdiction.”

On 30 August 2013, Claimant filed his Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction with accompanying
materials (“Claimant’s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction”). He further informed the
Tribunal that the Finnish Immigration Service (“FIS”) had issued a decision on 23 April 2013
in which it decided that Claimant had lost his Finnish nationality when he obtained Egyptian
nationality on 28 September 1997.? Claimant indicated that he had challenged this decision
before the Helsinki Administrative Court, that the proceedings were currently pending, and that
no date for a hearing on the matter had been fixed so far. Claimant announced that he might
request an amendment to the procedural schedule for the jurisdictional phase depending on the

timing of the court proceedings.

H. SECOND DEPOSIT REQUEST AND SUSPENSION OF PROCEEDINGS

On 13 September 2013, in view of the hearing on jurisdiction, the Tribunal requested that the
Parties deposit an additional EUR 200,000 (i.e. EUR 100,000 from each Party) pursuant to
Article 7(2) of the Terms of Appointment and Article 41(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

On 24 September 2013, Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to postpone
the hearing on jurisdiction scheduled for 18 and 19 November 2013 until further decision by
the Helsinki Administrative Court on Claimant’s challenge referred to in paragraph 37 above.
The Parties jointly requested the Tribunal to amend the relevant parts of Procedural Order No. 1

accordingly.

On 25 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 regarding Suspension of
the Proceedings (“Procedural Order No. 3”), which postponed the hearing on jurisdiction and
ordered Claimant to inform the Tribunal of the final outcome and/or resolution of the

Claimant’s challenge before the Finnish administrative courts, and set out a schedule for

Claimant’ s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 3.35-37.

30 November 2017

Claimant to “file a Supplementary Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction limited to covering issues
that may arise from any final decision made by the Finnish Administrative Courts” and
Respondent to file “its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction but only in rebuttal to the Claimant’s
Counter-Memorial” and Claimant to file “its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction only in rebuttal to the

Respondent’s Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction . . . .”

Following a request for clarification from Claimant, on 2 October 2013, the Tribunal requested
the Parties to pay a reduced additional deposit of EUR 50,000 instead of the EUR 200,000
previously requested. On 17 October 2013, Claimant paid his share of the additional deposit
requested. Because no payment was received from Respondent, the Tribunal requested

Claimant to make a substitute payment pursuant to Article 41(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

On | November 2013, Claimant requested the Tribunal to direct Respondent to report on its
latest financial situation and to explain why it was unable to comply with the Tribunal’s

direction to make the deposits.

On 12 November 2013, Respondent submitted that its economy remained unstable and that it
did not have the public finances available to pay arbitration fees. Respondent suggested that the
Tribunal direct that Claimant pay Respondent’s share of the additional deposit if he wished to

continue with the arbitration, as provided for in the UNCITRAL Rules.

On 13 November 2013, the Tribunal directed Claimant to make a substitute payment on behalf

of Respondent, which Claimant paid on 2 December 2013.

On 10 August 2015, the Tribunal requested an update on the challenge against the FIS decision
in the Finnish administrative courts and the expected next steps in those proceedings. On
12 August 2015, Claimant informed the Tribunal that the matter was still pending before the

Supreme Administrative Court in Helsinki (“SAC”).

On 13 August 2015, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Helsinki Administrative Court
had on 26 January 2015 upheld the determination of the FIS that Mr Bahgat had lost his Finnish
nationality when he took up Egyptian nationality on 28 September 1997. Respondent clarified
that the case pending before the SAC was an appeal against the decision of the Helsinki
Administrative Court and it informed that it was Mr Bahgat’s final legal recourse in that regard.
Respondent enclosed the decision of the Helsinki Administrative Court and predicted that the

decision of the SAC could be expected from summer 2016.

I. REVIVAL OF PROCEEDINGS

On 25 August 2016, the Tribunal requested an update as to the status of the proceedings
pending before the SAC. On 23 September 2016, Claimant notified the Tribunal that he was

still awaiting a decision from the SAC on the question of his nationality.

On 15 November 2016, Claimant informed the Tribunal that he had prevailed on appeal before
the SAC and that the decisions of the Helsinki Administrative Court and FIS had been revoked.
Claimant provided the Tribunal with a copy of the judgment of the SAC dated 15 November
2016 (“SAC Judgment”) in Finnish.

On 1 December 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties of a new timeline for their
submissions. On 14 December 2016, Claimant submitted to the Tribunal its Supplementary
Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (“Claimant’s Supplementary Counter-Memorial on

Jurisdiction’), including an English translation of the SAC Judgment.

On 28 December 2016, Claimant notified the Tribunal that Mr Subir Karmakar had ceased to
represent him and that the law firm Fietta was counsel of record for Claimant. Mr Samuel

Wordsworth QC and Professor Andrew Newcombe would continue as counsel for Claimant.

J. REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE OF THE COURT FILE DOCUMENTS

On 11 January 2017, Respondent requested the Tribunal to “order Claimant to disclose the
submissions, the exhibits to the submissions and all other documents” that were submitted to
the SAC in connection with the SAC Judgment (“the Court File Documents”). Respondent
argued that (i) the Court File Documents are directly relevant to the dispute and material to its
outcome, specifically, to Respondent’s ratione personae objection; (ii) the Court File
Documents must be disclosed in order to protect Respondent’s due process rights; (iii) the
disclosure of the Court File Documents would have no adverse effect on Claimant; and (iv) it
had taken all possible steps to obtain the Court File Documents. Respondent noted that the SAC
Judgment is not binding on the Tribunal and that the Tribunal is duty-bound to decide the

question of nationality for itself.

On 16 January 2017, Claimant responded, noting that Respondent had not demonstrated the
relevance of the Court File Documents to this arbitration and that the SAC Judgment was
decisive of Claimant’s nationality. Claimant noted that the Court File Documents are public and
could be accessed by Respondent through the Finnish Act on the Openness of Government

Activities (Law No. 621/1999). The Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimant’s

letter and to respond to the assertion that “all of the documents requested are publicly available

in Finland and easily accessible by the Respondent.”

On 2 February 2017, Respondent withdrew its request, stating that it had filed a disclosure
request under the relevant Finnish legislation. Respondent reiterated the relevance of the Court
File Documents and reserved its right to request an extension of the deadline for the filing of its

Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction based on when Respondent received the Court File Documents.

K. THIRD DEPOSIT REQUEST AND THIRD PARTY FUNDING

The Tribunal confirmed on 3 February 2017 that a two-day hearing on jurisdiction would be
held on 19 and 20 June 2017, at the Peace Palace in The Hague (“Hearing on Jurisdiction”),

in light of the Parties’ preference to hold a Hearing on Jurisdiction.

On 6 February 2017, Claimant, recalling Procedural Order No. 2 wherein the Tribunal directed
Respondent “to arrange, as soon as practicably possible, for restitution to the Claimant of the
share of the deposit that he paid in lieu of the Respondent” and invited Respondent to make
arrangements for restitution to Claimant of the EUR 100,000 that he had paid in lieu of

Respondent to that date.

On 10 February 2017, Respondent stated that it “cannot commit to the payment of its share of
the requested supplementary deposit due to the difficult financial circumstances that the Arab
Republic of Egypt continues to face to date.” Respondent noted that although the political
situation in Egypt had improved, the financial situation had not. Respondent confirmed that it
would continue to monitor its financial situation and report to the Tribunal as soon as it was in a

position to pay its share of the supplementary deposit and to restitute Claimant.

On 10 February 2017, Claimant argued that Respondent should pay its share of the requested
deposit as economic indicators suggested Egypt’s economic situation had improved and Egypt
could afford to engage expensive legal counsel to defend it in investment arbitrations. Claimant
contended that in any event, Respondent should at least apply to the PCA’s Financial Assistance
Fund. Claimant requested that the Tribunal make an order with the “same legal effect as an
interim award”:
directing the Respondent to comply with its ‘legal obligation to pay its share of the
deposit’, as confirmed by the Tribunal in [Procedural Order No. 2], by: (a) repaying to the
Claimant the two deposits (totalling EUR 100,000) that he has already paid in lieu of the
Respondent; (b) paying its share of the additional deposit requested on 3 February; and

(c) paying forthwith its share of any future deposits that may from time to time be
requested by the Tribunal.

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

On 17 February 2017, Respondent submitted that the Tribunal had no power to make an order
requiring Respondent to satisfy the deposit payment, that Claimant’s request for an order
requiring Respondent to make payment of costs was already considered and rejected in
Procedural Order No. 2, and that “Respondent does not refuse to pay, it cannot pay.”
Respondent confirmed that it had retained external counsel on a limited basis only and that its
inability to pay its share of the deposit did not in any way threaten the proceedings. Respondent
noted that it would be happy to continue monitoring the situation and that it would pay costs

once they were finally adjudicated in the costs phase.

Respondent also recalled that Claimant had agreed during the Interim Measures Hearing to
disclose its third party funding arrangements and sought an order directing Claimant to disclose
(i) whether third party funding arrangements have been entered into in respect of this
arbitration; (ii) the identity of the funder; (iii) the terms of the funding; (iv) whether the claims

have been assigned to a third party; and (v) the terms of any assignment arrangements.

On 8 March 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“Procedural Order No. 4”).
The Tribunal noted that neither Claimant nor Respondent had paid its shares of the
supplementary deposit by the prescribed deadline of 6 March 2017. The Tribunal noted that the
required course of action for a party’s failure to make a deposit payment was in Article 41(4) of
the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal considered that delivering an award at this stage “with the
same legal effect as an interim award” (as Claimant had requested) might not be appropriate in

a case where jurisdiction had not yet been determined.

Accordingly, the Tribunal directed Claimant to make payment of EUR 175,000, representing its
own share of the supplementary deposit requested on 3 February 2017. In light of Respondent’s
statements that it would not pay its share of the deposit, Claimant was directed to deposit
EUR 175,000 as substitute payment pursuant to Article 41(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The
Tribunal confirmed that consideration of the question of the allocation of the costs associated
with the deposit payments in this arbitration would be deferred until the final award or, in any

event, until after the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is determined.

The Tribunal recalled that Respondent remains under a legal obligation to pay its share of the

deposit, and to monitor and report on its own financial and political situation.

Finally, the Tribunal noted that Claimant’s third party funding arrangements had been notified
to the Tribunal on 3 December 2012. Claimant was invited to update the Tribunal regarding

(i) the identity of its third party funder; (ii) the nature or type of the third party funding; and

(iii) whether the third party funder has a charge or lien on the proceeds of this claim and/or if

the third party funder in any other way exercises control over the present arbitration.

On 14 March 2017, Claimant confirmed that he had no current third party funding in place. He
recalled notifying the Tribunal on 3 December 2012 that his then funder, Buttonwood Legal
Capital Ltd., had no charge or lien over any proceeds of the present claim. Claimant noted that
he was arranging to pay his share of the supplementary deposit as well as Respondent’s share of

the supplementary deposit by 8 April 2017.

On 23 March 2017, Respondent submitted its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction (“Respondent’s
Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction”).

On 11 April 2017, the Tribunal granted the Claimant’s request for an extension on the payment

of the supplementary deposit.

By letter dated 14 April 2017, Claimant alleged that Respondent’s Reply Memorial on
Jurisdiction contained three substantive new objections to jurisdiction (“New Objections”).
These concerned: (i) new alternative jurisdiction ratione personae objections set out in Section
L.C of Respondent’s Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction concerning Claimant’s dual nationality;
(ii) Claimant’s alleged failure to comply with the exhaustion of local remedies requirements
under Article 8 of the 1980 BIT; and (iii) the inability of Article 7 of the 1980 BIT to confer
jurisdiction to a Tribunal in an arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules administered by the
PCA. Claimant requested that the Tribunal dismiss these New Objections on the basis that
Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules precludes Respondent from raising the New Objections
belatedly. Additionally, Claimant submitted that Respondent should be estopped from
advancing the dual nationality objection, and the objection concerning applicable rules and the

administration of this arbitration.

On 26 April 2017, Respondent replied that its objections were not new, that Claimant’s request
should be rejected, and that Claimant should be directed to respond to Respondent’s arguments

made in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and during the Hearing on Jurisdiction.
A further extension for payment of the supplementary deposit was granted on 11 May 2017.

On 17 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 on Claimant’s Request to Rule as
Inadmissible Respondent’s New Jurisdictional Objections (“Procedural Order No. 5”). The
Tribunal dismissed with reasons the three objections that Claimant identified as being raised

out of time. The Tribunal clarified that it did not expect Claimant to respond to these objections

in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Respondent was directed not to raise these arguments at the

payment of the Parties’ supplementary deposit.

THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE

A. INTRODUCTION

Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae because Claimant
held Egyptian nationality at all relevant times and was not a Finnish national during the
relevant period.° Therefore, Claimant could not be considered a “national” within the meaning
of Article 7 of the 1980 BIT or, respectively, an “investor” within the meaning of Article 9 of
the 2004 BIT. Respondent argues that the SAC Judgment does not bind the Tribunal and that
the Tribunal must make its own determination of Claimant’s nationality. Further, Respondent
contends that in any event, the SAC Judgment did not find that Claimant held Finnish

nationality at the relevant times. Respondent claims that notwithstanding the SAC Judgment,

under Finnish lity legis]: Claimant lly lost Finnish ionality upon
acquiring Egyptian nationality in 1997. Respondent denies any allegations that Claimant was

coerced into acquiring Egyptian nationality in 1997.

It is Claimant’s position that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae under Article 7 of
the 1980 BIT and Article 9 of the 2004 BIT.’ Claimant argues that the SAC Judgment is
determinative of Claimant’s continuing Finnish nationality since 1971 and, therefore, Claimant
was entitled to investment protection under the BITs at all relevant times. Claimant further
contends that this Tribunal may only revisit the SAC determination under exceptional
circumstances, which are not made out in the present case. Claimant suggests that, under
Finnish law, Claimant did not automatically lose his Finnish nationality upon the acquisition of
Egyptian nationality in 1997. Claimant submits that, in any event, the provisions on loss of
Finnish nationality did not apply to him because he did not ‘acquire’ Egyptian nationality and
as Finland did not officially recognise Claimant’s Egyptian nationality. Claimant suggests that
Finland could not have recognised his Egyptian nationality because it took place under

circumstances of coercion.

Egyptian nationality by birth.*

In 1963, Claimant moved to Germany where he continued his studies and qualified as an
Electrical Engineer in 1966.° Claimant participated in demonstrations in Germany after the Six-
Day War in 1967 to express his discomfort with the policies of the then President of Egypt.
Since then, Claimant felt at risk of being apprehended by Egyptian Government agents in
Germany and so Claimant relocated to Finland in October 1967 where he started to work.!”
Respondent notes that Claimant’s nationality status during the time span from his birth in 1940

to 1980 is of limited relevance in this arbitration.'!

Claimant states that his Egyptian passport expired in 1970 and that the Egyptian Embassy in
Helsinki refused to renew his passport in 1970 on the basis that he would have to return to
Egypt “if [he] wanted to remain an Egyptian national.”'? According to Claimant, he
consciously decided not to return to Egypt due to the risk of being apprehended by the Egyptian
regime.'* Claimant testifies that he consulted with the Chief of the Foreign Police Section in

Helsinki, and that he was told to apply for Finnish nationality and to remain in Finland.'*

Claimant applied for Finnish nationality in 1970.'° Claimant became a Finnish national on
12 February 1971 by a decree issued by the President of Finland (“1971 Presidential
Decree”).'° The 1971 Presidential Decree stated that “in case you do not automatically lose
your former nationality after applying for the Finnish nationality, and now that you are being
granted it, you can be treated, in accordance with international regulations, in your former
home country as a national of only that country.”!7 Claimant alleges that in early 1971 he
informed the Egyptian Embassy in Helsinki of his intention to give up his Egyptian
nationality.'* According to Claimant, the Embassy personnel asked him to return his Egyptian
passport and told him that “the subject is now closed.”!? Claimant notes that the Finnish

population information system suggests that he was residing in Finland between | January 1973

and 20 November 2003.”° Claimant also notes that between 1976 and 2000, he was “still
domiciled and resident in Finland during this time” and he continued to pay “taxes from income

earned in Egypt and elsewhere to the Finnish revenue authorities in Finland.””!

In 1971, Claimant set up his own company in Finland called “Export & Import Centre”, which
exported Finnish wood products to countries such as Egypt, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.”? Claimant
states that his business ran successfully between 1972 and 1995.7? Between 1977 and 1981,
Claimant participated in construction projects in the Middle East by arranging the funding for
the projects, which were undertaken by a Finnish company called Hartela Contractors, and was
compensated based on the turnkey sum of the projects.7* Claimant also earned substantial
income from his companies M. Bahgat KY and Ravintola Olarius, which managed restaurants.

Claimant sold M. Bahgat KY and Ravintola Olarius in 1981.75

Around 1976, Claimant felt that the Egyptian Government had become more democratic and
liberal, and so he expanded his export business to Egypt.”° Claimant states that he visited Egypt
as a Finnish citizen in 1976 with an entry visa from the Egyptian consulate in Helsinki.” In
1980, Claimant established a representative office of his company, Export Import & Centre, in

Cairo and personally took charge of its business.”*

Claimant states that as his business in Egypt grew, it became necessary for him to be present in
Egypt.” When Claimant applied for an Egyptian residence permit and visa in 1980 the
authorities informed him that he was an Egyptian national and did not require permission to
work in Egypt.*° Claimant recalls that he learned in 1980 that Respondent's authorities in Egypt

did not know that Claimant had renounced his Egyptian nationality in 1971 and that they

requested Claimant to declare the renunciation again.*! Claimant recalls that he told Respondent’s
authorities that he had returned his passport to the Egyptian Embassy in Helsinki in 1971 and
that he was informed that this was all that was needed in order to renounce his Egyptian
citizenship.” Claimant pointed out that since then, he had been travelling to Egypt on visit

visas.**

On 29 September 1980, Claimant submitted an application to the Egyptian Passports,
Emigration and Nationality Administration (“PENA”) to renounce his Egyptian nationality.*+
On 6 November 1980, the Egyptian Minister of the Interior by Decision Number 1896/1980
authorized Claimant to acquire Finnish nationality while not retaining Egyptian nationality.*°
By letter of the same day, the Egyptian Directorate for Travel, Migration, and Nationality
Documents informed Claimant about its decision and stated the following:

Kindly note and provide us with the date of your acquisition of this [Finnish] nationality

and provide us with any Egyptian travel documents you have so that we can take the
necessary action.*°

On 6 December 1980, Claimant appeared before PENA and declared that he had acquired
Finnish nationality.*” Claimant also produces other evidence indicating that he was a Finnish
citizen residing in Egypt in the form of work permit cards and certificates issued by the

Egyptian Ministry of Interior and dated between 1981 and 1995.*8

Respondent submits that the evidence submitted by Claimant does not sufficiently prove that he
acquired Finnish nationality in 1971.*? Also, according to Respondent, under Egyptian law,

Claimant was considered to have lost his Egyptian nationality on 6 November 1980, which

Respondent considers was Claimant’s first renunciation of Egyptian nationality.*°

Respondent contests Claimant’s submission that he renounced his Egyptian passport in 1971
and argues that Claimant still held a valid Egyptian passport in 1980.*! Respondent submits that
Claimant’s request to PENA on 29 September 1980 to authorise the renunciation of his
Egyptian nationality in order to acquire Finnish nationality makes reference to the existence of
Claimant’s Egyptian passport issued on 21 September 1977.” Claimant denies Respondent’s
allegation about ever having held or used that passport.*? Claimant alleges that he was advised
by an official of the Egyptian Ministry of Interior to insert information about that passport in

order to avoid delays in the processing of his application to renounce Egyptian nationality.

Furthermore, Respondent suggests that Claimant filed an application to preserve his Egyptian
nationality in 1974. Respondent refers to a letter from the Egyptian Embassy in Helsinki to
Claimant dated 25 March 1974 that states:

Kindly be informed that your request filed on January 02, 1974 to acquire the Finnish
nationality and preserve the Egyptian one is granted by virtue of the Ministry of Interior’s
letter, Passports, Emigration & Nationality Administration, file no. 23/56/7865 in its
correspondence no. 1884 sent on March 12, 1974.4

Claimant denies ever filing a request to preserve his Egyptian nationality after 1971. Claimant

denies receiving that letter dated 25 March 1974 and contests its authenticity.“°

In summary, Respondent submits that Claimant appears to have held only Finnish nationality
from 1981 onwards and not from 1971 onwards as Claimant suggests.” Respondent argues that
the earliest dated evidence of Claimant’s Finnish nationality is Claimant’s Finnish passport

issued by the Finnish Embassy in Cairo on 14 May 1980.**

Egypt.*? With the knowledge that the Egyptian government was seeking private-sector
assistance to develop these mines,*° Claimant contacted the Egyptian Ministry of Industry to
inquire about the possibilities of establishing a private mining complex in the area.*! Claimant
states that in early June 1997, the Egyptian Minister of Industry organised a meeting with all
parties interested in the Aswan mines and requested those present to submit proposals to
develop the iron ore reserves.*? After site visits with expert geologists and studying the reports
produced by the experts on the existence of iron ore at the Aswan site, Claimant decided to
participate in the bidding process for the Project.**

According to Claimant, the Egyptian Minister of Industry, Mr Soliman Reda, suggested that
Claimant collaborate with Arbed S.A., a company based in Luxembourg that was also
interested in utilising the iron ore at Aswan.** According to Claimant, after visiting Arbed S.A.,
he wrote a letter to Mr Reda confirming that Claimant planned to build a steel plant in Aswan
using an old steel plant that he would purchase from Arbed S.A.*° Claimant states that Mr Reda
confirmed in the second half of August 1997 that Claimant had been awarded the contract to
mine iron ore in the Aswan region.*° Claimant states that after being awarded the contract, he

began to work on the implementation of the Project.*”

Claimant suggests that on 1 September 1997 Mr Reda invited Claimant to his office (the
“1 September 1997 Meeting”). The 1 September 1997 Meeting was also attended by
Mr Mokhtar Al El Ashri, a potential investor in the Project, who was in a meeting with

Claimant when Claimant received the phone call from Mr Reda.**

According to Claimant, at the 1 September 1997 Meeting, Mr Reda confirmed that Claimant
would be the Chairman of the company that would run the Project.*” Mr Reda allegedly stated
that he intended to grant the bid to Claimant if the following three pre-conditions were met.
First, Claimant would need to re-acquire his Egyptian nationality. Claimant states that Mr Reda

made it clear that if Claimant did not take on Egyptian nationality, the government would look

for someone else to run the Project and the money and time invested by Claimant in the Project
would be lost.® Claimant states that Mr Reda indicated that Claimant would be “out of this
project and from any other project in Egypt.”°! Second, Claimant would have to allocate 5% of
the shares in that company each to the Bank Misr and to the Al Sharg Insurance Company.
Third, Claimant would have to assign to each of Bank Misr and the Al Sharq Insurance

Company the right to appoint one Board member of Claimant’s company.

Claimant testifies that he pointed out to Mr Reda that he had renounced Egyptian nationality
and that being a national of Egypt was not a prerequisite for participation in the Project.
Claimant says that he indicated that he would be willing to accept Egyptian nationality if he
could, at the same time, retain Finnish nationality.© Claimant alleges that Mr Reda confirmed

that there was no obstacle to having dual nationality.©

Claimant describes that he accepted Mr Reda’s demands, seeing no other method of preserving
his investment in the Project and fearing the possibility of being put in jail if he refused the

demands.

Claimant alleges that Mr Reda handed him an application form to regain Egyptian nationality
which was addressed to PENA and d ded its i di letion. Claimant pleted
the form immediately in the presence of Mr El Ashri.® This form was submitted to PENA on

the same day.”

On 28 September 1997, the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior issued Decision Number
10815/1997, which restored Claimant’s Egyptian nationality pursuant to Article 18 of the

Nationality Law No. 26 of 1975.7! Claimant was notified of his new nationality status by letter

dated 30 September 1997.7

Claimant clarifies that he did not personally appear before PENA to file this application,”
contrary to Respondent’s claim.” Claimant does not accept as accurate the English translation
of Claimant’s application for Egyptian nationality that was submitted by Respondent.”
Claimant submits that, contrary to what Respondent’s translation of his application for
Egyptian nationality indicates, no official from PENA signed the application acknowledging

that Claimant had filled the form in the official’s presence.”°

Respondent points out that Claimant stated in his application to restore Egyptian nationality
that the date he adopted Finnish nationality was 1975, not 1971.7 However, Claimant explains
that this error speaks to the particular stress that Claimant was under at the time he completed

the application.”

On 24 December 1997, Claimant established ADEMCO with the authorization of the Chairman
of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones in Egypt (“GAFI”) to carry out the
exploitation and mining of iron ore.”” ADEMCO’s thirty-year mining license was confirmed by
Law No. 166 on 14 June 1998, which was enacted by the Egyptian Parliament and signed by then
President Hosni Mubarak (“Law No. 166”). Law No. 166 was accompanied by a commitment

agreement between ADEMCO and the Ministry of Industry (the “Commitment Agreement”).*°

On 21 July 1998, AISCO was established by a decision of ADEMCO’s shareholders. With the
authorization of GAFI, AISCO was incorporated in September 1998 and was registered as a

corporate entity on 10 September 1998.*!

Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Minister Dr Atef Ebied allegedly took measures to reverse the legacy of former Prime Minister
Dr Ganzouri.*? Claimant exhibits newspaper reports suggesting that the new government had a

negative approach to the Project and to Claimant.*

Claimant alleges that the Egyptian
government falsely claimed that Claimant was wanted in Finland in connection with a

commercial fraud case.**

In January 2000, the accounting books of ADEMCO and AISCO were scrutinised by a
committee formed by GAFI and chaired by Mr Salah El-deen Mandour (“Committee”).
Areport by the Committee issued on 6 February 2000 prompted criminal charges against

Claimant and his companies for misappropriation of funds.**

On 5 February 2000 — one day before the Committee report was submitted to GAFI - Claimant
was arrested by the Egyptian police in connection with ADEMCO’s alleged failure to make
payment of 54 million Deutsche marks to Mannesman Demag, in relation to constructing a
steel mill for the Project at the site in Aswan.*° A travel ban was imposed on Claimant, and
Egypt’s Public Prosecution Service and police searched Claimant’s residence and offices,
removing documents, computers, records, and files. By order of the Egyptian Public
Prosecutor, confirmed by the Cairo Criminal Court on 20 February 2000, Claimant’s assets as
well as the assets of ADEMCO and AISCO, Claimant’s family and his deputy, Mr Shimi, were

made subject to the Freezing Order.*”

According to Claimant, the Finnish Embassy in Cairo attempted to provide consular assistance
after the arrest, but the Egyptian Government refused any access on the basis that Claimant was
also Egyptian.** The Finnish Embassy circulated a memorandum stating that “Mr. Bahgat

obtained his Finnish citizenship on the 12" of February, 1971 and did not lose his Egyptian

nationality, so he is both an Egyptian and a Finnish national.”**

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Claimant was under arrest between 5 February 2000 and March 2003, and was released
following the dismissal of criminal allegations against him.°' After his release from prison,
Claimant visited the Finnish Ambassador who issued him a Finnish identity card for his
protection. According to Claimant, the Egyptian government did not allow him to leave the
country for the next two years. On 23 June 2005, after his travel ban was lifted, Claimant

returned to Finland.*? Claimant has “not travelled back to Egypt again in fear of [his] life.”°*

Claimant notes that the Finnish population information system reflects that he was not resident
in Finland between 21 November 2003 and 21 July 2005, as he was in Egypt and was banned
from travelling abroad.** Claimant points out that from 22 July 2005 onwards he is recorded as
being resident in Finland.*> Furthermore, Claimant relies on his Finnish passports and Finnish
identity cards to establish his nationality.°° Claimant notes that he has always travelled abroad
as a Finnish national and travelled to Egypt under Egyptian visas issued by the Egyptian

Embassy in Finland.”

Respondent states that Claimant took advantage of his Egyptian nationality by using his
passport at Cairo Airport in November 1997, September 1998, December 1998, and July
1999.°8 Respondent also contends that Claimant was “happy to look Egyptian in Egypt” and
that Claimant used his time as an Egypt resident to augment his financial and social status.”
Respondent submits that Claimant has accepted (if not requested) an Egyptian passport with
validity between 13 October 2004 and 12 October 2011.' Respondent notes that Claimant
relied on his Egyptian nationality in order to modify his daughters’ birth certificates on
8 November 1997; subsequently, PENA issued a letter to the Manager of the German School in
Cairo dated 10 November 1997 confirming that Claimant’s daughters had regained Egyptian

Furthermore, Respondent argues that on 26 March 2002, PENA wrote to Claimant indicating
that Claimant had been treated as an Egyptian citizen since 28 September 1997.'? Claimant
denies ever receiving such a letter and notes that on 21 October 2002, the Egyptian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs wrote to the Finnish Embassy in Cairo admitting that Claimant was a Finnish

national.'

On 26 December 2012, Egyptian authorities sent a note of enquiry about Claimant’s nationality
to the Finnish Embassy in Cairo, which stated that: “[Claimant] has been treated as an Egyptian
citizen in all aspects whereas the Finnish citizenship law that was in effect then when Egyptian
citizenship was restored banned dual citizenship.”'*' The note further stated that: “The
Immigration Service is not aware that [Claimant] at a later stage possibly gave up his Egyptian
nationality and again regained it.”!°°

On 23 April 2013, during the pendency of this arbitration, the FIS issued a decision ruling that
Claimant lost his Finnish nationality when be obtained Egyptian nationality on 28 September
1997. Claimant challenged the decision of the FIS before the Helsinki Administrative Court.!°°
The Helsinki Administrative Court delivered its decision no. 15/0033/5 on 26 January 2015 in
which it rejected Claimant’s complaint regarding the decision of the FIS.'” Claimant appealed

the decision of the Helsinki Administrative Court before the SAC.

The SAC Judgment in proceeding no. 807/3/15 Appeal Concerning Nationality: Mohamed
Abdel Raouf Bahgat was delivered on 15 November 2016. The court nullified the prior decisions
of the FIS and Helsinki Administrative Court and held that Claimant’s status as a Finnish citizen

D. THE PARTIES’ ARGUME!

 

'S ON JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE

1. Whether the Tribunal should depart from the SAC’s finding on Claimant’s
nationality

Respondent's Position

Respondent's position is that, as a matter of Finnish law, Mr Bahgat was not a Finnish national
at the relevant times for purposes of bringing this arbitration because he was at the same time
an Egyptian national. Respondent acknowledges that the SAC Judgment reaches a different
conclusion with respect to certain relevant periods but submits that this Tribunal is not in
principle bound by the SAC Judgment. In any event, it argues that the SAC Judgment should

not be followed because of its unusual and irregular reasoning.

Respondent argues that it is the Tribunal that determines Claimant’s nationality for the
purposes of this arbitration.'°? Respondent relies on Soufraki v. UAE for the statement that
“when, in international arbitral or judicial proceedings, the nationality of a person is challenged,

the international tribunal is competent to pass upon that challenge . . . the international tribunal

is empowered, indeed bound, to decide that issue.”!!?

Respondent notes that a tribunal must not defer to the State’s application of its laws on
nationality: when the investor’s nationality is in dispute, that dispute cannot be decided
exclusively in accordance with the nationality law of the State in question, the State’s official
declaration of claimant’s nationality, or official indicia of or a State’s recognition of an
individual’s nationality.''' Foreign nationality must be established by the objective criteria of

the treaties involved.'!? Respondent further states that it is well-established that certificates of

nationality only constitute prima facie evidence of nationality.''?

At the Hearing of Jurisdiction,
Respondent stated that the Tribunal need not disregard what the national authorities have
decided, but that international tribunals are free to assess their jurisdiction for themselves by
applying national laws: “You cannot invent Finnish nationality law; you have to apply it, not to
redo it.”'4 Respondent reminds the Tribunal that in Soufraki v. UAE, the tribunal undertook an
independent examination of Mr Soufraki’s nationality despite being provided certificates of
nationality and passports issued by Italian authorities, and found that Mr Soufraki had lost his

Italian nationality.''> That tribunal’s decision was upheld by an ad hoc committee.!'°

Respondent states that there are “ample reasons as to why the Tribunal should depart from the
SAC’s nationality determination” and find that, under applicable Finnish nationality laws,

Claimant was not a Finnish national at the relevant times.!!7

First, Respondent argues that the SAC Judgment is unprecedented and departs from well-
established case law. Respondent argues that the SAC Judgment is influenced by non-legal
considerations of fairness and morality are beyond the scope of investigation of a court in

nationality matters.'!*

Second, Respondent recalls that on 23 April 2013, the FIS determined through a reasoned order
that Claimant was to be regarded as an Egyptian national. The FIS stated that the nationality
documents produced by Claimant establishing his Finnish nationality were defective because
Claimant had failed to inform the Finnish authorities of his voluntary reacquisition of Egyptian
nationality in 1997.'!° Respondent points out that the Helsinki Administrative Court, in
confirming the decision of the FIS, held that the evidence of Finnish nationality produced by
Claimant had no legal significance and could not generate any legitimate expectation of Finnish
nationality for Claimant because the relevant authorities were not aware of Claimant’s Egyptian

nationality.'2 Respondent notes that the SAC Judgment did not state that the FIS and the

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Helsinki Administrative Court’s determinations regarding Claimant’s nationality were
erroneous, but, in fact, found that the FIS had applied the law correctly.'2! Respondent contends
that the SAC did not provide an interpretation of Finnish nationality law contrary to that
provided by the FIS and Helsinki Administrative Court, but annulled the FIS decision on a

different ground (explained below in paragraph 128).'** Therefore, the Tribunal should bear in
mind the decisions of the FIS and the Helsinki Administrative Court in adjudicating Claimant’s
nationality. Respondent notes that while it is unaware of any investment tribunal ever departing

from the finding of the highest national court, there is no rule prohibiting that outcome. !”°

Third, Respondent argues that, in making its decision, the SAC did not apply Finnish law.!74
The SAC held that the decisions of the lower courts were substantively correct, but, using a
“balancing approach” of the consequences of the FIS decision for Finland and Claimant, based
on Claimant’s legitimate expectations, the court held that it was unfair to apply the law against
Claimant.'?° In Respondent’s view, the “balancing approach” was neither anticipated by the
experts and the Parties in this arbitration, nor by the lower Finnish courts. Respondent suggests
that this is because the balancing approach based on legitimate expectations is not provided for
in the 1968 or 2003 Nationality Acts and because the principle of legitimate expectations is
foreign to the Finnish legal system, having been imported only around 2000.'° Prior decisions
of the SAC in the cases of Mrs. B and Mrs. C confirm that the principle of legitimate
expectations is alien to Finnish Law. Respondent argues that in those cases, the FIS and
Helsinki Administrative Court had found that Mrs. B and Mrs. C had automatically lost their
Finnish nationality in the 1970s, as a result of consenting to and applying for naturalisation in
another country, respectively. These findings were confirmed by the SAC, without making any

reference to legitimate expectations. !7”

The SAC Judgment, according to Respondent, is surprising because it is one of the first cases to

apply the doctrine of legitimate expectations before the entry into force of the Administrative

Procedures Act in 2003 which codified the principle of legitimate expectations. The only time the

SAC previously relied on the Administrative Procedures Act was in respect of facts that occurred

128,

after the legislation entered into force,!** or in cases that did not concern nationality.'” In general,

Respondent finds it surprising that the SAC concluded that Claimant had a legitimate expectation
of Finnish nationality when the Claimant himself had failed to inform Finnish authorities of his
acquisition of Egyptian nationality.!°° This is because a pre-requisite for the application of
legitimate expectations is the good faith of the individual seeking to avail itself of the principle. '*!
Respondent maintains that Claimant had no legitimate expectation of being treated as a Finnish
national when he himself led the Finnish administration to error.'** Respondent argues that in
order for expectations to be legitimate, “the individual must have disclosed to the administration

the relevant facts on which the administration should rely to take a position.”

Respondent agrees that as of 15 March 2000, the Finnish authorities were under the impression
that Claimant was an Egyptian-Finnish dual national. However, with respect to the restoration
of his Egyptian nationality in 1997, Respondent states that Claimant did not act in good faith
because he has taken contradictory stances on whether he informed Finnish authorities about
his Egyptian nationality. Mr Bahgat’s early witness statements indicate that he never informed
Finnish authorities of the restoration of his Egyptian nationality in 1997. Mr Bahgat’s

explanation in his fourth witness statement that he indeed did inform the Finnish Embassy in

1345

Egypt about his re-acquired Egyptian nationality’** is contradicted by statements in Claimant’s

Rejoinder which indicate that the Finnish authorities should have inferred that Claimant had
acquired Egyptian nationality.'** Respondent states that Claimant was obligated to inform
Finnish authorities about his Egyptian nationality.'*° Respondent further submits that even if

Claimant’s Finnish identity card was authentic, it would not prove Claimant’s Egyptian

nationality.'°’ For similar reasons, Respondent argues information on the Finnish population

information system is not proof of Claimant’s Finnish nationality. '**

Respondent also argues that the SAC was incorrect in stating that, on balance, the FIS
determination of Claimant’s nationality brings limited benefit to Finland because Claimant
could immediately become Finnish again by application in 2008. Respondent maintains that the
benefit to Finland of the FIS decision was that the FIS correctly applied Finnish nationality law:
“a State would have no benefit to see its Nationality Act misapplied.” °° Respondent contends
that if Claimant believed that the restoration of his Egyptian nationality in 1997 was a nullity,
Claimant should have informed the Finnish population information system in 2007 that he was
not, as they had considered, a dual Egyptian-Finnish national. If the restoration was valid, then
Claimant would have lost his Finnish nationality. Respondent notes that even if Claimant
applied for restoration of his Finnish nationality in 2008, this would not be retroactive and he
would not be a Finnish national between 1997 and 2008 (the time of the alleged breaches of the
BITs by Egypt).'“° Respondent concludes that the SAC, by its balancing approach, could only
have meant that the harm to Claimant in upholding the FIS decision is significant as he would

be unable to bring this arbitration.'!

Fourth, Respondent contends that the Court File Documents show that Claimant submitted
extensive pleadings that are the subject matter of this arbitration, indicating that the SAC was
motivated by a desire to allow Claimant to pursue this pending arbitration against Egypt.'”
“[T]he present claim and the present proceedings were at the heart of the decision of the
SAC”.'3 On this basis, Respondent stresses the need for this Tribunal to forge its independent
opinion on Claimant’s nationality.'‘* Respondent alleges that the SAC’s balancing approach
was employed to keep this arbitration alive and argues that it would be entirely inappropriate

for the Tribunal to adopt a similar balancing approach here. !45

case of Ms A that was delivered on the same day. Ms A was born in 1986 to Mrs C who was
thought to be a Finnish national and was entered into the Finnish population register as a
Finnish-Israeli. However, in 2010, it was discovered that Mrs. C lost her Finnish nationality in
1979, just before her daughter was born, by voluntarily acquiring Israeli nationality. The FIS
found on 15 June 2012 that Ms A was not a Finnish national. However, the SAC noted that
Ms A had been treated as a Finnish national since birth and, therefore, held that the Finnish
authorities had created a legitimate expectation of Ms A’s Finnish nationality. Respondent
argues that it was wrong for Mr Bahgat’s case to be influenced by Ms A’s case: Ms A had no
method of regaining Finnish nationality but for the SAC’s decision. By contrast, Claimant

could have applied for Finnish nationality under the 2003 Nationality Act.'4°

Respondent denies Claimant’s suggestion that the SAC Judgment is consistent with the record
of this arbitration and denies that the record of this arbitration shows that Claimant was treated
as a Finnish national by Finnish and Egyptian authorities. Respondent questions the
authenticity of the Finnish identity card issued by the Finnish Embassy in Cairo on 3 November
2003 that was produced by Claimant because it does not contain information in Finnish and
Swedish, the two official languages of Finland, and it does not resemble identity cards
generally issued by Finland.'*’ Respondent contends that Claimant’s Finnish passports are not
determinative of his Finnish nationality.'4* Respondent clarifies that the statement by the
Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 15 March 2000 was not a determination of Claimant’s
nationality, unlike the FIS determination of April 2013, but merely a transmission of
information.'*? Respondent states that the Tribunal cannot rely on Claimant’s testimony
regarding Mr Reda’s promise made in the 1 September 1997 Meeting that he would remain a

dual citizen because Mr Reda could not make promises on behalf of Finnish authorities. '*°

Moreover, Respondent contends that the note from the Egyptian authorities to the Finnish
authorities in 2002 confirming that Claimant had acquired Finnish and Egyptian citizenship
does not record the reinstatement of Claimant’s Egyptian nationality in 1997. The Egyptian
authorities likely base their view on their limited awareness that Claimant had acquired Finnish
nationality in 1971. Respondent states that Claimant might have notified the Egyptian Embassy

of his loss of Egyptian nationality in 1980, but the embassy staff might have changed, resulting

in inaccuracy of records.'*!

Respondent notes that it is not dispositive that the Finnish Population Register updated
Claimant’s nationality status following the SAC Judgment. According to Respondent, this only
places Claimant in the situation before the annulment of the FIS determination of April 2013,

when the Finnish authorities knew nothing of Claimant’s nationality status.'°?

Claimant’s Position

Claimant rejects Respondent’s challenge to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae.'*
Claimant argues that the SAC Judgment on his nationality is final and should be followed by
this Tribunal. The Tribunal may only depart from the SAC Judgment in exceptional

circumstances, and such circumstances are not made out in this case.

Claimant observes that the Parties agree that in order to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione personae, it must be established that Claimant was a Finnish national according to
Finnish law at the time of breach of the BITs (from February 2000, when Claimant was
incarcerated) and on the date of consent to the arbitration (3 November 2011).!** Claimant
emphasizes that the SAC has unanimously upheld Claimant’s challenge against the decision of
the FIS, and held that Claimant was at all relevant times, and continuously since 1971, a
Finnish national.'*> Claimant argues that the SAC Judgment supports his position, and that
taken by his experts,'*° that Claimant did not automatically lose his Finnish nationality in 1997
and that Claimant has remained a Finnish citizen from 1971 until 2013.'°’ Claimant notes that,
in arriving at the SAC Judgment, the SAC relied upon the declaration by the FIS of 22 January
2013 that Claimant was a dual national of Egypt and Finland.'* Accordingly, it is the
responsibility of Respondent to establish that, contrary to the finding of the SAC, Claimant

“somehow lost his Finnish nationality by the time of his mistreatment by Egypt in 2000 and by

the time of his imprisonment.”!*°

In the first instance, Claimant notes that “[t]he Supreme Administrative Court’s Judgment is
final and binding as a matter of Finnish law (res judicata) and the Judgment provides a final
and unequivocal determination that the Claimant has been Finnish since 1971 under Finnish
law.”'® There is no appeal available from a decision of the SAC.'¢! Claimant points out that
Respondent’s expert concedes that there exist extraordinary remedies against a decision of the
SAC such as a procedural complaint; however, Respondent’s expert does not state that the SAC
Judgment can be appealed.'© Claimant states that this is because: (i) the SAC Judgment is free
from defects and was hence executed by the FIS immediately;'® and (ii) the deadline for
applying for extraordinary remedies was 15 May 2017, which passed.'*! Claimant points out
that Respondent had sought an order for document production of the Court File Documents, but
even after obtaining these documents independently. However, Respondent was unable to
identify any basis on which to challenge the SAC Judgment and ultimately has not cited the

Court File Documents in its submissions.

Claimant reiterates the sovereign right of every State to determine the identity of its own
nationals. '©° In particular, Claimant submits that “a binding interpretation of a provision by the
highest court forms part of domestic law,” and that the SAC Judgment itself constitutes “final

and binding” Finnish law for the purposes of the determination of this Tribunal.'°”

Claimant submits that “there is serial recognition in international law that international tribunals

should give deference to the decisions of the highest courts of domestic jurisdictions in the

jurisprudence confirms that the tribunal should only in exceptional circumstances depart from a
State’s nationality determination’ and that no modern investment tribunal has contemplated
departing from that determination of a State’s highest court.!”? Claimant relies inter alia on the
following statement of the Soufraki Ad Hoc Committee:
[W]hen applying national law, an international tribunal must strive to apply the legal
provisions as interpreted by the competent judicial authorities and as informed by the

State’s ‘interpretative authorities.’ !7!

Claimant concedes that international tribunals are not bound by certificates of nationality.

However, international tribunals have set a high bar of review of nationality certificates, with

 

the result that a respondent bears a heavy burden of proof in showing decisive evidence of fraud

or material error in the production of the nationality certificate in question.'’” Claimant states

that Respondent has conceded this standard in the past.'”°

claimant against whom a host State has imposed its nationality; but highlights that these

circumstances are not made out in relation to the SAC Judgment.'™ The existence of such
allegations, according to Claimant, distinguishes cases relied upon by Respondent to discredit

the SAC Judgment.!*

Claimant then argues that, even if the Tribunal considers that it is faced only with prima facie
evidence of Claimant’s nationality, Respondent has identified no exceptional circumstances

that justify a departure from the SAC Judgment.!”°

First, Claimant denies that the SAC Judgment is “unprecedented”. With reference to reports
from its Finnish law experts,'”’ Claimant states that the structure and reasoning of the SAC
Judgment is characteristic, particularly the placement of a legal provision in its wider context
which is a well-established principle of Finnish law.'”* Claimant states that the principle of
legitimate expectations has existed in the Finnish legal system since at least the mid-1990s and
has been applied in prior cases.!”? The Administrative Procedure Act merely gave the principle
a formal status.'*° According to Claimant, the Tribunal would reach the same conclusions as
SAC if the Tribunal were to decide whether Claimant was a Finnish national in 2000, because
the principle of legitimate expectations existed then like it does today.'*! Claimant contends
that the 2003 Nationality Act was not a central consideration in the SAC’s analysis. Claimant
maintains that the SAC Judgment is not unduly influenced by considerations of fairness and
morality, or by sympathy for Claimant.'*? Claimant argues that Respondent’s expert, Professor
Scheinin’s testimony must be rejected because his argument that legitimate expectations did not

exist in Finnish law before 2004 is wrong.!**

Second, Claimant states that the Tribunal need not bear in mind the decisions of the FIS and the

Helsinki Administrative Court. Claimant notes that these prior decisions were heavily criticised

by the SAC and there is no basis to conclude as Respondent does that the earlier decisions were
substantively correct.'** Claimant points out that the SAC Judgment annuls as a matter of
Finnish law the decisions of the Helsinki Administrative Court and the FIS, which calls into
question Respondent’s reliance on the reasoning of these lower courts.'** The SAC noted that
there has been an “error of authority” because the FIS had failed to provide the necessary
reasoning for its decision and failed to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the
reinstatement of Claimant’s Egyptian nationality.'** The SAC does not state as Respondent
alleges that Claimant lost his Finnish nationality pursuant to Section 8 of the 1968 Nationality
Act.'8” Claimant states that Respondent contradicts itself by arguing on the one hand that the
SAC Judgment supports its position on the law, and on the other hand that the SAC Judgment
did not rule on Claimant’s nationality between 1997 and 2015.'** Claimant points out that the
SAC also criticizes the FIS’ decision to initiate proceedings against Mr Bahgat upon the referral

of a request from Egypt. '*°

Third, Claimant contends that the contextual approach used by the SAC, which is based on the

Finnish law principle of the protection of legitimate expectations!’ and compatibility with

fundamental rights under the Finnish constitution, is neither novel nor contradictory to the
SAC’s prior case law. The SAC has adopted the contextual approach in prior cases,'*! and this
approach was adopted by Claimant’s experts in this arbitration as well as in Claimant’s
submissions to the SAC.'*? Furthermore, Claimant clarifies that the SAC Judgment is not
contrary to the rulings in the cases concerning Mrs B and Mrs C.'°3 The facts of the present
arbitration can be distinguished from Mrs B and Mrs C'™* because Mr Bahgat was explicitly
granted Finnish nationality by the President of Finland on the basis that Mr Bahgat would

remain a dual national.'*> Claimant notes that the decision in Mrs B’s case was not published

and had become moot.!°°

Claimant contends that, even if correct, it was irrelevant to the SAC Judgment whether
Claimant informed the FIS of the reinstatement of his Egyptian nationality.'°’ It is Claimant’s
view that even if the Finnish authorities did not know until 2012 that Egypt had reinstated the
Claimant’s Egyptian nationality, this is irrelevant to his Finnish nationality because of the
consistent practice of Finnish authorities of recognizing Mr Bahgat as a Finnish national and
because there was no obligation upon Mr Bahgat to inform Finnish authorities that he re-
acquired Egyptian nationality.'°* Claimant notes that in any event, Finnish authorities continued
to state that Mr Bahgat was registered in their databases even though he informed them about
the reinstatement of his Egyptian nationality in 1997.!*° He notes that the Finnish Embassy was.
made aware of Mr Bahgat’s Egyptian nationality at various points in time and Mr Bahgat
cannot be penalized for the Finnish Embassy’s failure to communicate this information to the
relevant authorities.” Claimant maintains that, in any event, the SAC was fully aware of all the
facts associated with Claimant’s acquisition of Egyptian citizenship and still held that he had
not lost his Finnish nationality.?°'

Fourth, Claimant argues that it is absurd for Respondent to suggest that the SAC Judgment was
designed to allow Claimant to bring this arbitration.” Claimant states that this argument is
unsupported and surprising given that it was Egypt that prompted the FIS to investigate
Claimant’s nationality.?°°

Fifth, Claimant notes that Respondent is speculating when it suggests that the SAC Judgment
was influenced by the case of Ms A. This allegation, according to Claimant, is unsupported by

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

At the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Claimant concluded that the record shows that Finland
consistently treated Claimant as a Finnish national since 5 February 1971. Claimant notes that
express declarations and admissions by diplomatic representatives concerning an individual’s
nationality might result in estoppel.?° Claimant particularly relies on the 1971 Presidential
Decree, the Claimant’s Finnish passports, certifications by the Finnish Embassy in Cairo
confirming Mr Bahgat’s Finnish nationality in 1982, and the confirmation by the Finnish
Immigration Office of Mr Bahgat’s Finnish nationality in March 2000.7 Claimant notes that at
the outset, Mr Reda confirmed at the time of the reinstatement of Claimant’s Egyptian
nationality that Claimant would retain his Finnish nationality.” Claimant frequently visited the
Finnish Embassy in Cairo, which extended the validity of his Finnish passports despite being
aware of the fact that Claimant had regained Egyptian nationality in 1997.7°* Claimant submits

209

that both Finnish and Egyptian authorities were well aware of his dual nationality,” and notes

that he personally informed the Finnish Embassy in Cairo of his re-acquired Egyptian
nationality and called the Finnish Population Register to confirm his dual nationality.?!°
Claimant points out that the restoration of his Egyptian nationality was published in the Official
Gazette, which was distributed including to the Finnish Embassy in Cairo.7!! According to
Claimant, the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs was notified of his dual nationality by the
Directorate of Immigration around 15 March 2000,7!” and Respondent acknowledged this in a
letter to the Finnish Embassy in Cairo dated 21 October 2002.73 The Finnish Ministry of
Foreign Affairs on 15 March 2000 advised as follows:

The Nationalities Unit of Immigration Office has informed that:

Mr Bahgat obtained his Finnish citizenship on the 12" of February 1971 and did not lose
his Egyptian nationality, so he is both an Egyptian and a Finnish national.?!*

Moreover, the Finnish Foreign Ministry instructed the Finnish Embassy in Cairo that “since

Mr Bahgat is also a Finnish citizen, please [. . .] try to find out whether he would possibly want

continued to enquire after Mr Bahgat from Mr Bahgat’s arrest at least until 24 June 2002.?!¢

Claimant further notes that in diplomatic correspondence in 2002, the Egyptian Ministry of

Foreign Affairs acknowledged that:

After examining the case it was found out that the correct name of the above mentioned is
Mohamed Abdel Rauf Bahgat Aydoush ([. . .] He has acquired the Finnish citizenship in
addition to the Egyptian nationality).?!7

Claimant states that he was registered as Finnish resident, travelled regularly to Finland, and
owned property and paid taxes in Finland. Claimant points out that the Finnish Population
Register and Finnish Commercial Register confirmed that he was registered as having both
Egyptian and Finnish nationality.?'* Claimant also mentions that on 3 November 2003, the
Finnish Embassy in Cairo issued him a Finnish identity card and, approximately two weeks

later, a Finnish passport.?!? He holds that these documents commonly serve as proof of Finnish

nationality and can only be issued to Finnish nationals.?”°

Claimant submits that the SAC Judgment is not surprising as it was delivered in the background
of this record.?7! Moreover, Claimant points out that Respondent’s expert Professor Scheinin
has conceded that possession of a passport creates a presumption of citizenship.””? Claimant
stated that Professor Scheinin has not responded to these determinations of Claimant’s Finnish
nationality in his reports.”’ In the background of the documents cited above, Claimant contests

his renunciation of Egyptian nationality in 1980 and the restoration of his Egyptian nationality
in 1997.4

Tribunal’s Analysis

It is well-established that as a matter of international law, it is the law of the state whose
nationality is claimed that will govern whether an individual is a national of that state. The
International Commission in the Flegenheimer case referred to the “unquestionable principle of
international law according to which every State is sovereign in establishing the legal
conditions which must be fulfilled by an individual in order that he may be considered to be

vested with its nationality.””°

This principle is reflected in both BITs underlying the present arbitration. The 1980 BIT seeks
to “maintain fair and equitable treatment of investments of nationals and companies of one
Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State”.??° The term “national” is
defined under the 1980 BIT as “[iJn respect of Finland, an individual who is a citizen of Finland
according to Finnish law”; and “[i]n respect of Egypt, an individual who is a citizen of Egypt
according to Egyptian law.”??7 The Preamble of the 2004 BIT recognizes the “need to protect
investments of the investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting
Party on a non-discriminatory basis”.?** Article 1 of the 2004 BIT provides”?

3. The term “investor” means, for either Contracting Party, the following subjects who

invest in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the laws of the

latter Contracting Party and the provisions of this Agreement: (a) any natural person who is
a national of either C: Party in with its laws;

The Tribunal recalls the statement of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the
Serbian Loans Case that “[f]or the Court itself to undertake its own construction of municipal

law, leaving on one side existing judicial decisions, with the ensuing danger of contradicting

Exhibit C-0015 (Claimant argues that these contain copies of his Finnish passports and Egyptian work
permits which indicate that Finland was aware that Mr Bahgat had renounced Egyptian nationality).
Claimant, in response to questions raised by the Tribunal, notes that under the BITs, claims can be
brought by dual Finnish-Egyptian nationals as there is no prohibition against this in the BITs.
(Jurisdiction Hearing, Day 2, p. 272:4-23). Claimant states that the only exception to this rule is where
the claimant has engaged in an abuse of rights using a “flag of convenience”. This is not the case with
Claimant. Claimant maintains that any questions on the admissibility of claims of dual nationals was
dismissed in Procedural Order No. 5. (Jurisdiction Hearing, Day 2, pp. 273:15-274:23)

the construction which has been placed on such law by the highest national tribunal . . . would
not be in conformity with the task for which the Court has been established . . . .”° The
Tribunal notes that the SAC, Finland’s highest administrative court, has made a clear
determination regarding the nationality of Claimant in the SAC Judgment. The SAC Judgment
holds that

The [SAC] determines that [Claimant], when the [FIS] made its decision under appeal, has
had to be considered in Finland as an Egyptian, as well as Finnish citizen. [Claimant’s]
citizenship status as a Finnish citizen has not changed from the time of receiving Finnish
citizenship in 1971, up to the decision of the [FIS].7°!

Therefore, a determination of Claimant’s Finnish nationality pursuant to Finnish law has
already been made by the highest administrative court in Finland. There are very limited
circumstances under which a determination of this nature should be questioned by an arbitral
tribunal. These circumstances are set out in Soufraki v. UAE, a case that has been discussed

extensively by both Parties.

Soufraki v. UAE concerned a dispute about a concession agreement for the Al Hamriya port.
The claimant allegedly signed these contracts as a Canadian citizen. Later, claiming Italian
nationality, he brought proceedings for breach of the Italy-UAE investment treaty. The UAE
objected to the tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that Mr Soufraki had lost his Italian
nationality around 1991 upon becoming a national of Canada.?*” Mr Soufraki submitted that he
never intended to relinquish his Italian nationality when he took up residence in Canada.?*?
Mr Soufraki relied on, as conclusive evidence of his nationality, certificates issued by Italian
authorities, copies of his Italian passports, and a letter from the Italian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.2* The UAE contended that certificates of nationality issued by Italy at best constituted

prima facie evidence of nationality and that the tribunal had the power to determine issues of

disputed nationality.2 The UAE submitted that the certificate of nationality issued by the
Italian Consulate General in Istanbul could not be relied on because it was issued by the Italian
authorities without knowledge of all the relevant facts, particularly that Mr Soufraki had
become a Canadian citizen in 1991.*° The Soufraki tribunal held that it was competent to
determine whether claimant was a national of Italy for the purposes of international law,?*”
noting that “[i]t is accepted in international law that nationality is within the domestic
jurisdiction of the State, which settles, by its own legislation, the rules relating to the

acquisition (and loss) of its nationality.”*** The tribunal further stated:

But it is no less accepted that when, in international arbitral or judicial proceedings, the
nationality of a person is challenged, the international tribunal is competent to pa:
upon that challenge. It will accord great weight to the nationality law of the State in
question and to the interpretation and application of that law by its authorities. But it
will in the end decide for itself whether, on the facts and law before it, the person
whose nationality is at le was or was not a national of the State in question and
when, and what follows from the finding.2°?

 

 

The Soufraki tribunal accepted certificates of nationality only as “prima facie” evidence of
claimant's Italian nationality. It found that there was no evidence that any Italian official who
issued the nationality documents in the case had undertaken any inquiry regarding whether
Mr Soufraki had established his residence in Italy.74? Accordingly, the tribunal accepted the
UAE’s jurisdictional objection. The tribunal made this decision despite the fact that

Mr Soufraki might not have been aware of the loss (and could not have informed the

authorities) of his Italian nationality.74!

Pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, Mr Soufraki submitted a request for annulment,
which was decided on 5 June 2007.” Recalling the principle of competence-competence,” the
Soufraki annulment committee held that a state does not have the last word on nationality when a
jurisdictional question is raised before an international tribunal concerning the interpretation of
national law.?“* The annulment committee opined that official government nationality documents
“constitute prima facie — not conclusive — evidence, and are subject to rebuttal.”*4> The power to
investigate nationality, even in the presence of such documents, extends not only to cases of
fraud, but also to cases of mistake.“ The annulment committee rejected the idea that a tribunal
should “accept a nationality based on a patently (or facially) erroneous application of national law
by the national official issuing a nationality certificate, for international purposes;”™*7 albeit

noting that it is only “in exceptional cases — like the case under scrutiny — that ICSID tribunals

have to review nationality documentation issued by state officials.”

In Micula v. Romania, in order to establish the claimants’ Swedish citizenship and the
tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae, the claimants submitted certificates of naturalization

Board had confirmed the Swedish citizenship of the Micula brothers in a letter.2° The Micula

tribunal held that “there exists a presumption in favour of the validity of a State’s conferment of
nationality. The threshold to overcome this presumption is high.”?>! The tribunal ruled that it
would only interfere in the decision of Swedish authorities if there were “reasons of real
importance to doubt the accuracy and thoroughness of the enquiry that was made by the
Swedish authorities at the time,”?>? “if there was convincing and decisive evidence that Viorel
Micula [the claimant]’s acquisition of Swedish nationality was fraudulent or at least resulted
from a material error.”?°? It was the responsibility of the respondent to “make such showing”,
not merely cast doubts on decisions taken by the domestic authorities.?>*

In summary, it is within the powers of and incumbent upon an international tribunal being a
judge of its own competence to examine independently issues of nationality for the purposes of
international law. However, at the same time, domestic determinations of nationality constitute
prima facie evidence that generates a presumption of nationality that must be rebutted.?>°
Neither Party has identified a case in the realm of investment arbitration in which the decision
of the highest court of a State on a question relevant to the arbitration has been disregarded by
an investment tribunal.**° Claimant has cited decisions of international courts that have deferred

to the determination of a State’s highest court.?57

The task of the Tribunal is to determine whether Claimant was a Finnish national according to
Finnish law from the time of the alleged breaches of the BITs occurred until the initiation of
these arbitral proceedings. The Tribunal finds that there is prima facie evidence that Claimant
was a Finnish national from the time of the 1971 Presidential Decree until the determination of

the FIS in 2013, as held in the SAC Judgment.

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Respondent contends that the absence of precedent should not bar a tribunal from departing
from the findings of a State’s highest court where there exist valid reasons for doing so. The
Tribunal agrees and might depart from the prima facie presumption of nationality set out above
if there were reasons to do so. The Tribunal notes that the arbitral jurisprudence set out above
has set a high bar for departing from the conclusions of a national authority on a claimant’s
nationality, a showing of fraud, or material error. Below, the Tribunal considers whether such

circumstances are made out with respect to the SAC Judgment.

As to the relevance of the holdings in Soufraki and Micula, the respective tribunals in those
cases were called on to identify national law by reviewing interpretations of executive decisions
interpreting and applying national law. Such executive decisions, in general, are not final but
open for judicial review under the laws of the State concerned. By contrast, in the instant case,
this Tribunal is called upon to identify national law by reference to the judgment of the highest
judicial branch whose decisions are final under Finnish law. In Brazilian Federal Loans, the

Permanent Court of International Justice ruled that:

Once the Court has arrived at the conclusion that it is necessary to apply the municipal law
of a particular country, there seems no doubt that it must seek to apply it as it would be
applied in that country. It would not be applying the municipal law of a country if it were to
apply it in a manner different from that in which that law would be applied in the country in
which it is in force.

It follows that the Court must pay the utmost regard to the decisions of the municipal courts
of a country, for it is with the aid of their jurisprudence that it will be enabled to decide
what are the rules which, in actual fact, are applied in the country the law of which is
recognized as applicable in a given case. If the Court were obliged to disregard the
decisions of municipal courts, the result would be that it might in certain circumstances
apply rules other than those actually applied; this would seem to be contrary to the whole
theory on which the application of municipal law is based.25*

 

A fortiori, when the decision of the national court is at the highest instance and, rather than
making a single decision, is clearly laying down the law for the domestic institutions subject to

its jurisdiction.

Respondent makes no allegation of fraud, but rather points to several alleged irregularities in
the SAC Judgment. First, Respondent suggests that the SAC Judgment departs from well-
established case law and is influenced by non-legal considerations. Second, Respondent argues
that the decisions of the FIS and Helsinki Administrative Court should be followed because the
SAC did not criti

 

 

ise those decisions. Third, Respondent also contends that the SAC Judgment

did not consider Finnish law and incorrectly employed a balancing approach engaging the
legitimate expectations of Claimant, even though Claimant had failed to inform Finnish
authorities of his Egyptian nationality. Fourth, Respondent contends that the decision of the
SAC was influenced by a desire to keep this arbitration alive. Fifth, Respondent alleges that the

SAC was unduly influenced by the decision in Ms A’s case.

The Tribunal finds that the SAC’s 20-page decision is a reasoned order that provides a cogent
interpretation of Finnish nationality law as it applies to Claimant’s circumstances. The SAC
Judgment refers to various provisions of the 2003 Nationality Act and 1968 Nationality Act,
and clearly determines that the requirements of Section 8 of the 1968 Nationality Act were not
met because Claimant had not taken on Egyptian nationality of his own free will.?° Therefore,
it cannot be said that the SAC Judgment is not based on Finnish law. The Tribunal accepts the
submission made by Claimant and Claimant’s experts that the principle of legitimate
expectations existed as a principle in Finnish law before 2004. There is nothing on the face of
the SAC Judgment or elsewhere in the record that supports an inference that the court was
unduly influenced by non-legal principles, any particular domestic proceedings, or by the

existence of this arbitration.

The Tribunal notes that the SAC Judgment is final and binding as a matter of Finnish law and
cannot be appealed. Moreover, the SAC is the proper court of appeal from the Helsinki
Administrative Court and the FIS. Having considered the applicable law and the history of the
case, the SAC has “repealed” the prior decisions of the Helsinki Administrative Court and
FIS.?° The Finnish population information system has been updated to reflect the findings of
the SAC Judgment.”*' Accordingly, the Tribunal sees no reason to rely upon the analysis of

Claimant’s nationality conducted by the FIS and Helsinki Administrative Court.

The Tribunal is of the view that Respondent's criticisms of the SAC Judgment do not identify
exceptional circumstances that rise to the level of fraud or material error and justify departing
from the SAC Judgment. The Tribunal notes that Respondent has cited to a number of cases in
support of its position that the findings of the SAC Judgment should not be followed and that
the conclusions of the SAC should be further examined by this Tribunal. However, the cases

relied upon by Respondent in which tribunals have further examined certificates of nationality

claimant’s nationality” or falsity of certificates of nationality.” Such allegations have not

been raised in the present arbitration.

Finally, the Tribunal would like to point out that it is not its mandate to act as a review court

 

s-a-vis the highest Finnish administrative court. This precludes the Tribunal from scrutinizing
the SAC Judgment from the point of view of Finnish national law, unless there have been

allegations such as fraud.

Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that it will follow the findings of the SAC Judgment
concerning Claimant’s Finnish nationality. The Tribunal determines that for the purposes of
this arbitration, Claimant was a Finnish national from 1971 until 2013 (as held in the SAC

Judgment).

2. If the Tribunal accepts the findings of the SAC Judgment, whether the SAC
Judgment establishes that Claimant had Finnish nationality at all relevant
times for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction ratione personae

Respondent’s Position

Respondent maintains that, even if the Tribunal were to accept the SAC Judgment, the
SAC Judgment does not establish that Claimant was a Finnish national at the time of the

alleged breaches of the BIT or at the time of the Notice of Arbitration.”

Respondent states that, although the BITs do not state when the investor must satisfy their
conditions ratione personae, it is well established that nationality requirements of the BIT must
be met both on the date of the consent to arbitration as well as at the time of the alleged
breaches of the treaty concerned.” Respondent notes that some tribunals have even endorsed a

“continuous nationality” requirement, which requires an investor to have continuous national

identity from the date of events giving rise to the claim until the date the claim is resolved.”
Respondent therefore maintains that Claimant must establish that he was a Finnish national at
the time he initiated this arbitration (i.e. 8 July 2011, when the Notice of Arbitration was filed),
as well as on the date of the alleged breaches of the BITs (i.e. 9 February 2000).”°”

First, Respondent argues that the SAC Judgment only determines Claimant’s Finnish
nationality as of 23 April 2013, but not between 1997 and 2013.* Respondent emphasises that
the SAC did not take a position on when the legitimate expectation of Claimant’s Finnish
nationality commenced.” Further, Respondent distinguishes ‘nationality’ under Finnish
nationality law, which describes whether a person is a Finnish national, from ‘nationality
status’, which refers to a decision of the FIS and which has a constitutive effect on a person’s
nationality.?” Respondent argues that the SAC Judgment’s dictum that refers to the nationality
status of the Claimant is to be understood as a judicial affirmation that the determination of
Claimant’s nationality status as a Finnish national by the FIS had not changed between 1997
and 2013 because the FIS was not called upon to re-determine Claimant’s nationality status in
the meantime. Moreover, the SAC did not make any determinations as to the nationality status
of the Claimant between September 1997 and April 2013.7”! Respondent contests Claimant’s
allegations that it does not refer to the dispositive parts of the SAC Judgment and maintains that

Respondent has extensively analysed the SAC’s reasoning.”””

Second, on the question of Claimant’s nationality between 1997 and 2013, Respondent states
that Claimant’s legitimate expectations as to his Finnish nationality could only have arisen in
2012 or 2013. Respondent notes that the SAC decided two similar cases to that of the
Claimant’s in 2012, both of which confirmed the automatic loss of Finnish nationality under the
1968 Nationality Act. In Mrs B’s case, she was considered a Finnish national only in 2011 after
her application for re-acquisition of Finnish nationality under the 2003 Nationality Act.
Respondent states that accordingly, Claimant could not invoke the doctrine of legitimate

expectations prior to 2012-2013 and thus could not have reacquired Finnish nationality by

operation of this principle earlier than 2012-2013.?% Alternatively, Respondent argues that the
earliest point at which Claimant’s legitimate expectation of Finnish nationality could have
arisen is in 2004, as the doctrine of legitimate expectations was only introduced in the Finnish
legal system by Section 6 of the Administrative Procedure Act, which came into force on
1 January 2004.7 The SAC could not have delivered a decision based on Claimant’s legitimate
expectations before 2004.7" Moreover, Respondent suggests that the 2003 Nationality Act
allowing for the re-acquisition of Finnish nationality only entered into force on 1 July 2003 and,
therefore, Claimant could not have had a legitimate expectation of Finnish nationality before its

re-acquisition was permitted by law.?°

Claimant's Position

Claimant agrees that, in order to bring this arbitration, he must have been a Finnish national on
the date of consent to arbitration and on the date of the breach of the 1980 and 2004 BITs.
Claimant notes that he was indeed a Finnish national from February 2000 (the earliest date of
Respondent’s breaches of the BITs) and on 3 November 2011 (when the Claimant filed his

Notice of Arbitration).?””

Claimant observes that it is common ground between the Parties that the 1980 and 2004 BITs
determine who is a ‘national’ or ‘investor’ based on the law of the relevant contracting Party.
Therefore, Mr Bahgat’s Finnish nationality is a matter of Finnish law.?* Claimant contends that
in plain language, the SAC clearly and unambiguously determined that Claimant was in fact a

Finnish national between 1997 and 2013.2” Claimant submits that:

Mr Bahgat was a Finnish citizen upon being granted Finnish citizenship by presidential
decree in 1971; he continued to be a Finnish citizen when he formally renounced Egyptian
nationality in 1980; he continued to be a Finnish citizen when Egypt purportedly reinstated
his Egyptian nationality in 1997; and he continued to be a Finnish citizen in April 2013.7”

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Claimant contests Respondent’s allegations that the SAC Judgment provides no view on
whether Claimant was a Finnish national between 1997 and 2013.

First, Claimant contends that the Directorate of Immigration (the predecessor of the FIS)
confirmed Mr Bahgat’s Finnish nationality in March 2000.”*! Claimant submits that a Finnish

court in 2010 would likely have arrived at the same conclusion.?*?

Second, Claimant argues that Respondent’s distinction between ‘nationality’ and ‘nationality

 

   

status’ is artificial; there cannot be nationality without nationality status and vice versa.
Claimant submits that in making this argument, Respondent’s expert does not engage seriously
with the dispositive portions of the SAC Judgment.” Claimant objects to Respondent’ s expert
referring to the operative part of the SAC Judgment as “dicta”: dicta does not exist as a concept

in Finnish law and in any event, the operative part of the decision would not constitute dicta.”°>

Third, Claimant suggests that if the Tribunal adopts Respondent’s reading of the SAC Judgment,
the Tribunal would have to speculate as to what a Finnish court seized with the question of Mr
Bahgat’s nationality at the date of the breach of the BITs may have decided based on
Mr Bahgat’s legitimate expectations at that time.”*° This would leave the judgment open to

endless challenges. Therefore, Respondent’s reading of the SAC Judgment cannot be adopted.

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Parties agree that in order for Claimant to bring a claim under the BITs, he must have been
a Finnish national at the time of the alleged violation of the BITs in 2000 as well as in 2011

when the Notice of Arbitration was filed.

The Tribunal has determined in paragraph 174 above that it will follow the determination of the
SAC concerning Claimant’s nationality. The operative portion of the SAC Judgment in
Claimant’s translation states that “Claimant’s citizenship status as a Finnish citizen has not
changed from the time of receiving Finnish citizenship in 1971, up to the decision of the

{FIS]”.°87 The same section of the SAC Judgment in Respondent’s translation reads:

“[Claimant’s] nationality status as a Finnish citizen has not changed since he obtained Finnish
citizenship in 1971 by the time of the decision of the [FIS].”?** The FIS decided on 23 April

2013 that Claimant was an Egyptian national.

The Tribunal considers that the SAC Judgment is clear that Claimant was a Finnish national
from 1971 until 2013 when the FIS made its determination regarding Claimant’s nationality.
Under Finnish law, as authoritatively held and applied by the SAC, Claimant was a Finnish
national from the time that the alleged violations of the BITs occurred up to the moment that

the Notice of Arbitration was filed.

3. Whether Claimant automatically lost his Finnish nationality by operation of
Finnish Law

Respondent’s Position

Respondent contends that Claimant automatically lost his Finnish nationality under Finnish law
on acquiring Egyptian nationality in 1997. Finnish law did not permit multiple nationality.
Therefore, he was not a Finnish national or a Finnish-Egyptian dual national at the relevant

times and cannot claim investment protection under the BITs.

Respondent explains that the 1968 Nationality Act took a hostile attitude towards multiple
nationalities.“ For one, a foreigner acquiring Finnish nationality was required to renounce
previous nationalities.” Second, Section 8 of the 1968 Nationality Act provided that a Finnish
national who acquired a foreign nationality would ipso jure lose his or her Finnish nationality
upon receipt of the foreign nationality.”! Respondent asserts that Section 8 of the 1968
Nationality Act can only be translated as: “A person shall lose his Finnish citizenship: . . . if he
acquires the citizenship of another country by application or declaration, or if he has consented
to it of his own free will . . . .”?? Respondent states that Claimant’s argument, that loss of
Finnish nationality under Section 8 of the 1968 Nationality Act was only conditional and not
absolute, is based on a translation of Section 8 which is incorrect.””> Respondent emphasises

that its translation of Section 8 was acquired from an authorised English-Finnish translator,?*

whilst Claimant’s translation was acquired from a Dutch translation agency.”? Respondent
draws further support from a translation of the legislation that is available on the website of the

French Ministry of Culture, which was not prepared for the purposes of this arbitration.?°°

Although Respondent acknowledges that the 1968 Nationality Act admitted multiple
nationalities under certain limited circumstances, it submits that these circumstances are absent
from Claimant’s case.’ Respondent argues that the 1971 Presidential Decree does not create
an exception to the application of the Nationality Act as Claimant contends, but that the 1971
Presidential Decree has to “apply and defer to the law.”?°

Respondent states that Finnish nationality law began permitting multiple nationalities in 2003
when the 2003 Nationality Act replaced the 1968 Nationality Act. The 2003 Nationality Act
afforded persons that lost their Finnish nationality pursuant to Section 8 of the 1968 Nationality
Act the possibility of reacquiring Finnish nationality by way of a simple declaration.*”°

Section 60 of the 2003 Nationality Act provided in relevant part:

Section 60 (Declaration for the acquisition of citizenship to be made within a fixed period
of time)

(1) A former Finnish citizen will acquire Finnish citizenship by declaration if he or she has
lost Finnish citizenship before the entry into force of this Act under:

3) section 8 of the Nationality Act (401/1968);

The declaration procedure under Section 60 of the 2003 Nationality Act was initially limited in
time until 2008, but after 2011 it became permanently available.*' Claimant could have
theoretically held dual nationality by making use of the declaration procedure between 2003

and 2008 and any time after 2011. However, Respondent submits that Claimant did not avail

himself of such option.*”?

nationality under Section 8 takes place by operation of law and neither required an act of

303 Therefore,

renunciation by the individual concerned nor a decision by Finnish authorities.
Finnish authorities were not necessarily always aware when a Finnish national had lost Finnish
nationality.** Respondent relies on the case of Mrs B, a Finnish national who had acquired
British nationality in 1974 but was able to renew her Finnish passport because her acquisition
of British nationality was not noted by the Finnish authorities. In 2009, Finnish authorities
became aware that Mrs B had acquired British nationality. The Finnish authorities decided that
Mrs B lost her Finnish nationality in 1974, a view that was upheld by the SAC.*°

Separate from Section 8, Respondent contends that Section 9 of the 1968 Nationality Act
allows for an individual to be released from Finnish nationality by application.*°° Respondent
takes the view that the existence of Section 9 did not imply that Finnish nationality could not be
lost automatically on the basis of Section 8.*°7 Because Claimant satisfied the conditions of
Section 8, no separate application under Section 9 was required.*’* Respondent suggests that
Claimant confused separate concepts of Finnish nationality law: loss of nationality and release
from nationality, by alleging that a separate application under Section 9 of the 1968 Nationality
Act was required in order for a Finnish national to lose nationality.*” Respondent maintains
that Section 9 exists because some nations require that the applicant withdraw his or her current
nationality as a precondition to granting nationality.*!°

Respondent submits that by acquiring Egyptian nationality on 28 September 1997, Claimant
lost his Finnish nationality by operation of Section 8 of the 1968 Nationality Act.*!! On the
basis that Finnish nationality law did not allow for dual nationality at the time that Claimant
acquired Egyptian nationality, it was legally impossible for Claimant to have been a Finnish

national as well as an Egyptian national from 1997 onwards.

Respondent argues that it is undisputed that Claimant himself applied for the reacquisition of

his Egyptian nationality on 1 September 19973! and disputes any suggestion that Claimant was.

coerced into regaining his Egyptian nationality.*!’ Respondent points out that this has been

confirmed by the Helsinki Administrative Court and the SAC did not find otherwise.*"*

In addition, Respondent argues that an act of coercion would presuppose that Claimant was put
under duress. Article 127 of the Egyptian Civil Code describes duress as a situation in which
“the person who invokes it has been led to believe, in view of the circumstances, that a serious
and imminent danger to life, limb, honour or property threatened him or others.”3'5 In
Respondent’s submission, Claimant did not face such a situation of severe threat. He rather
followed all the administrative steps for the acquisition of his Egyptian nationality voluntarily,
inter alia, submitting his father’s as well as his own birth certificate to the Egyptian authorities.
Respondent contends that Claimant’s explanation of the 1 September 1997 Meeting only shows
that Claimant chose to take on Egyptian nationality based on Mr Reda’s proposals: “this is not
duress, this is not enough to be duress.”*!° Respondent notes that no case of economic duress
can be made out because Claimant had invested USD 25,000 in the Project, which was not a
significant sum for a businessman of his stature.*!’ Respondent also points out that Claimant
could have challenged any illegitimate behaviour on the part of the Minister of Industry after
his application to reacquire Egyptian nationality, but he refrained from doing so.*'* Respondent
alleges that Claimant’s description of the events during the 1 September 1997 Meeting have
evolved to fit the requirements of Article 127 of the Egyptian Civil Code;*!? observing that
several of Mr Reda’s alleged threats were not mentioned in Claimant’s first witness
statement.*”? Moreover, Respondent contends that the reacquisition of Claimant’s Egyptian
nationality was not a prerequisite for awarding the bid to ADEMCO and that Claimant could
have renounced his Egyptian nationality after the Project was awarded to ADEMCO, but he did
not do so.*! To the contrary, Claimant continued to reside and work in Egypt and benefit from

his Egyptian nationality.*??

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

According to Respondent, any allegation of coercion by Claimant is disproved by the fact that
Claimant made repeated use of his Egyptian nationality after 1997.*7* Respondent mentions, for
example, that Claimant used his Egyptian passport for travel purposes; that Claimant applied
for the modification of his daughters’ birth certificates to reflect they had reacquired Egyptian
nationality; and that Claimant was referred to as an Egyptian national in certain articles
published by the Middle East Economic Digest.** According to Respondent, Claimant even
requested the issuance of an Egyptian passport to be valid between 13 October 2004 and
12 October 2011.*?° Further, Respondent notes that although Claimant depicts Egypt as being a
totalitarian regime, Claimant’s witness statements indicate that he settled there, built a
successful business, family life and social circle there,*?° and was reportedly content, for

business purposes, to “look Egyptian in Egypt”.*””

Respondent reiterates that since 1997, Claimant never mentioned that duress was inflicted on
him, not even during his criminal prosecution or imprisonment in Egypt, and that Claimant
even relied on his Egyptian nationality during the said criminal proceedings.*** Consequently,
Respondent argues that Claimant “waived any right to argue he was coerced to regain his
Egyptian nationality’ by his own subsequent conduct.*” In any event, according to
Respondent’s Egyptian law expert, there is a limitation period on obtaining the annulment of an
act contracted under duress, of three years from the time when the duress ceased.**° Even
assuming that Claimant felt he was under duress as late as June 2005 when he returned to

Finland, Claimant’s objection is out of time.**!

Respondent contends that the alleged procedural defects in Claimant’s application to restore
Egyptian nationality do not give Claimant standing to request annulment of the application
because, in order to apply for annulment of an administrative action, an applicant must show

that the challenged decision harms his or her personal interests. Respondent states that Claimant

has not established such harm.*”

Respondent submits that there is no legal basis for Claimant to argue that he cannot be “in a
worse position than the one in which he would be if he had not renounced his Egyptian
nationality in 1980 . . . °° Claimant freely renounced his Egyptian nationality in 1980 and
was not forced to restore his Egyptian nationality in 1997. This does not provide Claimant a

legitimate expectation of Finnish nationality.*™

Respondent further argues that Claimant’s experts are unreliable and under-qualified, stating
that neither Ms Paavola nor Mr Backstrom are recognised in the field of Finnish nationality law
or international law. Respondent suggests that Ms Paavola’s primary field of research is not
relevant to this arbitration and that Mr Backstrom, having known Mr Bahgat since the 1980s,
might have been retained because of personal affiliations.*** Further, Respondent notes that
Claimant’s experts do not refer to sources of Finnish nationality law outside the Nationality Act

and the Nationality Decree.**°

Claimant's Position

Citing the SAC Judgment, Claimant states that it was possible for him to have retained his
Finnish nationality upon acquisition of Egyptian nationality in September 1997.*37 Independent
of the SAC Judgment, based on Finnish law, Claimant states that he retained his Finnish
nationality after September 1997 because (i) the 1968/1984 Nationality Act did not provide for
the automatic loss of Finnish nationality upon the acquisition of another nationality and
Mr Bahgat’s case was a permitted exception to any prohibition on dual nationality;*** and

(ii) the specific requirements of Section 8 were not made out in Claimant’s case.

Claimant contends that Section 8 of the 1968 Nationality Act may be translated as “[a] person
can lose his Finnish citizenship” when such person “acquires the citizenship of a foreign
country either by application or after giving his/her actual consent to it . . . .”**? Moreover,

Claimant suggests that any loss of Finnish nationality would have to be recognised by a valid

official act of Finland. According to Claimant’s expert Mr Ojanen,*° Section 8 of the 1968
Nationality Act does not stipulate an automatic loss of Claimant’s Finnish nationality because
the acquisition of the foreign nationality must occur voluntarily and the competent Finnish
authorities are under an obligation to establish that the individual consented to the acquisition
of foreign nationality.*"! Further, Mr Ojanen notes that Section 8 of the 1968 Nationality Act
has to be read together with Section 9 of the 1968 Nationality Act, which provides a system by
which a Finnish dual or multiple national can be released from his or her Finnish nationality.*“7
Claimant relies on the text of Section 9 which refers to a Finnish national being “released from
his Finnish nationality,” text that would be rendered redundant if Finish authorities were not
required to recognise the loss of an individual’s Finnish nationality.*? Therefore, Section 8 of

the 1968 Finnish Nationality Act did not stipulate the automatic loss of Finnish nationality.

Moreover, Claimant notes that exceptional cases of dual nationality were de facto accepted in
Finland before 2003.*4 The 1971 Presidential Decree that granted Claimant Finnish nationality
expressly recognised his continuing Egyptian nationality and did not make the grant of Finnish
nationality conditional upon Mr Bahgat’s renunciation of Egyptian nationality: “this decree
and cover note confirm that [Claimant] was granted Finnish nationality in 1971 with the right to
retain his Egyptian nationality; in other words as a dual national.”*“° According to Claimant and
his experts, this constituted an exception to the restrictive approach to multiple nationality taken

by the 1968 Nationality Act.”

Claimant’s expert, Professor Aarnio, notes that Sections 8 and 9 of the 1968 Nationality Act are

at best legally ambiguous regarding loss of nationality and, therefore, they cannot be read as

permitting a conclusion as absolute as that a Finnish citizen would automatically lose Finnish
citizenship upon application for foreign citizenship.“* Claimant relies on a decision of the
Finnish Parliamentary Ombudsman which states that competent Finnish authorities must clarify
the circumstances of the acquisition of nationality of another country and that, in unclear
circumstances, Finnish authorities should decide the matter to the advantage of the
individual.“ Claimant argues that Respondent’s expert, Professor Scheinin contradicts himself
on whether Finnish law allowed dual nationality, stating first that the 1968 Nationality Act
rejected dual nationality and later that it allowed for dual nationality in limited
circumstances.**°

In any event, Claimant argues that Section 8 of the 1968/1985 Finnish Nationality Act did not
apply to him because (i) in 1997, he did not ‘acquire’ Egyptian nationality as required by
Section 8; and (ii) Mr Bahgat did not validly consent to the reinstatement of his Egyptian

nationality.**!

Claimant states that he did not “‘acquire’ or ‘consent’ to Egyptian nationality as matter of

Egyptian law in 1997, but rather ‘reinstated’ that nationality thereby returning to the status quo
ante of his dual nationality” that existed between 1971 and 1980.*°? Egyptian law distinguishes
between acquisition and restoration of Egyptian nationality. The concept of restoration is alien
to Finnish law and does not amount to an acquisition of nationality for the purposes of Section

8, which states that “[a] person loses Finnish nationality . . . if he acquires the nationality of a

99353

foreign country . . Claimant states that Finnish authorities accordingly regarded

Mr Bahgat as a dual national, irrespective of whether he had lost or regained that status since
1971, and Mr Bahgat also continued to confirm his Finnish nationality after 1997.** Claimant
suggests that Respondent’s assertion that Claimant automatically lost his Finnish nationality on

28 September 1997 when Egypt reinstated Claimant’s nationality would effectively penalise

Claimant for having renounced his Egyptian nationality in 1980. It cannot be correct that if
Claimant had never renounced and regained his Egyptian nationality, he would be Finnish for

the purposes of the BIT.*°

Second, for Section 8 to operate, Claimant submits that it is critical to determine whether
Claimant made an application seeking Egyptian nationality and whether such application was

made voluntarily. Claimant states that these conditions were not met.%°

First and foremost, Claimant contends that Egyptian nationality was bestowed on him as a
result of Mr Reda coercing him into completing the application form.**’ The alleged coercion
exerted on Claimant has already been set out in paragraphs 97-101 above. As a result of the
above, Claimant argues that his acceptance of the Egyptian nationality should be regarded as
null and of no effect.** Claimant states that the evidence adduced by the Respondent to suggest
that Egyptian government has never coerced citizenship upon anyone is self-serving and does

nothing to specifically rebut Mr Bahgat and Mr El Ashri’s testimony.**°

In response to Respondent’s argument that Claimant’s application for restoration was made
after Claimant’s project was selected and therefore that there was no imminent danger, one of
Claimant’s experts states that Claimant had sufficient basis to believe that he was under serious

and imminent danger and that he would have suffered severe adverse consequences threatening
his freedom, dignity, and wealth if he decided to renounce his Egyptian nationality.*°°
Similarly, Claimant contends that a subsequent challenge of any illegitimate behaviour on the

part of the Minister of Industry would likely have led to Claimant’s unjustified

imprisonment.**!

Second, Claimant submits that Mr Reda forced Egyptian citizenship on him even though there

was no basis under Egyptian law to require Claimant to hold Egyptian nationality in order to

make his investment.*

30 November 2017

Third, Claimant argues that Mr Bahgat’s nationality was restored only to ensure that the
Government could interfere in the Project. Accordingly, Mr Reda had no objection to
Mr Bahgat retaining his dual nationality. Claimant contends that he continued to use his Finnish

363

nationality to travel for the purposes of the Project.*® Further to Respondent’s allegation that

Claimant used his Egyptian passport on a number of occasions after 1997 while travelling,
Claimant explains that he had to because of the continuing duress exerted by Respondent.*
Claimant contends that Respondent had stopped issuing residence visas on his Finnish passport.
Claimant believes that, if he had tried to leave Egypt with his Finnish passport, he would have
run the risk of the airport police detaining him as an over stayer or illegal immigrant. Therefore,
he claims to have had no other option but to use his Egyptian passport for travelling abroad. He
emphasises, however, that once he was out of Egypt he used to travel on his Finnish
passport.*®

Fourth, Claimant states that Decision Number 10815/1997 must be deemed null and void under
Egyptian law because there were several formal defects in the application handed to the
Minister of Industry on 1 September 1997. On the one hand, the application lacked certain
documents, such as criminal records that are in Claimant’s view mandatory under Egyptian law

366

for applying to restore Egyptian nationality.*° Claimant confirms that he did not submit these

at a later date.*”” On the other hand, Claimant asserts that the application was processed by the

368

Minister of Industry who was not authorised to do so under Egyptian law,*™ that his application

was not personally signed before a competent authority, and was not signed by PENA.*”°
Claimant’s expert states that it was unprecedented for an application seeking restoration of
Egyptian nationality to be submitted (i) to a person unauthorised to receive such an application;
and (ii) without enclosing mandatory supporting documentation.*”! Claimant further submits
that “[t]he speed with which the Egyptian Minister of Industries and the Egyptian Ministry of
Interior worked together to facilitate the [issuance of Decision Number 10815/1997 within less
than four weeks after the receipt of the application], and the procedural irregularities, show that

this was by no means a normal application for such a restoration, and provide further evidence

in support of Claimant’s case on coercion.”*”” Most crucially, Claimant states that the coercion
exercised against him in the reinstatement of his Egyptian nationality constitutes “stress of
justifiable fears” and, therefore, meets the test for duress under Section 127 of the Egyptian

Civil Code.*7

Claimant invites the Tribunal to undertake its own assessment regarding the validity of the
restoration of his Egyptian nationality in 1997, in particular whether the application was
voluntary, as the Tribunal has been presented with a prima facie case for Claimant’s Egyptian
nationality, which is fraught with errors constituting extraordinary circumstances, warranting
review.*” Claimant emphasises that the Pey Casado tribunal found that an arbitral tribunal can
question a State’s recognition of a claimant’s nationality if it is alleged that the nationality was
involuntarily imposed.*” At the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Claimant pointed out that it would be
“bizarre” for the Tribunal to find that Claimant should be denied Finnish nationality because
this would leave the Claimant “in a worse position than had he never revoked [his Egyptian
nationality in 1980] in the first place.”*”° Claimant notes that had he not renounced Egyptian
nationality in 1980, he would be a dual national as permitted in the 1971 Presidential Decree.
377 Tn response to Respondent’s allegations that there are inconsistencies in Claimant’s witness
statements regarding whether he had kept the Finnish authorities informed of his Egyptian
nationality, Claimant submits that “the Finnish authorities were kept fully apprised of the
situation as regards Mr Bahgat’s Egyptian nationality.”>”* Claimant points out that Respondent

chose not to cross-examine Mr Bahgat during the Hearing on Jurisdiction.*”

Tribunal’s Analysis
a)  Claimant’s Finnish Nationality

First, the Tribunal must determine the existence of Claimant’s Finnish nationality at the time of

contract is voidable as a result of duress, if one of the parties has contracted under the stress of justifiable
fear unlawfully instilled in him by the other party. Fear is deemed to be justified when the party who
invokes it has been led to believe, based on the circumstances, that serious and imminent danger
threatens his or others life, body, dignity, or property.”

the alleged breaches of the BITs in the 2000s as well as in 2011 when the Notice of Arbitration

was filed. The record indicates that Claimant was born in Egypt**°

and the Parties agree that he
was born an Egyptian national.**' He was granted Finnish nationality in 1971 by way of the
1971 Presidential Decree.** Claimant renounced his Egyptian nationality in 1980.** In 1997,
Claimant allegedly reacquired Egyptian nationality. Respondent maintains that Claimant was
not a Finnish national at the relevant times and therefore cannot bring this arbitration.
According to Respondent, on the basis of the applicable Finnish law, particularly Sections 8
and 9 of the 1968 Nationality Law, Claimant necessarily lost his Finnish nationality upon
acquiring Egyptian nationality in 1997. Claimant considers that he was granted nationality by
the 1971 Presidential Decree, which constituted an exception to any restrictive approach to
multiple nationality that might be taken under prevailing Finnish nationality legislation. In any
case, Claimant argues that the 1968 Nationality Act does not stipulate an automatic loss of
Finnish nationality upon the acquisition of another nationality; Finnish authorities are under an
obligation to establish that the other nationality was voluntarily acquired by the individual in
question. The Tribunal recognises that the SAC has, having considered the applicable Finnish
law, held that Claimant was a dual Finnish-Egyptian national at the time that the FIS made its
decision regarding Claimant’s nationality in 2013. As discussed above in paragraph 174, the

Tribunal will defer to the views of the SAC on Claimant’s Finnish nationality.

The Parties have made submissions concerning the impact that Claimant’s potential dual
Egyptian-Finnish nationality might have on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae.
Therefore, the Tribunal considers below whether Claimant acquired Egyptian nationality in
1997 (and thus, if he was, in fact, a dual Egyptian-Finnish national), and whether there is a bar

on dual Egyptian-Finnish nationals bringing claims under the BITs.

b) — Claimant’s Egyptian Nationality

The Parties disagree on whether Claimant validly reacquired Egyptian nationality in 1997. The
Tribunal, in particular, takes note of the alleged procedural defects associated with Claimant’s
re-acquisition of Egyptian nationality in 1997. Claimant has submitted that: (i) Mr Reda, the
Minister of Industry, received Claimant’s nationality application although his office did not
have the power to do so; (ii) his application lacked required supporting documentation, such as
Extract from the Finnish Population Information System for M. Bahgat dated 18 November 2016,

his prior criminal records; (iii) his application was not signed before a competent legal authority
as required by Egyptian law; and (iv) his application was not signed by PENA as required by
Egyptian law.**4

Claimant’s expert Professor Aboulmagd states that “[t]he prime factor in determining the
proper reinstatement of nationality would depend on whether such reinstatement was made
following an absolute li with the licable laws and lations,” including whether
the application is made on a Ministry of Interior template application form and accompanied by
(i) evidence of acquisition of foreign nationality; (ii) a birth certificates; and (iii) criminal
records.*** He states that the governing laws did not permit any ministerial discretion to waive
the legal requirements to submit necessary documents.**° He also notes that the Minister of
Industry was not the competent authority to receive the application.**’ This factor, in
conjunction with the application not being signed in front of a PENA officer and lack of
supporting documents should have led to the rejection of the application for restoration.*** The
Tribunal notes that Respondent has not contested the procedural irregularities with the
application, which call into question the propriety of the restoration of Claimant’s Egyptian

nationality.

c) Applicable Rules Governing Dual Nationals’ Claims

Notwithstanding the observations set out above, the Tribunal considers that Claimant can bring
this arbitration even if his Egyptian nationality were validly acquired in 1997 and, thus, even if
he was a dual Finnish-Egyptian national from 1997 onwards. The criteria for determining an
investor’s nationality, for purposes of treaty claims such as the present, are supplied by the

investment agreements in question.

The Tribunal notes that some investment treaties prohibit individuals who hold the nationality
of both contracting parties from bringing claims under the treaty. For example, the Agreement
between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the
Promotion and Protection of Investments defines an investor in the case of Canada, as “any
natural person possessing the citizenship of Canada in accordance with its laws ... who makes

the investment in the territory of Venezuela and who does not possess the citizenship of

Venezuela.”**?

Significantly, neither of the BITs under which this arbitration has been brought contains a
comparable prohibition on claims by dual nationals. Article 1(3) of the 2004 BIT defines
“investor” as “any natural person who is a national of either Contracting Party in accordance
with its laws . . . .”>°° Article 1(2) of the 1980 BIT states that the term “national” means “[i]n
respect of Finland, an individual who is a citizen of Finland according to Finnish law .. . .”°°!
The plain text of the BITs only imposes the positive requirement that an individual claimant be
a national of the other contracting party, not the negative requirement that the individual

claimant is also not a national of the host state.

Whether a dual national is able to bring a claim under a treaty is also dependent on the legal
framework governing the arbitral forum, to which the Tribunal will now turn. For instance, the
ICSID framework contains clear directions in this respect. Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID

Convention states that a “National of another Contracting State . . . does not include any person
who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute . . . .”*°?

According to the commentary on the ICSID Convention:

The ineligibility of an investor who also po: 's the host State’s nationality applies
irrespective of which of the several nationalitie: the effective one. . . . This bar would
also apply if consent is based on a treaty. If an investor possesses the nationalities of both
States parties to a bilateral investment treaty (BIT), he or she may enjoy the benefits of the
BIT for other purposes. But the dual national would be disqualified from invoking the
ICSID clause in the BIT.**

 
  

In contrast to the ICSID Convention, the UNCITRAL Rules that govern this arbitration do not
contain any prohibition on claims being brought by dual nationals. Therefore, the determination
of Claimant’s nationality must be made solely in accordance with the 1980 BIT and 2004
BIT.*™ As the applicable BITs do not state that a Finnish national for the purposes of the
treaties cannot also be an Egyptian national, in order to establish jurisdiction ratione personae,
Claimant need only prove Finnish nationality.*°* Claimant’s Finnish nationality at relevant

points of time has been clearly established in the SAC Judgment which, as stated already

above, was not successfully challenged by the Respondent.

The position set out above (paragraph 224) finds support in existing arbitral jurisprudence. In
Serafin Garcia Armas and Karina Garcia Gruber v. Venezuela, a case brought under the Spain-
Venezuela BIT, where both claimants were dual-nationals of Spain and Venezuela, the
applicable investment treaty imposed only a positive requirement of nationality of one or the
other contracting state, but not the negative requirement that the individual not simultaneously
hold the nationality of the other contracting state.*°° The tribunal held that the latter
requirement cannot be read into the text of the investment treaty where there was no text to that
effect.*°’ Similarly, in the Pey Casado v. Chile arbitration under the Spain-Chile BIT that was
governed by ICSID Rules, the tribunal explained the difference between the requirements of
nationality provided for in the ICSID Convention and those provided for in the underlying BITs
in that case. The tribunal found that it was sufficient for the purposes of the applicable BIT for
it to be proven that the investor was a national of the other contracting party.** There is no
requirement for a tribunal to enter into the question of the effective nationality of an investor of
dual Spanish-Chilean nationality, as the applicable BIT did not require this and only required
that the investor be a national of the other contracting state.*” The tribunal took the view that a
requirement that dual nationals be prohibited from bringing claims cannot be read into the
text.“ Accordingly, Mr Pey Casado only had to demonstrate that he possessed Spanish
nationality at the time of accepting the jurisdiction of the tribunal in order to benefit from the

protections of the applicable BIT.*”'

This trend in decisions finds further support in a recent judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal
of 25 April 2017 (numéro d’ inscription au répertoire general 15/01040 in the case République

nationality is not a bar to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal ratione personae.*?

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it is sufficient for the establishment of this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction ratione personae that Claimant was a Finnish national at the relevant points in time,
and this has been established in the SAC Judgment. The Tribunal need not make an additional
determination that he was simultaneously not Egyptian at the relevant points in time. In the
following section, the Tribunal will establish whether considerations based upon general
principles of international law suggest the reconsideration of the result reached upon on the

basis of the applicable BITs.

d) Principles of International law Governing Dual Nationals’ Claims and
Procedural Considerations
Customary international law was once deemed to preclude a State’s espousal of its national’s
injury caused by another State if its national was also the national of the latter State. Article 4
of the 1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality

Laws43

states that “[a] State may not afford diplomatic protection to one of its nationals against
a State whose nationality such person also possesses.”““ This position, which was explicitly
concerned with diplomatic espousal has gradually given way to the principle, in international
tribunals, of effective nationality, whereby the exercise of jurisdiction over a dual national is

admissible if the dominant nationality of the individual is not that of the respondent State.

When the International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) dismissed Liechtenstein’s claim on behalf of
Mr Friedrich Nottebohm against Guatemala, it noted that “nationality is a legal bond having as
its basis a social fact of attachment, a genuine connection of existence, interests and sentiments,
together with the existence of reciprocal rights and duties;” and upheld a requirement for “real
and effective nationality . . . based on stronger factual ties between the person concerned and
one of the States whose nationality is involved.’“°> This was obiter dictum, as the Nottebohm

case did not concern a claim brought by an individual against his/her state of nationality. In

protection principle “based on the sovereign equality of States, which excludes diplomatic protection in

nationality is that of the claiming State”).

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Case A/18, by contrast, the Iran-US Claims Tribunal considered the admissibility of claims
against Iran brought by naturalized American citizens who were Iranian nationals by birth, and
found that it had jurisdiction over claims brought by dual Iranian-United States nationals where
the dominant and effective nationality during the relevant period was that of the United States.
The tribunal noted that Article 4 of the 1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to
the Conflict of Nationality Laws does not express an unambiguous, current rule: “Not only is [the
rule] more than 50 years old and found in a treaty to which only 20 States are parties, but great
changes have occurred since then in the concept of diplomatic protection, which concept has been
expanded.” The tribunal noted that while the principle of non-responsibility might apply to
diplomatic protection (where a State is asserting its own rights by espousing a case of a national),
it might not apply to a case where a private party has brought a claim against a State.*°°

The Tribunal cannot discern from relevant jurisprudence any clear, applicable general principle
of international law that would prohibit a dual national in his or her private capacity from

bringing a claim against a State of his or her nationality pursuant to an investment treaty.

Some academic writing indicates that where an underlying BIT does not clarify whether dual
nationals might bring claims, principles of international law on effective nationality might be
considered by a tribunal in order to determine its jurisdiction based on the dominant nationality
of the claimant-investor.“”” However, any developments in international law must yield to the
lex specialis of the investment treaty.*°* Therefore, an analysis of the applicable BITs, as set out
above, should be dispositive of the issue of whether a dual Egyptian-Finnish national may bring
claims under the BITs. Even if international law principles of effective nationality were to be
considered in determining this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Tribunal is satisfied that the record of
this case, unlike those of prior cases, does not cast doubt upon the strength of that Claimant’s
ties to Finland or lead one to believe that Claimant is only asserting his Finnish nationality in

order to bring this claim.‘” Claimant acquired Finnish nationality in 1971, long before this

arbitration was brought, indeed even before he made any investments in the Project. Moreover,
the record reflects a long history of Claimant’s residence in Finland and consistent recognition
by Finland of Claimant’s residence in the nation.*!° Finland considered Claimant to be a
Finnish citizen while he was imprisoned in Egypt and although it knew that Respondent also
considered him to be Egyptian. Upon the lifting of his travel ban from Egypt, Claimant
relocated to Finland. Furthermore, that Claimant considered his ties to Finland genuine is

evident in the fact that Claimant continued to pay taxes in Finland.

On the basis of the considerations above (paragraphs 228 to 230), the Tribunal comes to the
conclusion that general international law principles concerning the consequences of dual
nationality in respect of jurisdiction ratione personae do not trump the explicit language of the

BITs, according to the Tribunal’s finding as set out above at paragraph 227.

A final procedural consideration is relevant. As noted above at paragraph 70, in Procedural
Order No. 5, this Tribunal dismissed as belated Respondent’ s new jurisdiction ratione personae
objection on dual nationality raised in its Reply (concerning whether international law and the
BITs allow a dual national to claim against his or her state of nationality). Thus, procedurally,
irrespective of the propriety of dual nationals’ claims under international law, the Tribunal need

not adjudicate the issue, which it directed the Parties not to address in their submissions.

THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION RATIONE TEMPORIS

Respondent maintains that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis because the alleged
Treaty breaches do not fall within the temporal scope of either of the BITs invoked by
Claimant.*"! Respondent pleads that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis with
respect to the 2004 BIT because the 2004 BIT is limited in its temporal application to disputes
which arose after the entry into force of the 2004 BIT on 5 February 2005. According to
Respondent, the claims in this arbitration arose in 2000 or, at the very latest, before 2005, and
therefore cannot be governed by the 2004 BIT. Respondent maintains that this Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction under the 1980 BIT. Claimant cannot invoke the sunset clause in Article
9(3) of the 1980 BIT because the 1980 BIT has expired and been replaced. The 1980 BIT,

therefore, does not cover Respondent’s pre-2005 conduct.

jurisdiction is concerned because of the effectiveness of the connections he had with Egypt at all relevant
times. Neither Italian nor Lebanese nationalities play any meaningful role in Waguih’s life. Moreover,
there are elements in the record that allow being skeptical about the other nationalities that come into
play in this case.”).

Claimant submits, on the contrary, that the present dispute only arose after the 2004 BIT came
into force and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis over these disputes even if the
investment was made before the 2004 BIT came into force. Claimant notes that: “Events that
occurred before 5 February 2005 are governed by the 1980 BIT; events that occurred on or after
that date are governed by the 2004 BIT.”*!? Therefore, the Tribunal must apply the substantive
standards of the 2004 BIT to events that took place after the 2004 BIT was in force and the
substantive standards of the 1980 BIT to events that took place when the 1980 BIT was in
force. Claimant notes that Respondent’s position places Claimant’s allegations in an unusual
temporal gap between the BITs such that he would have no recourse to bring his claims.
Claimant argues that if the dispute did arise before the 2004 BIT entered into force, it should be
governed by the 1980 BIT.“

A. RELEVANT BACKGROUND AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The 1980 BIT was signed by Egypt and Finland on 5 May 1980, and entered into force on

22 January 1982 for 20 years, with tacit renewal thereafter.*!*

Respondent argues that the 1980 BIT was “substitute[d] and replace[d]” pursuant to
Article 17(2) of the 2004 BIT upon the 2004 BIT entering into force on 5 February 2005.4!
Respondent observes that the offer to arbitrate contained in Article 7 of the 1980 BIT was

replaced by the offer to arbitrate contained in Article 9 of the 2004 BIT.*!°

Claimant sent a Notice of Arbitration on 3 November 2011 stating that it accepted “Egypt’s

standing offer to arbitrate” under both BITs.*!”

Article 9(3) of the 1980 BIT sets forth that:

In respect of investments made prior to the date when the termination of this Agreement
becomes effective, the provisions of Articles 1 to 8 shall remain in force for a further
period of twenty years from that date.

Article 13 of the 2004 BIT provides that:

This Agreement shall apply to all investments made by investors of either Contracting
Party, in the territory of the other Contracting Party, whether made before or after the entry

into force of this Agreement, but shall not apply to any dispute concerning an investment
which arose or any claim which was settled before its entry into force.

Article 17(2) of the 2004 BIT provides that:

Upon its entry into force, the present Agreement substitutes and replaces the Agreement
between the Government of the Republic of Finland and the Government of the Arab
Republic of Egypt on the Mutual Protection of Investments done at Helsinki on 5 May
1980.

Pursuant to Article 7 of the Egyptian Investment Law:

Investment disputes relating to implementation of the provisions of this Law may be
settled by the method agreed with the investor. Agreement may be reached between the
parties concerned for settlement of such disputes within the framework of current
agreements between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the state of the investor .

 

B. THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS ON JURISDICTION RATIONE TEMPORIS

Respondent’s Position
a) Jurisdiction under the 2004 BIT

Respondent submits that the 2004 BIT is limited in its application to disputes that arose after its
entry into force on 5 February 2005, which is not the case here. Respondent states that
Claimant’s own description of the facts indicates that the dispute arose in 2000, if not earlier.4!*

Thus, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis with respect to the 2004 BIT.*!°
Article 13 of the 2004 BIT provides that:

This Agreement shall apply to all investments made by investors of either Contracting
Party, in the territory of the other Contracting Party, whether made before or after the entry
into force of this Agreement, but shall not apply to any dispute concerning an investment
which arose or any claim which was settled before its entry into force.

Respondent notes that although the agreement applies to investments “whether made before or
after” the 2004 BIT entered into force,*” Article 13 provides that the treaty “shall not apply to
any dispute concerning an investment which arose or any claim which was settled before its
entry into force.”“?! According to Respondent, the use of the past tense of the term “arose”

indicates that the agreement carves out disputes concerning investments that arose before the

2004 BIT entered into force.*”? Respondent describes as “tautological” Claimant’s attempt to
rely on Article 13 to prove that the 1980 BIT somehow continued to apply after the 2004 BIT
came into force. Respondent explains that that Claimant’s argument is “tautological” because if
the 2004 BIT does not apply to a dispute, it must follow that Article 13 itself cannot apply.‘

Respondent states that Article 13 cannot be rendered a nullity: it excludes the application of the

“substantive and jurisdiction provisions of the [2004 BIT]” to pre-2005 disputes.‘

Further, Respondent argues that Article 9 of the 2004 BIT limits Egypt’s offer to arbitrate under
the treaty to disputes “arising” after its entry into force, i.e., 5 February 2005.*°° The use of the
word “arising” in Article 9 indicates that the 2004 BIT does not cover disputes that arose before
the 2004 BIT entered into force. If such disputes were intended to be covered by the 2004 BIT,

contracting parties would have employed terms such as “has arisen” or “arose”.“?° Respondent

thus submits that “with disputes there is no overlap” under the BITs.*””

Respondent recalls that a “dispute” has been defined as “a disagreement on a point of law or
fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.”“”* A dispute would not only

crystallize when one party formally notifies the other party of its claims but rather when the

> 429

parties “confront their positions’ Respondent notes that according to Claimant’s

submissions, the dispute in this case arises out of Egypt’s unjustified imprisonment of Claimant
(on 5 February 2000), the closure of the business of AISCO and ADEMCO (in February 2000),
and the seizure of AISCO and ADEMCO’s assets (by 9 February 2000).*” Thus, the events
giving rise to the dispute arose in 2000.**! Notably, the judgment of the Egyptian Supreme

State Security Court that dismissed charges against Claimant is dated 11 June 2001, indicating

that the dispute must have crystallised before 11 June 2001.4”

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Respondent states that Claimant confuses the term “investments” with the term “disputes”.

According to Respondent:

We know that investments are covered both before and after the entry into force of the
BIT; that’s not in issue. The point is was there a dispute concerning an investment already
in existence at the time the second BIT came into force?**?

Respondent states that the Ping An v. Belgium tribunal made it clear that what was relevant was
not when the investment was made, but when the dispute had arisen, and the tribunal stated as
follows: “that the 2009 BIT applies to all investments, made before or after its entry into force,
does not assist in any way on the question of the effect of a dispute arising before entry into

force.”"**4

Respondent also states that Claimant, by contending that the dispute in the present case arose
when Claimant on 8 July 2011 notified Respondent of the dispute, conflates “claim” and
“dispute” and bases himself on too restrictive an interpretation of the term “dispute”.**°
Respondent maintains that the natural understanding of the term “dispute” is a dispute

concerning the investment, not a dispute under the BIT.**

Respondent states that, in any event, in the alternative, it is clear that the dispute in this
arbitration arose before 2005, as it is effectively a continuation of the domestic proceedings
involving Claimant. The subject matter of the dispute before the Egyptian courts does not differ
from that in the present arbitration; rather, it is the outcome of the dispute in the Egyptian court

that gave rise to the present arbitration.*”

Respondent argues that the present case, is one, as in Lucchetti v. Peru, in which facts that gave
rise to an earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute.*** Respondent notes that, to

be considered the same, the prior dispute need not have the same expression as the later

dispute.*” The fact that a dispute “becomes later a BIT dispute does not mean that we do not

have the same dispute.”*#°

Respondent relies on the tribunal in Vieira v. Chile which, in assessing when the dispute arose,
found that the parties’ earlier dispute relating to the claimant’s fishing rights “continued to
occupy a central position in respect of the claims presented by [the claimant] . . . “4! Thus,
Respondent maintains that the present arbitration has arisen from the Parties’ prior dispute
concerning the compensation and damages resulting from Claimant’s imprisonment in 2000.7
Respondent considers the cases relied upon by Claimant to be irrelevant to the present
arbitration because they only concerned whether there had been notification of the dispute
under the applicable arbitration clause, and the wording in the applicable treaties was not

similar to Article 13 of the 2004 BIT.“

Respondent emphasizes that, contrary to Claimant’s view, there is no requirement in the
2004 BIT that, in order for a dispute to have arisen, it must have been raised in writing.“*
Respondent argues that Article 9(2) of the 2004 BIT, which states that a dispute may be
referred to arbitration if it has not been settled within three months of it being raised in writing,
is only a prerequisite for the commencement of arbitration, not a constitutive element giving
rise to the dispute itself.“*° Thus, Claimant cannot sustain the argument that the Parties’ dispute
only arose when he sent his Notice of Arbitration to Respondent.*° Further, Respondent notes
Claimant’s argument that a dispute requires communication between parties. Respondent states
that there was discussion regarding the dispute in Claimant’s appeal against his criminal
conviction in Egyptian domestic courts.”

Further, Respondent argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine any
breaches of the substantive obligations contained in the 2004 BIT as those obligations cannot
be retroactively applied to conduct pre-dating 2005. Relying on Article 28 of the Vienna

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”) and prior arbitral awards, Respondent underlines
the general principle that a State can only be responsible for a breach of treaty obligation if the
obligation existed at the time of the alleged breach.“* Respondent argues that this principle of
non-retroactivity is enshrined in Article 13 of the 2004 BIT. Accordingly, the 2004 BIT cannot
be applied to breaches allegedly committed by Egypt in 2000, and there exists no real event
arising after 5 February 2005 that could violate the provisions of the 2004 BIT.” Respondent
cites to Ping An v. Belgium to argue that that tribunal “pointed out the possible effects of a
limited interpretation of provisions such as Article 13 of [the 2004 BIT], opening the broader
protection of the subsequent BIT to prior disputes and they said that this is something that the

state parties had clearly not intended . . . "45°

Respondent concedes that Claimant might be able to argue that a new dispute exists before this
Tribunal, if new facts or events had arisen giving rise to a new dispute.**' Respondent submits
that this is not the case in the present arbitration; the case before this Tribunal is the same as
that pled before the Egyptian courts, which resulted in the judgment of the Egyptian Supreme
State Security Court dated 11 June 2001.**? Respondent argues that Claimant wrongly conflates
the continuing character of a breach and the continuing effect of the breach. Relying on
commentary to the ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally

Wrongful Acts, Respondent states that an act does not have a continuing character merely

453

because its effects continue to extend in time.** Particularly, Respondent argues that an

expropriation is complete when the transfer of title is carried out by legal process.
Respondent states that the Freezing Order was lifted and Mr Bahgat was acquitted in 2006, but
these are not a continuous part of the acts complained of, as required by Article 14 of the ILC

Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Rather, the

lifting of the Freezing Order and acquittal are effects of the acts complained of.*** Respondent
states that none of the claims in the present case arise out of continuous breaches and, therefore,

they are outside the temporal scope of the 2004 BIT.

Accordingly, Respondent concludes that the present dispute arose before the entry into force of
the 2004 BIT on 5 February 2005 and that, pursuant to Article 13 of the 2004 BIT, the Tribunal

lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis.°6

Respondent stated during the Hearing on Jurisdiction that “there may be an arbitration gap if
that is the result of the proper meaning of the 2004 BIT,” but Claimant is not without remedy as
it is open to Claimant to claim pursuant to an agreed dispute resolution method before the
Egyptian courts.**’ Respondent points to the dispute resolution clause in the agreement between
ADEMCO and Respondent and states that there might be recourse under this clause, which
refers disputes to Egyptian courts.“ Respondent states that the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction to adjudicate questions concerning the Egyptian Investment Law because the
legislation does not apply to physical persons.*° Further, the Egyptian Investment Law does
not constitute part of the acceptance of Egypt’s offer to arbitrate. Under Article 9(2) of the
2004 BIT, the Tribunal only has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims arising out of the 2004 BIT,
not the Egyptian Investment Law.**! Moreover, Article 7 of Egyptian Investment Law requires
a separate agreement between Claimant and Egypt regarding the method by which investment
disputes will be adjudicated and Claimant has not established any such agreement.‘
Respondent points out that in Khan Resources v. Mongolia, the relevant domestic investment
law did not contain an independent basis for jurisdiction and therefore a claimant had to claim
through a separate investment treaty. This is not the case, according to Respondent, with the

Egyptian Investment Law.**

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

b) Jurisdiction under the 1980 BIT

Respondent recalls that the 1980 BIT was signed on 5 May 1980 and would be in force for
20 years.“ The 2004 BIT (which entered into force on 5 February 2005) “substitutes and
replaces” the 1980 BIT,“® and the 1980 BIT has since been deprived of any legal force or
continuing legal effect. At the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Respondent invoked a sporting
analogy: if a player is substituted with another, the substituted player leaves the field and is not
allowed to play again.**’ Respondent takes the view that the contracting parties in the present
case did not intend to terminate the 1980 BIT but to substitute and replace it with the 2004 BIT

468

and, thus,*® the offer to arbitrate contained in Article 7 of the 1980 BIT (framed in present

tense) was replaced by the offer to arbitrate in Article 9 of the 2004 BIT.“ Respondent
contends that the 1980 BIT only covers disputes that arose between 1982 and 2005, i.e., when
the 1980 BIT was in force, but could apply to investments made before or after the entry into
force of the 1980 BIT.*” Referring to the fact that Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration is dated
3 November 2011 and that the claims in this arbitration took place before the entry into force of
the 2004 BIT, Respondent concludes that Claimant is prevented from invoking Article 7 of the

1980 BIT as a basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.*7!

Respondent relies on the minutes of the meeting of the Egyptian Committee for Treaties
Revisions and International Loans from 2002 which notes that the 2004 BIT was necessary as
the 1980 BIT had “lapsed”.‘”” Further, Respondent cites a statement by the Egyptian Minister
of Foreign Affairs in which he states that the 2004 BIT “replaces the agreement of 1980,

because more than twenty years have passed on the agreement of 1980 [. . .] the current

3473

agreement will replace the agreement of 1980.”*”* Respondent also relies on the proposal made

by the Finnish government to the parliament to accept the 2004 BIT, according to which “. . .]

the treaty in question will replace the treaty signed in 1980 when entered into force.”4"*

Further, Respondent argues that Claimant circumvents the replacement of Article 7 of the 1980
BIT by making reference to Article 9(3) of the 1980 BIT,*” which provides for the legal
consequences resulting from the termination of the 1980 BIT. Respondent argues that the
replacement of the 1980 BIT did not trigger the survival clause contained in the 1980 BIT.
Under Article 9(2) of the 1980 BIT, termination is a unilateral act taken by one of the
contracting parties. Respondent submitted at the Hearing on Jurisdiction that unilateral
termination, unlike any other method of treaty termination, warrants the application of a

survival clause:

Tf one state unilaterally terminates the BIT, then it will be depriving the investors already
who have invested in its state from the other contracting state of protection, the protection
that they had expected to continue when they made their investment. Hence, one can
understand why, in a case of unilateral termination, there would be a survival clause.*°

Thus, according to Respondent, the 20 year survival clause contained in Article 9(3) is only
triggered if the 1980 BIT was terminated pursuant to Article 9(2). Respondent notes that it is
not disputed that the 1980 BIT has not been terminated by way of a unilateral declaration of
termination under Article 9(2). Rather it is common ground that the 1980 BIT was terminated
by mutual consent, as provided for in Article 17(2) of the 2004 BIT and in Article 54 of the
VCLT, which states that treaties can be terminated “at any time by consent of all the parties”.4””
Respondent argues that it is generally accepted that, where state parties have terminated a treaty
by mutual consent, that agreement neutralises any residual protections that might have been
available under the original treaty’s survival clause.*”* Respondent cites to Article 70 of the
VCLT which states that “the termination of a treaty [. . .] in accordance with the present
Convention [. . .] releases the parties from any obligation further to perform the treaty.”4”
Respondent takes the view, referring to Article 59 of the VCLT, that the 1980 BIT was, in fact,

terminated as a result of the 2004 BIT, and, therefore, the contracting parties were released

from the obligation to further perform the 1980 BIT.**° Respondent notes that the 2004 BIT
does not explicitly provide for the subsistence of the Article 9 survival clause of the 1980 BIT:
therefore, the survival clause was terminated along with the rest of the 1980 BIT upon the entry
into force of the 2004 BIT.**! Respondent clarifies that there was no need for a “protection
period” following the 1980 BIT, as referred to by the Finnish parliament, because the new 2004

BIT had entered into force.**?
Respondent suggests that were the Tribunal to have jurisdiction under the 1980 BIT:

[. . .] the two subsequent or consecutive BITs could give rise to parallel proceedings, with
parallel jurisdictions and obviously, therefore, the risk of different decisions on exactly the
same subject matter. That cannot be what Finland and Egypt intended.***

Respondent refers to ABCI Investments v. Tunisia which concerned two investment treaties
entered into by the Netherlands and Tunisia, in 1963 and 1998. That tribunal held that the
disputes which arose prior to the entry into force of the later BIT continued to be governed by
the earlier BIT because Article 12(5) of the later BIT specifically provided that disputes arising
before the entry into force of the later BIT would continue to be governed by the earlier BIT.“**
Respondent also refers to Ping An v. Belgium, where the applicable investment treaty explicitly
provided that the old BIT would continue to operate for disputes that had already reached
arbitration or judicial proceedings before the entry into force of the new BIT.“ Respondent
states that Egypt and Finland did not choose to include similar provisions in the 2004 BIT.
Therefore, in the absence of such provisions, the protections in the 1980 BIT cannot be invoked

by Claimant for conduct that took place before 2005.**°

Respondent contends that the substantive provisions of the 1980 BIT have, similarly, been

substituted and replaced by equivalent provisions in the 2004 BIT.**”

Respondent denies that its interpretation of the BIT creates a “temporal hole” in the system.
Claimant could and should have raised its claim for violations of the 1980 BIT when they
occurred, and in any event, before 2 February 2005, when the 1980 BIT expired. Respondent
states that, in fact, had Claimant not waited 10 years to bring his claim, he could have accepted

Egypt's offer to arbitrate in the 1980 BIT before the 2004 BIT came to be.***

Claimant's Position
a) Jurisdiction under the 2004 BIT

Claimant argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis under Article 9 of the

2004 BIT.“

Claimant submits that upon an ordinary and natural reading of Article 13 “the 2004 BIT in its
entirety does not apply with respect to pre-existing disputes”.“°° Claimant rejects Respondent’s
argument that the dispute crystallised at the time of the criminal proceedings and, hence, arose
in February 2000, or earlier. In the first instance, Claimant argues that Respondent’s approach
conflates “disputes” and “claims”.*°! According to Claimant, there may be an existing or future
investment claim under the 1980 BIT that has not yet crystallised into a dispute. Should a
dispute out of such a claim arise after the entry into force of the 2004 BIT, it would become
subject to the dispute settlement mechanism of the 2004 BIT. Put differently, Claimant argues
that Article 13 of the 2004 BIT leads all investment disputes arising after the entry into force of
the 2004 BIT (whether based on the 2004 BIT, 1980 BIT or otherwise) to be adjudicated in
accordance with the 2004 BIT, irrespective of when the investment was made.*”? Additionally,
Claimant argues that Respondent’s position ignores the text of Article 13 of the 2004 BIT,
which affirms that the 2004 BIT is applicable regardless of the date that the investor made the
investment, to ensure the continuity of investment protection. According to Claimant, it is clear
that the intention of the drafters was to ensure that all investment disputes would be covered by

one or the other BIT.*°? Claimant objects to Respondent’s submission that Article 17 must be

read to eliminate the 1980 BIT for all purposes, including for pre-existing disputes. Claimant

notes that there is nothing in the 1980 BIT or 2004 BIT to support such a reading."

Claimant disagrees with Respondent that the carve-out for prior disputes that was present in
Ping An v. Belgium is missing from the BITs in the present case. Claimant submits that the
equivalent carve-out for prior disputes is found in Article 13.4°° Claimant denies that its reading
of Article 13 is “tautological”. Claimant notes that by Respondent’s logic, any carve-out
provision in a later treaty would fail because the treaty would not apply to prior disputes in the

first place.*”°

With regard to the question of when the investment dispute arose, Claimant points out that the
“time of the dispute is not the same as the time of the events leading to the dispute. [. . .] The
mere fact that some of the events giving rise to the dispute occurred before the 2004 BIT came
into force is not relevant to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the 2004 BIT”.*”” Relying on the
tribunal’s findings in Maffezini v. Spain, Claimant argues that a dispute presupposes a sequence
of events beginning with a statement of difference of views, followed by the formulation of
legal claims and their discussion between the parties.’ Claimant submits that the legal test
used by tribunals for whether a dispute has arisen has been that a dispute arises when parties

assert their conflicting claims regarding their rights and obligations.*””

Applying this formulation to the present case, Claimant submits that he first raised the dispute
with Respondent in writing on 8 July 2011.° On 3 November 2011, he submitted his Notice of
Arbitration thereby, in his view, accepting Respondent’s offer to arbitrate any dispute arising
directly from an investment as set forth in Article 9 of the 2004 BIT.*' Claimant concedes that

many events leading to the present dispute began in 2000, but the dispute did not crystallise at

502

that time.’ According to Claimant, nothing on the record suggests that the dispute crystallised

in 2001.°° At the same time, Claimant clarifies that nothing that happened before the filing of
the Notice of Arbitration in 2011 by the Claimant can be considered as constituting an
investment dispute, as envisaged under Article 7(1) of the 1980 BIT or Article 9(1) of the 2004
BIT.* Claimant relies on Jan de Nul v. Egypt, where the tribunal emphasised the “separate and
distinct” nature of the alleged conduct at issue in the domestic dispute from that in the BIT
dispute.*°’ Similarly, Claimant states that the subject matter of the present arbitration, is distinct
from the domestic criminal proceedings: the latter concerned alleged misappropriation of funds
and fictitious payments, while the former deals with international legal obligations.*° Claimant
notes that the criminal proceedings concerned acts that took place between February 1998 and
the end of 1999, unlike the claims in this arbitration which span across a different period.*””
The criminal proceedings dealt with allegations of embezzlement of public property by Mr
Bahgat, unlike this arbitration, which deals with alleged expropriation of his property by
Respondent.*’ Claimant submits that there is no record of Claimant having alleged expropriation
or some domestic equivalent in the domestic proceedings.” Overall, facts and considerations
that gave rise to the domestic criminal proceedings are not central to this arbitration.*!°

Further, Claimant submits that it is well-established by international tribunals that a dispute
only arises, for the purposes of international law, on the identification of a breach of a treaty
and a clear articulation of a claim.*'’ Claimant states that there was no communication between
the Parties concerning the investment dispute (as distinct from the criminal proceedings) until
the submission of the Notice of Arbitration in 2011.5! Claimant submits that his appeal against
his criminal conviction cannot, contrary to Respondent’s submissions, constitute a dispute for

513

the purposes of the applicable BITs.

To determine whether, under the 2004 BIT, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is excluded because

of Article 13, Claimant states that the Tribunal should assess whether or not there is (i) a

dispute concerning an investment; which (ii) arose prior to the entry into force of the 2004 BIT

on 5 February 2005.54

Claimant notes that the present arbitration is a new and separate dispute, not a continuation of
the criminal proceedings that took place between 2000 and 2006.*!> According to Claimant, the
situation prior to 5 February 2005 cannot be characterised as “a dispute concerning an
investment” within the meaning of Article 13 of the 2004 BIT because the conflict between the
Parties surrounded solely criminal charges against Claimant, which did not concern the closure

of AISCO and ADEMCO, or the taking of Claimant’s investment in the Project.*'°

Claimant distinguishes Vieira v. Chile from the present arbitration, stating that in the former
case, the domestic dispute and the ICSID arbitration were brought by the claimant in order to
protect his fishing rights. However, in the present arbitration, Claimant was prosecuted by
Respondent in domestic criminal proceedings where Claimant only presented his defence, and
Claimant then brought this arbitration to protect his investments. Therefore, the breach of
Respondent's international legal obligations did not occupy a central position in the criminal
proceedings.*!7 Claimant distinguishes Lucchetti v. Peru, which dealt with a single long
running dispute, from the present dispute, which Claimant states involves the bringing of a later
claim that is fundamentally different from the prior claim.5'’ Claimant also distinguishes
Helnan International Hotels v. Egypt stating that it concerns the meaning of “divergence” and
that the Claimant cannot meet the threshold of divergence or dispute on the present facts as
Respondent has been unable to point to evidence in the pre-February 2005 record that the

Parties were mutually aware of their differences.*!

Claimant argues that Article 9 of the 2004 BIT provides broad subject matter jurisdiction to the
Tribunal over “[a]ny dispute arising directly from an investment between one Contracting Party
and an investor of the other Contracting Party [. . .!”, unlike other investment protection treaties,
that might only establish jurisdiction with respect to breaches of the treaty in question. Thus,

Claimant is of the view that, pursuant to Article 9 of the 2004 BIT, the Tribunal has jurisdiction

to determine breach of the substantive obligations under the 1980 BIT,*”° arising out of
Respondent’s conduct before the 2004 BIT came into force. Claimant explains that the 2004
BIT provides this Tribunal with jurisdiction to adjudicate any violation of the substantive rules
applicable to the events that started in 2000 and which led to the destruction of Claimant’s

investment.**!

Claimant objects to Respondent’s reliance on Feldman v. Mexico, arguing that this case
concerned Article 1117(1)(a) of NAFTA which states that it is limited to claims arising out of
breach of Section A, Chapter 11 of NAFTA. No similar limitation exists in Article 9 of the
2004 BIT.*” Instead, Claimant presents authority for the proposition that investment tribunals
have adjudicated on questions of domestic investment law, particularly where the treaty’s
dispute resolution clause does not contain any explicit limitations on the tribunal’s

jurisdiction.°>

Claimant states that the effect of the termination of the 1980 BIT is not that Respondent ceased
to be bound by the substantive provisions of the 1980 BIT when the treaty subsisted, but that
the terms of the 1980 BIT continued to cover activities until 5 February 2005 when it was in
force.** For the sake of clarity, Claimant notes that he does not ask the Tribunal to
retroactively apply the 2004 BIT. He contends that his submissions are entirely consistent with
the inter-temporal rule since he seeks to have Respondent’s conduct assessed in light of its
existing international obligations at the time of the conduct at issue: the Tribunal must apply the
substantive provisions of the 1980 BIT to Respondent’s conduct until the 2004 BIT came into
force. Claimant notes that the Jan de Nul v. Egypt tribunal supports its position: it applied
substantive protections of an earlier BIT to conduct that took place before a later BIT came into
force to adhere to the principle of non-retroactivity.°*° According to Claimant this is not
inconsistent with Ping An v. Belgium which states that provisions of a BIT may not be relied on

for acts occurring before its entry into force; or the ruling in Mondev v. USA that a state can

only be responsible for treaty breaches if the obligation is in force at the time of the alleged

279. In response to Respondent’s suggestion that Claimant should have raised this dispute before
2 February 2005 when the 1980 BIT was replaced, Claimant states that he was incarcerated
between February 2000 and March 2003 and subject to a travel ban until June 2005. Accepting
Respondent’s argument would allow it to benefit from its own misconduct and penalise
Claimant for prioritising his well-being and safety.*** Claimant reiterates that he was under no
obligation to seek local remedies, and in any case, denies that any such remedies existed.*”?

280. Claimant also contends that this Tribunal has jurisdiction under the 2004 BIT to determine any
breaches of the substantive obligations under the 2004 BIT arising out of the Respondent’s
conduct after the 2004 BIT entered into force. Respondent, in Claimant’s view, incorrectly
suggests that there are no events capable of constituting unlawful conduct that arose after
5 February 2005. Claimant identifies the following breaches that persisted after the entry into
force of the 2004 BIT: (i) Respondent’s imposition of a travel ban on Claimant until June 2005;
(ii) Respondent’s failure to comply with the court order requiring the Freezing Order to be
lifted and Claimant to be given access to the company sites and bank accounts; and
(iii) Respondent’s refusal to release the Aswan mines to AISCO and ADEMCO, despite
ADEMCO’s sole mining rights in the region; and (iv) Respondent’s failure to protect the

movable and immovable properties on the site.”

Claimant contests Respondent’s
characterisation of these events as effects or consequences of prior breaches, but rather

considers them to be continuing breaches.**!

281.

Claimant submits that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes under the Egyptian

532

Investment Law.** Claimant explains that Article 7 of the Egyptian Investment Law states that

disputes under the legislation may be settled by the method agreed with the investor and

provides four methods by which such agreement might be reached. The first method states that:

Agreement may be reached between the parties concerned for settlement of such disputes
within the framework of current agreements between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the
state of the investor.**

Claimant argues that this provision covers bilateral investment treaties in force.** Claimant
argues that Claimant has no recourse under the Egyptian Investment Law for the protection of
his investment.**> Claimant acknowledges Respondent’s point that the Egyptian Investment
Law is only available to companies, and clarifies that Claimant has invoked the legislation for
the protection of his investments in the Companies.**° Claimant also notes that the Egyptian
Investment Law, in Articles 7, 53, and 54 does accord rights to investors as distinct from
companies.**” Claimant points out that Respondent’s interpretation of the Egyptian Investment
Law is merely assertion, unsupported by expert reports or case law.** In this context, Claimant
invites the Tribunal to apply Articles 12(1) and (2) of the 2004 BIT which allow for the

application of sources of law that are more favourable to an investor.°*”

b) Jurisdiction under the 1980 BIT

According to Claimant, the Tribunal also retains jurisdiction ratione temporis under the
1980 BIT. Claimant submits that the 1980 BIT and 2004 BIT provide seamless protection to
qualifying Finnish investors in Egypt.™° Article 9(3) of the 1980 BIT contains a survival clause
stating that the 1980 BIT stays in force for a further period of twenty years from the date of
termination of the 1980 BIT. Thus, even if the treaty dispute crystallised before
5 February 2005, as Respondent contends and Claimant denies (see paragraphs 268 onwards),

Article 9(3) preserves Claimant’s right to bring this arbitration.

Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s argument that the sunset clause in Article 9(3) is only
applicable for unilateral acts of termination. Article 9(3) contains no reference to unilateral
termination™! and it makes no sense to Claimant to interpret “substitution and replacement” as

having an even more severe effect on the protection of investments than the termination of the

treaty.*?

Claimant agrees with Respondent that the Article 9(3) sunset clause should apply to
an investor who should not see their treaty coverage defeated by unilateral termination of a BIT
by one contracting party. Claimant argues that an investor should be able to benefit from
Article 9(3) also in case of mutual termination as “[i]t makes no difference whatsoever to the

investor whether or not the termination was mutual or unilateral.”*"?

Moreover, Claimant argues that a unilateral act is not the only way by which the 1980 BIT
could have been terminated as Article 9(2) of the 1980 BIT does not purport to set out an
exclusive list of termination events.** Article 54 of the VCLT states that a treaty might either
be terminated by its own terms or after consultation with the other contracting states. Further,
Article 59 of the VCLT states that a treaty is considered terminated if all the parties to it
conclude a later treaty concerning the same subject matter. On the basis of these provisions of
the VCLT, Claimant states that it is clear that the 2004 BIT terminated, rather than substituted
and replaced, the 1980 BIT.** This is reinforced by the fact that the VCLT does not recognise
the replacement of treaties.*“° Claimant submits that the sunset clause in Article 9(3) will apply
irrespective of whether the 1980 BIT was terminated by unilateral action as under Article 9(2)

or otherwise, in so far as the result is the termination of the 1980 BIT.**”

Claimant questions the relevance of the Czech and Indonesian practice relied on by Respondent
and notes that the Czech and Indonesian practice demonstrates use of an explicit revocation of a

survival clause. Absent such explicit revocation, a survival clause shall continue to apply.*“*

In Claimant’s view, Respondent’s position that the survival clause of the 1980 BIT is not
applicable and is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the 2004 BIT, namely the
promotion and protection of investments and economic cooperation and the creation of a stable

investment framework.*? Claimant submits that the 2004 BIT was intended to continue,

strengthen, and update the investment protection regime originally established in the 1980
BIT. Claimant cites a proposal submitted to the Finnish parliament regarding the approval of
the 2004 BIT which states that the treaty aimed to expand the protections available to investors
and to “decrease the potential risks of foreign investments”. It was moreover stated that the
2004 BIT “shall apply to all future investments and existing investments made by investors of
either Contracting party in the territory of the other Contracting country”.**! Claimant notes that
this interpretation is consistent with that of the Egyptian government, because it agreed to the
dispute resolution clause in Article 9 of the 2004 BIT without insisting on any changes to the

legal framework.**?

Claimant states that the contracting parties to the 2004 BIT could have explicitly clarified that
all protections relating to the 1980 BIT were to be terminated, but this was not done in the 2004
BIT, and therefore must not be the case.** It is Claimant’s view that it could not have been the
intention of the contracting parties to the 2004 BIT at the same time to replace the 1980 BIT
with more expansive protections, and to “establish a large temporal hole in [terms of Treaty]
protection”*™ depriving a class of investors, whose investments were destroyed before 2004 but

who did not commence arbitration until after 2004, of protection.**°

Claimant denies that its submission will result in possible parallel proceedings, as suggested by
Respondent. Claimant argues that if the sunset clause were to be applied, it would only apply to
pre-existing disputes: “it establishes a bifurcated regime, where the dispute that crystallized

prior to 5 February 2005 is resolved under the 1980 regime, and the dispute that crystallises

19556

post 5 February 2005 is resolved under the new treaty regime.

Therefore, Claimant concludes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis under
Article 7 of the 1980 BIT to adjudicate all claims regarding any alleged treaty breaches that

occurred after the 1980 BIT came into force on 22 January 1982, when the “dispute” arose, up

until 4 February 2005, the day before the 2004 BIT came into force.*”

C. TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

a) The “dispute” in this arbitration

The Tribunal first considers its temporal jurisdiction under the 2004 BIT. The 2004 BIT was
signed on 3 March 2004 and entered into force on 5 February 2005. Article 13 of the 2004 BIT
states that it applies “to all investments made . . . before or after [its] entry into force,” but “shall
not apply to any dispute concerning an investment which arose or any claim which was settled
before its entry into force.”*** Respondent maintains that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the
2004 BIT because the dispute in this case arose before the 2004 BIT entered into force and is a
continuation of the proceedings that have already taken place in Egypt. By contrast, Claimant
argues that the present arbitration concerns a new dispute that arose when he raised his treaty

claims in the Notice of Dispute on 8 July 2011, well after the 2004 BIT entered into force.

In order to establish its temporal jurisdiction, the Tribunal must consider the meaning of the
term “dispute” and determine when a “dispute” arose in this case. The Parties are divided on
the meaning of “dispute”. The Parties also disagree about whether the domestic criminal
proceedings in Egypt, resulting in Claimant’s incarceration and eventual release, are part of the

same dispute as the present arbitration.

The questions of what constitutes a dispute under an investment treaty and whether a dispute is

new have been considered by tribunals in the past.

In Maffezini v. Spain, the underlying events began in 1989. Spain argued that the tribunal did
not have temporal jurisdiction under the applicable investment treaties (which entered into
force on 28 September 1992, at the earliest). Invoking the International Court of Justice
definition of a dispute as “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or
interests between parties,” the tribunal in Maffezini v. Spain stated that a “dispute must go
beyond general grievances and must be susceptible of being stated in terms of a concrete
claim.” The tribunal found that a dispute begins with “the expression of a disagreement and

the statement of a difference of views . . . . The conflict of legal views and interests will only be

present in the latter stage, even though the underlying facts predate them.”** The tribunal
upheld jurisdiction because even though the underlying facts may have arisen from 1989, the

dispute began to take shape only in 1994, after the applicable BITs were in force.*°!

Similar issues arose in Helnan International Hotels v. Egypt, which was brought under the 1999
Denmark-Egypt BIT that entered into force on 29 January 2000. The respondent contended that
the tribunal lacked jurisdiction because divergences between parties began in 1993 and disputes
and divergences that arose before the entry into force of the treaty were excluded. The claimant
maintained that a “divergence” required an opposition or conflict of views between parties,
which only arose in 2004.°® The tribunal held that “in the case of a divergence, the parties hold
different views but without necessarily pursuing the difference in an active manner... . [I]n
case of a dispute, the difference of views forms the subject of an active exchange between the
parties under circumstances which indicate that the parties wish to resolve the difference

. °° The tribunal found that the divergences between parties only crystallised after the entry
into force of the applicable investment treaty and therefore dismissed the ratione temporis

jurisdictional objection.**

In Vieira v. Chile, Vieira argued that Chile had breached investment treaty protections under
the Spain-Chile BIT (which came into force on 29 March 1994) in the context of fishing rights.
Chile challenged jurisdiction on the basis that the dispute arose at the very latest when
claimant’s company was denied the right to fish in external waters, on 12 September 1990,
which was before the investment treaty came into force.*® The claimant alleged that the dispute

arose after 29 March 1994, giving the tribunal jurisdiction under the Spain-Chile BIT.*°

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

The tribunal defined a dispute as:

a disagreement which implies a minimum of communication between the parties.

2

b) in order to characterize a dispute, one of the parties involved shall raise the issue to the
other, and the latter shall stand in opposition, either directly or indirectly, with the other
party. The dispute shall entail that one of the parties stands positively in opposition
with the other.

the disagreement shall be in connection with a matter of fact or law, resulting in a
concrete conflict of interest between parties.

2

d) the disagreement shall entail a discussion resulting in a situation where parties have
clearly opposite positions with respect to the issue (of fact or law).

the disagreement shall comprise a claim, either made orally or in writing, or, depending
on the case, the disagreement shall appear when the claim is presented.

&

f) the disagreement shall refer to issues clearly identified between the parties, shall not be
merely theoretical and shall be likely to be presented within a concrete claim.*”

The tribunal found that a dispute had arisen between the parties “before the Treaty came into
force .. . . [B]oth Chile and CONCAR had presented [written] evidence which indicated a clear
disagreement and different interests and points of view with respect to CONCAR’s right to fish
within external waters.”*°* The tribunal determined that the dispute giving rise to the arbitration

was a continuation of an earlier dispute. The tribunal declined jurisdiction.*?

In Lucchetti v. Peru, the underlying BIT entered into force on 3 August 2001. Peru argued that
the dispute between the claimants and the Peruvian authorities began in 1997-1998 and,
therefore, the tribunal had no jurisdiction.*” The tribunal accepted that a “dispute” had arisen
between the claimants and the authorities because each side had expressed conflicting views
regarding their respective rights and obligations.*”! However, the tribunal held that the dispute
was not a new one and therefore the tribunal lacked jurisdiction. In reaching that conclusion,

the tribunal found that the subject matter and facts giving rise to the earlier dispute were the

same as those giving rise to the investment dispute before it.°””

300. The Tribunal concludes, based its evaluation of the Parties’ arguments and informed by their
discussions of the jurisprudence discussed above, that a “dispute” entails a disagreement on
facts and/or law that has been communicated by one party to the other. Claimant submitted at
the Hearing on Jurisdiction that the pre-February 2005 record of this case reflects that the
Parties were not mutually aware of their disagreements with respect to the investment dispute
that lies at the centre of this arbitration.*”> The Tribunal agrees. Unlike the circumstances in
Vieira v. Chile, the Tribunal finds that the pre-February 2005 record of this case does not reflect
that the Parties had exchanged communications regarding their positions on the violation of
investment protection obligations by Egypt. This dispute was first raised in writing by Claimant
on 8 July 2011.5” Respondent has not presented any evidence or communications before 2011
showing opposing positions with respect to its treatment of Claimant’s investment. The
conditions set out in paragraph 297 above were not satisfied at any time before 8 July 2011.
The Tribunal is thus satisfied that in this case, the dispute in its legal sense arose after the 2004

BIT entered into force.

301.

The Tribunal has considered Respondent’s argument that this dispute is not new, but is
substantially similar to, and effectively a continuation of, the domestic Egyptian criminal
proceedings involving Mr Bahgat. The May 2006 judgment of the Egyptian Court of Cassation
lifting the Freezing Order details the nature of the allegations against Mr Bahgat before the
Egyptian courts.*”* The Court explains that Mr Bahgat was accused of “embezzling for the
purpose of expropriation the sum of fifteen million pounds which was owned by the aforesaid
company they worked for” and obtaining a profit from this activity.°”° Mr Bahgat was also
accused of “forgery of a document of a company in which public funds were invested”;*”” and
“caus[ing] deliberate damage to the property and interests of the aforesaid company where they

worked.”5”8 As pointed out by counsel for Claimant, the domestic litigation was a case about

alleged wrongdoing by Mr Bahgat, not alleged wrongdoing by Egypt.” By contrast, in this
arbitration, Claimant is invoking substantive protections for his investment in the Project under
the BITs, which is a distinct dispute from that before the Egyptian courts. The first time
Claimant communicated that he was doing so was in the Notice of Dispute dated 8 July 2011
and the first time Egypt stated an opposing position evincing a disagreement with respect to the
treatment of his investments was 6 February 2012.°*° The present arbitration thus concerns a

different subject matter and different facts than those before the Egyptian courts.

This arbitration can be distinguished from Lucchetti v. Peru and Vieira v. Chile. In Lucchetti v.
Peru, a long-running dispute about a license for a pasta factory was at the heart of both the
domestic proceedings and the international arbitration. Similarly, the domestic proceedings in
Vieira v. Chile and the arbitration concerned the same subject matter and facts concerning the
grant of the fishing licenses. Unlike these cases, in the present case, the domestic criminal
proceedings in Egypt did not concern the same subject matter and facts as those raised in the
arbitration. The two proceedings concern complaints about the actions of different actors in

relation to different legal obligations and different events.

Therefore, the Tribunal is satisfied that in this case, the dispute in its legal sense arose after the
2004 BIT entered into force and that this dispute is not the continuation of the dispute that had
been decided by the Egyptian criminal courts. The Tribunal therefore finds that it has
jurisdiction under the 2004 BIT to determine Claimant’s claims. Respondent’s objection to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis under the 2004 BIT is accordingly dismissed. The
Tribunal notes that Article 13 of the 2004 BIT confirms that it applies to “investments made by
investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, whether
made before or after the entry into force of this Agreement.”**!' Therefore, this Tribunal can
take jurisdiction under Article 9(2) of the 2004 BIT with respect to Claimant’s investments in

Egypt that were made in 1997, before the 2004 BIT came into force.

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

b) The applicable substantive law and interaction between 1980 and 2004 BITs

This arbitration has been brought under the 1980 BIT and, “[iJn addition, and in the
alternative,” under the 2004 BIT.** It is a well-established principle of international law, and

common ground between Parties, that treaties cannot have retroactive effect.°**

Bearing this
principle in mind, the Tribunal now considers the law applicable to this dispute and the

interaction between the substantive protections contained in the 2004 BIT and the 1980 BIT.

In this respect, the Parties have referred the Tribunal to a number of relevant decisions of other
investment tribunals. Impregilo v. Pakistan involved a claim under the 2001 Italy-Pakistan BIT
that came into force on 22 June 2001.°** Pakistan invited the tribunal to hold, based on the
principle of non-retroactivity, that it had no jurisdiction save with respect to acts that occurred
after 22 June 2001. The tribunal found that it had jurisdiction ratione temporis but noted that the
substantive provisions of the 2001 Italy-Pakistan BIT did not bind Pakistan in relation to its pre-
22 June 2001 actions. It held that “Impregilo complains of a number of acts for which Pakistan is
said to be responsible. The legality of such acts must be determined, in each case, according to
the law applicable at the time of their performance. The BIT entered into force on 22 June 2001.
Accordingly, only the acts effected after that date had to conform to its provisions.”** This can

be contrasted with cases involving an earlier BIT and a subsequent BIT.

In Jan de Nul v. Egypt, which was brought under the provisions of both the 1977 and 2002
Egypt-Belgium/Luxembourg BITs, the tribunal found that it had jurisdiction under the 2002

treaty and held with regard to the applicable substantive law that:

The Tribunal must apply the provisions of the 2002 BIT with regard to the acts of the
Ismailia Court in relation to its judgment [dated 22 May 2003] and the provisions of the
1977 BIT with regard to conduct that took place prior to the entry into force of the 2002
BIT .... As a result, the substantive provisions of both treaties will apply, while, as it

within three months Mr Bahgat would invoke investor-state arbitration under Art 9(2)(d) of [the 2004

that Mr Bahgat would also invoke investor-state arbitration under Art. 7 of [the 1980 BIT] in respect of
violations of [the 1980 BIT]”).

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

follows from the Decision on Jurisdiction, the jurisdiction over the dispute is based on the
2002 BIT only.56

In the light of the Parties’ arguments and informed by the case law set out above, the Tribunal,
having taken jurisdiction under the 2004 BIT, will apply the substantive provisions of the 1980
BIT to acts before 5 February 2005 (when the 2004 BIT came into force) and the 2004 BIT to
acts after 5 February 2005.

The tribunal in Jan de Nul v. Egypt noted that the dispute resolution clause of the treaty under
which jurisdiction was taken contained no restriction with respect to the applicable law and that
the acts at issue fell within the scope of application of the earlier treaty.**’ This Tribunal
considers that the 2004 BIT likewise imposes no limitations. The offer to arbitrate in
Article 9(1) and (2) of the 2004 BIT does not restrict the contracting parties’ consent to

arbitrate only to disputes that involve the application of the 2004 BIT.***

Respondent argues that Claimant cannot benefit from the substantive protections under the
1980 BIT as the 2004 BIT states that “[u]pon its entry into force, the present Agreement
substitutes and replaces the [1980 BIT].”°*° Respondent maintains that all provisions of the
1980 BIT, including its substantive provisions, ceased to apply in any manner to disputes that
arise after the entry into force of the 2004 BIT.*” The Tribunal notes that at the same time,
Respondent concedes that the principle of non-retroactivity would not allow this Tribunal to
apply the substantive protections of the 2004 BIT to pre-existing investments.*’' Respondent’s
argument would create a situation where the Tribunal has jurisdiction over pre-existing
investments under Article 13 of the 2004 BIT, but is prevented from applying either the
substantive provisions of the 2004 BIT or the 1980 BIT to the investments. This could not have
been the intention of the contracting parties. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that Article 17 of
the 2004 BIT does not prevent it from applying the substantive provisions of the 1980 BIT to
the events that took place before 5 February 2005.

Respondent contends that if the contracting parties to the BITs had intended for the substantive

provisions of the 1980 BIT to apply after the entry into force of the 2004 BIT, they would have

specifically so provided in the 2004 BIT, as has been done in other investment treaties.

Respondent refers to Ping An v. Belgium, which was brought under the 2009 China-
Belgium/Luxembourg BIT. Article 10(2) of the 2009 China-Belgium/Luxembourg BIT states
that it “substitutes and replaces” the 1986 China-Belgium/Luxembourg BIT, and that the 2004
China-Belgium/Luxembourg BIT “shall not apply to any dispute or any claim concerning an
investment which was already under judicial or arbitral process before its entry into force. Such
disputes and claims shall continue to be settled according to the [1986 China-
Belgium/Luxembourg BIT].”*”? The claimant in Ping An v. Belgium relied on the 2009 China-
Belgium/Luxembourg BIT for jurisdiction, but on the 1986 China-Belgium/Luxembourg BIT
for the substance of the disputed obligations (as the events forming the basis of the claim and
the crystallisation of the dispute took place while the earlier BIT was in force).*** The tribunal
found that it did not have jurisdiction ratione temporis to adjudicate the claims that were based
on facts that took place and a dispute that arose before the 2009 China-Belgium/Luxembourg
BIT was in force.** Unlike Ping An v. Belgium, in this arbitration, Claimant’s reliance on the
2004 BIT is not merely procedural. Claimant makes submissions based on events that took
place before and after the 2004 BIT and also proposes the application of its substantive
provisions. Importantly, unlike Ping An v. Belgium, the dispute in the present arbitration
crystallised after the 2004 BIT was in force.* Ping An v. Belgium does not assist Respondent
as the tribunal did not adjudicate whether the substantive provisions of an earlier treaty can be

applied to the facts of a dispute that had crystallised during the pendency of a Jater treaty.

Respondent also refers to the 1998 Dutch-Tunisian BIT, under which ABCI Investments v.
Tunisia was brought, Article 12(5) of which states that “[o]n the entry into force of the present
agreement, the [1963 Dutch-Tunisian BIT] shall be terminated and shall be replaced by the
present Agreement. Disputes arisen before the entry into force of the present Agreement shall

continue to be ruled by the agreement of May 23, 1963”.°* Respondent argues that unlike

Bahgat v. Egypt
Decision on Jurisdiction
30 November 2017

Article 12(5) above, the 2004 BIT “does not contain any provision to the effect that the
substantive provisions of the 1980 BIT would continue to be applicable to disputes which arose
prior to 2 February 2005”.*°’ However, Article 12(5) is inapposite to Respondent’s case in light
of the Tribunal’s finding above that the present dispute arose when the 2004 BIT was in force.
Article 12(5) does not state that the substantive law in the 1963 Dutch-Tunisian BIT will
continue to apply to investments that were made before the later BIT that were connected to a
dispute arising under the 1998 Dutch-Tunisian BIT. It only states that the 1963 Dutch-Tunisian

BIT would continue to apply to pre-existing disputes.

In any event, the Tribunal finds that Claimant benefits from the application of the survival
clause contained in Article 9 of the 1980 BIT. Article 9(3) of the 1980 BIT states that for
investments made prior to the date on which the 1980 BIT is terminated, Articles 1-5 of the
1980 BIT will continue to remain in force for a further period of 20 years from the date of
termination. The Tribunal is unconvinced by Respondent’s argument that the survival clause in
Article 9(3) will only apply in circumstances where the 1980 BIT has been unilaterally
terminated according to the terms of Article 9(2) and not in the event of the substitution and
replacement of the 1980 BIT, as is the case with the 2004 BIT. Respondent states that investors
have a legitimate expectation of the continuation of investment protections through a survival
clause only following the unilateral termination of a bilateral investment treaty: the Tribunal
considers that the text of Article 9(3) provides that investors, following any kind of termination

of investment protections, should benefit from a survival clause.

The general principle is that a treaty must be interpreted according to its terms, in its context, in
accordance with its object and purpose.*** The Tribunal notes the text of the Preamble to the
1980 BIT “[d]esiring to maintain fair and equitable treatment of investments of nationals and
companies of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State [. . .]” The
Tribunal notes the wording of the Preamble to the 2004 BIT, which states: “[rJecognizing the
need to protect investments of the investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of another
Contracting Party [. . .]”; “[a]greeing that a stable framework for investment will contribute to
maximizing the effective utilization of economic resources and improve living standards”. The
BITs strongly indicate that the intention of the contracting parties was to provide continuous
investment protection to investors of the other contracting state. A gap in protection afforded to
investments under international investment treaties would be contrary to that intention. The

Tribunal notes that at the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Respondent conceded that there is no

recourse available to Mr. Bahgat in local courts pursuant to the Egyptian Investment Law as the
provisions of the law only apply to companies.*” The Tribunal cannot accept Respondent’s
interpretation of Article 9(3) as this would generate a gap in the protection available to Finnish
investors. The Tribunal, thus, confirms Claimant’s reading that, on account of the survival
clause in Article 9(3) of the 1980 BIT, the substantive investor protections contained in
Articles 1-8 of the 1980 BIT can be applied in respect of Respondent’s actions that took place
while the 1980 BIT was in force.

In conclusion, the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction in this arbitration under
Article 9(2) of the 2004 BIT. In line with the principle against non-retroactivity, the substantive
provisions of the 1980 BIT will be applied to actions that took place before 5 February 2005
and the substantive provisions of the 2004 BIT will apply to all actions that took place after that
date. As a practical matter, the Tribunal observes that the application of different treaties in this
case should not be a hindrance to the conduct of this arbitration as the substantive protections
that are provided under the 1980 BIT and under the 2004 BIT are near identical.’ The
Tribunal considers that its approach is consistent with the intention of the contracting parties to

the BITs to ensure that there is no gap in investment protection.

c) Breaches of Egyptian Investment Law

A further issue relevant to the law applicable to the dispute is that of the relevance of Egyptian
Investment Law. Respondent contends that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to deal with
breaches of the Egyptian Investment Law as there is no agreement between the Parties to this
effect, as required by Article 7 of the Egyptian Investment Law. Claimant maintains that this
Tribunal has jurisdiction to apply Egyptian Investment Law as Article 7 of the Egyptian

Investment Law allows Parties to agree to settle disputes related to the Egyptian Investment

Jurisdiction Hearing, Day 2, pp. 245:16-246:1.

See provisions in the Treaties on expropriation (Article 3(1), 1980 BIT, Exhibit CLA-0001 and
Article 5(1), 2004 BIT, Exhibit CLA-0002); fair and equitable treatment (Article 2(1), 1980 BIT,
Exhibit CLA-0001, and Article 2(2), 2004 BIT, Exhibit CLA-0002); full and constant protection and
security (the most favoured nation clause contained in Article 2(3), 1980 BIT, Exhibit CLA-0001 read with
Article 3(1) of the 1996 Egypt-Netherlands BIT, and Article 2(2), 2004 BIT, Exhibit CLA-0002);
protection against arbitrary measures (the most favoured nation clause contained in Article 2(3), 1980 BIT,
Exhibit CLA-0001 read with Article 3(1) of the 1996 Egypt-Netherlands BIT, and Article 2(3), 2004 BIT,
Exhibit CLA-0002); national treatment (the most favoured nation clause contained in Article 2(3), 1980
BIT, Exhibit CLA-0001 read with Article 3(2) of the 1996 Egypt-Netherlands BIT, and Article 2(1), 2004
BIT, Exhibit CLA-0002); and failure to observe obligations in relation to an investment (the most
favoured nation clause contained in Article 2(3), 1980 BIT, Exhibit CLA-0001 read with Article 3(4) of
the 1996 Egypt-Netherlands BIT, and Article 12(2), 2004 BIT, Exhibit CLA-0002). See also Jan de Nul

Law “within the framework of current agreements between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the
state of the investor”. The Tribunal finds the Claimant’s reading of Article 7 convincing and
determines that there is agreement between the Parties for this Tribunal to apply the Egyptian

Investment Law.

317. Further, the Tribunal notes that the authorities cited by Respondent for the proposition that
tribunals cannot apply provisions of domestic law in international proceedings are inapposite.
The tribunal in Feldman v. Mexico found that the tribunal could not apply general international
law or Mexican law because the underlying treaty, Article 1117(1)(a) of NAFTA, did not
permit it to do so. Article 9 of the 2004 BIT refers to the resolution of “dispute arising
directly from an investment”. On its face, it does not limit this Tribunal’s jurisdiction to

apply the Egyptian Investment Law for the adjudication of this dispute.

318. Therefore, the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction to hear claims arising out of alleged

breaches of the Egyptian Investment Law.

VI. DECISION

319. Based on the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal:
A. Dismisses the jurisdiction ratione personae objections advanced by Respondent.
B. Dismisses the jurisdiction ratione temporis objections advanced by Respondent.
C. Decides that it has jurisdiction over the dispute.

D. Reserves all questions concerning the merits, costs, fees and expenses for subsequent
determination; and

E. _ Invites the Parties to confer regarding the procedural calendar for the merits phase of the
arbitration, and to report to the Tribunal in this respect within six (6) weeks of receipt of
