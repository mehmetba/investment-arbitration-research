PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. THE NOTICE OF ARBITRATION

On 6 February 2013, Achmea submitted to the Slovak Republic a Notice of Arbitration
pursuant to Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
Arbitration Rules of 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”),* and to Article 8 of the Treaty.°

B. THE FIRST PROCEDURAL HEARING AND PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 1

On 28 May 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties held an initial procedural
hearing via teleconference, where they discussed a draft agenda circulated earlier, a
draft Procedural Order No. 1 submitted jointly by the Parties and their proposals
regarding the procedural schedule of the arbitration.

On 31 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO1”), which set out
the procedural rules and the calendar for the arbitration. It also specified that the
Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) would act as fund holder for the deposits
made by the Parties by way of advance for the costs of arbitration.®

c. THE WRITTEN PHASE

On 5 June 2013, the Claimant filed its Statement of Claim (“SoC”). The SoC was
accompanied by Exhibits C-1 through C-63.

On 30 August 2013, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“Rejoinder’),
accompanied by Exhibits C-88 through C-106.

On 5 September 2013, in accordance with paragraph 5.6 of PO2, the Claimant
introduced Exhibits C-107 through C-112, which had been obtained as a result of
document production; to which the Slovak Republic responded on 11 September
2013, in particular by submitting Exhibits R-2 through R-9.

On 13 September 2013, the Claimant filed a submission, accompanied by Exhibit C-

Mr. George von Mehren
Mr. David Alexander
Mr. Rostislav Pekaf

Ms. Maria Lokajova

Mr. Stephen Anway

of Squire Sanders, and

Mr. Mark Clodfelter
Mr. Constantinos Salonidis

of Foley Hoag.

During the course of the hearing, the Parties presented oral opening arguments on
their respective positions with respect to jurisdiction. Messrs. Marsman and Leijten
addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant and Messrs. Hudak, von Mehren,
Alexander and Clodfelter on behalf of the Respondent.

E. THE POST-HEARING PHASE

On 16 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO3”), whereby
it confirmed the agreement reached at the end of the hearing that there would be no
post-hearing briefs. It also fixed the time limits for the submission of any corrections to
the transcript and of the Parties’ statements on costs.

On 4 October 2013, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached an
agreement for the extension of the time limit for the submission of their statements on
costs until 11 October 2013. On that date, each Party submitted its statement.

On 18 October 2013, the Parties jointly submitted a corrected version of the transcript
of the hearing.

On 29 January 2014, the Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal informing it of new
factual allegations. The Respondent objected to that course of action in its
communication of 31 January 2014, on the ground that its due process rights were
seriously put in jeopardy, and requested the Tribunal (i) to disregard the materials
presented by the Claimant, or, (ii) if the Tribunal were to consider such materials in
assessing its jurisdiction, to allow the Respondent to respond and contest the
Claimant's new allegations. On 3 February 2014, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to
comment on the Respondent's two proposed courses of action by 10 February 2014.

On 10 February 2014, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to
allowing the Respondent to comment on its new allegations, but objected to the
Respondent's primary request. Accordingly, the Tribunal proposed on 11 February
2014 to the Respondent to comment by 20 February 2014 on the content of the
Claimant's letters of 29 January and 10 February 2014.

On 20 February 2014, the Respondent filed its comments to the Claimant's new
allegations. On 25 February 2014, the Claimant again approached the Tribunal to
request the Tribunal to “take appropriate measures to safeguard the integrity of the
proceedings and the robustness of any awards rendered pursuant to it’. In essence,
the Claimant asked the Tribunal (i) to admonish the Respondent in connection with its
alleged misrepresentations in connection with Exhibit R-2, (ii) to order the
Respondent to bear all costs associated with these misrepresentations (including
costs related to the preparation of the 29 January, 10 February and 25 February 2014
letters), and (iii) to draw appropriate inferences when assessing the other evidence
submitted by the Respondent.

In light of this development, the Tribunal gave to the Respondent until 25 March 2014
to respond to the requests filed by the Claimant in its 25 February 2014 letter. On that
date, the Respondent commented on the Claimant's new request.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The summary below is based on the Parties’ written and oral submissions and the
documentary evidence they have introduced into the record. It is presented only to
the extent it is useful to frame the Tribunal’s analysis of the Respondent's objections
to jurisdiction. It is noted that the detailed nature of the summary that follows is
explained by the fact that the Respondent has specifically objected on the ground that
Achmea’s claim manifestly lacks legal merit. Disputed facts are highlighted as
appropriate.

A. ACHMEA’S INVESTMENT AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET IN THE SLOVAK
REPUBLIC

The Slovak Republic acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004. It liberalized its
health care insurance market, setting up a system of regulated competition with the
entry into force of Acts No. 580/2004 and 581/2004.” Under the new framework,
health insurance companies were required to be set up as joint stock companies and
were allowed to make and distribute profits to their shareholders.® With a view to
ensuring a competitive market, clients were allowed to switch health insurance
companies each year by 30 September.° An independent regulatory authority, the
Slovak Health Surveillance Authority (“HSA”), was set up to issue operation licenses
and to supervise the insurance companies’ compliance with applicable regulations. °

SBsseidgartssc

Achmea applied for, and obtained, a license from the HSA on 13 February 2006, and
on 9 March 2006, Union zdravotna poist’oviia a.s. (“Union”) was incorporated."
Achmea holds all the shares in Union.’? Achmea invested approximately € 72 million
in the form of cash capital contributions."

On 1 January 2013, Union held a market share of 8.42% in the Slovak Republic.*
Union has two competitors in the Slovak market: (i) VSeobecna zdravotna poist'oviia,
a.s. (“VSZP”), which is the State-owned (and largest) health insurer with a market
share of 64.09% as of 1 January 2013; and (ii) Dévera zdravotna poist'oviia, a.s.
(‘Dévera”), which is a privately-owned Dutch company holding a market share of
27.49% as of 1 January 2013."°

Achmea also holds close to 100% of the shares of Union posit'oviia a.s. (“Union
Commercial”), a Slovak joint stock company offering life and non-life insurance
products to individual and corporate clients, including travel insurance.‘

B. THE BAN ON PROFITS, THE BAN ON TRANSFERS AND THE FIRST BIT ARBITRATION

In 2006, a change of Government occurred in the Slovak Republic, with Mr. Robert
Fico of the SMER-socidina demokracia (“SMER”) party assuming office as Prime
Minister on 4 July of that year.’7 The new Government announced that it would
introduce measures with respect to health insurance companies,’® which it did by
adopting Acts Nos. 530/2007 and 192/2009."* The first regulation “required profits
from health insurance to be used for healthcare purposes only, rather than at the
discretion of the company and its shareholders” (“ban on profits”).”° The second
tegulation provided for “a prohibition on the transfer of a portfolio of insurance
contracts against payment’ (“ban on transfers”).”"

Other measures adopted at that time included “a prohibition on the use by health
insurance companies of insurance brokers, a requirement that health insurance
companies contract with certain named state-owned hospitals, and an obligation for
health insurers to submit their financial budgets to the Slovak government ‘for

discussion”.”* Through Act No. 12/2007, the Slovak Government could “discharge at
will the Head of the Health Care Regulator”.”°

 

On 1 October 2008 Achmea (still known as Eureko) commenced arbitration
proceedings against the Slovak Republic challenging, among others, the above-
described measures. The case was registered with the PCA with the reference
number “PCA Case No. 2008-13” (“Achmea |”). On 26 October 2010, the tribunal in
Achmea | issued an Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension. In the
relevant part of that decision, the Tribunal:
“(a) DISMISSE[D] the ‘Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection’ advanced by
Respondent and decide[d] that it ha[d] jurisdiction over the
dispute;
(b) REJECT[ED] Respondent's request to suspend the proceedings
until the European Commission and/or the ECJ ha[d] come to a
decision on the EU law aspects of the infringement proceedings;
(c) RESERVE[D] all questions concerning the merits, costs, fees and
expenses, including the Parties’ costs of legal representation, for
subsequent determination”.”°
The Slovak Republic challenged this award before the Oberlandesgericht in Frankfurt
am Main. The application was rejected on 10 May 2012. The Slovak Republic filed an
appeal before the Bundesgerichtshof in Karlsruhe,”° which had yet to be decided at
the time of the issuance of the present Award.
On 7 December 2012, the tribunal in Achmea | issued its Final Award, in which it:
“(a) ohenced by, each of the Temaining jurisdictional objections
and that it ha[d] j
over the Siete
(b) DECLARE[D] Respondent to have breached Article 3 and Article
4 of the Treaty by adopting the ban on profits and the ban on
transfers;
(c) ORDER[ED] Respondent to pay to Claimant damages in the sum
of €22.1 million, net of any taxes that might be due to be paid by
Claimant to Respondent on that sum;
(d) ORDERJED] Respondent to pay to Claimant interest on the
amount of €22.1 million, as from 1 August 2011 up to the date of
payment, at the Eurozone official rate for “main refinancing

Phase of the arbitration; and

(f) ORDER[ED] Respondent to pay to Claimant the amount of
€2,095,350.94 for its legal representation and assistance in the
Merits Phase of [the] arbitration”.2”

On 31 January 2013, the Slovak Republic filed an application to set aside the Final
Award before the Oberlandesgericht in Frankfurt am Main.”® As of the date of the
issuance of the present Award, the challenge is still pending before the German court.
As of the date of the Statement of Claim, the Slovak Republic had not paid the
amounts mentioned in the Final Award. To obtain enforcement, Achmea seized
Slovak bank accounts in Luxemburg.”°

On 15 October 2008, shortly after the arbitration in Achmea | commenced, the
Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic received a petition from a group of 49
deputies of the National Council of the Slovak Republic challenging the
constitutionality of the ban on profits, and its conformity with the European
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of
4 November 1950 (“ECHR’), Article 1 of its Additional Protocol and several provisions
of the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”).°°

While Achmea | was still pending, the challenge was decided by the Constitutional
Court on 26 January 2011. The Court ruled that the ban on profits breached the
Slovak Constitution and Article 1 of the Additional Protocol to the European
Convention on Human Rights.**

A new Government headed by Ms. Iveta Raditova replaced the Government of Mr.
Fico on 8 July 2010. Ms. Radiéova’s Government announced a reversal of the ban on
profits and the ban on transfers with effect from 1 August 2011. As part of the new
measures of her Government, as of 1 April 2011, it was also no longer permitted to
discharge the Head of the Health Care Regulator “at will”.** Later Ms. Radigova’s
Government fell, and on 1 April 2012, Mr. Fico returned to office.**

Cc. PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY STATE OFFICIALS ON THE INTRODUCTION OF REFORMS
TO THE HEALTH-INSURANCE MARKET

Before and after re-assuming office, Mr. Fico made public statements to the press
about his intention to introduce amendments to the regulatory framework of the health
insurance market. In an interview with the Slovak journal SME on 12 March 2013, he
indicated that re-introducing the ban on profits was one of the priorities of his party,
SMER. He further stated that the main difficulty lay in implementing such change “in
compliance with [the] legislation of the European Union and with the constitution” and
that he understood from his legal advisors that this could be possible.** On 13 April
2012, the same newspaper reported that the Prime Minister had asked the new
Minister of Health, Ms. Zuzana Zvolenska, “to find a way to ban the profit and not
violate the constitution at the same time”.

During a radio interview given on 30 June 2012, Mr. Fico expressed his opinion that
“the state will have to solve the problem of the health insurance companies and [that
the Government] should go [in] the direction towards one health insurance
company’”.®° He further stated that this could be done either by buying the shares from
Dévera and Union, or by expropriating and paying compensation based on the law
and for public interest, as authorized by the Slovak Constitution.*” The next day,
Slovak TV 1 hosted a debate between Prime Minister Fico and Mr. Béla Bugar, a
member of the Slovak Parliament (“MP”) and chairman of the political party Most-
Hid.** During the debate, Mr. Fico referred in the following terms to the current state
of the health insurance market, and his intentions in this domain:

“L can now imagine that we really could give an offer to private
health insurance companies to sell their private health companies
to the state, there will be only one health insurance company
created and we wouldn't have the never ending problem with
leakage of money through health insurance. We are now trying to
find money for salaries of doctors and nurses, but gentlemen in
private health insurance companies each year take away tens of
millions of Euro as a kind of profit from public funds. Both you and
me send money to some health insurance company according to
the law, a public fund which should return back to healthcare,
private health insurance companies can keep only 3 - 4%, it is
some administration fund, they take some profit from these public
funds and use it for their private purposes. Airplanes and similar
things, which are typical for these owners. Therefore we think that
this is the way, we can try it and | am really not against and | think
that this will cause a big discussion, there are many countries in

Europe which operate on the principle of one health insurance
company. But money are leaking, if there would not be leakage of
money, and if they kept only 3-4%, if they only had the
administration fund, let them live with it, but tens of millions [of]
dollars are leaking from the profit, they do no have the right to
create profit’.°°

During the debate, MP Bugar reacted by cautioning that implementing Mr. Fico’s
ideas for the health insurance market should be done in a way that would not spur
legal actions against the State, as had happened before.‘ In response, Mr. Fico
recalled that expropriation, by law, in the public interest and against compensation, is
“a constitutional institute which is applicable in the whole world”.*" He further stated
that he preferred if the Slovak Republic would buy the private health insurers’
shares.*?

On 19 July 2012, the Slovak news agency TASR reported that the Health Minister,
Ms. Zlovenska, announced that she would “soon submit a proposal for creating a
single health-care insurer’, and conceded that “state acquisition of private health-
insurers is one of the options”.** The rationale given by Prime Minister Fico for the
creation of a single-insurer system was “to stabilise cash flows in the health-care
system in a way that would make sure that all the money flowing into health insurance

serves patients”.**

D. THE RESIGNATION OF THE HEAD OF HSA.

Through Act No. 185/2012, which entered into force on 1 July 2012, two additional
grounds for dismissal of the Head of the HSA were added to the Act on Health
Insurance Companies, Act. No. 581/2004:

“(d) if the Authority does not fulfill the duties under this statute;

(e) if there are other serious reasons, in particular in the event of a
deed that brings or is capable of bringing doubts over personal,

moral or professional qualifications for the exercise of his office”.

Shortly before Act No. 185/2012 entered into force, the Head of the HSA, Mr. Jan
Gajdo§, tendered his resignation on 28 June 2012.*° A press release published on the

HSA website purported to reproduce comments made by Mr. GajdoS on his
resignation, in which he stated that:

“By doing this, | express my disagreement with bringing politics into
HSA and making it a servant to the Ministry of Health, as the
amendment that was passed and takes effect on 1 July brings. The
office of the HSA Chairman, and performance of the HSA tasks,
are now, in reality, becoming subordinated to the Health Minister,
and the HSA ceases to be an independent authority. With this step,
HSA as a control authority again misses out on a chance to

jectively supervise i and
healthcare providers that are subordinated to the Ministry of
Health. This repeats the 2007 scenario in which | refuse to play a
role. | think this is political hypocrisy since my stepping down has
been decided a long time ago, and | will not simply stand here and
watch as someone tries to come up with some artificial reasons for
my resignation”.”

E. THE INTENTION STATEMENT

On 20 July 2012, the Ministry of Health published a proposal for discussion within the
Slovak Government in respect of its intention to introduce a unitary system of public
health insurance in the Slovak Republic (the “Intention Statement’).®

The Intention Statement analyzes certain assumptions for reforms to the health
insurance system in the Slovak Republic, including the country’s health indicators as
they compare to other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (“OECD”), and the make-up of the Slovak health insurance providers
market. On the first issue, the Intention Statement notes that “[wJhile total life
expectancy keeps growing in the Czech Republic in line with the trends prevailing in
OECD Member States, the gap between Slovakia and the rest of OECD countries
keeps widening”.*® It further states that the “below-average result and unfavourable
developments are the result of a number [of] contributing factors” both stemming from
the lifestyle choices of patients and from the funding and administration of the
healthcare system itself.°° On this point, the Intention Statement concludes that:

“[tlhe growing pressure on public funds and, subsequently, on
health spending is currently an important motivation to introduce a
more efficient utilization of the limited resources. Having regard to
the unsatisfactory results achieved by the Slovak health care
system, this pressure calls for a change in organization of the
health care sector”.*"

In exploring alternatives for health insurance provider systems, the Intention
Statement goes on to analyze 29 European countries and finds that “only three [...]
have introduced legislation allowing for generation of profit on public health
insurance” and that the “[uJnitary system has been introduced in 16 countries and [a]
plural system not allowing for generation of profit in 10 countries”.°

On the health insurance providers, the Intention Statement finds that “[tloday, it can
be stated that there are no important differences between individual health insurers in
term of services offered to the insured, price policy or structure of the health care
providers network”.® It further finds that, even if there are several health insurance
providers in the market, VSZP holds the most important position both in terms of
market share (65.8% of the total number of insured) and in terms of the “ability to
create the extent of the network of existing health care providers, or performance of
health care policy through its contract policies’.* Under these circumstances, “the
importance of private health insurers to patients is much more less pronounced”.*>

From the above, the Statement concludes that ‘[iJt has been estimated that
elimination of plurality from health insurance sector would significantly reduce
spending for administration and management of public health insurance due to
elimination of duplicities in administrative costs, and that profit would be eliminated in
full”.

The Intention Statement identifies three possible “Implementation Means” for the
creation of a single health insurance company in the Slovak Republic:

i) seeking an agreement with the shareholders of private health insurers
to have the Slovak Republic take over the administration of their
companies “without involvement of their owners”, who would receive a
certain financial compensation from the State; or

(ii) seeking an agreement to have the shareholders of the privately-owned
insurers agree to a voluntary sale of their shares or certain assets of
their companies to the Slovak Republic (the “voluntary sale process”);
or

(iii) expropriation.°”

On the first option, the Intention Statement notes that it “has never been tested and
can be therefore viewed as a risky legal hybrid” and that “there are reasonable doubts
whether this would correspond with the objective for introduction of the unitary

system, as the State would continue to compensate shareholders of private health
» 58

insurance companies’.
The other two options are presented as part of a two-step process: the State would
first offer to buy the shares or certain assets of the private insurers and, only “after
futile efforts for an agreement’, proceed to expropriation.®* In this scenario, a law
could be passed either before or after the decision to expropriate, outlining the
procedure for these two “Implementation Means”.©°

In case of expropriation, the Intention Statement takes into consideration the fact that
it should be carried out in accordance with the Slovak Constitution, and specifically
Article 20(4) thereof. This means that it must be performed based on a law, in the
public interest, to the minimum required extent, and against adequate
compensation.®' Specifically, the Statement notes that “[iJn this particular case, the
public interest may be deemed the need to create a functional and efficient public
health insurance mechanism’. The Statement ends with some considerations as to
how the two preferred “Implementation Means” (i.e., purchase of shares, and/or
expropriation) would fare under the law of the European Union (“EU law’), and
international investment protection law.°*

On 23 July 2012, Achmea’s CEO, Mr. Willem van Duin, sent a letter to Mr. Fico, in
which he responded to the Government’s public statements on the contemplated
single health insurance company, including the Intention Statement, and expressed
his concern as to how the announced measures would affect Union. He also
outlined Achmea’s disagreement with the Government's stated plans in the following
terms:

“| regret that [...] your government is again considering measures
intended to remove privately-owned health insurance companies
such as UZP [Union] from the Slovak market. Such measures will
again cause significant damages to Achmea. Moreover, there is no
public interest that requires a removal of privately-owned health
insurance companies from the Slovak market. Alleged differences
in life expectancy between the Slovak Republic and certain other
countries that existed well before the Slovak health insurance
market was liberalized, and that apparently only improved since
UZP entered the market, certainly do not compel the removal of
privately-owned health insurance companies from the Slovak
market. [...] Finally, an expropriation of privately-owned health
insurance companies would appear discriminatory in that it would

remove exclusively foreign-owned businesses from the Slovak
rk

market’.
He noted that the timing was particularly infelicitous, as health insurers were at that
time in the midst of the acquisition campaign competing for clients before the
statutory deadline of 30 September 2012.
On 25 July 2012, the Slovak Government issued Government Resolution No, 383,
approving “the intention to introduce unitary public health insurance system in the
Slovak Republic”, and instructing the Minister of Health “to prepare the project and
ensure the performance of related acts in order to implement” this intention by 30
September 2012.”
In an interview published on the same day, Mr. Fico was quoted as saying that “in
practice [the Government's unanimous approval of the Intention Statement] means
that the private health insurers Dévera and Union should leave the Slovak market”.
Several days later, on 31 July 2012, Mr. Fico responded to Achmea’s 23 July 2012
letter. The Prime Minister re-stated the Government's case for the reform of the
health care insurance market, including its considerations on Slovak Constitutional
law and EU law.”° It further stated:
“[T]he Government of the Slovak Republic fully respects Achmea’s
tights resulting to it under domestic law, and that it also considers,
in relation to the intended creation of unitary health insurance
system, also international liabilities of the Slovak Republic in the
area of protection of cross-border investments, in particular those
concerning the support and protection of investments (bilateral
investment treaties) under which foreign investors exercise their
claims against the Slovak Republic where they believe that their
investment has been prejudiced due to the steps taken [by] the
State. Nonetheless, it has to be stated that such a treaty allows for
dispossession of a foreign investor of its investment for reasons of
public interest, in compliance with the law and in a non-
discriminatory manner, provided that the Slovak Republic will be
obliged to pay to the investor without undue delay a fair
compensation”.’*
Mr. Fico concluded his missive by stating that his Government did not believe that its
public announcements and approval of the Intention Statement “might be capable of
causing any damage to Achmea’”, and that any measures going forward would be

carried out “with due regard to the maintenance and respecting of all Achmea’s

rights”.
During a radio interview broadcasted on 22 September 2012, Mr. Fico referred again
to his Government's plans regarding the health insurance market in the following
terms:

“We are now stubbornly going to create a single health insurer, and
| stand behind this project because the private health insurers take
our money from the health care system by carving a huge amount
of money from the public money.

And if we get these insurers under the one health insurance
company, then all the money that would otherwise end up in
pockets, luxurious cars and luxurious houses of Dévera and
Union's owners, will end up in the health care system, then that is
the concrete saving for the state”.’*

F. THE PROJECT PLAN

On 25 September 2012, in furtherance of the instructions contained in Government
Resolution No. 383, the Slovak Ministry of Health published a proposal to implement
the Intention Statement entitled “Project of implementation of a unitary system of
public health insurance in the Slovak Republic” (the “Project Plan’).”*

The Project Plan is divided into three sections, an introduction on constitutional law
provisions applicable to the provision of health care in the Slovak Republic and on
studies on the effectiveness of healthcare systems,’° an overview of the desired
features of a single health insurance provider under the new system, including a
section on the role of the HSA,” and a third section, touching on the introduction of
the unitary public health insurance system. It analyzes the “pros and cons” associated
with the two pI d Imp ion Means i i in the i Tt
(i.e., buy-out of the private insurers and expropriation) and the “vulnerabilities”, and it
ends with a schedule of implementation.”

The Project Plan states the Government's desire to undo the liberalization of the
health insurance market that had allowed the introduction of private companies. It
notes, for example, that “the joint-stock companies present since 2005 have provided
no significant argument which would — by a different quality and attitude of their

£

services — justify the necessity to keep their existence as a tool to provide the health
needs of population in more efficient way”.’ It goes on to recall that:

“[t]he Intention [Statement] has evaluated the facts why the new
public health insurance system being administered by several
health insurance companies as well as by private entities has not
proved to be good”,”* and finds that “[t]he interest in ensuring the
efficiency in spending such a big volume of resources through
health insurance companies — where they belong to public finances
— leads to the strengthening of reasons from the side of the state to
terminate the existence of the plural system and to return to an
economical, less-administrative and cost-effective model of
financing the health care through a single public institution”.©°

The Project Plan, to be implemented through the so-called “Transformation Act’,
further describes the introduction of a unitary health insurance system as a three-step
process:

(i) first, an attempt to agree with the privately owned health insurers a
“voluntary sale” of the shares;

(ii) second, if no agreement is reached, the expropriation of the shares;
and

(iii) third, the merger of the formerly privately-owned health insurers with
the state-owned insurer into a single health insurer.**

During this process, the State is to be represented either by VSZP or by a new
company called Spoloénost’ pre zavedenie unitameho system verejného poistenia,
a.s. (the “Unitization Company”), defined as a “legal entity (joint-stock company) with
100% capital participation of the State in its registered capital, established by the
State only for implementing the unitarisation project’. Either V8ZP or the new
company is to conduct legal and financial due diligence, offer the non-State insurers
the opportunity to enter into purchase agreements, or, if no such purchase agreement
is concluded, seek expropriation and act as the expropriator.®*

Throughout the unitarisation process, the existing number of insured persons is to be
stabilized, because “if non-State insurers attract too many of those insured by VSZP,
the State will incur damage as a result, as it would have to pay a higher
compensation (purchase price) due to such ‘unnatural’ jump in the numbers of the
insured”. Furthermore, should the privately-owned insurers not allow the Unitization

Company to perform legal and financial due diligence, it would be free to value the
insurers’ shares by using governmental information.®®

As to the expropriation scenario, expropriation is to be requested after three
unsuccessful offers during the “voluntary sale” process; two from the Unitization
Company and, in between, one counter-offer from the insurer.°® The Project Plan
defines expropriation as the “compulsory passage of the title to shares in a non-State
insurer to the Expropriator”.®” It also specifies that the expropriator (i.e., the entity
requesting the expropriation) would be the Unitization Company, and that HSA would
act as the expropriating authority.*®

As to the public interest underlying the eventual expropriation, the Project Plan states
that:

“The expropriation objective will be to achieve, in the public
interest, the acquisition of the title to the Expropriated Assets for
implementing the objective of introducing unitary model into health
insurance”.

And on the issue of compensation, it provides that:

“The compensation for expropriation (i.e. compulsory passage of
title, including a potential compulsory passage of a receivable from
the non-State insurer) must be given in a way that is conformant
with the Constitution, ie. also including with international
obligations binding on the Slovak Republic, in a non-discriminatory
and equal manner, i.e. monies”.”

The expropriation procedure is to be governed by the rules of administrative
procedures, and may include an expert appraisal — whose costs shall be borne by the
expropriator —, oral hearings, and deposits of the amount of compensation. The
expropriation decision, which is taken by the Health Care Regulator upon application
of the Unitization Company, transfers title to the shares, and must mention the
amount of compensation owed. While the Project Plan indicates that that decision is
not subject to appeal, is also states that “a remedy could be filed [...] with a court”
with suspensive effect and that “not even the Transformation Act will eliminate the risk
that the decision to expropriate might be quashed by a court of another instance”.
The final step of the process is then the immediate merger of the Unitization company
with VSZP, the state-owned insurer, since this course of action would minimize the
tisk of constitutional and anti-trust scrutiny:

“The fast completion of mergers of these health insurers can be an
efficient tool for lowering the risk of questioning the Unitarisation
Process (or constitutional questioning of the Transformation Act)
with the Constitutional Court. In the opinion of the court, the
Constitutional Court does not rule on restitution of a condition
caused by a law which has been already executed’.

“[i]t is desirable for the Transformation Act to also lay down that
[...] prior approval of the [...] Antimonopoly Office of the Slovak
Republic will not apply to the acquisition of non-State insurer's
assets by the Unitarisation Company”.

82. The Project Plan was subject to a “legislative commenting procedure”, which lasted
until 8 October 2012. Both Achmea and Union, together with other entities, such as
Dévera and a group of Slovak health policy experts, submitted their objections to the
Project Plan.®*

83. Achmea communicated its objections directly to the Prime Minister, Mr. Fico, and to
the Minister of Health, Ms. Zuzana Zvolenska in a letter dated 8 October 2012 (the “8
October 2012 letter”), copying the Minister of Finance, Mr. Peter Kazimir.®° Therein,
Achmea noted that no “rational relationship” between the policy goals referred to in
the Project Plan and the desire to expropriate existed; that the alleged problems in
the Slovak health care system could not be blamed on Achmea’s participation in its
health insurance market; that the Government ignored the significant contributions
that the privately-owned insurers had made to the efficiency of the health care
system; and that, “[e]ven if the Slovak Republic were permitted to expropriate the
privately-owned insurers, which it clearly is not, [the Slovak Republic] would be
required to fully refund the future profits that it seeks ownership of, therefore leaving
no financial benefit to the Slovak health care system’.®” The letter also refers to the
discriminatory nature of the plan, as it targets only foreign-owned businesses, and
only the health insurers, leaving other players in the health care market unaffected,
such as hospitals, pharmacies or doctors.*°

84. On 15 October 2012, the Ministry of Health submitted to the Government a written
assessment of Achmea’s and Union's objections. The next day, a meeting was held
in Bratislava with representatives from Achmea, Union and the Ministry of Health."°°

G. THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE REPORT

On 12 December 2012, the Financial Policy Institute of the Slovak Ministry of Finance
published a report entitled “Less health care for more money — Analysis of Slovak
healthcare sector efficiency” (the “Ministry of Finance Report’), which reached the
following conclusions:

(i) No causal relationship was identified between an alleged deterioration
of the Slovak health care system and the introduction of the system
based on multiple health insurers;

(ii) The private health insurance companies had in 2010 statistically
significant lower costs per one insured than the State-owned insurance
company, and this was not the result of the privately-owned insurers
having healthier clients;

(iii) The fixed costs incurred by the health insurance companies are not a
significant source of inefficiency;

(iv) Profits of the privately-owned health insurers that were according to the
Ministry “economically unjustified’, have been largely eliminated
through an amendment of the rules applicable to the redistribution pool
for health insurance premiums effective July 2012;

(v) There was no finding of a “strong general argument for unitary vs.
pluralistic insurance company system for all OECD countries”, and “[a]t
the international level, the unitary system has better results in one

indicator, but the effect is not robust”.

‘© On this issue, Achmea explains that “[hJealth insurance companies in the Slovak Republic are

required to deposit a certain percentage of premiums paid by their clients into a common pool,
where those premiums are then redistributed to the health insurers based on the characteristics of
their client portfolio. These characteristics include age, sex and economic activity, and — from July
2012 — additionally also a classification into one of the Pharmacy Cost Groups a cblecive of
which is to identify insured with This

premiums to those insurers that bear the largest burden in terms of health care Feet. See SoC,

H. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT PLAN

87. On 20 December 2012, the press reported that the Unitization Company had been
established by the Ministries of Health and Finance." The Unitization Company was
registered in the Slovak business register on 29 January 2013.'%

88. Between February and May 2013, the Slovak Government announced on several
occasions that the Transformation Act was being “finalized’,"”’ though it eventually
conceded that there was likely to be a need for revision of the timeline set out in the
Project Plan (see above paragraph 81).'°

89. In its announcements to the press, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to
move forward with the implementation of the unitary public health insurance system.
Mr. Fico stated on 4 April 2013 that “[w]e are doing everything we can to have a
single insurer’."°° Information presented by the Minister of Health to the Government
in May 2013 revealed that the existence of the instant arbitration proceedings was
being taken into account in the process to implement the Project Plan through the
Transformation Act.""°

“The proposal of the Transformation Act is being evaluated also by
the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic together with the
representatives who represent the Slovak Republic in international
arbitrations related to health insurance companies. In order to
minimize the risk of potential as well as already ongoing arbitration
proceedings against the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of Finance

On 27 May 2013, the Respondent issued a tender proposal for the public
procurement for legal and economic consulting “connected with implementation of the

IL THE CONDUCT OF VSZP AND STATE-OWNED HOSPITALS

Achmea submits that VSZP had recently communicated to the Association of Slovak
Hospitals (“ASH”) new terms and conditions relating to the contracts between VSZP
and individual State-owned hospitals.''* The Respondent denies that V&ZP played
any coordinating role in these changes, and, in any event, that the conduct of V8ZP.
could be attributed to the Slovak Republic.'*

On 17 June 2013, Ing. Marcel Forai, MPH Director General of VSZP sent a
communication concerning “Price offer for completed hospitalisations” to the Director
of Children’s University Hospital Kosice."*® In his letter, Director General Forai sent an
“offer for prices for completed hospitalizations”, and indicated that VSZP would make
contracts with these prices, provided that:

Ww the provider submits a firm price offer for completed hospitalisations
and separately paid performances form other insurance companies;

(ii) the firm price offer must be at the same or higher amount, with due
reflection of surcharges, for all departments for which the provider has
a contract in place with health insurance companies; and

(iii) the contract with the other health insurance company does not contain
a provision on digressive price for completed hospitalisations if
payments for performances are made in excess of the scope agreed in
the contract. '"®

meeting(s) with officials of the Ministry of Healthcare, (iii) outcome of negotiations with

(Minister of Health) and Ing. Forai (Director General of VSZP) were both invited to the
meeting.'’® Representatives of 19 Slovak hospitals attended the meeting. ‘®

In the course of the month of July 2013, 17 State-owned hospitals (of which 15 had
attended the 26 June 2013 meeting) delivered termination notices to Union, effective
as of 30 September 2013, although several of the relevant contracts had expiration
dates of 30 June 2014,'7°

The Parties hold starkly opposing views on the role of VSZP and ASH in these
developments, as the Respondent denies that the Ministry of Health had anything to
do with the termination of the contracts. On 11 September 2013, the Respondent
submitted a letter from the Ministry of Health, addressed to the Ministry of Finance,
indicating that it did not issue any instruction, proposal or position regarding the
contractual relationship between the hospitals and Union.'?"

ANALYSIS

Pursuant to PO1, the present proceedings have been bifurcated in a phase dealing
with all of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, and a merits
phase."° The present ruling addresses the Slovak Republic’s objections to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Achmea’s various claims.

A. INTRODUCTORY MATTERS

1. Applicable procedural law

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is contingent upon the provisions of the Agreement on
encourag it and recip ion of ir between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic.'?” On the applicable
procedural rules, Article 8(5) of that BIT provides that “[t]he arbitration tribunal shall
determine its own procedure applying the arbitration rules of the United Nations
Commission for International Trade Law”."?°

 

 

In PO1, the Tribunal confirmed that the UNCITRAL Rules govern the present
proceedings, “[s]ave as otherwise agreed by the Parties and subject to the provisions
of [PO1] and any subsequent Procedural Order by the Tribunal’.’”° It further stated
that:

“[flor issues not dealt with in the Rules, the Tribunal shall apply

such rules as may be agreed upon by the Parties. In the absence

of any such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply such rules as it
deems appropriate”.'°°

2. Applicable substantive law

Article 33 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that “[t]he arbitral tribunal shall apply the
law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute”. '*"

For its part, Article 8(6) of the BIT provides as follows on the issue of the substantive
law applicable to the dispute:

“The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking
into account in particular though not exclusively:

- the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

- the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements
between the Contracting Parties;

- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;

- the general principles of international law”. '**
The Tribunal decided, in PO1, that the place of arbitration shall be Geneva, and it
further clarified that “[t]his choice of the place of arbitration in no way affects the law
applicable to the merits of the dispute” and that “Article 187 of the Swiss Code on
Private International Law merely serves as guidance and is not a mandatory provision

in these proceedings”. '**

3. Interpretative approach

Under the relevant provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the
“Vienna Convention” or the “VCLT”),"** which codify customary international law, the
Tribunal shall interpret the provisions of the BIT in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose. "*®

4. Jurisdictional requirements under the Netherlands—Slovak
Republic BIT

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is contingent upon the provisions of the BIT, Article 8 of
which reads in relevant part:

“4. All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of
the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter
shall if possible, be settled amicably.

2. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute
referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if
the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six
months from the date either party to the dispute requested
amicable settlement”.

182 Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, Article 8(6) (Exh. C-1).

138 bO1, {| 3.2. Article 187 of the Swiss Code on Private International Law reads as follows: “1. The
arbitral tribunal shall rule according to the law chosen by the parties or, in the absence of such
choice, according to the law with which the action is most closely connected. 2. The parties may
authorize the arbitral tribunal to rule according to equity”.

* Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Done at Vienna on 23 May 1969, entered into force on
27 January 1980, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (Exh. RLA-32). Both State Parties to the BIT are also parties
to the Vienna Convention. The Netherlands acceded to the VCLT on 9 April 1985. Czechoslovakia
acceded to the VCLT on 29 July 1987, and the Slovak Republic succeeded Czechoslovakia as a
State Party on 28 May 1993.

138 Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, Article 8(1) and (2) (Exh. C-1).

108.

110.

111.

Accordingly, Article 8 articulates four jurisdictional requirements. There must be (i) a
dispute, (ii) between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party, (iii) concerning an investment, and (iv) which has not been settled amicably
within a period of six months from the date either party to the dispute requested
amicable settlement. The Parties disagree on whether a further condition exists
requiring the Claimant to show that it has a prima facie case on the merits. This latter
point will be discussed further below under Section C.

It is undisputed between the Parties, that the Claimant is a Dutch national and thus a
qualifying investor pursuant to Article 1(b)(ii) of the Treaty.” Save for one issue, it is
equally undisputed that the Claimant made an investment in accordance with the
Article 1(a) of the Treaty." Indeed, Achmea’s investment comprises the totality of
Union’s shares. The Respondent has not objected that such investment is not
protected under the BIT. However, the Respondent objects that Achmea’s indirect
shareholdings in Union Commercial or other Slovak companies would not qualify as
protected investments under Article 1(a) of the Treaty.'*®

More generally, the Respondent objects to the existence of a dispute under Article 8
of the BIT," and argues as indicated above that the Claimant has failed to state a
prima facie case."*' The Respondent further submits that the six-month waiting period
provided for in Article 8 (2) of the Treaty has not been respected.'*? Finally, it
contends that Article 8 of the Treaty is incompatible with EU law, thus rendering its
expression of consent contained therein inoperative. '**

5. Jurisdiction vs. admissibility

Before considering the objections raised by the Slovak Republic, the Tribunal
addresses, for the sake of clarity, the question of their characterization as either to the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal or to the admissibility of the claims, over which there
appears to be a certain disagreement between the Parties.

"37 article 1(b)(ii) of the BIT provides that, for the purposes of the treaty, the term “investors” comprises

“natural persons having the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its law”
Exh. C-1).

188 Article 1(a) of the BIT, for the purposes of the treaty, provides that the term “investments” shall
comprise “every kind of asset invested either directly or through an investor of a third State and
more particularly, though not exclusively: (i) movable and immovable property and all related
property rights; (ii) shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures, as
well as rights derived therefrom; (iii) title to money and other assets and to any performance having
an economic value; (iv) rights in the field of intellectual property, also including technical processes,
goodwill and know-how; (v) concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions
to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources” (Exh. C-1).

112. In essence, the Claimant submits that the Respondent waived the possibility to raise
any admissibility objections to Achmea’s claims because it failed to do so in its brief
on its preliminary objections, as indicated in the Tribunal’s letter accompanying
P01." For its part, the Respondent retorts that Achmea’s argumentation is irrelevant
since, besides being wrong, it “elevates form over substance”.“® The UNCITRAL
Rules do not entertain a distinction between objections to jurisdiction and objections
to admissibility, and, in any event, the Tribunal has all latitude to qualify the objections
as it deems fit, notwithstanding the fact that the Respondent has opted to label them
as objections targeted at the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. "**

113. The Tribunal first notes that the Respondent insisted on having the first phase cover
both objections on grounds of jurisdiction and admissibility. It is in this light that the
Tribunal ordered the Respondent to file all its objections in its first brief, failing which
the Tribunal would consider that it waived its right to do so further along the
proceedings. It did so in the following terms:

“the Respondent shall file a statement containing all and any of its
objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and to the admissibility
of Claimant's claims to be submitted on or before 14 June 2013,
failing which the Respondent will have waived the possibility to
raise any further objections thereafter’. '*”

114. The Tribunal further notes that “admissibility” and “jurisdiction” are two distinct legal
concepts under international law, which governs the judicial function of international
courts and tribunals."® This distinction, which finds its origin in domestic legal
systems,® has not been strictly enforced at the international level,"*° and has
received varying treatment or even been disregarded in the investment treaty
context.'** Some investment tribunals have, in particular, pointed out that the term

and concept of “admissibility” is absent from the instruments that govern their
jurisdiction, such as the relevant investment treaty and the ICSID Convention. ®?

115. The jurisdiction of a tribunal goes to the power to decide a specific dispute, whereas
admissibility relates to the ability to exercise that power and speaks to the
characteristics of a particular claim and whether it is fit to be heard by a tribunal. As
Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice said:

“there is a clear jurisprudential distinction between an objection to
the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and an objection to the substantive
admissibility of the claim. The latter is a plea that the tribunal
should rule the claim inadmissible on some ground other than its
ultimate merits: the former is a plea that the tribunal itself is
incompetent to give any ruling at all whether as to the merits or as
to the admissibility of the claim. A successful challenge to the
jurisdiction stops all further proceedings in the case, or at any rate
ensures that there is no finding on the merits. But an unsuccessful
jurisdictional plea leaves open the possibility that a finding on the
ultimate merits may still be excluded through a decision given
against the substantive admissibility of the claim”."°°

116. The key element to determine the jurisdictional character of an objection is assessing
whether it addresses the Parties’ consent to the relevant dispute settlement
mechanism, and the scope of such consent. As the ICJ considered in Certain
Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that:

“in determining the scope of the consent expressed by one of the
parties, the Court pronounces on its jurisdiction and not on the
admissibility of the application”.*™*

117. In that case, the Court was confirming its finding in Armed Activities on the Territory of
the Congo, that “its jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties and is confined
to the extent accepted by them”,"®® and that “any conditions to which such consent is

subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon’.'*° The Court concluded

raised by one of the Parties.

that “the examination of such conditions relates to its jurisdiction and not to the
admissibility of the application”."°”

 

118. These consi ions are equally i in the i It treaty context. For
example, the tribunal in Micula found that:

“[Whhen an objection relates to a requirement contained in the text
on which consent is based, it remains a jurisdictional objection. If
such a requirement is not satisfied, the Tribunal may not examine
the case at all for lack of jurisdiction. By contrast, an objection
relating to admissibility will not necessarily bar the Tribunal from
examining the case if the reasons for the inadmissibility of the
claim are capable of being removed and are indeed removed at a
subsequent stage. In other words, consent is a prerequisite for the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal’.'°?

119. Hence, any and all objections grounded on the BIT provision that contains the State’s
consent to international arbitration for the solution of an investment dispute address
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. This rule was expressed with particular clarity in Daimler.

“[a]ll BIT-based dispute resolution provisions [...] are by their very
nature jurisdictional. The mere fact of their inclusion in a bilateral
treaty indicates that they are reflections of the sovereign
agreement of two States — not the mere administrative creation of
arbitrators. They set forth the conditions under which an investor-
State tribunal may exercise jurisdiction with the contracting state
parties’ consent, much in the same way in which legislative acts
confer jurisdiction upon domestic courts”.

120. While the Tribunal must, if necessary, examine issues of jurisdiction of its own
volition, questions of admissibility may only be examined if they are raised by the
Parties."® In light of the fact that the Respondent has only raised objections relating
to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the Tribunal will accordingly not engage in its own
admissibility analysis, but rather consider whether one or more of the objections
already raised by the Respondent need to be re-qualified as issues of admissibility. It
recalls that under paragraphs 7.1 and 8.7 of PO1,"*' the Tribunal is expressly called
to decide at this stage on both its jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims
submitted.

The Tribunal will now address each objection in turn. In the making of its ruling the
Tribunal has observed Article 8(7) of the BIT, as well as Articles 31 and 32 of the
UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal notes that, in its analysis, it addresses the dispositive
and outcome-determinative arguments raised by the Parties; it does not include a
consideration of each and every specific argument raised by the Respondent in
support of its objections, or by the Claimant in response to such objections. Even if
not explicitly addressed in its ruling, the Tribunal wishes to stress that it carefully
considered all of the Parties’ oral and written submissions.

 

B. FIRST OBJECTION: THERE IS NO LEGAL DISPUTE

1. The Respondent's position

The Respondent submits that Achmea’s expropriation claim is premature and
hypothetical since there is no dispute under the Treaty. In addition, the Tribunal’s
decision on such a claim would not have practical and concrete consequences, and
would ultimately be an impermissible advisory opinion falling outside the ambit of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In essence, Achmea’s attempt to create a “stand-by tribunal”,
so the Respondent argues, is an abuse of rights.

The Slovak Republic submits that Achmea’s expropriation claim fails to qualify as a
“dispute” under Article 8 of the BIT.'® A dispute requires a “conflict of claims and
rights”,'©? and the existence of a dispute is a “jurisdictional threshold [that] must be
met at the time of commencement of proceedings”."™

The requirement that the actual controversy must be “concrete” is “well recognized in
international jurisprudence” and is meant to prevent tribunals from engaging in
“abstract disagreements over administrative policies” and to protect States from
unnecessary litigation and from judicial interference “until the act at issue has been
executed”. "©

The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) has stated that its contentious jurisdiction
authorizes it to “pronounce judgment only in connection with concrete cases where
there exists at the time of adjudication an actual controversy involving a conflict of
legal interests between the parties”.

126. The requirement of concreteness has likewise been recognized in the investment
arbitration context,'®” and more particularly in the expropriation context." In AES, the
tribunal held that jurisdiction depends on “legal issues in relation with a concrete
situation” and that “the tribunal’s determination must have some practical and
concrete consequences”.’®° In that case, jurisdiction was found on the basis of
statutory provisions in force, including an executive decree, a national emergency law
and posterior decrees of application, as well as a documented claim for
compensation. The Claimant has not pointed, and cannot point, to any similar
elements in the instant proceedings."”°

127. In the Mariposa case, the tribunal found that “the claim came into existence only
when the expropriation was enforced”."”' The same conclusion was reached in
Aminoil and Glamis Gold."’? In Glamis Gold, for example, the tribunal held that “mere
threats of expropriation or nationalization are not sufficient to make such a claim
tipe”."75

128. In the instant case, the Project Plan is non-binding and optional, and as such “the
issue is not fit for jurisdiction’.'* The Slovak Republic further submits that “no one
currently knows the ultimate modalities of a possible expropriation. And yet it is
precisely those modalities that will determine whether the criteria for a lawful
expropriation under Article 5 of the Treaty are satisfied”.""° This is so because the
Respondent can lawfully expropriate Achmea’s investment under the Treaty, so long
as it does so in accordance with the terms of Article 5.‘ As counsel for the
Respondent presented the issue at the hearing:

“some expropriations are lawful and some expropriations are not
and therefore in order for a tribunal to judge an expropriation under
article 5 you must know the facts. And you simply do not and
cannot know the facts. No one does”.'””

129. According to the Slovak Republic, Achmea does not deny that the existence of a
dispute is an objective matter for the Tribunal to determine when considering
jurisdiction." And if no dispute exists, “a conclusion of incompetence or fin de non-

recevoir must follow”.'”°

130. The alleged disagreement over the potential expropriation outlined in the Project Plan
is “optional, vague, and without any legal effect”.'®° Given that an expropriation may
be conducted in a legal manner, “an expropriation claim arises only when an
expropriation law is actually applied against an investor”.'*"

131. Relying on Malicorp and SAUR, together with Articles 1, 2 and 12 of the International
Law Commission's Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful

must be a claim that a violation of the Treaty has actually occurred because only then
international responsibility can arise."®

132. In fact, contends the Respondent, Achmea has not pointed to a single investment
arbitration case where allegations of a future expropriation were deemed to constitute
a dispute."*

133. The Parties’ disagreements about possible, future events are not sufficient to
constitute a dispute in the absence of an allegation of a past or ongoing breach of the

134. A dispute under Article 8 of the BIT requires allegations of a past or ongoing violation,
and Achmea does not allege any such violation of Article 5 of the Treaty. '®”

135. On the Claimant's reliance on the Certain German Interests in Upper Silesia case,'®*
the Respondent argues that the instant case is different from the one decided by the
Permanent Court of International Justice (“PClJ”) because Poland had actually taken
a first legislative step, which the Slovak Republic has not done here.’®® Furthermore,
counsel for the Respondent noted that “the statement of intention [in that case] was
not just a statement of intention, it in fact had direct legal consequences. The legal
consequences were that it placed a restriction on the property owner's right to
alienate the property inter vivos”."® Finally, the Respondent notes that the treaty
providing for the jurisdiction of the Court, the Geneva Convention, expressly provided
for a mandate to issue advisory opinions, which is absent from the BIT.'®*

136. Relying on AES, the Respondent maintains that one of the elements of the test of
jurisdiction consists in determining “if the Tribunal’s determination of the answer to be
given to these issues would have some practical and concrete consequences”, '%*

which would not be the case in the instant arbitration.

137. Indeed, the type of relief requested — that the Slovak Republic be ordered to refrain
from expropriating — “is impermissible under public international law and is too vague
to have any concrete or practical consequence”.'®* Under Articles 31 and 34 of the
ILC Articles," the remedies available against a State in international law are limited
to restitution, compensation and satisfaction. '**

138. The Tribunal “cannot impose a ‘penalty or a pre-emptive ban on the Slovak
Republic’s sovereign power to legislate [...] because any relief against a State is
available only if and after the State violates an international legal obligation”."** Thus,
Achmea does not have standing to bring an expropriation claim.” In the

Respondent's submission, the Claimant has “failed to provide any legal authority for
its bold assertion that a ‘financial penalty’ is a permissible remedy”."%*

139. The Claimant has asked the Tribunal to order the Slovak Republic to refrain from
expropriating its investment “on the terms of the Project Plan or materially similar
terms”.'°° The Respondent submits that, even if the relief sought was permissible,
and it is not, “the terms of the Project Plan are far too vague and optional to
understand what ‘[those] or materially similar terms’ could be”.?° Accordingly, the
Tribunal’s decision on the expropriation claim would be “too vague and would not
have any practical and ‘concrete’ legal consequences”.””

140. The legal authorities cited by Achmea confirm that specific performance is a possible
form of relief only as a form of restitution after a breach has occurred; the cited
passages from Professor Schreuer’s academic writings relate to cases in which
specific performance was ordered as a form of restitution for breaches that had
already occurred.”°

141. In the Respondent's submission, the jurisdictional character of the issue of remedies
has been confirmed by several tribunals, including the tribunals in AES, Continental
Casualty, Telefonica, and Total.?°

142. Given that the basis for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is Article 8 of the Treaty, the
Tribunal must consider whether this provision allows for the relief sought by
Achmea.”™ Given that the expropriation claim seeks relief that is impermissible under
public international law, this bars the Tribunal’s jurisdiction rationae materiae.”°°

143. The Slovak Republic contends that the Claimant is actually asking the Tribunal to
issue an advisory opinion, whose purpose as understood by the ICJ is “not to settle —
at least directly — disputes between States, but to offer legal advice to the organs and

institutions requesting the opinion”.?* During the hearing, counsel for the Respondent
submitted that “[n]o BIT tribunal has ever made itself available to engage in this
process, nor [...] has any other investor to [his] knowledge ever asked a tribunal to do
s0”.27

An ex-ante assessment of the legality of the Slovak Government's policy choice to re-
introduce a unitary public health insurance system is manifestly outside the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction,?° since the Slovak Republic and the Netherlands “did not agree to grant
an arbitral tribunal such extraordinary jurisdiction under the Treaty”.7°

The Respondent rejects the Claimant's submission that, under its broad definition of
“dispute”, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to “pre-assess whether a possible act would
violate Article 5 of the Treaty simply because the Slovak Republic might expropriate
property owned by Dutch investors”.”"° Article 8 of the Treaty cannot be interpreted to
allow for such premature and hypothetical claims;?"' had the parties to the Treaty
intended to provide for advisory opinions they would have done so.?"

In fact, the phrase “all disputes” in Article 8 of the Treaty should be read in context, as
provided for under the Vienna Convention.?* According to the Respondent, “[t]he
other provisions of the treaty [...] establish certain rights, they impose damages if
there is a breach of those rights and indeed BIT tribunals have uniformly decided
jurisdictional objections on this basis”.2"*

Finally, the Slovak Republic submits that “Achmea is not seriously interested in
pursuing the claims as stated in its Statement of Claim” and has brought them with
the hope to “keep this Tribunal available long enough to instantaneously hear
Achmea’s future, new claims if and when the expropriation of [its] investment actually
occurs” as evidenced by ‘[t]he striking absence of any submissions on quantum”.?"®
During the hearing, counsel for the Respondent expanded on this argument in the
following terms:

“Achmea clearly plans an ever moving attack on the legislative process for

148. Citing the findings of the investment tribunals in Phoenix Action and Mobil, the
Respondent contends that the abuse-of-rights doctrine is a fundamental principle of
international law;?"” and refers to Lauterpacht to state that “[t]here is no right, however
well established, which could not, in some circumstances, be refused recognition on
the ground that it has been abused”.?"

149. Accordingly, the Claimant's attempt to create a “stand-by” tribunal constitutes an
abusive use of the Treaty*'® and Achmea’s claims should be dismissed on this ground
as well.?2°

2. The Claimant's position

150. The Claimant, for its part, maintains (i), that there is a dispute between the Parties
and, (ii), that there is no additional requirement of concreteness. In any event, (iii), the
present dispute is concrete, while (iv), the appropriateness of the relief sought goes to
the merits of the case.

151. The ICJ has defined a “dispute” as “[a] disagreement on a point of law or fact, or
conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons”.”*' In other words, ‘ijt
must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other”.”

152. A dispute between the Parties clearly exists, because Achmea’s view is that the
expropriation as contemplated in the Project Plan, if carried out, would be unlawful
and would violate Article 5 of the BIT, and the Respondent holds the opposite view.
Furthermore, it is in Achmea’s interest to remain in the Slovak market and it is in the
Respondent's interest to expropriate Achmea’s investment.”*>

153. The requirement of concreteness as referred to by the Respondent is based on an
erroneous interpretation of the cases it cites; in fact, there is no such requirement

implying that an expropriation dispute can only be concrete enough for a tribunal to
d 224

have jurisdiction if the expropriation in question is completed.

154. Achmea submits that the “requirement of concreteness”, referred to by the Tribunal in
AES, “merely means that an arbitral tribunal in the context of the ICSID [C]onvention
is not meant to be constituted only to decide a purely academic question in absence
of a dispute”.?*° Furthermore, quoting Schreuer, the Claimant contends that “[a]ctual
or concrete damage is not required before such a party may bring legal action”.

155. In the Headquarters Agreement case, the ICJ found that there was a dispute; that the
legislation in question — measures by the United States purporting to close the PLO
Mission to the United Nations — had not yet been implemented did not exclude the
existence of a dispute.”””

156. Glamis Gold and Aminoil, cited by the Slovak Republic, do not support the
Respondent's position, because these awards concern legal instruments requiring
that damages be incurred or that the relevant contract be breached before a claim
could be filed.?”°

157. In any event, even if the Tribunal finds that a requirement of concreteness does
apply, the present dispute is concrete enough and Achmea has described exactly
which past, present and future actions by the Slovak Republic it considers to be in
violation of the BIT: “the Slovak Republic has breached the BIT and is still breaching
the BIT by failing to protect Achmea’s investment, and by actively taking steps to
harm that investment and to unlawfully expropriate it”.?2°

158. On the relief it seeks, the Claimant submits that it is a matter to be dealt with in the
merits phase. It further argues that “[a]part from the fact that Achmea is requesting
several types of relief that the Slovak Republic does not dispute can be granted (such
as declaratory and monetary relief), Achmea is entitled within the boundaries of
Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules to ‘amend or supplement’ its claims ‘during the

The Claimant furthermore submits that, contrary to the Respondent's assertions, it is
not seeking a legal opinion from the Tribunal." It also rejects the Slovak Republic's
submission that Achmea is attempting to create a “stand-by” tribunal.?*

In fact, there is no applicable rule that prohibits the Tribunal from ordering the relief
sought by Achmea.”** The Claimant submits that “[pJermitting arbitral penalties is part
of the contemporary tendency to reinforce the effectiveness of the arbitral process”.?*
It also quotes from Schreuer, who has said that “[t]he ability to order specific
performance is a power that is inherent in a tribunal's jurisdiction””*> and that “[tJhere
is no doubt that an obligation imposed by an award that is expressed not in monetary
terms but in terms of an obligation to perform a particular act or to refrain from a
certain course of action is equally binding and gives rise to the effect of res
judicata” ?°*

Contrary to the Slovak Republic's allegations, Article 5 of the BIT does not guarantee
its right to expropriate foreign investments; rather, it forbids the Respondent from
expropriating and provides “an exception to the prohibition [...] under specific and

very narrowly defined circumstances”.”*”

3. Discussion

The Slovak Republic's first objection relates to the purported absence of a legal
dispute. The existence of a dispute is a specific requirement for the Tribunal to have
jurisdiction under the Treaty.

Article 8 (1) and (2) of the Treaty provides as follows:

“4. All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of
the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter
shall if possible, be settled amicably.

2. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute
referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if
the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six

months from the date either party to the dispute requested
amicable settlement’.”**

164. While the Claimant argues that the expression “all disputes” is broad and that, under
either definition advanced by the Parties in this instance, Achmea’s disagreement
with the Slovak Republic qualifies as a dispute under the BIT, the Respondent retorts
that a dispute within the meaning of Article 8 “requires an allegation that a breach of
the Treaty has occurred’. Furthermore, the Slovak Republic also argues that
Achmea’s claims have no plausible chance to succeed on the merits.

165. The Treaty does not define the term “dispute”. Article 8(1) provides that “all disputes”
ing an i shall if possible be settled amicably. Article 8(2) provides in
relevant part that any dispute that could not be settled amicably, can be submitted to

166. Black's Law Dictionary defines “dispute” as “[a] conflict or controversy; a conflict of
claims of rights; an assertion of a right, claim, or demand on one side, met by contrary
claims or allegations on the other’”.”°

167. The notion of dispute was discussed at length by the Permanent Court of
International Justice (the “PCIJ”) and its successor, the International Court of Justice
(the “ICJ”). In Mavrommatis, the PClJ defined a dispute as “[a] disagreement on a
point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons”.”"*
The ICJ clarified that the assessment of whether a dispute exists must be subject to
an objective determination.2*? It is not sufficient that the Claimant alleges the
existence of a dispute,” nor is it sufficient for the Respondent to deny the existence
of a dispute.” In the South West Africa cases, the ICJ further indicated that a mere
conflict of interests is not sufficient, but that “[i]t must be shown that the claim of one
party is positively opposed by the other’.**° Finally, the ICJ also held that “[t]he

existence of a dispute does not depend on the objective validity of the claims”.° For
instance, in the East Timor case, the Court held that by virtue of Australia’s denial of
the complaints formulated, rightly or wrongly, by Portugal, there was a legal
dispute.4”

168. A dispute may involve a complaint of fact or law. There is no need to delve into the
question of what a dispute of fact means. A disagreement on a point of law may relate
to the existence, interpretation or application of a legal provision. It appears from the
case law of the ICJ and its predecessor that the existence of a dispute is readily
acknowledged where a claimant submits specific and argued claims, which are
denied by a respondent.”* Hence, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction, it suffices if it
is established that there is a conflict of legal views between the Parties, whether the
Claimant will seek from the Respondent a relief arising from the existence of legal
rights rather than only factual interests which would not be legally protected. In turn,
this will beg a second question, namely whether the dispute concerns an investment
and is thus not of a political or commercial nature. In the present instance, the issue
goes to whether Achmea formulated claims of a “legal nature” which were denied or
rejected by the Respondent prior to the institution of these proceedings.

169. There can be no doubt that the Parties have stated opposing views on the
Respondent's conduct and its impact on the Claimant's rights under the Article 5 of
the BIT. According to the Claimant, the Slovak Republic has engaged in conduct,
through the adoption of the Intention Statement, the Project Plan and the draft
Transformation Act, including government resolutions approving such documents and
public statements related thereto, which it believes warrants redress under the Bit?

170. On 23 July 2012, Achmea’s chairman, Mr. Willem van Duin, signified his concern
about announcements that the Slovak Republic was considering gaining control of
Union “through an expropriation, or measures similarly designed to force Achmea to
abandon control over its investment’.?°° He also indicated that “[s]uch measures will
again cause significant damage to Achmea’.”*' He further specified that there was no
public interest justifying the removal of privately-owned health insurance companies
from the Slovak market and that such removal would appear discriminatory since it
would only target foreign-owned businesses.”** The Slovak Government responded to
this letter on 31 July 2012 by referring to its principled right under the BIT to
expropriate foreign investors of their investment, and opining that the Government's

statements or its approval of the Intention Statement are not capable of causing harm
to Achmea:

“[I]t has to be stated that such a treaty [i.e., the BIT] allows for
dispossession of a foreign investor of its investment for reasons of
public interest, in compliance with the law and in a non-
discriminatory manner, provided that the Slovak Republic will be
obliged to pay to the investor without undue delay a fair
compensation.

The Government of the Slovak Republic does not believe that its
statements and approval of the intention to implement a unitary
public health insurance system in the Slovak Republic might be
capable of causing any damage to Achmea’.**

171. In the 17 December 2012 letter addressed to the Prime Minister of the Slovak
Republic, Achmea summarized its dispute with the Slovak Republic as follows:

“In essence, this dispute concerns your government's unjustified
determination to remove Achmea’s operations from the Slovak
public health insurance market, despite the fact that Achmea — as
Achmea has communicated on several occasions — wishes and is
entitled to continue these operations. The removal of Achmea’s
investment by way of an expropriation as contemplated in the
Project Plan clearly violates the BIT and other applicable law; and
so do the negotiations contemplated in the Project Plan for a so-
called ‘voluntary buy-out’ of Achmea’s investment which — even if
Achmea would want to enter into such negotiations (which it does
not) - are manifestly unfair and not voluntary at all, since they
would be conducted under the threat that Achmea’s investment will
be expropriated if no agreement is reached”.*

172. Furthermore, in its Notice of Arbitration, Achmea specified that:

“A dispute exists between Achmea and the Slovak Republic
concerning Achmea’s investment. The dispute in essence
concerns the Slovak Republic’s determination to remove Achmea’s
investment from the Slovak health insurance market [...], whereas
Achmea wishes to retain and continue its investment in the Slovak
health insurance market [...]

The dispute between Achmea and the Slovak Republic pertains to
the BIT. The expropriation of Achmea’s investment contemplated
by the Slovak Republic, should comply with Articles 5 and 3 of the
BIT, which it does not’.**°

173. Achmea’s legal position was consistently denied by the Slovak Republic, arguing first
and foremost that the Slovak Republic is entitled within the limits of Article 5 of the
BIT to make use of its sovereign prerogative to expropriate foreign assets. That a
dispute exists between the Parties on the proper interpretation of Article 5 became

overwhelmingly apparent at the hearing, where both Parties adopted diametrically
opposed interpretations of that provision. While the Slovak Republic insisted on its
principled right to expropriate foreign assets in accordance with the conditions set out
in Article 5 of the BIT, the Claimant argued that this provision enshrined a prohibition
of expropriation, entailing a series of legal consequences in terms of available relief.
For the Claimant, the Slovak Republic was:

“trying to prohibit effective enforcement of a BIT provision that
prohibits expropriation. If you look at article 5 it says, ‘neither
contracting party shall expropriate unless’, and that is a prohibition.
Any effective enforcement of that prohibition requires that we have
the right to submit to your tribunal any arguments that we have on
that prohibition before that prohibition is breached”.”°°

And the Claimant continued:

“the principal rule of article 5 is, and it starts that way if you read
the article: neither party shall expropriate. Then there is an unless
clause which says ‘unless’ and then follow three conditions that
have to be complied with. Our submission is that is a clear
prohibition, there is one exception, they are permitted to
demonstrate that that exception applies, they can do that, but
unless and until they have done so the principal rule, the starting
point, the words that the article starts out with, apply in full
force”.”°”

Arguing the contrary, the Respondent stated that:

“it is our submission, clearly, that nothing in the treaty should
prevent the Slovak Republic from engaging in that discussion, from
engaging in consideration of the issue, and in fact all other issues
related to the possibility of a unitary system.

Now, then | think | heard, well, they haven't explained what the
public purpose is. There is no statement of public purpose in these
documents that we have looked at. In the documents so far, what
is the obligation to state the public purpose? There is no obligation
at this point’.**

The foregoing clearly shows that the two Parties hold radically opposing views on the
proper interpretation of Article 5 of the BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that a
dispute exists between the Parties.

The Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent’s attempt to add requirements
under the heading of the existence of a dispute. It is the Respondent's submission
that for a dispute to exist (i) the Claimant must have alleged that a breach has already
occurred; (ii) the Claimant bears the burden of showing that the actual controversy is
concrete; and (iii) the relief sought must be permissible.

181.

The Respondent argued that “[a] ‘dispute’ within the meaning of Article 8 requires an
allegation that a breach of the Treaty has occurred’. In particular, a disagreement
on possible future conduct is not sufficient to constitute a dispute “in the absence of
an allegation of a past or ongoing breach of the Treaty”. The Respondent relied in
this respect on Malicorp v. Egypt, where the tribunal held that the allegation of a
treaty breach is a jurisdictional requirement,’ and on SAUR v. Argentina, where the
tribunal held that “si les lois 4 caractére général et leur application concréte par les
autorités argentines constituent une violation des droits conférés a un investisseur
étranger par le Traité Bilatéral, alors un différend d’ordre juridique prend
effectivement naissance entre un investisseur et le pays d’accueil”.?

The Respondent called attention to the fact that Achmea acknowledged that it was
not yet expropriated of its investment. Achmea only claims that if the expropriation
were carried out on the terms of the Project Plan or on materially similar terms, then it
would breach Article 5 of the BIT. Hence, Achmea acknowledged that no breach of
Article 5 had yet occurred.

In the view of the Tribunal, the question of whether the Claimant alleged a breach of
Article 5 of the BIT is of little relevance for the determination of whether a dispute on
the interpretation and application of Article 5 exists. Indeed, the Respondent conflates
the question of the existence of a legal dispute and the law of international
responsibility.° It does not follow from the fact that international responsibility can
arise only after an internationally wrongful act has occurred, that an internationally
wrongful act is required for a legal dispute to exist. In other words, the allegation of a
breach is not a constitutive element of the notion of legal dispute but rather a
requirement for liability to arise. In any event, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has
alleged that the Slovak Republic was obliged under Article 5 of the Treaty to state a
public interest in the Project Plan, and that a failure to do so warrants review by the
present Tribunal. Whatever the outcome of that argument, at the present juncture, the
Tribunal cannot but find that there is a legal dispute between the Parties on the
correct interpretation of Article 5 of the Treaty.

Moreover, the cases relied upon by the Respondent are of no help here. Malicorp is
inapposite to the extent that the tribunal in that case enumerated various jurisdictional
requirements, amongst which were the existence of a dispute, and, additionally, the

allegation of a breach of the bilateral investment treaty.” Hence, it is incorrect to
conclude that the allegation of a breach is a constitutive element of a legal dispute. As
regards SAUR, the Tribunal is also unconvinced of its relevance here. In that case,
the tribunal held that it did not fall within the ambit of its jurisdiction to adjudicate
measures of general application, such as legislative acts or instruments implementing
them, unless such “general laws and their specific implementation [...] violate the
tights conferred on the foreign investor under the bilateral treaty”, at which time one
could consider that a dispute of a legal nature arises.”°° While the Tribunal agrees
with the general conclusion reached by the tribunal in SAUR, it does not believe that
this question has to be resolved at the stage of determining whether a legal dispute
exists (which the SAUR tribunal in any case found to exist in that particular instance).
Deciding on a “general law’ is not the remedy sought in this arbitration, but would
rather be a step in the Tribunal’s reasoning to adjudicate on the Claimant’s requested
relief. Hence, if at all, such issue would rather arise at the stage of the so-called prima
facie test to which the Tribunal will revert below.

The Respondent also relied on the Northern Cameroons case to argue that a dispute
only exists if the Claimant can show that the actual controversy is “concrete”. The
Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent's reading of a concreteness requirement
into the notion of dispute is unsupported by the authorities it relies on. In Northern
Cameroons, the ICJ held that

“[t]he function of the Court is to state the law, but it may pronounce
judgment only in connection with concrete cases where there
exists at the time of the adjudication an actual controversy
involving a conflict of legal interests between the parties. The
Court’s judgment must have some practical consequence in the
sense that it can affect existing legal rights or obligations of the
parties, thus removing uncertainty from their legal relations. No
judgment on the merits in this case could satisfy these essentials
of the judicial function”.*°°

However, prior to that, the Court first held that a legal dispute existed between
Cameroon and the United Kingdom when proceedings were instituted, in light of “the
opposing views of the Parties as to the interpretation and application of relevant
articles of the Trusteeship Agreement’.””” It then indicated that some circumstances
may warrant the Court to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction, notably in pursuance of its

duty to safeguard its judicial function.” Since the dispute had become moot in the
course of the proceedings, the Court held that “to adjudicate on the merits would be
inconsistent with its judicial function”.”°° Hence, this decision does not support the
Respondent's reading of a specific concreteness requirement into the existence of a
legal dispute.

The Respondent's reliance on AES v. Argentina is equally unavailing. The
Respondent argued that investment treaty tribunals have recognized that “a claim
must be sufficiently concrete for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the
claim’.””° In particular, the AES tribunal held that:

“the true test of jurisdiction consists in determining

(a) whether, in its claim, AES raises some /egal issues in relation
with a concrete situation, and

(b) if the Tribunal’s determination of the answer to be given to
these issues would have some practical and concrete
consequences”.””'

Here again, this ruling needs to be put in its proper context. It is true that the AES
tribunal expressed the foregoing opinion in the context of its analysis on the existence
of a dispute. That said, the tribunal held that in the specific context of the ICSID
framework, two elements needed to be met for a dispute to be considered as having
a legal nature: “The first deals with the intrinsic definition of what is a legal dispute;
the second deals with the inherent logic which presided over the creation of ICSID”.””?
As regards the first element, i.e. the intrinsic definition of a dispute, the tribunal quotes
the classic Mavrommatis definition. As regards the second element, i.e. the inherent
logic underlining the creation of ICSID, the tribunal quotes Professor Schreuer’s
opinion that a dispute must have some practical relevance and cannot be purely
theoretical.’”* On that basis, the tribunal made the abovementioned determination on
what it qualifies as the “true test of jurisdiction” by reading a two-pronged
concreteness requirement into the notion of legal dispute, only to then reach the

conclusion that “AES' claim seems prima facie a substantial one”.?”*

cases’). See, id., p. 38.

attention — the duty to safeguard the judicial function. Whether or not at the moment the Application
was filed there was jurisdiction in the Court to adjudicate upon the dispute submitted to it,
circumstances that have since arisen render any adjudication devoid of purpose. Under these
conditions, for the Court to proceed further in the case would not, in its opinion, be a proper
discharge of its duties’).

186. Whatever the merits of the AES tribunal's analysis on this particular point, it does not
support the Respondent's interpretation. Indeed, the tribunal referred to the “intrinsic
definition of a dispute”, and then added a supplementary consideration which it held
to be specific to the ICSID framework. On this basis, the AES decision must be
distinguished from the present case, where the Tribunal should not deviate from the
definition developed in the jurisprudence of the ICJ and its predecessor referred to
above. It also app that the introduction of a requil into the
definition of a legal dispute conflates the question of the existence of a dispute with
the prima facie test developed by various investment tribunals, a separate question to
which the Tribunal will revert further below.

 

187. Finally, elaborating on its argument that a dispute can only exist if the Claimant
alleges that a breach has already occurred, the Respondent argued that the relief
sought by the Claimant is impermissible. For the Respondent, remedies in
international law are “strictly reparatory”, and damages are the only remedy available
to the Claimant under the BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot order the Respondent
to refrain from expropriating Achmea nor impose a penalty as requested by the
Claimant. For its part, the Claimant answered that the question of available remedies
is not a question for the jurisdictional stage, and even less so a constitutive element
of the definition of a legal dispute. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant.

188. In sum, the Tribunal finds that there is a conflict of legal views opposing the Parties
regarding the interpretation and application of Article 5 of the BIT. Hence, the Tribunal
finds that a dispute in the sense of Article 8 of the BIT exists. The Respondent's first
jurisdictional objection is accordingly dismissed.

investment tribunals, was set forth by Judge Higgins in her separate opinion in Oil
Platforms.” This test applies “under all investor-State arbitration clauses”.?”

190. The Slovak Republic further submits that “[e]arly dismissal of a claim for which there
is no prima facie merit fosters judicial economy’”.””* As stated in Impregilo, such early
dismissal seeks to prevent “courts and tribunals [from being] flooded with claims
which have no chance of success, or may even be of an abusive nature”.2°°

191. In the instant case, “[e]ven if Achmea’s factual allegations were assumed to be true —
and they are not — those facts are not capable of constituting a violation of the
Treaty”.?*"

192. Achmea’s expropriation claim fails on the merits because no unlawful expropriation
has occurred.” The Slovak Republic maintains that “[i]t is a basic principle of public
international law that preparatory conduct does not constitute a breach unless it is
specifically prohibited by an applicable rule”. Article 5 of the BIT only prohibits
measures depriving Achmea of its investments that do not meet the criteria for a
lawful deprivation set out therein; the Respondent argues that, however, “[nJothing in
Article 5 would prohibit the preparation of such measures”. As stated in Gabéikovo-
Nagymaros, preparatory conduct is not to be confused with the actual breach.78°

193. A prima facie cause of action is a basic precondition of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

the relief sought’.®’ This test should apply here, and the Claimant fails on all three
counts.

In reliance on Continental Casualty and Railroad Development, the Slovak Republic
argues that a “measure” does not exist until legislation is enacted and/or published,
thus becoming legally effective.” Here, the Project Plan does not have any “outward”
legal effect since it was adopted by the Cabinet in the form of a resolution and only
affects the Minister of Health, requiring her to prepare a draft bill. Hence, the
resolution is “an internal normative act that does not affect the rights of non-
government entities”.”*° This is further confirmed by the fact that a draft bill cannot be
challenged before the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic.” In the instant
case, the Tribunal does not have the power to adjudicate ex ante the enactment of a
possible law.”*!

As to Achmea’s assertion that “it knows with certainty that the expropriation, if it
happens, will be unlawful”, it is not supported by any evidence.” In sum, the
Claimant failed to show a prima facie case on the merits, and therefore Achmea’s
expropriation claim falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction rationae materiae.”*°

As to Achmea’s non-expropriation claims, they lack prima facie merit on the ground of
the “stunning absence of any quantitative analysis”.““* Given that proceedings were
bifurcated and not trifurcated, the Claimant was to quantify its claims in the Statement
of Claim.”* Having failed to do so, the Tribunal should find that it has no jurisdiction to
hear these claims. In any event, in view of the fact that Achmea’s client base actually
grew following the September 2012 acquisition campaign, to the detriment of the
other two competitors VSZP and Dovera, Achmea’s claim that it actually suffered any
damage does not withstand scrutiny.7°

The Respondent maintains that the central issue here is that Achmea’s non-
expropriation claims are all “ancillary” to the potential expropriation of its
investment.” The Slovak Republic's right lawfully to expropriate Achmea’s

investment would be rendered nugatory if preparatory conduct in the process could
constitute a violation of Article 3.7°° Achmea’s claim that announcements related to
the preparation of legislation for the establishment of a unitary health insurance
system violate the Treaty is contrary to the principle that preparatory work does not
violate international law,”*° and to the Slovak Republic's right under Article 5 of the
BIT and customary international law lawfully to expropriate Achmea’s investment.°°

“The government's announcement of a plan to proceed with
legislation to enable expropriation is inextricably linked to the
appropriation itself and it cannot be independently actionable” °°"
To announce the Project Plan was a basic requirement of a transparent democratic
legislative process. The BIT — which was executed between two democratic States —
cannot be interpreted to render such conduct internationally wrongful. °°?

As to the alleged changes to the regulatory framework, there is no complaint of any
actual change. The Claimant rather complains of “public statements of the intention to
re-introduce the unitary health insurance system”.° Such public statements of
intentions are an inherent part of the democratic legislative process and thus cannot
be interpreted as breaching the Treaty.°* They have no legal effect and cannot affect
Achmea’s rights.°° Accordingly, “this claim is wholly unsubstantiated”.°%°

The Claimant's allegations regarding the conduct of the state-owned V8ZP vis-a-vis
the association of hospitals, ASH, “is likewise prima facie without legal merit” because
“[t}he Slovak Republic is not internationally liable for the conduct of VSZP [... nJor has

proposal or position” in connection with the contractual relationship between the
Slovak hospitals and Union.*””

In sum, Achmea’s secondary claims are largely based on statements made by certain
individuals of the Government about a possible future law. These political statements
cannot violate the Treaty. Furthermore, “Achmea did not even allege — much less

prove — specific damages”.*"*

2. The Claimant's position

It is the Claimant's submission that there is no jurisdictional requirement under the
Treaty to state a prima facie case. In any event, should such a requirement exist,
Achmea has sufficiently shown that it has a prima facie cause of action.

“Achmea has shown a prima facie case of breach of the Treaty.
More importantly, however, there is no jurisdictional requirement

for Achmea to state a prima facie case at all under the Treaty”.*"?

The cases cited by the Slovak Republic supporting the existence of such a
requirement “involve arbitration clauses that qualify the types of disputes that may be
submitted to arbitration”.*"* For example, Saijpem dealt with a clause that covered
only disputes relating to compensation for expropriation or similar measures. In
Telenor, a clause allowing for the arbitration of disputes as to the amount or payment
of compensation for expropriation and other similar measures was at issue. In Oil
Platforms, the arbitration clause extended to a “dispute [...] as to the interpretation or
application of the [relevant] Treaty”. And finally, in /mpregilo there was a discussion
as to who the parties to the dispute were.*"* Achmea submits that, consequently, the
determination of jurisdiction in those cases required an assessment of whether the
dispute was of the type covered by the relevant arbitration clauses.°"*

In the instant case, by contrast, “no particular limitation as to the type of dispute that
may be submitted to arbitration applies” because Article 8 of the BIT covers “all
disputes” between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Party concerning
an investment of the latter.>"* Hence, there is no need for a prima facie test here.

As to the Respondent's argument that Achmea failed to quantify its damages in the
Statement of Claim, the Claimant retorts that neither Article 18 of the UNCITRAL
Rules, nor PO1, require Achmea to quantify its damages in the Statement of Claim.°"”

Achmea will quantify its damages when appropriate, that is in the merits phase. In
any event, the quantification of the Claimant's damages is not relevant for the
decision on jurisdiction and admissibility.°”

3. Discussion
a) The applicable standard

206. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae is limited to disputes concerning an
investment, as required by Article 8 of the BIT. Since the Claimant does not raise any
dispute regarding an investment approval or an investment agreement, but places
itself exclusively under the umbrella of the BIT, an essential element of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction ratione materiae is to determine whether the claims put forward by the
Claimant are capable of coming within the reach of these provisions. The so-called
prima facie test has been applied by numerous international courts and tribunals. In
Mavrommatis, the PClJ held that prior to engaging in the merits of the case it had to
ascertain whether the claim was capable of coming within the reach of the provisions
of the Mandate:

“The Court, before giving judgment on the merits of the case, will
satisfy itself that the suit before it, in the form in which it has been
submitted and on the basis of the facts hitherto established, falls to
be decided by application of the clauses of the Mandate”.°"°

207. In Ambatielos, the |CJ indicated that:

“The Court must determine, however, whether the arguments
advanced by the Hellenic Government in respect of the treaty
provisions on which the Ambatielos claim is said to be based, are
of a sufficiently plausible character to warrant a conclusion that the
claim is based on the Treaty. It is not enough for the claimant
Government to establish a remote connection between the facts of
the claim and the Treaty of 1886”.°7°

208. Judge Rosalyn Higgins further spelled out the so-called prima facie test in her
separate opinion in Oil Platforms:

“The only way in which, in the present case, it can be determined
whether the claims of [the applicant] are sufficiently plausibly
based upon the 1955 Treaty is to accept pro tem the facts as
alleged by [the claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret
Articles |, IV and X for jurisdictional purposes — that is to say, to

see if on the basis of [the claimant's] claims of fact there could
occur a violation of one or more of them”.

209. Numerous investment tribunals have also sought to establish at the jurisdictional
stage whether the facts as alleged by the Claimant, if established, “are capable of
coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked”.*”? For instance,
the tribunal in UPS v. Canada held that it:

“must conduct a prima facie analysis of the NAFTA obligations,
which UPS seeks to invoke, and determine whether the facts
alleged are capable of constituting a violation of these
obligations”.*”°

210. In Telenor, it was held that:

“The onus is on the Claimant to show what is alleged to constitute
expropriation is at least capable of doing so. There must, in other
words, be a prima facie case that the BIT applies”.°

211. In that case, the tribunal's jurisdiction was limited to claims of expropriation. Since the
claimant failed to put forward a claim of expropriation in its written submissions, the
tribunal found that the facts as asserted could not support a prima facie claim of
expropriation.°>

212. And in Saipem, the tribunal indicated that it would apply:

“a prima facie standard, both to the determination of the meaning
and scope of the relevant BIT provisions and to the assessment
whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these
provisions. In doing so, the Tribunal will assess whether Saipem’s
case is reasonably arguable on its face. If the result is affirmative,

will be is but the exi of will

Temain to be litigated on the merits”.*°

instruments’).

Finally, in Chevron v. Ecuador Ill, the tribunal made the following instructive
observations:

“The practical difficulty arises from the use of the Latin phrase
‘prima facie’. In the Tribunal’s view, it does not mean, at this early
procedural stage, that the Claimants must satisfy the Tribunal that
their case, as now pleaded, would necessarily prevail on the merits
if this arbitration were to proceed beyond the jurisdictional stage.
Nor can it mean, in a heavily adversarial procedure with both sides
here making very extensive submissions and submitting numerous
exhibits, that the Tribunal should only investigate the apparent
surface of the Claimants’ case on the merits. In other words, the
jurisdictional stage of this arbitration cannot take the form of a
preliminary hearing on the merits; but, conversely, the Claimants
must establish that their case is sufficiently serious to proceed to a
full hearing on the merits.

The Tribunal specifically facets as imposing too high a prima facie

the ission at the iction Hearing
that the Claimants must already have established their case with a
51% chance of success, i.e. on a balance of probabilities [...]; and
the Tribunal prefers, to this extent, the Claimants’ submissions that
their case should be ‘decently arguable’ or that it has ‘a reasonable
possibility as pleaded”.*”

 

The Claimant's attempt to distinguish the cases mentioned above from the present
case must be rejected. Since the Tribunal’s ambit of jurisdiction is limited to rule on
disputes involving the interpretation and application of the provisions of the BIT, and
the Claimant invokes the application of various provisions of the BIT, it behooves the
Tribunal to assess at this stage if the facts as alleged by the Claimant are susceptible
of coming within the reach of the provisions of the BIT. In this regard, whether the
scope of the BIT arbitration clause is large or restricted, will not cause a difference of
approach even if, in practice, the Claimant may have to show more in order to prove
prima facie compliance with a more restrictive arbitration clause. Using the Claimant’s
own words, “a determination about jurisdiction will involve an assessment of whether
the dispute is of the type referred to in the arbitration clause”.*” What will vary is not
that requirement but rather its extent in view of the wider or narrower ambit of that
clause, even if that clause covers all disputes, i.e. implicitly all disputes covered by
the BIT.

The Tribunal thus finds that at the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant must not only
establish that the jurisdictional requirements of the Treaty are met, which includes

Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 27 February 2012, {f] 4.7-4.8. The tribunal added
that “the Tribunal’s general approach in deciding the Respondent's jurisdictional objections under
the prima facie standard here requires an assumption of the truth of the relevant facts alleged by
the Claimants in the Notice of Arbitration (subject to the qualifications described above), excluding
however a disputed fact uniquely relevant to the existence or exercise of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
As to such disputed fact, the Tribunal is required either [to] finally decide the factual issue here (if it
can) or address it later pursuant to Article 21.4 (second sentence) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules”, 914.11.

proving the facts necessary to meet these requirements, but also that it has a prima
facie cause of action under the Treaty, that is, that the facts it alleges are capable of
falling under the relevant provisions of the BIT. This standard could itself be more or
less strict and for instance be phrased as “capable of falling within the reach of the
provision” or “susceptible of constituting a breach of the provision”. It is, however, not
necessary to decide on this issue and applying the more expansive approach outlined
above results in a test that, in this arbitration, will strike a proper balance between a
more exacting standard which would call for examination of the merits at the
jurisdictional stage,°”° and a less exacting standard which would confer excessive
weight to the Claimant's own characterization of its claims.

216. The prima facie test thus entails two consequences. First, the facts alleged by the
Claimant are in principle accepted to be true pro tem, without prejudice to any further
examination of the same facts which may be relevant at a further stage of the
proceedings.**° To paraphrase Salini v. Jordan, the Claimant is free to advance facts
it relies upon and claims it advances in the way it thinks appropriate.**' That facts are
assumed to be true for jurisdictional purposes derives from the circumstance that the
Claimant filed one submission containing allegations of fact and law relevant for the
merits, and the Respondent only filed submissions relating to its jurisdictional
objections. Hence, the Parties have not had a proper opportunity to provide the
Tribunal with their views on the pertinence of the facts alleged by the Claimant so far,
and even less to supply evidence about such facts.

217. Second, the onus is on the Claimant to show that the substantive BIT provision which
is relied upon is susceptible of finding application to the alleged facts. In other words,
the claim as formulated by the Claimant must be capable of coming within the reach
of the relevant provision. As recalled in Siemens, the Tribunal is not called upon to
enquire at this stage whether the claims made under the Treaty are well founded, as
this issue is properly reserved for the merits.°°

%2° For instance, the ICJ held that “[i]n the present phase it concerns the competence of the Court to
hear and pronounce upon this dispute. This issue being thus limited, the Court will avoid not only
all expression of opinion on matters of substance, but also any pronouncement which might
prejudge or appear to prejudge any eventual decision on the merits”. Fisheries Jurisdiction Case

5 It is to be noted that the Respondent agreed that for jurisdictional purposes it was willing to accept
that the Tribunal regard the facts as alleged by the Claimant to be true pro tem, thus defusing any
controversy over facts for the present exercise. See Objections, {If] 13, 73, citing the separate

While the Tribunal thought it inappropriate to include a concreteness requirement into
its analysis on the existence of legal dispute, it is of the view that greater weight
should be given to such a criterion at this juncture. As stated by the tribunal in AES v.
Argentina, the Claimant must raise in its claims “some legal issues in relation with a
concrete situation” and the Tribunal’s determination must have “some practical and
concrete consequences”.*** Indeed, it seems appropriate for the Claimant to show
that the facts it alleges are connected in law to the provisions it relies on to obtain
relief and that a pronouncement of this Tribunal would clarify the legal situation
between the Parties.

Whereas the Respondent only challenged the existence of a dispute regarding
Achmea's expropriation claim, the Respondent objected to all of Achmea’s claims on
the ground that they manifestly lack legal merit. The Tribunal will therefore now
engage in the analysis of each claim separately.

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal wishes to refer to the Swiss Federal
Tribunals jurisprudence on so-called “facts having double relevance”, namely those
facts that a tribunal may have to subsume both at the jurisdictional and the merits
stages of a dispute resolution procedure. That doctrine allows courts and tribunals to
uphold jurisdiction if the facts as presented by the claimant are reasonably probable.
However, this doctrine will not apply in arbitration given that it would be “excluded to
force a party to be bound by what a tribunal should decide on its disputed rights and
obligations if a binding arbitration agreement is not covering them”.*** The Parties
have rightly not referred to this case law which might not apply to investment
disputes, even when seated in Switzerland. Moreover, the issue here is not whether
the arbitration agreement does indeed bind the Parties or whether it would extend to
disputes about expropriation or the other alleged breaches but rather whether, prima
facie, there are established facts which raise arguable issues under the BIT. In other
words, the actual dispute goes to legal matters rather than factual differences.

b) The expropriation claim (Article 5 of the BIT)

In its Statement of Claim, the Claimant requested the Tribunal:

“to order the Slovak Republic to refrain from expropriating
Achmea’s investment in the Slovak Republic on the terms of the
Project Plan or materially similar terms, subject to a financial
penalty in an amount to be specified in the course of the arbitral
proceedings”.*°

While Achmea argues that it is entitled to the relief it seeks, i.e. (i) an order enjoining
the Slovak Republic to refrain from expropriating Achmea’s investment “on the terms.
of the Project Plan or materially similar terms” and (ii) subject to a financial penalty,

26 April 2005, 11 44 (Exh. RLA-9).

225.

226.

the Respondent objects first, that Achmea’s claim is premature, because its
investment was not expropriated and thus patently fails to survive the prima facie test,
and secondly, that the relief sought is impermissible. For the Respondent, the facts as
alleged are incapable of constituting a breach of Article 5.

On the one hand, Achmea claims that if the expropriation were to be carried out “on
the terms of the Project Plan or materially similar terms” it would breach Article 5 of
the Treaty. On the other hand, Achmea submits that Article 5 contains a general
prohibition to expropriate Dutch assets, thus entitling Achmea to seek arbitral review
of the expropriation process initiated by the Slovak Republic. More specifically,
Achmea submits that the Slovak Republic can only expropriate its assets if the Slovak
Republic states a valid public purpose; a failure to do so would warrant arbitral
review.

In light of the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal is faced with the question of whether
Achmea’s expropriation claim is capable of falling within the provisions of the Treaty.
Obviously, it cannot be said, and no one contends, that expropriation is per se
extraneous to the Treaty; quite to the contrary, Article 5 of the Treaty specifically
deals with the issue of expropriation, and sets a specific standard to be observed by
the Contracting Parties.

But the way in which the Claimant has formulated its expropriation claim leads the
Tribunal to engage in two lines of legal inquiry. First, the Tribunal must ascertain
whether Article 5 can be interpreted as containing a general prohibition to expropriate,
as argued by the Claimant, or whether it circumscribes the right to expropriate to
specific conditions, as argued by the Respondent. In light of the response given to
this preliminary question, the Tribunal will then be in a position to ascertain whether
Achmea’s claim is capable of coming within the reach of that provision.

The Tribunal is well aware that the interpretation of Article 5 is a matter which could
be dealt with at the merits stage. On the one hand, the Tribunal recalls that it is
empowered to join the present objection to the merits pursuant to Article 21(4) in fine
of the UNCITRAL Rules. This would be the appropriate course if the objection did not
possess an exclusively preliminary character or if rendering a decision on the
jurisdictional objection would entail the risk of prejudging the merits.°*° An apposite
example here is Tradex Hellas, where the tribunal joined the jurisdictional objection
relating to the expropriation claim to the merits. It stated that:

“The Tribunal notes that the question of whether the alleged
conduct of Albania can be considered an expropriation is on one
hand relevant under Art. 8 (2) for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
and is on the other hand the decisive issue relevant under Articles
4 and 5 of the 1993 Law or Articles 9 and 10 of the 1992 Law to
decide on the merits of Tradex’s claim. At least it cannot be

excluded that under certain circumstances it would be considered
an expropriation if a state permits the deprivation of land use from
a joint venture based on foreign investment or fails to grant
protection against interference if a legal duty for protection can be
found to exist. But the Tribunal feels a further examination of this
matter in the context of establishing jurisdiction according to Art. 8
(2) would be so closely related to the further examination of the
merits in this case that this jurisdictional examination should be
joined to the merits”.*”

However, in light of the conceptually radically opposed interpretations adopted by the
Parties on the scope of Article 5 of the Treaty, touching upon fundamental questions
of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and the full opportunity the two Parties have had to put
their respective cases on these matters pertaining to jurisdiction, the Tribunal is of the
view that a preliminary assessment is warranted, indeed necessary, at this stage.

That the Tribunal may engage in a preliminary interpretation of the nature and scope
of a substantive provision for purposes of jurisdiction, has been recognized in
numerous cases. For instance, in the [CAO Council case, the ICJ indicated that:

“many cases before the Court have shown that although a decision
on jurisdiction can never directly decide any question of merits, the
issues involved may be by no means divorced from the merits. A
jurisdictional decision may often have to touch upon the latter or at
least involve some consideration of them. This illustrates the
importance of the jurisdictional stage of a case, and the influence it
may have on the eventual decision on the merits”.°**

In the South West Africa cases, the ICJ held that:

“It may occur that a judgment on a preliminary objection touches
on a point of merits, but this it can do only in a provisional way, to
the extent necessary for deciding the question raised by the
preliminary objection”.*°

The Certain German interests in Polish Upper Silesia case, on which both Parties
relied in their submissions, is particularly apposite here. In that case, the PClJ had to
decide whether a notification of the intent to expropriate fell within the ambit of its
jurisdiction. The Court found that the jurisdictional enquiry may indeed impinge on the
merits, while at the same time stressing that it did not purport to make a definitive
finding on the merits :

“The Court, therefore, for the purposes of the decision for which it
is now asked, considers that it must proceed to the enquiry above
referred to, even if this enquiry involves touching upon subjects
belonging to the merits of the case; it is, however, to be clearly
understood that nothing which the Court says in the present
judgment can be regarded as restricting its entire freedom to

estimate the value of any arguments advanced by either side on
the same subjects during the proceedings on the merits”.*“°

With these considerations in mind, the Tribunal now engages in its analysis of the
Parties’ respective positions in order to determine whether the claim, as articulated by
Claimant, is capable of falling under Article 5 of the BIT. This provision provides as
follows:

“Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving,

directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of

their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:

a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due
process of law;

b) the measures are not discriminatory;

¢)

the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of
just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the
genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to
be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable,
without any undue delay, to the country designated by the
claimants concerned and in any freely convertible currency
accepted by the claimants”.

The Respondent submits that Article 5 enshrines the right of each Contracting State
to expropriate the investment of nationals of the other Contracting State, subject to
the conditions specified therein. Since no expropriation has taken place, Article 5
cannot serve as a foundation of Achmea’s claim, nor of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

If the Respondent's interpretation were correct, there is no doubt that the Tribunal
would not have the power at this time to entertain Achmea’s expropriation claim and
would have to uphold the Respondent's objection on this point. A series of arbitral
decisions confirm that tribunals have not been willing to uphold jurisdiction in cases
where the expropriation claim was premature. In Mariposa Development Company v.
Panama, the tribunal held, as a matter of “practical common sense”, that an

propri: 1 claim only tipe and acti once the expropriation had
been enforced. It was not sufficient to attack an enacted piece of legislation seeking
the expropriation of foreign-held assets.

 

“Practical common sense indicates that the mere passage of an
act under which private property may later be expropriated without
compensation by judicial or executive action should not at once
create an international claim on behalf of every alien property
holder in the country. There should be a locus penitentiae for

diplomatic representation and executive forbearance, and claims
should arise only when actual confiscation follows”.

While it is true that this decision is more than 80 years old, which is apparent from the
central role accorded to diplomatic representations, the general principle underlying
the decision, i.e. that an expropriation claim only becomes ripe once the taking has
occurred, has been followed with approval by various other tribunals. In Aminoil, the
tribunal rejected the claimant’s attempt to challenge a law nationalizing Aminoil’s oil
concession. It found that it could only entertain an expropriation claim after some
concrete steps had been taken:

“[T]he possibility (prior to the issuing of Decree No. 124) of seizing
an arbitral tribunal with the particular question over which the
Parties had failed to come to an understanding [...] did not exist,
because unless and until the Government took some concrete step
— such as nationalization — in consequence of that failure, there
would have been no definite complaint with which to seize any
arbitral tribunal”.

The Tribunal in Glamis Gold also had no hesitation to hold that mere threats of an
expropriation are not sufficient to warrant arbitral review under the Article 1110
NAFTA:

“In the determination of whether the Tribunal has subject matter
jurisdiction to decide the Article 1110 claims before it, the Tribunal
begins from the premise that a finding of expropriation requires that
a governmental act has breached an obligation under Chapter 11
and such breach has resulted in loss or damage. NAFTA Article
1117(1) establishes standing for an investor of a State Party to
bring a claim for harm done to its subsidiary in the territory of
another State Party under the investment provisions of Chapter 11.
Through the language of Article 1117(1), the State Parties
conceived of a ripeness requirement in that a claimant needs to
have incurred loss or damage in order to bring a claim for
compensation under Article 1120. Claims only arise under NAFTA.
Article 1110 when actual confiscation follows, and thus mere
threats of expropriation or nationalization are not sufficient to make
such a claim ripe; for an Article 1110 claim to be ripe, the
governmental act must have directly or indirectly taken a property
interest resulting in actual present harm to an investor’. °“

This line of cases is unanimous in holding that an expropriation claim is too
hypothetical, and thus premature as long as no taking has occurred. The fact that the
Glamis case was arbitrated under NAFTA rules, which specifically require an
allegation of a breach of a NAFTA rule and also to have suffered a loss or damage in
order to bring a claim for compensation, does not change the fundamental principle

that an expropriation claim only becomes ripe if concrete steps have been taken
which have the effect of a taking.

In the present case, the Slovak Republic has engaged in a process of unification of
the Slovak health insurance sector. While the sector was liberalized in 2004, allowing
foreign investors such as Achmea to enter the market, subsequent Governments
have struggled with the question of how to regulate the health insurance sector
efficiently. The present Government announced during its election campaign and
when taking power in the Spring of 2012 that it would unitize the health insurance
market. On that basis, it launched the political process through an Intention Statement
in July 2012, setting out the general lines of the process. In October 2012, the Project
Plan was adopted, which contemplates a voluntary sale process, and if that fails the
expropriation of Union. In the Project Plan, the Slovak Government tasked the
Ministry of Health to prepare a draft law setting out the regulatory framework of the
unitization process. A draft Transformation Act was purportedly prepared in July
2013. The Tribunal is not apprised, at the time of issuing its ruling on the
Respondent's jurisdictional objections, of the exact stage at which the unitization
process is, but it does not seem that this draft law has even been circulated for
preliminary comments by the Ministry of Health to other involved ministries.

As the Slovak Republic has made abundantly clear in its submissions, the process is
still in its infancy stages, since no draft bill has as of yet been submitted to the Slovak
legislature. Hence, at this moment, it is still entirely speculative if, when, and under
which conditions the purported expropriation of Achmea’s investment is to take place.
Under these conditions, if the Respondent's interpretation of Article 5 is correct, i.e. a
provision enshrining the principled right of the Slovak Republic to expropriate Dutch-
held assets, subject to specific conditions, the fulfillment of which could be reviewed
by an arbitral tribunal once an expropriation has occurred, then the Tribunal would
have to find that it lacks jurisdiction over the present claim.

The Claimant has, however, put forward an interpretation of Article 5, which would, if
upheld, allow the Tribunal to review the conformity of the expropriation process as it
advances, prior to the actual taking. To be clear, the Claimant has not put forward a
claim of an actual taking. It remains in full control of its investment. It is the Claimant's
primary contention that it wants to remain in possession and control of its investment,
which explains why it seeks an injunction from the Tribunal ordering the Respondent
to refrain from expropriating Achmea’s investment, subject to a financial penalty in
case of non-compliance.

The Claimant submits the following interpretation of Article 5 of the Treaty. The
negative formulation of Article 5 suggests that this provision prohibits each

* The Respondent indicated the following on the current status of the Project Plan: “Project Plan is at
the earliest stage of the legislative process. It may or may not approximate the terms of a future
draft bill, which may or may not be enacted into a law by the Slovak Parliament through a standard
democratic process. It is not known whether and, if so, how an administrative authority authorized
by such a law would carry it out’. See, Objections, | 42; Reply, If] 1-8.

Contracting State to expropriate the assets held by a national of the other Contracting
State, unless specific conditions are all met.

“The Slovak Republic's interpretation of a rule prescribing ‘X shall
not do Y, unless [ ]' as in fact meaning ‘X has the right to do Y’
goes beyond the most creative interpretation techniques”.

Had the Contracting States intended to recognize a right to expropriate, they could
have used clear and affirmative language. Instead, they sought to devise a “regime”
treating their respective investors more favorably than other aliens “in line with the
BIT’s purpose which is the ‘encouragement and reciprocal protection of
investments”.*” In light thereof, the Claimant argues that the Project Plan fails to
state any public interest which would warrant engaging in the process of
expropriation. Failing to do so gives Achmea a cause of action under Article 5 to
make sure that the expropriation process as contemplated in the Project Plan, or any
other plan on materially similar terms, is halted by the present Tribunal.

For this interpretation of Article 5, based up to here on the wording of the provision
and object and purpose of the BIT, the Claimant additionally relies on two external
elements. First, the Claimant calls attention to Certain German Interests in Polish
Upper Silesia,*“* where the PClJ “found that a publication of the Polish Government's
intent to expropriate was sufficient to render a claim to ‘obtain an order suspending
expropriation proceedings and a declaration that such proceedings are illegal’
admissible”.*“°

The Claimant also pointed to the dispute settlement provision of the Austria-Slovak
Republic BIT, which was under scrutiny in Euram Bank, and where it was held that
this provision limits the tribunal’s jurisdiction to disputes concerning the amount of
payment of a compensation.**° Since Article 8 of the present BIT extends to “all
disputes”, and is not limited to the payment of compensation, the Claimant argues
that the present Tribunal is empowered to review the expropriation process (as
contemplated in the Project Plan) before the taking actually takes place, and, if need
be, order the Respondent to refrain from expropriating Achmea’s investment.

The Tribunal does not find the Claimant's argumentation to be persuasive. General
customary international law recognizes the sovereign prerogative of States to
regulate the economic activities taking place in their territory. The international
community of States recognized in General Assembly Resolution 1803(XVII) on
“Permanent Sovereignty Over Natural Resource” of 14 December 1962 the sovereign

right of States to expropriate foreign-held assets in their territory, if the expropriation
is made in the public interest, according to due process of law, and against
compensation. The resolution provides in relevant part as follows:

“Nationalization, expropriation or requisitioning shall be based on
grounds or reasons of public utility, security or the national interest
which are recognized as overriding purely individual or private
interests, both domestic and foreign. In such cases the owner shall
be paid appropriate compensation, in accordance with the rules in
force in the State taking such measures in the exercise of its
sovereignty and in accordance with international law’.**'
This right, which the Tribunal considers to be strongly established in customary
international law, has been recalled in numerous international instruments, most
notably milestone resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations. It is true
that the exact scope of the requirements which make an expropriation lawful have
been hotly debated in the past decades, but the core principle under international
customary law has remained untouched, i.e. that a State may expropriate foreign-held
assets.

According to the prevalent view, the sovereign prerogative to expropriate foreign-held
assets was confirmed and further specified in bilateral investment treaties adopted
since the 1960s and other instruments dealing with the same subject matter. Bilateral
investment treaties further specify for instance that expropriation may not be
discriminatory and they clarify what standard of compensation is to be adopted. To
the knowledge of the Tribunal, it has never been argued that the negative formulation
employed in the expropriation clauses contained in most BITs, and indeed also in
Article 5 of the present Treaty, entails an express reversal, as opposed to a
specification, of the customary right of States to expropriate foreign-held assets
located in their territory. The Tribunal does not believe it to be the case here either.

A negative formulation of the right to expropriate is commonly adopted in a wide
range of bilateral investment treaties, not to prohibit expropriation, but more
appropriately strictly to circumscribe that right to the requirements set out in these
provisions. In this regard, the Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia case
must be distinguished.**? That case turned in part around the interpretation of Article
15 of the Germano-Polish Convention concerning Upper Silesia of 15 May 1922,
which required the Polish Government to give notice of its intention to expropriate a
“large estate”, as defined under the Convention, prior to a specified date. Without
going into the details, Germany argued that ten notices of the Polish Government had
not been made in conformity with Articles 9(3)(2), 12(1), 13(2) and 17 of the
Convention, inter alia arguing that several estates were not liable to expropriation,

(

because they did not fulfill the requirements set out in these provisions.*** Besides
holding that there was an “undeniable difference of opinion” on the proper
interpretation of these provisions (and thus falling within the Court's jurisdiction under
Article 23 of the Convention), the Court held Poland’s objection to be ill-founded,
since Article 20 and 16 of the Convention entailed that once a notice of expropriation
was issued, the assets could no longer be freely alienated, thus placing a serious
restriction on property rights. Having concrete legal effects, the notice came within the
jurisdictional purview of the Court.

“The Polish objection is not sound, not only because the right of
complaint granted by Poland to the owners is a matter of domestic
concern which cannot be used in argument against Germany, but
also because, according to Article 20, directly notice has been
given, expropriation is possible under the Geneva Convention
without any restriction as to time, and thus becomes for the owner
a menace which may continue for two years; and finally because
under the terms of the same Article 20 and of Article 16, once
notice has been given, the owner cannot without the consent of the
Polish Government, alienate inter vivos either the estate to be
expropriated or its accessories, so that the giving of notice places
serious restrictions on rights of ownership”.

There are thus three fundamental differences between that case and the present one.
First, the Germano-Polish Convention expressly, and very specifically categorized
various properties according to their destination, their size, and their ownership.
Properties fulfilling certain characteristics could expressly be expropriated (subject to
certain conditions), while others were a contrario excluded from the various regimes
designed in that Convention. In the present case, there is no language allowing to
discern a specific expropriation regime set out in the Treaty beyond the general
requirements deriving from customary international law. Second, the Germano-Polish
Convention mandates the notification of an intention of expropriation, an obligation
the observance of which would normally fall under the power of review of the Court
under Article 23 of the Convention. No such specific requirement is to be found in the
Treaty presently under review. Finally, and most importantly, a notice of the intention
to expropriate carries an important legal consequence with it under the Germano-
Polish Convention, i.e. that the owner who has been put on notice can no longer
alienate his property without the consent of the Polish Government. Here again, no
such legal consequence is expressed or implied in the BIT. The Claimant indicated at
the hearing that the announcement of the Intention Statement and the Project Plan,
as well as the adoption of the latter, had the consequence of grossly hindering its
ability to sell its investment to a willing buyer at a fair market value. Whatever the
merits of that argument, the Tribunal can only observe first, that such a hindrance
would not in general qualify as a taking, i.e. an expropriation, and second, that an
alleged de facto impediment is not to be equaled with a de jure impediment, only the
latter being susceptible of judicial or arbitral review. For these reasons, the Tribunal

does not find the Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia case to support the
Claimant's argument.

As regards the Claimant's reliance on the Austria-Slovak Republic BIT, it patently fails
in all respects. It does not follow from the fact that in that BIT the jurisdiction of a
tribunal is limited to the amount of compensation, thus excluding even a review of the
lawfulness of the expropriation itself, that an expropriation provision as formulated in
Article 5 of the Treaty automatically empowers the Tribunal, absent more specific
language, to review the stated intention or the possible, yet hypothetical, process of
expropriation in which the Slovak Republic seemingly engaged.

Finally, the Claimant has also sought to convince the Tribunal of its position by stating
that the Slovak Republic announced its intention to expropriate Achmea’s investment,
while at the same time failing to provide a public interest justifying such course of
action. The Tribunal does not need to, and cannot, make any finding on the existence
of a public interest supporting the Slovak Government's expressed will to unify its
health insurance system, as indeed that would impinge on the merits. However, it
must make an assessment of whether Article 5 mandates the Respondent to state a
public interest at the outset of the political process eventually leading to the adoption
of a piece of legislation contemplating the expropriation of Achmea’s investment. On
its face, Article 5 does not mandate such an obligation on the part of the Slovak
Republic. The Tribunal reads Article 5 to mean on its face that if the expropriation is
to be considered lawful, it must have been made in pursuance of a public interest and
that analysis is an exercise to be undertaken once the expropriation has occurred. As
rightly pointed out by the Respondent, the Slovak Republic acknowledges so much in
its Project Plan, where it is stated that:

“A law will define the expropriation objective and conditions. The
expropriation objective will be to achieve, in the public interest, the
of title to the i Assets for it the
objective of introducing unitary model into health insurance. The
expropriation process will only take place provided that the
expropriation objective could not be reached by agreement with a
shareholder of the non-State insurer, and the expropriation will be
possible only to achieve the objective (set by law) and in the public
interest, which would need to be proven in the expropriation
proceedings in a manner prescribed by law” (emphasis added). 68

 

On the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant has failed
to state a prima facie case for its Article 5 claim. Accordingly, the Respondent’s
objection is upheld. This conclusion is all the more important, since, in its view, the
Tribunal is not empowered to intervene in the democratic process of a sovereign
State, and cannot do so absent very specific language to that effect. The design and
implementation of its public healthcare policy is for the State alone to assess and the
State must balance the different and sometimes competing interests, such as its duty
to ensure appropriate healthcare to its population and its duty to honor its

international investment protection commitments. The Tribunal is being invited to
engage in a speculative exercise, looking into the future to examine a State conduct
that has not yet materialized and whose features may not be determined with
certainty at this stage. The Tribunal concludes that that is impermissible under the
BIT and thus falls outside the ambit of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

c) The non-expropriation claim (Article 3 of the BIT)

The Parties disagree on whether the Claimant filed various Article 3 claims, as argued
by the Respondent, or whether it filed a single claim encompassing a succession of
facts. Regarding its submissions under Article 3 of the BIT, the Claimant requested
the Tribunal:

“(ii) to declare that the Slovak Republic has breached Article 3 of
the BIT through conduct related to the impending expropriation of
Achmea's investment; and

(iii) to declare that the Slovak Republic has breached Article 3 of

the BIT by continuously destabilizing the regulatory and investment
environment in the Slovak health care sector’.°*

For its part, the Respondent indicated that, in its view, Achmea asserted three Article
3 claims in its Statement of Claim:

“[First], Achmea claims that Slovakia ‘denied Achmea’s investment

 

 

 

fair and it and has imp: it by

or discriminatory . by dl its
desire to expropriate Union during the 2012 client acquisition
campaign.’

[Second], Achmea seems to claim that Slovakia violated Article 3
of the Treaty through the alleged recent conduct of the State-
owned health insurance company VéSeobecné Zdravotna
Poist’ovria (“V8ZP”) vis-a-vis the Association of Slovak Hospitals
(‘ASH’).

[Third], Achmea claims that Slovakia denied Achmea fair and
equitable treatment by failing to provide a stable and predictable
regulatory framework because of statements that it wishes to
reintroduce a unitary health insurance system”.**”

It may not be indispensable to determine whether the Claimant filed several discrete
Article 3 claims or whether these could be subsumed as a single claim. It remains
certain that, in a single arbitration proceeding, the Claimant is praying for a unitary
relief basing its unitary request on three (or four) allegedly discrete sets of facts.
Whether such sets of facts are examined separately or as a possible general pattern
of the Respondent’s conduct is going more to the presentation of the Tribunal’s
analysis than to its substance, namely the merits of the claim(s): the Tribunal is of the
view that Achmea lodged a single Article 3 claim comprising four separate limbs.

257.

First, Achmea claims that “[i]f carried out, the process under which Achmea would be
asked to ‘voluntarily sell’ its investment to the Slovak Republic violates Article 3(1) of
the BIT’.°8° Second, Achmea claims that the Slovak Republic “denied Achmea’s
investment fair and equitable treatment, and has impaired it by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures, by repeatedly communicating its desire to expropriate Union
during the 2012 client acquisition campaign”.°** Third, Achmea claims that “the Slovak
Republic’s many statements since 2006 [and] intentions are incompatible with the
requirement of fair and equitable treatment as expressed in Article 3 of the BIT” to
ensure a stable and predictable legal framework.*®° Fourth, Achmea claims that the
conduct of VSZP in relation to Union’s contractual arrangements with the State-owned
hospitals is attributable to the Slovak Republic and is in breach of Article 3 of the
Treaty.

Article 3(1) of the Treaty reads as follows:

“4. Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable
treatment to the investments of investors of the other Contracting
Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or disposal thereof by those investors”.**"

The validity of these four limbs of Achmea’s Article 3 claim, based on a prima facie
assessment of the facts as exposed by the Claimant, may better and will be assessed
separately. The first limb of the claim relates to the voluntary sale process
contemplated in the Project Plan. In light of the Parties’ pleadings, the Tribunal need
not spend much time on this first limb. Indeed, the Claimant did not expand any
further on this particular issue beyond its Statement of Claim. The Tribunal
understands the Claimant’s argument to be that the voluntary sale process as
contemplated in the Project Plan would violate Article 3 of the Treaty, and not that a
Treaty breach has already occurred.**? As such, this part of the claim fails to meet the
prima facie test. The Tribunal further notes that the Claimant has not provided any
evidence suggesting that the process has been set in motion so that this claim would
fail in any circumstances.

There remains, however, one argument to be addressed in this connection and thus
at this juncture. The Claimant indicates that the Project Plan contemplates the
commencement of the voluntary sale process after the 2013 acquisition campaign,
but on the basis of a number of clients stabilized at the level of the 2012 acquisition
campaign. This circumstance “would clearly disadvantage Achmea” since it

traditionally gained market share during acquisition campaigns.** Here again, this
argument fails since Achmea has not alleged that such a measure has been put into
effect. The mere fact that the Project Plan envisages such a scenario is insufficient to
meet the prima facie test. Thus, the Claimant's proffered set of facts would be
insufficient to constitute an actual breach of the Treaty standard. Accordingly, the
Tribunal finds that this part of the claim falls outside of its jurisdiction.

The second and third limbs of Achmea’s claim relate to announcements, as well as
several measures, which the Slovak Republic came up with in connection with its
intention to expropriate Achmea’s investment. According to the Claimant, the Slovak
Republic engaged in unreasonable and discriminatory measures which allegedly
harmed Achmea’s investment, notably “by repeatedly communicating its desire to
expropriate Union during the 2012 client acquisition campaign”, thus impacting
Union's business, especially the number of clients it could have attracted had such
announcements not been made. In this regard, the Claimant points to (i) the Intention
Statement, (ii) the Project Plan, (iii) various statements of public officials, and (iv) two
governmental resolutions approving respectively the Intention Statement and the
Project Plan.**° The Claimant complains that the Intention Statement puts a certain
level of blame on private health insurers for the low life expectancy in the Slovak
Republic, thus setting in train the process of driving Achmea out of the health
insurance market.* The Claimant complains further that the Project Plan was
published in the last week of the acquisition campaign, thus willfully harming
Achmea’s attempts to gain more market share. Finally, as regards the statements
made in the Slovak press, the Claimant points to various statements of high-ranking
officials who publicly affirmed that the political decision to create a unitary health
insurance system had been taken and was irreversible. The Claimant also refers to a
press interview given by the Prime Minister, Mr. Robert Fico, where he stated that “in
practice this means that private health insurers Dévera and Union should leave the
Slovak market”.*°”

The Respondent qualifies this claim to be “ancillary” to the expropriation claim, and
therefore not to be entertained by the Tribunal.*® This is especially so because
preparatory work of an internationally wrongful act, which the proposed expropriation
by no means purports to be, is in any circumstances not unlawful under international

purportedly already occurred. In contrast, their article 5 claim, expropriation, is based on events

law. In addition, the Respondent argues that mere intentions or political statements in
the midst of a democratic process cannot be the basis of an Article 3 claim.

While no expropriation of Union has yet taken place, it is clear that the matters upon
which the Claimant relies in support of the second and third limbs of its Article 3
claim, based on an alleged breach of the FET standard, have already occurred. Both
the second and third limbs are based upon declarations and statements made by
Slovak officials, as well as two resolutions, regarding the intention to create a unitary
health insurance system, and which anticipate an eventual expropriation of Union.
The Tribunal accepts that, in certain circumstances, conduct of a State in anticipation
of an expropriation might amount to a breach of its obligation to respect the FET
standard. For the reasons developed below and on the basis of a prima facie review
of the evidence filed by the Claimant, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this is such a
case.

The announcements made by, and on behalf of, the Slovak Republic did not amount
to more than expressions of intent, which had yet to be made effectual. In particular,
these announcements required to be translated into legislation and in any event, were
premised on the basis that were an expropriation to result, it would be made with due
tespect to the compensation terms of the BIT. As regards the Intention Statement, it
discusses the possibilities of introducing a unitary public health care system in the
Slovak Republic, inter alia in light of EU law and the right to protection of
investments.*° In this latter regard, the Intention Statement indicates that any
potential expropriation of Union would have to comply with the conditions set out in
the BIT, amongst which paying “fair compensation without undue delay”.*”° Similarly,
the Project Plan sets out the general framework for the contemplated implementation
of a unitary public health insurance system in the Slovak Republic.*”' An eventual
expropriation of non-State owned health insurers is contemplated as a measure of
last resort to be adopted in conformity with the Slovak Constitution and international
law.°72

As regards the two resolutions referred to by the Claimant, they do not show any
prima facie evidence of any conduct falling below the FET standard. Government
Resolution No. 383 of 25 July 2012 approves “the intention to introduce unitary public
health insurance system in the Slovak Republic’.°” It also instructs the Minister of
Health to prepare a project along these lines by 30 September 2012, thus denying the
Claimant's argument that the publication of the Project Plan in the last week of
September 2012 was willfully intended to harm Union. For its part, Government

Resolution No. 606 of 31 October 2012 approving the Project Plan indicates that the
implementation of the unitary system to public health insurance is to be achieved
preferably through a voluntary buyout of the shares in non-State owned health
insurers, or, in the last resort, through expropriation.°”*

The Claimant has not brought either any sufficient prima facie evidence that the
actions of the Slovak Republic preparatory to any planned taking of Union are
somehow beyond any norm, which might otherwise render those preparations
susceptible to attack as a breach of the State's obligations to afford fair and equitable
treatment to the Claimant. The Respondent argues that the announcement of the
Project Plan was ‘a basic requirement for a transparent democratic legislative
process’. On the face of it, it seems to the Tribunal that the Slovak Republic has
observed the formalities, however uncompromising the terms of some of the public
statements of senior officials. Neither has the Claimant demonstrated enough of a
case to enable the Tribunal to say that the actions and public pronouncements of the
Slovak Government have been such as to destabilize the investment and regulatory
environment.

The third limb of the claim relates to the purported regulatory instability associated
with the expropriation process, most notably through the various statements made in
the Slovak press and the two resolutions to which the Tribunal has referred above.
Mutatis mutandis, this element of Claimant's Article 3 claim, as it also deals with
statements made by Slovak officials and the two resolutions, calls for the same
observations on the part of the Tribunal. Furthermore, as the Respondent has noted,
the Claimant has been unable to refer to a single instance of regulatory change
prejudicial to Achmea.

As a consequence, for all the reasons indicated above, the Tribunal considers that
the Claimant has not demonstrated a prima facie basis for the second and third limb
of its Article 3 claim.

Finally, the fourth limb of the claim relates to the conduct of VSZP, the Association of
Slovak Hospitals (“ASH”), and the 17 State-owned hospitals. The Respondent raises
two separate issues in this regard. First, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant
failed to establish a link of attribution between the Slovak Government and these
State-owned entities, in particular since they do not belong to the governmental
apparatus and do not exercise elements of governmental authority. Mere State-
ownership is insufficient to establish attribution, and thus the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
does not extend to the conduct of these entities. Second, the Respondent criticizes
that the Claimant did not specify in its Statement of Claim which conduct of the State-
owned hospitals would breach the Treaty. Since the Tribunal must assess its
jurisdiction at the time of the Statement of Claim, it should disregard any alleged facts
subsequent to the Statement of Claim, in particular the meeting of 17 hospitals on 26

June 2013 and various statements of the Minister of Health brought to the attention of
the Tribunal on 29 January 2014.

267. It is an accepted principle of international law that jurisdiction must exist on the day of
the institution of proceedings. As stated by the ICJ:

“The Court recalls that, according to its settled jurisprudence, its
jurisdiction must be determined at the time that the act instituting
proceedings was filed”.°”°

268. In the realm of investment arbitration, numerous arbitral tribunals have also indicated
that jurisdiction must exist on the day of the institution of proceedings. For instance, in
Goetz v. Burundi, the tribunal held that:

“Quant a la compétence du Tribunal et a la recevabilité de la
requéte, elles s'apprécient, selon le principe rappelé recemment
par la Cour internationale de Justice, a la date du dépdt de la
requéte”.*’°

269. As appears from these decisions, an international tribunal's jurisdiction must exist on
the day of the institution of proceedings, that is, for present purposes and pursuant to
Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the date on which the Notice of Arbitration is
received by the Respondent. It is undisputed that Achmea did not raise the conduct of
V8ZP or any State-owned hospitals in its Notice of Arbitration. The first time Achmea

expressly mentioned VSZP and the State-owned hospitals in connection with an
alleged prejudice suffered by Achmea, was in its Statement of Claim.°””

In these circumstances, the Tribunal has no difficulty in finding that the fourth limb of
Achmea’s Article 3 claim falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, since no specific
conduct of V8ZP or the State-owned hospitals is complained of in Achmea’s Notice of
Arbitration. Even if the Tribunal were minded to uphold jurisdiction over the fourth limb
of the Article 3 claim as formulated for the first time in the Statement of Claim, that
limb would nonetheless fail to satisfy the requirements of a valid claim. This derives
from the fact that the Statement of Claim fails to point with sufficient specificity to any
event or conduct of VSZP, or of the State-owned hospitals, having allegedly caused a
prejudice to Achmea’s investment.

As regards (i) the purported meeting held on 26 June 2013 between VSZP and
several State-owned hospitals, and (ii) the rescission by several State-owned
hospitals of their contracts with Union, these events postdate not only the Notice of
Arbitration but also the Statement of Claim, and thus patently fall outside the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal is further of the view that Achmea may in fact
have called the Tribunal's attention in its Statement of Claim to the purported conduct
of VSZP or of the State-owned hospitals in an attempt to prevent these organisms to
interfere with Achmea’s contractual relations with these State-owned hospitals. But
this course of action is not one that this Tribunal can entertain, since it does not fall
within its jurisdiction to entertain preventive actions. Indeed, the Tribunal accepts the
Slovak Republic's argument that it did not consent to arbitrate disputes seeking
preventive actions, but that its consent only extends to disputes dealing with alleged
breaches of the BIT that have already occurred at the time of the institution of arbitral
proceedings. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it lacks jurisdiction over the fourth
limb of Achmea’s claim.

In conclusion, the Tribunal upholds the Respondent's objections to the claim raised
by the Claimant under Article 3 of the Treaty.

Having found that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction on both the expropriation claim and

the FET claim, it is unnecessary to address the Respondent's further objections to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

B. THE COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS

Each Party paid an advance of EUR 200,000, i.e. a total of EUR 400,000. In addition,
the Parties have advanced costs for court reporters at the jurisdictional hearing
amounting to GBP 3,041.71 each, i.e. a total of GBP 6,083.42.

The arbitration costs advanced by the Parties thus amount to an aggregate of
EUR 400,000 + GBP 6,083.42, each Party advancing half of these amounts.

The Tribunal has incurred expenses in a total amount of EUR 12,809.62, including
expenses for travel, lodging and bank charges.

The Members of the Tribunal have collectively spent a total of 474.25 hours as
follows: Mr. John Beechey 105.75 hours; Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy 72 hours; and
Dr. Laurent Lévy 296.5 hours. In addition, the Secretary of the Tribunal has spent a
total of 183.5 hours. It was agreed in paragraph 19.1 of PO1 that the Tribunal’s time
would be compensated at an hourly rate of CHF 700 (seven hundred Swiss francs),
and that the Secretary’s time would be compensated at an hourly rate of CHF 350
(three hundred and fifty Swiss francs). The total fees of the Arbitral Tribunal amount
to CHF 396,200, amounting to EUR 324,549.66.

The PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR 2,362.50 for the administration of
the funds deposited by the Parties by way of advance.

The total costs of the proceedings are thus EUR 339,721.78 + GBP 6,083.42,
detailed as follows:

Expenses for court reporters GBP 6,083.42

Tribunal expenses EUR 12,809.62

Tribunal fees EUR 324,549.66

Administrative expenses EUR 2,362.50

Total EUR 339,721.78 + GBP 6,083.42.

Consequently, the Tribunal notes that there is a surplus of EUR 60,278.22 (i.e.
EUR 400,000 + GBP 6,083.42 [total advances] less EUR 339,721.78 + GBP 6,083.42
[total arbitration costs].

c. THE ALLOCATION OF CosTS

Article 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules read as follows:

“Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in
principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral
tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it
determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account
the circumstances of the case.

83

287.

289.

290.

Vil.

291.

With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance
referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking
into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to
determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such
costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable”.

The UNCITRAL Rules thus adopt the rule “costs follow the event” with respect to the
costs of the arbitration and confer broad powers to the Tribunal in connection with the
Parties’ costs.

With respect to the costs of arbitration, the Claimant did not succeed in establishing
the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal. Accordingly, the Claimant shall bear the costs
of arbitration advanced by the Respondent. As indicated above, the costs of
arbitration advanced by the Respondent amount to EUR 200,000 + GBP 3,041.71.
The surplus of the advances, i.e. EUR 60,278.22, will be returned to the Respondent.
Therefore, the Tribunal directs the Claimant to pay the Respondent the balance as of
the date of the present award, ie., EUR 139'721.78 (EUR 200,000 less
EUR 59,894.18) + GBP 3,041.71.

As regards the costs of legal representation and other costs incurred by the Parties, it
is the considered opinion of the Tribunal that, in light of all the circumstances of the
present case, the Claimant shall bear 75 percent of all of the Respondent's costs of
legal representation, i.e. an amount of EUR 1,011,515.22.

Finally, the Claimant shall pay no pre-award interest but post-award simple interest

on the Respondent’s costs computed at 6 month Euro LIBOR + 2 % per annum from
the date of the award until payment in full.

DECISION

For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides that:

a. it does not have jurisdiction over Achmea’s claims;

b. the Claimant shall bear the arbitration costs, which amount to
EUR 339,721.78 + GBP 6,083.42 within 30 days of the notification of
this award;

c. the Claimant shall pay EUR 1,011,515.22 to the Respondent as

contribution to its legal and other costs incurred in connection with this
arbitration within 30 days of the notification of this award;

d. the Claimant shall pay post-award simple interest on the Respondent's
costs computed at 6 month Euro LIBOR + 2% per annum from the date
of the award until payment in full.
