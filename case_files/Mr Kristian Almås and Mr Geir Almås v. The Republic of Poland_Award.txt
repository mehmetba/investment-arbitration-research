A. THE PARTIES

Kingdom of Norway. The Claimants’ addresses are, respectively, Skadalsveien 23E, 0781 Oslo,
Norway; and Gaustadalléen 21, 0349 Oslo, Norway. The Claimants were the only shareholders
in Pol Farm Sp. z 00 (‘Pol Farm’), a limited liability company with a registered address at Street
No. 11A, 78-300 Krosino, Poland. The Claimants are represented in these proceedings by
Mr Magnus Hellesylt and Ms Kristin Hallsjé Aarvik of Advokatfirmaet Wiersholm AS,
Dokkveien 1, 6th Floor, 0250 Oslo, Norway.

The Respondent in this arbitration is the Republic of Poland (‘Poland’). The Respondent is
represented in these proceedings by Ms Julita Zimoch-Tuchotka and Dr Marek Swiatkowski of
Domanski Zakrzewski Palinka sp. k, Rondo ONZ 1, 00-124 Warsaw, Poland. The Respondent is

00-682 Warsaw, Poland.

B. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

A dispute has arisen between the Claimants and the Government in respect of which the Claimants
commenced arbitration pursuant to Article X of the Agreement between the Government of the
Kingdom of Norway and the Government of the Republic of Poland for the Promotion and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which was signed on 5 June 1990 and entered into force on

24 October 1990 (the ‘BIT’ or ‘Treaty’).

The dispute concerns the Claimants’ investment, by way of their shareholding in Pol Farm, in a
lease of approximately 4200 hectares of land in Swidwin Commune, Poland. The lease was
pursuant to an agreement dated 14 February 1997 (the ‘Lease’ or ‘Lease Agreement’) between
Pol Farm and the Polish Agricultural Property Agency (Agencja Nieruchomosci Rolnych,
hereinafter ‘ANR’ or ‘Agency’), whereby Pol Farm took over a 30-year lease granted by ANR in
1994 to another lessee. Following ANR’s termination of the Lease in 2009, the justifications for
which are disputed by the Parties, Pol Farm was liquidated under the judicial supervision of the

District Court in Koszalin.

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

The Claimants seek declarations that Poland has breached the Treaty and international law by
expropriating the Claimants’ investment without adequate compensation, by failing to accord the
Claimants equitable and reasonable treatment and protection, and by subjecting the Claimants to
unreasonable and discriminatory measures. They also argue that the lease termination constituted
a breach of an applicable umbrella clause. The Claimants claim compensation for loss suffered as
a result of Poland’s Treaty violations, in the amount of approximately EUR 23 million. They also

seek interest and costs.

The Respondent argues that the claims fall outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. But even if the
Tribunal were to uphold its jurisdiction, the Respondent submits that the claims that it violated
the Treaty are flawed in law and fact and must fail on the merits. Accordingly, it requests the

Tribunal to dismiss the claims and order the Claimants to pay all costs.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Claimants wrote to the Respondent on 6 July 2012,' 16 October 2012,? and 18 April 2013,3
requesting that the Parties’ dispute be amicably settled. On 10 July 2013, the Polish Embassy in
Oslo replied that the Polish Ministry of Agriculture had considered the complaint and adjudged it
to have ‘no substantiation’. On 1 November 2013, the Claimants commenced these proceedings
by Notice of Arbitration pursuant to the Treaty and the United Nations Commission of

International Trade Law Arbitration Rules of 1976 ((UNCITRAL Rules’).
The Claimants invoked Article X of the Treaty, which provides:

1. Disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting
party concerning an obligation of the latter under Article 6 of the present
agreement in relation to the investment of the former which have not been
amicably settled within 6 months from the date of a written notification of a
claim shall be submitted to settlement before an ad hoc international
arbitration tribunal if either party to the dispute so wishes.

2. The ad hoc international arbitration tribunal shall be constituted for each
individual case in the following way:

Within two months of the receipt of the request for arbitration, each party to
the dispute shall appoint one member of the tribunal. These two members shall
then select jointly within two months the chairman of the tribunal who is not

a national of either contracting party. Each party to the dispute may in the
absence of any other agreement invite the president of the International Court
of Justice to make the necessary appointments. The tribunal shall determine
its own procedure applying the arbitration rules of the United Nations
Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) of December 15,
1976. The tribunal reaches its award by a majority of votes.

The tribunal reaches its award on the basis of the provisions of the present
agreement as well as on the general principles and rules of international law.
The award shall be final and binding and shall be carried out according to
domestic legislation. Each contracting party shall ensure the recognition and
execution of the arbitral award in accordance with the appropriate provisions
of its legislation.

3. Each party shall bear the costs of participation of its member in the arbitration
procedure.

The costs of participation of the chairman shall be borne in equal parts by both
parties. The tribunal may, however, in its award decide on a different
proportion of costs to be borne by the parties and this award shall be binding
on both parties.

9. On 24 April 2014, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Article X(2) of the
Treaty, the Respondent notified the Claimants of its appointment of Professor August Reinisch

and accompanying documents.

On 13 May 2015, each arbitrator signed declarations confirming that he is and shall remain

impartial and independent of the Parties.

On 18 June 2015, the Tribunal convened a preliminary procedural teleconference with the Parties,

minutes of which were circulated on 19 June 2016.

On 23 June 2015, the Tribunal invited the Parties to express their preferences in regard to the

confidentiality of the arbitral proceedings.

On 26 June 2015, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed that the 1976 version of
the UNCITRAL Rules would apply, that the place of the arbitration would be Brussels, and that
hearings would be held at the premises of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (‘PCA’) in The
Hague, the Netherlands. The Parties communicated that they had not reached an agreement with
respect to confidentiality, with the Claimants preferring a fully public approach, and the
Respondent preferring the proceedings be kept confidential in general, but agreeing to publication

of the award with any appropriate redactions.

The Parties and the Tribunal signed Terms of Appointment taking effect from 28 July 2015.
Pursuant to the Terms of Appointment, the Parties and the Tribunal confirmed their agreement
that the PCA would serve as registry and that PCA Senior Legal Counsel, Ms Judith Levine,
would serve as Tribunal Secretary. Among other things, the Terms of Appointment also
confirmed the valid constitution of the Tribunal, identified the representatives of the Parties, fixed

Brussels as the legal seat of arbitration and The Hague as the venue for hearings, confirmed the

language of the arbitration to be English, and set in place arrangements for the payment of fees

and expenses.

On 19 August 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, in which the Tribunal set out
procedural rules and a schedule for the proceedings. The Tribunal also set out rules with respect
to public disclosure about the arbitration, publication of awards, and confidentiality of non-public

materials and information provided in the context of the arbitration.

On 18 September 2015, Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence (‘Statement of
Defence’) and accompanying documents, including (i) Exhibits R-1 to R-20, with translations

and enclosures; and (ii) Legal Authorities RLA-1 to RLA-14.

On 30 September 2015, the Claimants submitted a request for the production of documents to the
Respondent, which in turn submitted its objections on 12 October 2015. The Respondent did not

request document production from the Claimants.

On 19 October 2015, the Claimants replied to the Respondent’s objections and submitted a revised
request for document production. The Respondent responded with additional objections on
22 October 2015. On 23 October 2015, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Parties had
agreed to an extension of time for the submission of outstanding document production requests
to 28 October 2015, including an extension of time for the Tribunal to issue its decision on any

outstanding requests to 7 November 2015.

On 28 October 2015, the Claimants submitted to the Tribunal their outstanding document
production requests in the form of a completed Redfern schedule. On 29 October 2015, the
Respondent was granted leave to file additional comments on new issues raised in the Claimants”

request. The Respondent submitted its comments on 30 October 2015.

On 6 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, in which it narrowed the scope
of two of the Claimants’ amended requests and ordered the production of the remaining requests.
The Tribunal ordered the Respondent to produce those documents ‘that are in its possession,
custody or control, and/or to use its best efforts to obtain such documents from ANR, without
prejudice to any finding the Tribunal may make with respect to the status of ANR or its

relationship with the Respondent.’

On 10 November 2015, the Claimants requested an extension of the deadline for the submission
of their Reply to 4 December 2015 and of the Respondent’s Rejoinder to 11 February 2016,

No. | to permit the Claimants to submit their Reply on 11 December 2015.

On 18 November 2015, the Respondent requested an extension for the submission of its Rejoinder
to 4 March 2016. Following exchanges amongst the Parties, on 20 November 2015, the Tribunal
amended Procedural Order No. | to permit the submission of the Respondent’s Rejoinder on

(ii) Legal Authorities CLA-1 to CLA-52; and (iii) witness statements of Mr Geir Almas (CWS-1)
and Mr Kristian Almas (CWS-2), both dated 11 December 2015. The Claimants’ Reply noted the
Respondent’s failure to produce certain documents purportedly held by ANR and requested that
the Tribunal convene a teleconference with the Parties in order to resolve the Parties’

disagreement.

On 18 January 2016, the Tribunal noted the Claimants’ proposal and reserved the right to order
further document production in respect of ANR, at or subsequent to the merits hearing, in order

to permit the Claimants an opportunity to supplement their submissions on quantum.

On 19 February 2016, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder (‘Statement of Rejoinder’) and
accompanying documents, including (i) Exhibits R-21 to R-25, with translations and enclosures;
(ii) Legal Authorities RLA-15 to RLA-47; and (iii) witness statements of Mr Marek Gil (RWS-1),
Mr Tomasz Wronski (RWS-2), and Ms Anna Zajac-Plezia (RWS-3), dated 22 January 2016,
2 February 2016, and 18 January 2016, respectively.

On 4 March 2016, the Parties each submitted a list of the witnesses they intended to call for

examination.

On 10 March 2016, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing teleconference with the Parties in which

arrangements for the hearing were agreed.

On 11 March 2016, the Tribunal circulated minutes of the pre-hearing teleconference and advised
that, following the teleconference, the Tribunal had conferred on the outstanding question of how

to deal with quantum issues and had agreed as follows:

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

In the event quantum becomes an issue, the Tribunal will conduct a separate process
involving an exchange of expert reports and (if necessary) further disclosure of
documents. In addition, a second hearing may be necessary. The procedure for and
timing of this separate process will be determined after the end of the merits hearing.

33. Between 4 and 7 April 2016, the Tribunal held oral hearings on jurisdiction and the merits at the

Peace Palace in The Hague. The following individuals were in attendance:

and the alleged ‘fact that in 2009 Pol Farm did not use about 900 hectares of land’.° In view of
the fact that the principal ground for the requested post-hearing submissions relates to issues
raised by the Respondent during the hearing at a late stage and which would require further
document disclosure, and that the Claimants nevertheless preferred to proceed without

post-hearing submissions, the Tribunal decided not to request post-hearing submissions.

The Tribunal further raised a number of translation issues which were duly resolved in
correspondence. At the request of the Tribunal, both Parties confirmed their final requests for

relief and made brief submissions as to costs on 22 April 2016.

By letter of 15 April 2016, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision on
post-hearing submissions in order to afford the Respondent an opportunity to provide additional
information relating to an issue raised during witness testimony concerning the area of land
allegedly used by Pol Farm. The Respondent attached a document from the Agency for
Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture. On 11 May 2016, the Tribunal recalled and
confirmed its earlier communication, deciding not to request post-hearing submissions. In this

connection, the Tribunal disregarded the attachment to the Respondent’s letter.

Il. THE UNCONTESTED FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A. NEGOTIATION AND ENTRY INTO THE LEASE AGREEMENT

The present dispute stems from a Lease Agreement between the Claimants and the Agricultural
Property Agency (Agencja Nieruchomosci Rolnych), a Polish institution under the supervision of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development that is responsible for administering, leasing,
and selling Polish State-owned land. ANR is the successor body to the Agricultural Property
Agency of the State Treasury, which was originally created to supervise Poland’s transition from
State-owned agriculture to a market-based economy pursuant to the 1991 Act on Managing

Agricultural Property Owned by the State Treasury (the ‘1991 Act’).”

On 18 February 1994, Danish investors, acting through a company, Pol Rol Sp. z oo (‘Pol Rol’),
began a 30-year lease with ANR on a 4296.47-hectare estate in Swidwin Commune, Poland (the

Hearing Tr. (Day 4), p. 99.

 

Statement of Claim, §2.1; Statement of Defence, $52.

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

‘Farm’),® which had been previously run by a State-owned farm now in liquidation.° Pol Rol was
unable to cultivate the land in such a way as to turn a profit, however, and entered into negotiations
to transfer its leasehold interest to Mr Kristian Almas and Mr Atle Almas (the brothers of Mr Geir

Almas).!°

On 13 February 1996, the Claimants incorporated Pol Farm Sp. z 00 (‘Pol Farm’) for the purpose
of entering into the Lease.'! On 14 February 1997, Pol Farm and ANR finalised a consolidated
lease agreement for the Farm (the ‘Lease’ or ‘Lease Agreement’) in which Pol Farm replaced

Pol Rol as lessee.’?

Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, Pol Farm was to pay an annual rent equivalent to the market
value of approximately 700 tons of wheat to ANR.'* Additionally, the Lease Agreement contained
limitations on Pol Farm’s use of the land, including in Section 5 a clause requiring Pol Farm to
‘use and manage the rented property properly in order to conduct their business activity there”
and prohibiting it from changing ‘the required use of the property’ without ANR’s written

consent.'*

Section 5 provided, in relevant part:

1. The Lessee commits themselves to use and manage the rented property properly
in order to conduct their business activity there. At the same time they cannot
change the required use of the property without Lessor's consent.

 

2. Moreover, the Lessee agrees to take over all the rights and duties resulting from
employment agreements signed by and between PGR Swidwin and its 94
employees and becomes a party in a employment relationship with these
employees under art. 23 1§2 of the Polish Labor Code. The Lessee takes over all
the duties with respect to these people as specified elsewhere.'>

Section 7 provided:

1. The Lessee commits themselves to maintain the subject of this Agreement on their
own cost in such a way and manner that its specific parts will not be subject to
deterioration apart from the normal tear and wear.

2. In particular, the Lessee commits themselves to maintain and repair buildings and
structures as well as plant and machinery that are subject of the Lease Agreement
on their own cost. The frequency of repair shall result from the principles of proper
exploitation.

Finally, Section 14(1) provided:

Apart from the rent, the Lessee will bear all the regulatory liabilities connected with the
rented property for which, according to legal provisions, either the owner or the possessor
is liable. In this case these include: real estate tax, agricultural tax and other liabilities
resulting from p ‘ing the property including obligatory insurance.

 

 

Section 17 of the Lease Agreement provided the conditions under which it could be terminated
prior to its expiration in 2024. That clause provides, in relevant part, that the Agreement may be
terminated ‘without statutory notice if the Lessee lags behind with rent for a minimum of two

terms of payment or when [it] fails to fulfil the duties described in § 5 and § 14 point 1.”

B. POL FARM’S INVESTMENTS IN THE FARM 1995-2007

From 1995 to 2004, Pol Farm made investments and operational changes to the Farm. In 1998,
Pol Farm hired additional staff. Additionally, Pol Farm spent approximately PLN 14 million

(EUR 3.4 million) by way of additional investments in this period. '®

Despite Pol Farm’s investments, the Company failed to turn a profit in those years, and by 2003,
the Company was near bankruptcy. Between 2003 and 2004, Mr Kristian Almas and Mr Geir
Almas, the present Claimants, bought out other ownership interests in Pol Farm, including that of

their brother Mr Atle Almas.'”

In 2004, the Republic of Poland acceded to the European Union. The Lease Agreement’s value
rose, along with other property prices in Poland.'* As a result of Poland’s EU accession, the Farm

began to receive approximately EUR 500,000 in agricultural subsidies each year.'®

That same year, Pol Farm received a letter from ANR in which the Agency expressed its interest
in renegotiating the Lease Agreement.” ANR enclosed with the letter a new lease agreement with
its signature. Under this proposed renegotiation, ANR could reassume control of up to 20 percent

of the productive farmland.! Pol Farm declined to accept the offer.”

From 2005 to 2007, Pol Farm made additional investments in the Farm.?? In 2005, Pol Farm
acquired stock and cattle at Bierwznica, a nearby farm, and was granted a short-term lease by
ANR for the buildings there. In exchange, Pol Farm entered into additional agreements for the
continued employment of workers,™* whose numbers grew from 35 to 120 full-time employees
between 2004 and 2007.” Pol Farm also invested substantially in dairy production during this

period.”

In 2006, Pol Farm requested from ANR a cancellation of 32 percent of the rent due under the
lease for the first half of 2006, as well as an extension for payment of the remaining amount from
15 November 2006 to 31 January 2007.7’ According to the Respondent, ANR agreed with

Pol Farm’s request.”*

In 2007, Pol Farm, according to the Claimants, submitted a letter to ANR in which it proposed to
purchase the buildings on the Farm outright.” Subsequently, Pol Farm attended a meeting in the
autumn of 2007, during which ANR again proposed the renegotiation of the Lease Agreement
and d that the be ded to the pre-signed proposal it had sent in its earlier

letter.*° Pol Farm declined the offer. During the course of the meeting, Pol Farm claims it informed

ANR it would start producing raspberries on the farm from the spring of 2008, receiving, in its
view, no apparent objection.*! Taking this as implied consent, Pol Farm did not ask for a ‘change

of purpose’ of the Lease.

Cc. ANR’S INSPECTIONS OF AND COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FARM.

On 3 October 2005, in response to what ANR considered to be the dilapidated condition of various
buildings on the Farm, ANR concluded two contracts with Pol Farm which set a deadline of

30 May 2006 for the demolition of the buildings.*”

On 6 July 2006, ANR met with Pol Farm employees Mr Marian Kiwkowicz and Ms Monika
Wojcik, during which ANR expressed its disappointment with Pol Farm’s failure to comply with
earlier agreements regarding the renovation and maintenance of buildings leased from the
Agency.*? On 7 December 2006, Mr Geir Almas wrote to ANR agreeing that Pol Farm had failed

to implement previously agreed measures.

Between 2007 and 2009, ANR conducted various inspections of the Farm.** On 23 November
2007, ANR conducted an inspection.** Section II.7 of the ensuing report, summarising the
inspector’s conclusions, set out the following remarks:

1. The physical liquidation of the heifer buildings must be commenced

immediately as there is a risk of their collapse - the demolition decision was
issued by the Agency Branch in Koszalin in 2005.

2. The fallow meadows set aside, approx. area of 200 hectares, must be restored
to use until 2015, however approx. 100 hectares should be utilized earlier until
2010.

3. The arable land which is not currently used, approx. 50 hectares, must be

rehabilitated. The deadline is until 2010.

4, According to the lease agreement (§7.2), the leaseholder must regularly
renovate the existing buildings. The deadline is now.

5. The building protection against third-party access must be strengthened to
avoid fire (arson).*”
How far and when the Claimants were informed of ANR’s concerns is in dispute.** The record
indicates, however, that Pol Farm had obtained a copy of the inspection report by 15 January

2008.”

On 15 February 2008, ANR sent a letter to Pol Farm with a copy of the report.”° The letter noted
the detection of several ‘irregularities’ during the inspection, demanded certain improvements to
buildings and land, and requested that Pol Farm act by 31 December 2010 to make the land

‘cultivated and developed’.*! The letter stated:

1. The Company is obliged to liquidate immediately the buildings of the heifers
in physical terms (as they are about to collapse), to which the decision on
disassembly was given by the Branch of ANR in Koszalin in 2005;

2. The Company is obliged to develop the meadows with the area of about 200ha
by 31 December 2015, however, by 31 December 2010, about 100ha of
meadows are to be developed;

3. By 31 December 2010, the agricultural lands are to be cultivated and
developed with the area of SOha. The deadline for performance by
31 December 2010.

4, In accordance with the lease agreement concluded, par. 7 points 2, the lessor
shall be obliged to make systematic repairs of the buildings. The deadline -
now.

5. The security of buildings should be increased from the entry of third persons

so as to not allow fires (arson).

6. The Company is obliged to establish and conduct on a currently basis the
books of the construction facilities. The deadline for establishing and
introducing the book by 31 June 2008.
In response, Pol Farm made certain repairs to the buildings identified by ANR’s report as in need

of maintenance.” The timing of other measures is in dispute. The Claimants state that Pol Farm

fenced off parts of the land and undertook security measures to comply with ANR’s fifth
recommendation, including through the installation of security cameras and the hiring of security
guards,“* but the Respondent suggests these measures preceded ANR’s 2007 inspection,** and

that further promised measures were not taken.

On 30 May 2008, the Mayor of Swidwin wrote a letter to ANR expressing support for Pol Farm
as a substantial local employer, and stating that ‘[a]ny slowdown of the Company’s operations,
and especially a case of its full withdrawal from the local market, would lead to serious

repercussions for the economy of the Commune.’“* He added:

Considering the above, when re-negotiating the lease agreement made with Polfarm
we kindly ask that such circumstances be analysed, taking into account the interests
of both the Agency as well as Swidwin Commune which is looking forward [to]
keeping the strategic investor on the local market.”

On 19 September 2008, ANR conducted a second inspection of Pol Farm.“* During the inspection,
the Claimants provided ANR with a list of repair work carried out in accordance with ANR’s

letter of 15 February 2008.”

On 7 October 2008, ANR sent a letter to Pol Farm referring to a number of observations the
Agency had made during its inspection and noting that further ‘irregularities’ had been detected,
including the continued presence on the Farm of several heifer buildings that had, under the 2005
agreements, been due to be demolished by 30 May 2006.” In its letter, ANR: (i) requested that
Pol Farm ‘provide written explanations of why the arrangements concerning demolition . . . had
not been performed’;*! (ii) acknowledged the Company’s improvements with regard to ANR’s

previous request to conduct other maintenance and repairs on the Farm; (iii) noted that Pol Farm’s

building logbooks were incomplete;*? and (iv) demanded an explanation for why raspberries had

been planted on parts of the land. It wrote:

The lessor presented the structure of crops constituting annex no 2 to the note, from
which it results that on the plots no 21/28, 23, 86, 150, the Klepezewo district, the
multi-year plantation of raspberries was established with the area of 50 ha, as a result,
the Lessor shall submit an explanation in writing why the plantation was founded
without the consent of the Agency. The deadline for submitting the explanation is
31 October 2008.
In Pol Farm’s response of the same month, the Company requested ANR to extend the deadline
for a written response to 30 November 2008.™ Pol Farm also requested that ANR clarify the basis
in the Lease Agreement for requiring consultation regarding the plantation of raspberries.** ANR

did not respond to the letter.*

On 11 December 2008, ANR conducted a third inspection of the Farm. The inspection revealed

that no further demolition work had been carried out.*”

D. DETERIORATION OF POL FARM’S FINANCIAL SITUATION

In 2008, drought and financial recession reduced Pol Farm’s profits.** Pol Farm’s potato and grain
crops failed and prices, particularly for dairy, fell significantly. Pol Farm defaulted on lease
payments on both due dates in 2008, although enough was paid to avoid triggering ANR’s right

to terminate the lease (see paragraph 245 below).*°

On 30 April 2009, the Claimants signed a letter of intent with a German company, Agrar Invest
Holding, to sell Pol Farm for PLN 75 million (EUR 18 million).°° Under the proposed terms of
the deal, the Claimants would transfer their shareholdings in Pol Farm to Norwegian investment

companies Hermod Farms AS and Skogbrynet Eiendom AS, which were accordingly included as

7 million, however, and the attempted sale was ultimately abandoned.

On 6 May 2009, ANR received a letter from Kancelaria Radc6w Prawnych Nosowski,
Konratowski i Wspdlnicy, a law firm representing one of Pol Farm’s creditors, requesting

information as to Pol Farm’s liabilities to ANR.

On 8 May 2009, ANR’s Koszalin branch held an internal meeting attended by Deputy Director
Marek Gil, ANR’s deputy chief accountant, a legal advisor, and other employees to discuss Pol
Farm’s financial situation.“ An internal ANR memorandum (the ‘ANR Memorandum’),
authored by Mr Witold Nowak, records multiple internal ANR meetings about Pol Farm and
notes, with respect to the 8 May 2009 meeting, ANR’s observations that: (i) Pol Farm’s debts
might exceed the total value of its assets; (ii) several enforcement proceedings were pending
against the Company; and (iii) that there was ‘a real threat’ that Pol Farm’s creditors could file a
petition in bankruptcy in response to Pol Farm’s financial difficulties and late payments.® Those
present at the meeting also interpreted the 6 May 2009 enquiry into Pol Farm’s liabilities as ‘a
signal that the Company has multiple public-law, civil-law and loan obligations of significant
value.’® Mr Gil concluded that ANR would file a claim against Pol Farm for outstanding rent and

contractual penalties.

The ANR Memorandum makes reference to the fact that on 6 May 2009, Pol Farm twice
contacted ANR, transferred PLN 50,000 in outstanding rent due, and requested an urgent
meeting.® As a result of these interventions, the minutes of ANR’s meeting indicate that Mr Gil
‘decided to withhold submitting the statement of claim’ pending an assessment of whether

Pol Farm would comply with its earlier representations.

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

On 12 May 2009, Mr Geir Almas met with representatives of ANR to discuss Pol Farm’s financial
situation.” At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr Almas undertook, according to the
ANR Memorandum, that Pol Farm would pay off its outstanding debt in monthly instalments of
PLN 100,000, and promised to ‘submit such a proposal in writing’.”” The ANR Memorandum
records ANR’s interpretation of Mr Almas’ promise as ‘a play for time’.”! Nevertheless, Mr Gil
determined that ANR would refrain from terminating the Lease Agreement pending Pol Farm’s

subsequent actions:

Termination of the agreement will be considered depending on whether the
Company complies with its proposal as regards handling the debt and on the basis of
other information that shows the Company’s current financial and organisational
status.”

On 14 May 2009, Pol Farm wrote to ANR and informed it that ‘difficulties in paying off debts
due to you are only transitory and are caused by factors unrelated to the Company’.”*

On 15 May 2009, the Claimants wrote to the Swidwin Municipality requesting the deferral of an
instalment of agricultural tax due.” By letter dated 21 May 2009, the municipality agreed to defer

the deadline for payment to 30 September 2009.”°

On 21 May 2009, ANR wrote to Pol Farm to demand payment of liquidated damages” for
Pol Farm’s alleged failure to demolish a building as required under two agreements signed by
Mr Marian Kiwkowicz, Pol Farm’s field manager, in 2005.7 ANR subsequently referred the
matter to debt collection.” Pol Farm disputed the claim on the ground that Mr Kiwkowicz lacked
authority to sign them, and obtained a preliminary injunction against collection. Further debt

collection was stayed pending resolution of the dispute.”

E. TERMINATION OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT

On 30 June 2009, ANR held another internal meeting at which it discussed Pol Farm’s
non-performance of its obligations under the Lease Agreement, including the Company’s failure
to provide ANR with its financial documents and to pay PLN 300,000 in late rent. At the

meeting, ANR resolved to terminate the Lease Agreement.

On 7 July 2009, ANR served Pol Farm with a Notice of Termination purporting to terminate the
Lease Agreement with immediate effect.*! ANR justified the termination by reference to the
clause in the Lease Agreement requiring ANR’s prior written consent in order to change the use
of the land: ‘In connection with infringing the conditions of the lease .. . i.e. par. 5 it. | involving
the change of the purpose of the subject of the case — [ANR’s Koszalin branch] — quoting par. 17
— hereby terminates the Agreement without the preservation of the statutory notice period.’*?
Pol Farm was given until 31 August 2009 to relinquish control over the land to ANR and to sign
a handover protocol.*?

On 14 July 2009, Pol Farm, acting through its legal representatives, requested further clarification
of the grounds for termination of the Lease Agreement.* Pol Farm also proposed a meeting with

ANR to discuss the circumstances concerning ANR’s decision to terminate the Lease.*°

On 16 July 2009, ANR and Pol Farm met to discuss ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement.*°
During the meeting, Pol Farm undertook to settle outstanding payments and to provide ANR with
a ‘recovery plan’.87 An ANR Memorandum of 8 May 2009, which incorporates ANR’s
observations from events subsequent to the termination of the Lease Agreement, including this

meeting, suggests that the meeting ended unsuccessfully:

During the meeting, the representatives of the Company failed to provide any
particular proposal or declaration that would show that their approach to [the]
Company’s problems is serious . . . . They declared that they will submit a formal

proposal or a recovery programme within 10 days, and analysing which would allow

the Agency to change its mind. In response, Mr Marek Gil declared that he is waiting

for a full and documented . . . financial standing of the Company, based on which it

will be possible to assess the Company’s proposal. This expectation has dramatically

changed the approach of the Company’s representatives, who ended the meeting and

stated that the matter will be left for lawyers to handle.**
Lawyers for Pol Farm sent a second letter to ANR on 6 August 2009, requesting that ANR ‘take
a stance’ with regard to the Company’s previous request for clarification as to the grounds for the

termination of the Lease Agreement.”

On 3 August 2009, ANR conducted a further inspection of the Farm. Its post-inspection
memorandum from this period noted that several buildings not in use were ‘not secured against
third parties’ and that ‘only a few’ were fenced as originally requested by ANR in its letter to

Pol Farm dated 15 February 2008.”

On 12 August 2009, Mr Gil of ANR wrote to Pol Farm. He denied that ANR’s behaviour was
contrary to the terms of the Lease Agreement and reiterated the deadline for Pol Farm to return
the land.°! Further, the Agency provided additional reasons for its Notice of Termination. Those
included charges that the Claimants: (i) excluded some land from cultivation, thereby using the
property contrary to its purpose and to the rules of proper management; (ii) did not properly
maintain the buildings, and that, in consequence, the state of the property had deteriorated to a
greater extent than if it had been normally and properly used; and (iii) did not pay all of its public

fees.” The letter stated:

I would also like to clarify that the basis for the renouncement of the Agreement
without the statutory notice period was the breach of the provisions of § 5 item 1,
namely the change of the purpose of the lease object (land structures) as well as using
the lease object to conduct business in a manner non-compliant with the principles
of good administration which hereby present as the cause of the renouncement.

The obligation of Pol Farm sp. z o. in Krosino under the agreement was to maintain
the lease object so that its individual elements did not deteriorate except for normal
wear and tear. This obligation concerned especially maintaining and renovating
buildings and structures as frequently as dictated by the principles of the correct use.
The lessee did not duly perform those obligations.

The breach of § 5 item | of the Agreement regarding the use of the lease object in
accordance with the principles of good administration consisted also in turning some
part of the lands into fallow lands which contradicted those principles.

I would like to additionally raise as the basis for the renouncement of the agreement
the lack of regulation of any statutory charges regarding the lease objects (§ 14 item
regarding § 17 of the Agreement).”*
On 28 August 2009, Pol Farm wrote objecting to the legal basis for the termination of the Lease
Agreement.” On 31 August 2009, the seven-week deadline set by ANR to hand over the premises

passed.

Further meetings between ANR and Pol Farm took place in September and October 2009.*° All,
however, were unsuccessful: they neither led to the withdrawal of the termination of the Lease

Agreement nor to any agreed plan for the continued use of the land.

On 4 September 2009, Pol Farm informed ANR that its shareholders wished to transfer their
shares in the Company to a Polish food manufacturer.°® Pol Farm also indicated its readiness to
accept ANR’s earlier proposal of renegotiating a more limited lease agreement for a smaller area
of land, such that ANR would take over part of the land ‘in order to transfer them to the farmers

nearby.’”” Neither of these eventualities occurred.

F. POL FARM’S BANKRUPTCY

On 4 September 2009, Al-Samer LLC, a Pol Farm creditor, submitted a petition in bankruptcy

On 4 December 2009, the Claimants’ appeal against the liquidation order was rejected, as was

Pol Farm’s petition for a preliminary meeting with creditors.'°!

Subsequent to the order, Pol Farm was liquidated, with its remaining assets distributed to
creditors. ANR assumed control over the Farm in December 2009.'” An external expert report
assessing the damage to the buildings on the Farm estimated damage exceeding normal wear at

PLN 718,500.'%

G. SUBSEQUENT CRIMINAL PROCEEDIN

 

On 22 October 2009, subsequent to the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, the court receiver,
Mr Andrzej Wojtalik, requested the regional prosecutor’s office in Bialogard to investigate
perceived irregularities in Pol Farm’s financial statements and allegations that the Claimants had
misappropriated the Company’s funds.! The complaint related, in particular, to allegations that
the Claimants had ‘tried to embezzle valuable assets’ by transferring Pol Farm’s assets to another

company which they owned, Gospodarstwo B.!°°

Following an investigation, on 2 August 2013, the prosecutor’s office filed an indictment against
the Claimants in connection with several allegations: (i) damage to Pol Farm; (ii) Pol Farm acting
to the detriment of its creditors; (iii) failure of Pol Farm to file for bankruptcy; and (iv) alleged
irregularities in Pol Farm’s statements of account.'*° On 8 October 2015, the Criminal Division

of the Regional Court in Koszalin found the Claimants guilty of misappropriation and several

IV. RELIEF SOUGHT

86. Following the Tribunal’s invitation to the Parties to submit their final requests for relief, on

22 April 2016, the Claimants stated their final ‘Claim for Relief’ requesting the Tribunal to:

1. DECLARE that the Respondent:

(i) has breached Art. VI of the Treaty by subjecting the Claimants’ investment to
measures amounting to expropriation;

(ii) has breached Art. III of the Treaty by failing to accord the Claimants’
investment equitable and reasonable treatment and protection; [and]

(iii) has breached Art. III and VI [of the Treaty] by subjecting the Claimants’
investment to unreasonable and discriminatory treatment.

2. DECLARE that the Respondent is liable to pay damages to the Claimants for the
loss that the Claimants have suffered as result of the Respondent’s breaches of
the Treaty, as set out in section 1 above. The amount of damages payable, which
shall include interest, shall be decided by the Tribunal in a procedure to be set out
in a separate Procedural Order.

3. ORDER the Respondent to pay the fees and expenditures of the Arbitral Tribunal
and of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.

V. THE ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES AS TO JURISDICTION AND MERITS
A. SUMMARY OF PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

As a preliminary matter, the Parties disagree as to whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction. The
Respondent questions the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the following grounds: (i) any conduct of
ANR is not attributable to the Respondent; (ii) the Claimants’ protected investments must be
limited to their shares in Pol Farm only, and do not include their contractual rights under the Lease
Agreement; (iii) in any event, the MFN Clause in the Treaty cannot extend the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction to consider claims other than expropriation of the Claimants’ shares; and
(iv) similarly, the MFN Clause cannot extend jurisdiction to cover the breach of an umbrella

clause.

The Claimants maintain that: (i) ANR’s conduct is attributable to Poland; (ii) the Claimants’
contractual rights under the Lease Agreement are protected investments; (iii) the Treaty permits
the Claimants to claim in an arbitration not only for expropriation but also, by operation of the
MEN Clause, for failure to offer equitable and reasonable treatment; and (iv) the MFN Clause

also permits arbitration of claims for breach of an umbrella clause.

B. ATTRIBUTION OF ANR’S CONDUCT TO POLAND
1. The Respondent’s Arguments

In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants have failed to show that the conduct of ANR is
attributable to Poland for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction. It notes that the party to the
Lease Agreement, ANR, is a legal entity separate from the Republic of Poland. ANR’s conduct,

which amounts to that of an ordinary commercial party, cannot be attributed to the Respondent.

Respondent was set out in its Statement of Defence, §80 and Statement of Rejoinder, §236.

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

The Parties agree that the question of attribution is to be determined by applying the International
Law Commission’s 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful
Acts (the ‘ILC Articles’).!"5

In Poland’s view, ANR does not meet any of the criteria under the ILC Articles to permit
attribution of State responsibility. First, ANR is not a ‘State organ’ for the purposes of Article 4
of the ILC Articles. Second, and considering Articles 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles as alternative
bases on which to attribute State responsibility, the Respondent concludes that the conduct of

ANR ‘does not meet’ either of the tests posed under those provisions.

(a) ANRis not a State organ under Article 4 of the ILC Articles

In the Respondent’s view, ANR is not a ‘State organ’ for the purposes of Article 4 of the
ILC Articles. Article 4 reads:

1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under
international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial
or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the
State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of
a territorial unit of the State.

 

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance
with the internal law of the State.'!

Article 4, in referring to status ‘in accordance with the internal law of the State’,!!> requires

reference to Polish law.''® In this regard, the Respondent notes that Article 3 of the 1991 Act

states that ANR holds ind dent legal p lity, acts d and

ly from the R

 

performs obligations under contracts with third parties in its own name.'!7 On this basis, Polish

law clearly distinguishes ANR from State organs.

The Respondent admits that Article 4(2) of the ILC Articles, and investment case law, permit an

entity to be considered a ‘de facto organ’ of the State even in situations where that entity is not a

State organ under the terms of applicable domestic law.''* In its view, however, two factors are
relevant in assessing whether an entity qualifies as a de facto organ: (i) the level of State
involvement in the entity; and (ii) the level of control ‘actually exercised’ by the State over the
entity.''? ANR complies with neither of these, according to the Respondent. In this regard, the
Respondent contests the Claimants’ argument that the classification of an entity’s act as
‘governmental’ in character can suffice to consider it an organ of the State.'?? Rather, the
government must be ‘substantially involved’ and exercise a ‘high level of control’, a high

threshold not met in this case.'?!

Where, as here, the entity enjoys appreciable autonomy and receives only directions ‘of a general
nature’ from the government, attribution under Article 4 of the ILC Articles is inapposite.'?* The
Respondent notes that ANR enjoys a wide degree of autonomy under the 1991 Act, controls its
own budget, and selects nominees for its governing board through a public appointments

committee.'*

Accordingly, the Respondent concludes that ANR cannot be considered a ‘de facto’ organ of the

State under Article 4(2), any more than it qualifies as an actual organ.

(b) ANR’s conduct is not attributable to the Respondent under the ‘functional
test’ of Article 5 of the ILC Articles

Article 5 of the ILC Articles provides that the conduct of an entity that is not an organ of the State
but which is nevertheless ‘empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of
governmental authority’ is to be considered an act of the State under international law.'** Under
Article 5, for ANR’s conduct to be attributable to it, ANR must have acted ‘in [a] governmental
capacity in the particular instance.”!?5

The Respondent submits that ANR fails to satisfy the so-called ‘functional test’ embodied in

Article 5. This is because, in its view, an act can only be considered an ‘exercise of such

governmental authority’ if the act is not one that could be performed by a commercial entity.!”°
Under Polish law, the Respondent submits that ANR is expressly recognised as acting in
‘a commercial capacity (dominium) as an ordinary contracting party and does not exercise any
sovereign powers (imperium).’'”’ This also holds true, in the Respondent’s view, for the specific

acts complained of by the Claimants:

The termination of the Lease Agreement was an act of an ordinary contracting party
and it was not done in the exercise of any sovereign powers. The evidence submitted
by Respondent clearly demonstrates that the termination was for commercial reasons
only and due to Polfarm’s repeated breaches of the provisions of the agreement. 7°

100. The Respondent reiterates that ANR exercises its powers under its own name, including when it

enters into contracts for the lease of agricultural land.'” In this respect, the Respondent
distinguishes Vigotop v. Hungary (on which the Claimants rely for the proposition that political
grounds for a decision suffice to demonstrate that an entity acted in a sovereign capacity).'*° In
that case the Hungarian State, not a separate entity, acted to terminate a contract to which it was

itself a party.

101. Inany event, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ submission that ANR’s Notice of Termination

was motivated by a policy to redistribute land to Polish farmers at the expense of foreign
lessees.'*! It contests, for instance, the press articles cited by the Claimants to support their
allegations that illegitimate political motives—either in favour of local farmers or as part of a
more general drive to reduce the number of leases in effect—drove ANR to terminate the Lease
Agreement.'” In the Respondent’s view, the articles do not demonstrate that ANR’s termination
occurred because of a desire to subsequently lease the land to Polish family farmers, only that it

was (in part) subsequently so leased.'**

Award, 27 June 2016

(c) ANR’s conduct is not attributable to the Respondent under the ‘control test’
of Article 8 of the ILC Articles

102. Finally, the Respondent considers Article 8 of the ILC Rules, which holds the conduct of a

separate entity to be attributable to the State under international law ‘if such entity is in fact acting
on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of,’ that State.'** According to the
Respondent, the ‘opposite is true’ in the present case.'** ANR’s decision to terminate the Lease
Agreement, it suggests, was an autonomous decision based on lawful or at least arguable grounds
of contractual breach. The ANR Memorandum of 8 May 2009 ‘confirms beyond any doubt that
the decision to terminate the Lease Agreement was made autonomously’ and that there was ‘no

involvement of any representatives of Respondent in the decision-making process.’°

103. For these reasons, the Respondent regards ANR to have acted independently of Poland in

terminating the Lease Agreement, and the Claimants to have failed to prove any conduct

attributable to the Respondent which could constitute a violation of the Treaty.

2. The Claimants’ Arguments

(a) ANR acted as a State organ, or at least in a sovereign capacity, when
terminating the Lease Agreement, and its conduct is attributable to Poland

104. The Claimants consider ANR to qualify as an ‘organ’ of the State of Poland for the purposes of

Article 4 of the ILC Articles. In the view of the Claimants, Article 4 must be read so as to include

a ‘broad range’ of entities.'°7

105. In the alternative, the Claimants suggest that, under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, ANR’s conduct

34

35

136

38

should nevertheless be attributed to the Respondent on the basis that ANR exercised ‘elements of
. .. governmental authority’ when it terminated the Lease Agreement.'** They urge the Tribunal

to consider ANR ‘based on a joint assessment’ of Articles 4 and 5 of the ILC Articles, noting that

27

106. Citing decisions of other arbitral tribunals, such as MCI Power v. Ecuador,

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

previous tribunals have, to establish State attribution, considered the two alternatives ‘in

conjunction’, rather than strictly as separate tests for attribution.'°

(b) ANR is an organ of the State for the purpose of Article 4 of the ILC Articles

the Claimants

submit that an entity with competence to exercise public powers and to enter into contracts with
private operators, and possessing an ‘institutional structure and composition’ indicative of State
control or influence, should qualify as an ‘organ’ of the State for the purposes of attributing that

entity’s conduct to the State under international law.'*!

107. In the case of ANR, the Claimants argue that the Agency’s founding documents are strongly

indicative of ANR’s status as an extension of the Respondent itself:

(a) Under Article 3 of the 1991 Act, ANR is defined as ‘a state legal entity . . . supervised

by the Minister for rural development.’'*?

(b) Polish law further describes ANR as a ‘state legal person . . . established in order to
enable to realisation of “important economic tasks that should be supported from the

state budget”.’!45

(c) ANR’s official website, at a governmental address,'“4 describes the Agency as ‘a state
institution ...a trust organization authorized by the state treasury.’'5 The website
provides, further, that ANR acts pursuant to federal legislation, enjoys rights of

pre-emption and buyout for purchasing agricultural land on the free market, and

Respondent in its Rejoinder considered that a more accurate translation would be ‘State legal personality’.
Statement of Rejoinder, p. 34, fn. 78; Hearing Day 1, p. 65. The Polish interpreters confirmed that this phrase
should be translated as ‘State legal personality.” (See Letter dated 8 April 2016 from the PCA to the Parties).

exercises ownership rights over companies considered by the Ministry of Agriculture

and Rural Development ‘as particularly important for [the] national economy.’!“°

108. While the Claimants acknowledge that ANR performs duties in its own name, they consider this

point neither ‘particularly relevant’ nor inconsistent with the observation in the Commentary to
Article 4 of the ILC Articles that ‘characterization as a state organ under international law does
not depend on the status of the entity’ under domestic law.'*” ANR acts as an agent of Poland in
managing and disposing of State land; whether or not it is considered an ‘ordinary’ contracting

party under Polish law is not dispositive.

(c) ANR’s conduct is attributable to the Respondent based on its function and
control under Article 5 of the ILC Articles

109. Even if ANR is not a State organ under Article 4 of the ILC Articles, the Claimants submit that,

at a minimum, the Agency’s conduct must be considered attributable on the basis of ANR’s

overall function and control.

110. To demonstrate that ANR falls within the scope of Article 5, the Claimants cite the

ILC Commentary for the proposition that the article covers a ‘wide variety of bodies’ empowered
to exercise ‘elements of governmental authority.’'“* In the view of the Claimants, the ‘formal
designation in the domestic legal system’ is not decisive; rather, factors to be taken into account
include (i) the manner in which the entity is empowered by the State to exercise authority, (ii) the

content of the powers conferred, and (iii) the links between the entity and the State itself.'°

111. In this regard, the Claimants emphasise that ANR’s conduct, regardless of how it is domestically

146

147

148.

49

characterised, is guided by State policy. They cite, among others, the following factors as

examples in support of the proposition that ANR acts to further the Respondent’s public policy:

(a) Leading board members of the Agency are appointed by the Polish Minister of
Agriculture or by the Prime Minister upon motion by the Minister of Agriculture, and

annual reports of ANR activities are submitted by the agriculture ministry to the Polish

parliament.!°° Similarly, the leadership of ANR routinely changes based on shifting

political coalitions in government.'*!

(b) Article 6(1) of the 1991 Act expressly states that ANR ‘shall perform tasks arising from

State policy.”!*?

Of particular significance for the Claimants is Article 6(a) of the 1991 Act under which ANR is

given the policy aim of ‘creating and improving the area structure of family farms’.

112. Finally, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s assertion that the functional test of Article 5

requires specific acts of a separate entity to be classified as ‘governmental’ in nature in order to
be attributable to the State. Citing decisions such as Vigotop v. Hungary,'** Noble v. Romania,'**

155

and Salini v. Morocco,'» the Claimants submit that, under Article 5, even acts of an ‘ordinary

contracting party’ must be attributed to a respondent State where the entity ‘stepped out of the

contractual shoes,”!*°

as when that entity’s conduct is motivated by considerations of State policy
rather than by commercial considerations. Stated differently, attribution can occur ‘as long as the
conduct is an expression of policy,’ even if the outcome—in this case, the termination of a lease—

could ‘in theory [] also be performed’ by commercial actors.'*7

113. The Claimants submit that ANR terminated the Lease Agreement out of deference to the

156

Respondent’s public policy favouring Polish famers, and not for commercial reasons.

Accordingly, ANR’s conduct must be attributed to the Respondent.

Cc. POL FARM’S CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT AS PROTECTED
INVESTMENTS OF THE CLAIMANTS

1. The Respondent’s Arguments

114. According to the Respondent, the Lease Agreement is not a protected investment under
Article I(1) of the Treaty over which the Claimants are entitled to arbitrate. Although the Treaty
provides for ‘a broad definition of assets’ regarded as protected investments, the Respondent
submits that it is ‘well established that in order to qualify as a protected investment a contractual
right must belong to the investor under the BIT, i.e. the investor must be party to the relevant
contract.’'*8 In this case, the Respondent submits, the contractual rights under the Lease
Agreement did not belong to the Claimants, but rather to Pol Farm. Accordingly, the Respondent
concludes that the investment protected by the BIT does not extend to ‘the contractual rights under

Lease Agreement’ itself, only the Claimants’ shares in Pol Farm.'*°

2. The Claimants’ Arguments

115. The Claimants submit that their claim for expropriation of Pol Farm’s contractual rights is within
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In their view, the investment ‘in and through their company

Pol Farm’ qualifies as a valid investment eligible for protection under the Treaty.’

116. Article I(1) of the BIT provides a ‘broad definition’ of investment, including ‘every kind of asset’,
and specifically lists shares as one type of qualifying asset.'®! The Claimants argue that the Treaty
‘clearly gives an independent standing to shareholders’ such that shareholding of a company
qualifies as an investment.’ Indeed, in the Claimants’ view, any other outcome would render the
Treaty’s protection of any investments rendered through intermediary companies ‘meaningless’
especially since most disputes will centre not on a host State’s imposition of measures directly on

investors’ shares themselves, but rather on the corporate investment vehicle.'

117. The Claimants submit that arbitral case law makes it equally clear that, even where a local
company is not granted the status of an investor under a bilateral investment treaty, an investor’s
participation in that company ‘will be seen as an investment in itself,’ permitting the

shareholder to proceed against the State in the company’s name.

118. Accordingly, by virtue of their shareholding in Pol Farm, the Claimants maintain their ability to
claim against the Respondent for actions impacting any and all of the Company’s assets, including

Pol Farm’s rights under the Lease Agreement.'®

D. USE OF THE MFN CLAUSE TO EXTEND JURISDICTION BEYOND EXPROPRIATION
CLAIMS

1. The Respondent’s Arguments

119. In the Respondent’s view, the Tribunal only has jurisdiction to decide claims arising under
Article VI of the Treaty, namely those pertaining to expropriation.'® All other claims, including
those of fair and equitable treatment, are excluded from jurisdiction. Article VI, which is expressly

referred to in the dispute resolution provisions of Article X, provides:

Expropriation
1. Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the
other Contracting Party cannot be expropriated, nationalized or subjected to
other measures having the same effect (all such measures hereinafter referred
to as ‘expropriation’), unless the following conditions are fulfilled:

(i) the expropriation shall be done for public interest and under domestic
legal procedures;

(ii) it shall not be discriminatory;

(iii) it shall be done only against compensation.

2. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment
immediately before the date of expropriation and shall be paid without undue
delay within such period as normally required for the completion of transfer
formalities, in any case not exceeding three months. The compensation shall
include interest, computed from the first day following the above mentioned

period until the date of payment, at a rate based on LIBOR for the appropriate
currency and corresponding period of time.

120. In this connection, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ suggestion in the alternative, namely
that they may bring non-expropriation claims under the most favoured nation clause in Article IV

of the BIT. Article IV provides:

Investments made by investors of one contracting party in the territory of the other
contracting party, as also the returns therefrom, shall be accorded treatment no less
favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third state.

121. In the Respondent’s view, the MFN Clause cannot allow the Claimants to access dispute
resolution provisions in another BIT. It argues that international jurisprudence and academic
commentary support the proposition that MFN clauses ‘cannot be applied in such a way as to
permit a claimant to avail itself of dispute resolution provisions in a BIT between the host State
and a third State, unless the MEN clause explicitly provides’ for such application.’ Citing awards

123. Similarly, while the RosInvestCo case did allow the claimant to resort to a broader arbitration

clause, this was ‘only because the MEN clause . . . pertained to the treatment of ‘investors’.’!”°

‘investment’ only; since the Claimants are proceeding in their personal capacities, the

MEN Clause is unavailing in this case.!”

2. The Claimants’ Arguments

124. The Claimants rely on Article X(2) of the BIT, which provides that ‘the tribunal reaches its award

on the basis of the provisions of the present Agreement as well as on the general principles and
rules of international law.”!”* In their view, the applicable ‘provisions’ include not only Article VI,
relating to expropriation, but also other provisions, including Article III, relating to promotion
and protection of investments. The wording of Article X, in any event, ‘cannot be interpreted’ to
prevent investors from enforcing other provisions of the Treaty, a position that would render the

Treaty’s promise of investor protections ‘illusory’.'”

125. In the event that the applicability of the dispute resolution provision in Article X is limited to

176

cover only breaches of Article VI, however, the Claimants submit, in the alternative, that the
MEN Clause in Article IV permits them a greater degree of protection that would allow them to
advance claims not limited to expropriation.'*® Because the MFN Clause contains no limiting
language, it ‘will apply to both procedural and material provisions,’ permitting the Claimants a

wider range of substantive protections from which to claim.'*!

In favour of this interpretation, the
Claimants cite a range of cases including Maffezini v. Spain, Gas Natural v. Argentina, and

126. Accordingly, and having regard to the expanded protections given to investors under Article 7 of

E. USE OF MEN CLAUSE TO INCORPORATE AN UMBRELLA CLAUSE

1. The Respondent’s Arguments

127. The Respondent submits that the Claimants cannot claim protection for their investment under

the umbrella clause contained in a BIT with a third party by virtue of the MFN Clause in
Article IV of the Treaty.

128. In keeping with its previous jurisdictional objection to the invocation of the MFN Clause, the

Respondent submits that the arbitration clause in Article X of the BIT covers only treaty claims
under Article VI, limited to expropriation.'** Accordingly, claims regarding breach of some other
provision of the Treaty or in another BIT, including the Dutch-Poland BIT, are outside the scope

of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

129. Second, even if the MFN Clause permitted recourse to an umbrella clause in a third-party BIT in

general, the Respondent notes that the Croatia-Poland BIT, on which the Claimants rely, does not

contain an umbrella clause and accordingly cannot cover claims pertaining to the breach of one.'*°

131. Accordingly, the Claimants seek to benefit from substantive protections under Article 3(5) of the
Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Poland on
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the ‘Dutch-Poland BIT”).'** That

article provides:

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it may have entered into with
regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.'®”

F. THE PARTIES’ CHARACTERISATION OF THE FACTUAL RECORD

132. Central to the dispute over the merits is a question of characterisation. The Claimants allege that
ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement was unjustified under its provisions but was
motivated by impermissible political aims, specifically the redistribution of land to Polish
farmers. In contrast, the Respondent argues that ANR duly terminated the Lease Agreement
owing to the Claimants’ repeated violations of specific provisions, including Pol Farm’s failure

to maintain the land as required under that Agreement.

1. The Claimants’ Arguments

(a) ANR was not justified in terminating the Lease Agreement under any of its
provisions
133. Section 17 of the Lease Agreement permits ANR to terminate the lease without the one-year
statutory notice period when certain conditions are met, specifically ‘if the Lessee lags behind
with rent for a minimum of two terms of payment or when [it] fails to fulfil the duties described
in § 5 and § 14 point 1.’ The Claimants argue, accordingly, that premature termination without

notice would have been permissible only where:

(i) Pol Farm was in delay with payments of rent for more than two calculation periods;

(ii) Pol Farm violated its obligations under § 5 (concerning the manner of use of the
leased property and requirements regarding minimum number of employees); or

(iii) Pol Farm violated its obligations under § 14(1) (concerning duty to pay regulatory
fees and taxes and other public fees relating to the leased property).'°°

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

In the Claimants’ view, ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement cannot be justified on any of
these grounds. They argue, in particular, that: (i) Pol Farm never changed the use or purpose of
the leased land; (ii) in any event, the plantation of raspberries (of which specific complaint was
made) was duly communicated to ANR; and (iii) Pol Farm complied with all other provisions of
the Lease Agreement, including its obligation to pay rent and other applicable fees and taxes.

Accordingly, the Claimants submit that ANR was not justified in terminating the Lease.

(i) The Claimants did not change the ‘required use’ of the land

Section 5(1) of the Lease required Pol Farm ‘to use and manage the rented property in order to
conduct their business activity there.”!! It specified, further, that Pol Farm could not ‘change the
required use’ of the property absent ANR’s explicit consent.'°?

ANR’s Notice of Termination dated 7 July 2009, only briefly specified the reasons for

termination:

infringing the conditions of the lease . . . i.e. par. 5. it. 1 involving the change of the
purpose of the subject of the case . . . hereby terminates . . . without the preservation
of the statutory notice period.'°?

On 12 August 2009, in response to a letter from the Claimants requesting clarification, ANR

provided further reasons:

I would also like to clarify that the basis for the renouncement of the Agreement
without the statutory notice period was the breach of the provisions of § 5 item 1,
namely the change of the purpose of the lease object (land, structures) as well as
using the lease object to conduct business in a manner non-compliant with the
principles of good administration which I hereby present as the cause of the
renouncement.

The breach of § 5 item | of the Agreement regarding the usage of the lease object in
accordance with the principles of good administration consisted also in turning some
part of the lands into fallow lands, which contradicted those principles.'*4

In light of their correspondence with ANR, the Claimants consider the principal justification on

which ANR relies to be the allegation that Pol Farm changed the use or purpose of the land without

Award, 27 June 2016

consulting ANR and without obtaining the required consent, pursuant to Section 5(1) of the Lease

Agreement. In the Claimants’ view, Pol Farm cannot be said to have violated this provision.

139. First, and proceeding on the assumption that ANR’s arguments regarding the ‘change of use’ of

the Farm are ultimately grounded on Pol Farm’s decision, in 2008, to plant raspberries on the
land, the Claimants argue that this action did nothing to deprive the land of its original purpose

under the Lease Agreement.

140. As a threshold matter, the Claimants note that the Lease Agreement does not specify the ‘agreed

purpose’ of the property at all, referring only to Pol Farm’s ‘business activity’.'°° That term, they
submit, should be interpreted in light of Poland’s statutory definition of conduct constituting
‘proper management’ of leased property, a term of art that relates to maintenance, investment,
and other activities necessary to prevent a diminution of value of land during the duration of a

lease.!°°

141. In this connection, the Claimants argue that the planting of raspberries, in itself, neither affected

95

196

97

98

99

200

201

the ‘proper management’ of the leased property nor altered the character of the Farm or its land.
In his witness statement, Mr Geir Almas observes that raspberries constituted only 50 out of 4,200
hectares then in use by the Farm.'*’ The Claimants note that the Farm was a ‘multi-purpose’
enterprise used for the production of, among other things, grain, milk, and meat. In this context,
the production of raspberries ‘cannot be seen as outside an agricultural purpose, as it is
horticulture, using traditional farming principles.’!°* Indeed, the Claimants submit that
horticultural activities are ‘included in the purpose of the Lease Agreement”! and also fall within
the statutory definition of ‘land intended for agricultural use’ under Polish law.?” Article 46 of

the Polish Civil Code, for instance, provides:

Agricultural real estate (agricultural land) is any real estate which is or may be used
to conduct agricultural production, both crop and animal farming, including
gardening, horticulture and fish farming.”°"!

142. Second, and in any event, the Claimants submit that ANR was duly informed of the development.

143. In the Claimants’ view, ANR’s subsequent silence amounted to ‘implied consent’ from ANR.

In particular, the Claimants imply that ANR was effectively put on notice of the development as
early as October 2008, when Pol Farm informed ANR in a letter of its decision to plant raspberries

on the area of land in question. ANR did not reply to this letter.

202
In light of ANR’s non-objection over repeated occasions to Pol Farm’s raspberry plantation—
only raising the issue in its inspection report of May 2009—the Claimants submit that ‘change of

purpose’ of the land cannot have been a bona fide reason underlying ANR’s decision to terminate

the lease.

144. Finally, the Claimants suggest that the Tribunal should not allow the Respondent to rely on

grounds other than those stated in its Notice of Termination on 7 July 2009.7" They argue that,
given ANR’s belated response to the Claimants’ requests for clarification of the grounds on which
ANR terminated the Lease, ANR’s conduct justifies an inference that the reasons for its decision
had to be ‘construct[ed]’ on artificial premises. The Claimants note, in any event, that to
exclude subsequent reasons provided after the termination itself is ‘consistent with Polish contract

205

law’ and rely on an expert report to that effect.

(ii) The Claimants complied with the Lease Agreement in all other respects

145. The Claimants submit that the remaining grounds under which immediate termination of the

202

203

204

205

206

207

Lease Agreement was permitted (without providing Pol Farm with the one-year statutory notice
period) are equally inapplicable. As a factual matter, the Claimants dispute that Pol Farm’s delays
in paying rent could trigger the effects of Section 5(1) of the Lease Agreement, since Pol Farm,
although in arrears, never fell behind by two or more consecutive periods.’ Equally, Pol Farm
complied with its obligations to pay other regulatory fees. Its failure to make payments on other
amounts due, such as social security, however substantial, could not justify termination of the

Lease Agreement because they were not ‘connected with’ the leased property.”””

146. In any event, other grounds, unrelated to the change in use or purpose of the leased land, cannot

be considered as justifying termination of the Lease Agreement. Citing a Polish legal opinion,”
the Claimants argue that the only ground under which termination is properly assessed is that
offered in the Notice of Termination, and not in any subsequent communications offered to
elaborate or modify ANR’s original reasoning.” Since ANR’s letter of 7 July 2009 only included
the ‘change of use’ clause as purported justification, the Claimants submit that only this ground—
and not others added ‘retroactively’ in later communications with Pol Farm or in this arbitration—

can be considered.

147. Accordingly, the Claimants conclude that ANR acted outside the contractual bounds of the Lease

Agreement in terminating the Lease.

(b) ANR acted to terminate the Lease Agreement for political reasons

148. According to the Claimants, ANR’s termination of the Lease was motivated by a policy to

redistribute land to local Polish farmers at the expense of foreign lessees, not on the basis of any
of the grounds specified under Section 5(1) of the Lease Agreement. In support of their argument,
the Claimants submit expert reports referring to: (i) ANR’s purported anticipation of Polish
legislation, which entered into force in 2011, requiring ANR to attempt to renegotiate smaller
leases with foreign lessees;7"° (ii) the potential role that the Polish constitutional doctrine of the
‘family farmstead’ played in guiding ANR to favour Polish farmers and farmers’ organisations

over foreign lessees;7"!

and (iii) two newspaper articles in which ANR officials, in the Claimants’
view, indicate that the decision to terminate the Lease Agreement was a political one in line with

the motive described above.?!?

149. In the Claimants’ view, even if a contractual right to terminate did exist and was available under

the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal nevertheless has an obligation to consider whether

those reasons were in fact relied upon to support such termination. In this regard, the Claimants

rely heavily on Vigotop Limited v. Hungary'} for the proposition that, if contractual grounds
invoked by a respondent State for termination are not ‘sufficiently well-founded, then this would
indicate that those grounds were merely a pretext designed to conceal a purely expropriatory

measure.”*!*

150. In this connection, the Claimants assert that ANR’s conduct is an example of contractual grounds

for termination of an agreement being used to mask the true motivation for terminating the Lease

Agreement. They state:

[T]he termination was discriminatory, in that the apparent reason for ANR’s
termination is policy reasons as it wanted to give farm land to [P]olish farmers[.]

[T]he ANR had a political agenda, i.e. reducing the number of lease agreements, and
. .. the termination was in order to give effect to a change in policy . . . to sell land
to [Polish farmers at the expense of foreign investors[.]?!>

151. The Claimants submit that several factors support their interpretation of ANR’s motivations. The

first of these is a series of amendments to ANR’s constitutive legislation, the 1991 Act.?!¢ In
March 2010, the Polish Constitutional Tribunal found that provisions of the 1991 Act,
empowering ANR to repurchase land that it had sold within five years, if the value of the land
had significantly increased or if the new owner was considered a speculator, were unconstitutional:
this motivated an amendment to the law in December 2011,7!” which required ANR to submit,
within six months, a proposal to all large-scale farmers to reduce the size of their existing leases

by 30 percent.”!*

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

153. In this regard, the Claimants refer to several newspaper articles that, in their view, reflect ANR’s
intention to redistribute land to local farmers at the expense of foreign lessees. They note, in

particular, the following material:

 

(a) An article dated 19 August 2010 in Polish newspaper Kurier Olsztynski which quoted
Adam Poniewski, an ANR official, as noting that much of the land at ANR’s disposal
is highly fragmented and that, ‘[i]n those regions, where there is huge demand for land
on the part of the farmers, we do not renew lease agreements ....Last year we
terminated a lease agreement for 4200 hectares with a Norwegian equity company. We

let [it] to farmers who took part in a close[d] tender.’ It is not disputed that this was

a reference to the Pol Farm land.

(b) An article dated 9 April 2011 in the Norwegian newspaper Dagens Nerringsliv cited
ANR spokesperson Michael Koczalski as stating that ‘ANR’s goal is to sell as much

land as possible to [P]olish farmers.’7”!

154. In the Claimants’ view, these articles provide further indication ‘that ANR had a political
agenda,’ namely the renegotiation of lease agreements (where possible) and the termination of
leases outright (where necessary) in order to meet demand on the part of local farmers for larger
tracts of land.” They reject the Respondent’s suggestion that the quotations draw no connection
between the underlying cause for the termination and ANR’s desire to sell land to Polish farmers,
suggesting there is ‘a clear correlation’ between statements regarding demand for land, ANR’s

policy of non-renewal of leases, and references to ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement.?**

2. The Respondent’s Arguments

155. In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants themselves are principally responsible for the financial
conditions under which Pol Farm struggled to perform its contractual obligations and which

ultimately led to ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement on 7 July 2009. Pol Farm’s

liquidation, it submits, was driven by the Claimants’ own financial mismanagement, which

resulted in material breaches of the Lease Agreement and justified the Lease’s termination.

(a) Pol Farm’s financial troubles and bankruptcy were due to the Claimants’
poor investment decisions

156. Rather than precipitating Pol Farm’s financial collapse, the Respondent considers ANR’s

termination of the Lease Agreement to have been in response to, and justified by, Pol Farm’s
serious financial difficulties and its resultant failure to comply with its contractual obligations. In
this respect, it rejects the narrative that ‘Pol Farm was a prosperous business enterprise’ before

the termination of the Lease forced the Company into bankruptcy.”

157. Relying on statements by Pol Farm’s former accountant, Ms Jadwiga Luzynska, the Respondent

submits that Pol Farm’s financial difficulties stem from its decision, in 2007, to implement a
business strategy focused on large, capital-intensive investments.””° In its view, the Claimants’
strategy proved harmful to Pol Farm’s creditors, suppliers, employees, and even the health of its
animals. In the period from 2008 to 2009, for instance, the Company’s suppliers ‘started
repeatedly sending summons for overdue payment.’??’ The Company’s employees, too, made
allegations of mismanagement against Pol Farm, accusing the owners ‘of wastefulness and
extravagance,’ including through the purchase of luxury cars and items unrelated to the

Company’s business.”*

158. According to the Respondent, Pol Farm’s financial difficulties became more severe in the period

225

226

227

228

229

230

immediately preceding the termination of the Lease. In 2008, for instance, Pol Farm’s auditor
observed that the Company suffered a loss of PLN 6,595,033. From April 2009, ‘at least
44 court orders for payment and judgments’ were issued against Pol Farm.?*° The Respondent

points to the following statistics as additional indicators of Pol Farm’s viability:

(a) According to the court-appointed expert in the criminal proceedings against the

Claimants, Pol Farm stopped paying its creditors altogether on 30 September 2008.7!

(b) At the time of the termination of the Lease Agreement, the Company had unpaid wages
amounting to PLN 600,000 and unpaid employee insurance contributions totalling
PLN 1,200,000.??

(c) Animals on the Farm were allegedly underfed and undernourished.”** According to the
court-appointed expert’s report, Pol Farm’s neglect of its livestock resulted in a

decrease in the value of the Farm’s herd amounting approximately to PLN 3,000,000.2**

159. By the time the Lease Agreement was terminated on 7 July 2009, the Respondent argues that Pol

Farm was ‘a bankrupt company’,”* estimating Pol Farm’s financial liabilities toward various

creditors at over PLN 21,000,000 (approximately EUR 5,250,000).?*° Despite Pol Farm’s
financial distress, the Respondent notes that the Claimants neither filed a petition in bankruptcy
for Pol Farm nor provided it with the necessary funding to allow it to meet its liabilities.?"’ The
ultimate initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, it notes, followed from petitions in bankruptcy filed

by Pol Farm’s creditors, dated 4 and 7 September 2009.7

160. In light of the foregoing facts, the Respondent considers the Claimants’ observations to ANR that

234

236

240

Pol Farm’s difficulties in paying off debts were ‘transitory’ or ‘caused by factors unrelated to the
Company’ to be ‘misleading’. While recession and drought ‘may have increased’ the
Company’s financial difficulties in 2008, ‘they definitely did not trigger it.’ The Respondent

states:

At that point in time the Company was already on the path to insolvency due to
Claimants’ ever-increasing expenditure and overinvestment. Consequently,

Claimants’ allegation that ‘as a direct result of the unlawful termination of the Lease
Agreement, Pol Farm’s financial situation became impossible’ does not reflect the
true reasons behind Pol Farm’s bankruptcy.”4!

161. The Respondent submits that the subsequent institution of criminal proceedings against the

9242

Claimants ‘for acting to the creditors’ detriment and for misappropriating Pol Farm’s funds,

following a preliminary analysis by the bankruptcy court of Pol Farm’s financial documents, is

further evidence that the Company’s financial failures cannot be blamed on outside forces.”*

(b) ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement was justified by Pol Farm’s
consistent failure to properly manage the leased property and to perform its
contractual obligations

162. In the Respondent’s view, Pol Farm’s chronic financial distress in the period from 2008 to 2009

led to the result that the Company proved unable to comply with its obligations under the Lease
Agreement. In its view, ANR was therefore justified in terminating the Lease Agreement on 7

July 2009.

163. The Respondent argues that the ‘first indications’ of Pol Farm’s looming default became clear in

2006, when Pol Farm requested the cancellation of a significant portion of rent due as well as an
extension of the deadline for payment of the remaining balance.*“* ANR granted Pol Farm’s

245

requests.”

164. Despite ANR’s flexibility and its attempts to accommodate Pol Farm’s financial difficulties, the

2a

242

Respondent submits that the Company consistently failed to implement measures that would have
avoided the need for ANR’s ultimate termination of the Lease. As early as 2006, for instance, Pol
Farm ‘failed to follow ANR’s recommendations for maintenance work’ on identified buildings.**°
The Respondent notes that Mr Geir Almas conceded Pol Farm’s failure to perform its obligations

ina letter to ANR dated 7 December 2006, which states:

With reference to the conversation on 06/07/2006 between you and my employees,
Mr Marian Kiwkowicz and Ms Monika Wéjcik, during which you expressed your
disappointment that Pol Farm had not complied with earlier arrangements made as
regards the buildings leased from the Agency, I have noticed that we do not have the

required reports on the renovations carried out in 2006. From my point of view, our
behaviour in this matter is not satisfactory.”
In the Respondent’s view, these early indications of Pol Farm’s failure to perform its obligations
under the Lease Agreement quickly became the norm. Over the period from 2007 to 2009, ANR
conducted at least four inspections of the Farm. ANR’s inspection reports from this period
indicate that the farmland suffered significantly as a result of Pol Farm’s financial difficulties.“

In connection with ANR’s December 2007 inspection, for example, the Respondent states:

In addition to the fact that the Company was in financial distress, the Farm itself was

in poor condition and devastated, as Claimants had failed to perform their basic

obligations to manage it properly and to conduct regular maintenance work. As a

result, 50% of the buildings were not in use and were decapitalised, at least 200 ha

of arable land was lying fallow and over 50 ha of arable land suitable for cereal

cultivation had been turned into horticultural land.”
The Respondent argues that Pol Farm’s failure to undertake necessary corrections relating to the
irregularities detected by ANR in its December 2007 inspection became ‘a constant bone of
contention between the Parties’.?° In its letter of 15 February 2008, ANR identified six areas
which it expected Pol Farm to address: (i) the liquidation of farm buildings ‘on the verge of
collapsing’; (ii) the development of uncultivated land; (iii) the cultivation of arable land; (iv) the
undertaking of maintenance and repair works on various buildings; (v) strengthening the security
of the buildings against third-party access; and (vi) the introduction of building logbooks.”*' Of
these six recommendations, the first, fourth, and sixth recommendations were to be implemented
‘immediately’. In the Respondent’s view, however, Pol Farm failed to address most of ANR’s

concerns:

(a) The demolition of heifer farm buildings: As early as 3 October 2005, ANR concluded
contracts with Pol Farm to demolish several buildings in danger of collapse.” ANR
was ‘particularly surprised’ to discover that these buildings continued to stand on the
property at the time it conducted its December 2007 inspection; it accordingly requested

that Pol Farm immediately carry out the demolitions.*** ANR’s subsequent inspection,

dated 19 September 2008, revealed that the buildings continued to stand.2** ANR asked
for immediate clarification from Pol Farm as to its delay.**° Rather than explain its
reasons for the delay, Pol Farm asked for an extension until 30 November 2008; a
further inspection on 11 December 2008 revealed that no demolition had been carried

out.

(b) Letting land lie fallow: ANR’s December 2007 inspection report indicated that
200 hectares of land were not being cultivated.?*’ ANR gave Pol Farm until 2010 to ‘make
proper use’ of the land and ignored Pol Farm’s continued noncompliance with the
provision in its post-September 2008 inspection memorandum.”** The Respondent argues
that Pol Farm had ‘not even started preparations’ to comply with the request by 2009,

and, in light of its financial situation, ‘it was obvious it would not be able to do so.’?*°

(

&

Failure to cultivate arable land: The Respondent notes that Pol Farm attempted to
comply with its request that the Company recultivate and develop arable land by
planting raspberries on 50 hectares of the Farm.?® In the Respondent’s view, because
the affected plots were arable land and intended for growing and harvesting crops, they

were ‘not fit for horticultural activity’.?°!

(d) Failure to carry out maintenance and repairs: ANR’s post-December 2007 inspection
report required Pol Farm immediately to ‘make systematic repairs to the buildings’.?
The Respondent submits that, in contrast to the Claimants’ allegation that this point was
fully addressed,”* Pol Farm conducted repairs on only ‘a small fraction’ of the

buildings identified.*™ Furthermore, in the Respondent’s view, the work that Pol Farm

did was inadequate and ‘rather cosmetic in nature’.?*° The ANR Memorandum
confirmed the continuing ‘alarming condition’ of the buildings, including missing

windows and roofs.”

(

a&

Insufficient security measures: According to the Respondent, ANR’s recommendation
that Pol Farm enhance the security of the buildings to prevent third-party access and
arson resulted in no additional efforts from Pol Farm.”*’ Because some of the Farm
facilities were already secured with guards and CCTV cameras at the time ANR
conducted its December 2007 inspection, the Respondent considers the Claimants’
argument that the hiring of security staff and installation of cameras was undertaken
subsequent to ANR’s recommendations in this respect to be ‘hardly possible’. In any
event, subsequent inspections confirmed that ‘the buildings that are not in use are not

secured’ and that, ‘of the leased buildings, only few are fenced.’?”

¢

oS

Lack of building logbooks: Finally, the 2007 report required Pol Farm to introduce and
regularly keep building logbooks, which are required under Polish law to document
inspections of a building’s technical state and repairs or reconstruction carried out
during the building’s use.?” The Respondent notes that ANR’s post-September 2008

inspection memorandum reveals that Pol Farm continued to keep incomplete books.?”!

167. The Respondent views with particular concern the Claimants’ plantation of raspberries on the

Farm, which it considers to be contrary to Section 5(1) of the Lease Agreement, stipulating that
Pol Farm ‘cannot change the designated use of the property without the Lessor’s consent’.?” In
the Respondent’s view, Pol Farm’s decision was ‘incomprehensible’ in light of ANR’s repeated

characterisation in its inspection reports of the affected land as ‘arable, not horticultural’.?” It

suggests, in any event, that Pol Farm was under the duty to apply for ANR’s consent to change

the use of the leased plots and to ‘start horticultural activity on them.’?”*

The Respondent argues that ANR ‘patiently and repeatedly’ requested Pol Farm to perform its
obligations as lessee. In light of the foregoing difficulties with securing Pol Farm’s compliance
with its obligations under the Lease Agreement, however, it is the Respondent’s submission that,
despite being given numerous opportunities to rectify the irregularities revealed by ANR
inspections, Pol Farm continued to fail to adhere to ‘the most basic obligations’ by which it was
bound under the Lease Agreement, i.e., to (i) use the leased object ‘properly’ and (ii) preserve the

value of the property through regular upkeep.””>

In the Respondent’s view, Pol Farm’s serial failure to remedy the deteriorating condition of the
Farm constituted a material breach of the Lease Agreement. Though ANR afforded the Claimants
‘ample opportunities’ to remedy Pol Farm’s non-compliance under the lease, the Company, in the
Respondent’s view, consistently failed to live up to its obligations and ‘undermined the trust’ that

ANR had placed in Pol Farm as a reliable commercial partner.’

Accordingly, the Respondent submits that ANR was justified in terminating the Lease Agreement
under Section 5(1) of the lease, relating to the ‘change in use of the leased object’ absent ANR’s
consent.””’ In contrast to the submissions of the Claimants, however, the Respondent argues that
ANR’s decision to terminate the Lease Agreement did not rest on the plantation of raspberries
alone. In the Respondent’s view, Pol Farm illegally changed the use of the leased property with
regard both to the land and to the buildings on the land, as explained by ANR in its subsequent
letter of 12 August 2009.” In this respect, the Respondent maintains, in any event, that a breach
of any of the four requirements under Section 17 of the Lease Agreement—including but not
limited to the unauthorised change of use of the property—would have justified ANR’s

termination.?””

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

To aid in the interpretation of Section 5(1), the Respondent suggests the Tribunal take into account
ANR’s rules for the termination of land leases, titled ‘Lease of the property of the Agricultural

Property Stock of the State Treasury’ and dated January 2008 (‘Rules of Land Lease’):

(2) _ the object of [the] lease is used contrary to proper management rules, and, in
particular:
- inappropriate use of land during the term of the lease agreement
- deterioration of the object of [the] lease due to the lessee’s failure to carry
out renovation and maintenance of buildings and structures at its own
expense.

(3) changing the intended use of the object of [the] lease without consent of the
lessor,

(5) failure to settle liabilities due to public-law charges related to the subject
matter of the agreement (i.e. taxes) and other compulsory charges related to
possession (i.e. insurance).”8°

172. In accordance with the Rules of Land Lease, the Respondent considers that Pol Farm’s failures to

carry out repairs, institute security measures, cultivate and develop land, and make timely rent
payments all relate to the obligations of ‘proper management’ encapsulated by the concept of
‘proper use’ of the land required under Section 5(1) of the Lease Agreement.”*! Accordingly, each
of the Company’s continuing breaches subsequent to ANR’s December 2007 inspection
constitute grounds under which the Lease Agreement would have entitled ANR to terminate the

agreement.

173. Finally, the Respondent also considers that ANR was entitled to terminate the Lease Agreement

280

281

282

283

under Section 14(1) of the Lease Agreement. Under that section, Pol Farm undertook to ‘bear all
the regulatory liabilities connected with the rented property for which, according to legal
provisions, either the owner or the possessor is liable.’*? The Respondent notes, in this regard,
Pol Farm’s failure to pay public dues as well as employee social security contributions amounting

to more than PLN 1,200,000.78*

Award, 27 June 2016

(c) ANR’s choice to terminate the Lease Agreement followed applicable
procedures and was free of political motives

174. The Respondent maintains that Pol Farm’s breaches of the Lease Agreement formed the basis for

ANR’s termination of the Lease on 7 July 2009. It submits that it complied with applicable
procedures and regulations in considering, deciding on, and issuing its Notice of Termination.
The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ assertion that political motivations, including a desire to
reduce the number of leases in force or to redistribute land to Polish farmers, drove the decision

to terminate the lease.

175. On 8 May 2009, ANR held a meeting chaired by Deputy Director Marek Gil to consider

Pol Farm’s financial situation with the aim of ‘discussing supervisory measures available to force
the Company to perform its obligations as the lessee’ under the Lease Agreement.” The meeting
established that Pol Farm’s liabilities were sufficiently large as to threaten to exceed the total
amount of the Company’s assets and revealed the existence of enforcement proceedings against
Pol Farm. The Respondent notes that ANR’s minutes from this meeting clearly demonstrate
that these reasons, and not political factors, grounded Mr Gil’s request that a notice of termination

and statement of claim against Pol Farm be drawn up.”*

176. Additionally, the Respondent suggests that ANR’s consistent accommodation of Pol Farm’s

284

285

286

287

situation and its leniency toward the Company with regard to its performance under the Lease
Agreement contradicts any claim that ANR was intent on dispossessing Pol Farm of its lease. The
Respondent notes that ANR repeatedly delayed issuing its Notice of Termination in response to
late pleas by the Claimants that Pol Farm would improve its financial situation and begin to
perform under the terms of the lease.?*’ ANR only definitively decided on issuing its Notice of
Termination, which had been prepared in May 2009, at ANR’s meeting of 30 June 2009, by which
point the Respondent submits it was clear that: (i) Pol Farm would not submit financial paperwork
as requested; (ii) the Company’s bank account was empty; (iii) Pol Farm had demolished one of

the three milk production facilities on the Farm without seeking ANR’s consent; and

(iv) Company loans were being ‘used to partially finance expenses incurred on the private

property’ of the Claimants.”**

177. Consequently, on 7 July 2009, ANR issued its Notice of Termination and informed Pol Farm that

it was to vacate the property within two months.” The Respondent submits that the termination
was ‘standard procedure in cases where a lessee infringes its contractual obligations’”’ and

followed from the Rules of Land Lease. Section 14.8.1 of those Rules state:

If such reasons are definitely attributable to the lessee (e.g. incompetent
management, intentional action reducing the value of the object of lease), the
agreement shall be terminated as soon as practicable.”"!

178. Sections 14.8.2 and 14.8.3 of the Rules of Land Lease require, respectively, that termination based

on mismanagement of the leased land be (i) accompanied by an inspection report containing video
or photographic documentation and (ii) made on the recommendation of a committee appointed

by the ANR Director.” The Respondent submits it complied with both requirements.”

179. In this regard, the Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ assertion that it violated Section 14.8.3

by failing to send Pol Farm a letter with its comments from its most recent inspection.”* The
Respondent argues that Section 14.8.3 permitted, but did not require, ANR to provide lessees with
comments on an inspection if the Agency wished to allow ‘rectification of irregularities’. It
notes, in any event, that ANR determined not to permit Pol Farm additional opportunities to

correct for its non-performance under the Lease Agreement.

180. Even following ANR’s termination, the Respondent asserts that ANR remained open to revisiting

296

its decision, and considered doing so during an (ultimately unfruitful) meeting held with

Mr Kristian Almas on 16 July 2009.7° Ultimately, however, the Respondent suggests that the

Claimants failed to take measures necessary to ensure that the Lease Agreement could be

reinstated.”*”

181. In light of the foregoing, the Respondent considers ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement

to have been lawful. It therefore rejects the Claimants’ ‘far-reaching’ allegation that the
termination was driven by political reasons. With respect to the Claimants’ reliance on two
press articles quoting ANR staff, the Respondent suggests that the text reflects only the fact that
the land was in part re-leased to local farmers after a competitive tender following the termination
of the Lease Agreement, but not that the termination itself was caused by a desire to re-lease the
Farm to an entity other than Pol Farm.” Indeed, according to the Respondent and its witnesses,
a determination by ANR to terminate a lease has never come under the influence of other public

administrative authorities or other entities.°°°

182. Finally, and in any event, the Respondent draws attention to Pol Farm’s failure to contest the

termination under Section 18 of the Lease Agreement.” Section 18 contains an arbitration clause
providing that ‘any disputes that may arise during performance of this agreement will be resolved
through arbitration’, subject to a very short (two-week) deadline—in effect a form of summary
arbitration.” The Respondent notes that the Claimants had ‘invoked the very same arbitration
clause’ under Section 18 on a previous occasion, suggesting that it is ‘incomprehensible’ that

Pol Farm failed to challenge the termination under Section 18 in this instance.*”?

G. THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS ON THE MERITS: EXPROPRIATION

1. The Claimants’ Arguments

183. The Claimants submit that the termination of the Lease Agreement unlawfully expropriated the

304

Claimants’ investment.*™ In particular, they argue that the deprivation of Pol Farm’s 30-year

contractual right to operate the Farm was a de facto expropriation for the purposes of Article VI

of the BIT.*°

184. The Claimants submit that the deprivation of an investor’s contractual rights, whether direct or

indirect, may be tantamount to a deprivation in violation of the Treaty’s protections against
expropriation under international law.” Relying on Eureko B.V. v. Poland, they suggest that ‘the

deprivation of contractual rights may be expropriatory in substance and in effect.”*”

185. While the Claimants acknowledge that ‘[n]Jot every failure to perform or uphold a contract’ will

amount to an expropriation, they nevertheless consider that ANR’s termination of the Lease
Agreement suffices.** In particular, the Claimants submit that: (i) ANR acted in a sovereign
capacity when terminating the Lease; (ii) the termination was neither legitimate nor justified under
the terms of the Lease Agreement; and (iii) in any event, the termination was abusive and not in
good faith.*” With respect to the legitimacy of the termination, the Claimants attach particular
importance to what they consider ANR’s failure to afford Pol Farm the statutory notice period
under the Lease Agreement, as well as its non-response to Pol Farm’s letter concerning the

plantation of raspberries in October 2008.7!”

186. Even if ANR had a contractual right to terminate the Lease Agreement, however, the Claimants

305

306

307

submit that the termination nevertheless operates as an expropriation of their investment since, in
their view, it was carried out contrary to ANR’s duty to act in good faith.*!! Specifically, the
Claimants allege that ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement for the ‘very minor violation’
of planting raspberries on the Farm—an activity that the Claimants submit ‘had no significant
consequences’ for the land’s value—constituted an ‘abuse[]’ of ANR’s position.*!? Accordingly,
the Claimants consider an expropriation to have been established and request compensation for

all losses flowing from the Lease’s termination.

2. The Respondent’s Arguments

187. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ assertion that the termination of the Lease Agreement was

a de facto expropriation or measure tantamount to the same under Article VI of the BIT.*!3

188. First, the Respondent argues that the Claimants did not lose control over their investment, i.e.,
their shares in Pol Farm, as a result of the termination of the Lease Agreement. Citing case law
such as Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Canada and Telenor v. Hungary, the Respondent submits that the
‘decisive element in an expropriation is the substantial loss of control or economic value of an
investment’ as a result of an expropriatory measure.*"* In the present case, it considers that none
of the requirements for loss of control were met, since (i) the Claimants continued to exercise
‘effective control’ over Pol Farm and continued to own Pol Farm’s shares; and (ii) ANR ‘has not

interfered in the day-to-day management’ of Pol Farm.**

189. The Respondent dismisses the allegation that the termination of the Lease Agreement itself forced
Pol Farm into bankruptcy and liquidation, leading to the loss of the Claimants’ control over their
investment. Pol Farm was already effectively insolvent at the time of the Notice of Termination;
the Respondent observes that the court-appointed expert during bankruptcy proceedings
considered Pol Farm to have lost solvency as early as 30 September 2008.*'° The Respondent
notes that the Claimants remained in possession of the Farm on the date that bankruptcy

proceedings commenced.*!”

190. Second, the Respondent reiterates that ‘ANR did not use any sovereign powers when terminating
the agreement but acted as an ordinary contract[ual] party without invoking any sovereign

powers.’*!8

H. OTHER ARGUMENTS ON THE MERITS
1. Failure to Accord Equitable and Reasonable Treatment and Protection

191. In the Claimants’ view, ANR failed to afford Pol Farm ‘procedural fairness and due process,’
both of which the Claimants consider to be included under the Treaty’s requirement that
investments be provided with equitable and reasonable treatment and protection under Article III
of the Treaty, in its correspondence and conduct vis-a-vis the Company.*!° In particular, the
Claimants note ANR’s non-response to Pol Farm’s letter, in October 2008, considering
clarifications relating to ANR’s September 2008 inspection and informing ANR of Pol Farm’s
decision to plant raspberries on the Farm.*”°

192. The Respondent considers the Claimants’ claims with respect to equitable and reasonable
treatment and protection to be without merit. In particular, they contest the Claimants’ suggestion
that the termination of the Lease Agreement was against the good faith principle. In the
Respondent’s view, the Lease’s termination was justified and in accordance with both the terms

of the Lease Agreement itself and with Polish law.*?!

193. Rather than constituting an act of bad faith, ANR’s termination was reasonable and foreseeable
by the Claimants, who had been warned by ANR of the likely termination of the Lease, absent
action to remedy Pol Farm’s non-compliance under the agreement, in a meeting on 12 May
2009.5? Accordingly, the Respondent disagrees that the Lease’s termination breached any duties

2. Unreasonable and Discriminatory Measures

194. The Claimants argue that the Respondent has subjected them to unreasonable, inequitable, and
discriminatory treatment.*?? With regard to their claim of discrimination, the Claimants rely
principally on their submission that the ‘apparent reason for ANR’s termination [are] policy

reasons’ related to a desire to award farmland to Polish farmers at the expense of foreign lessees.***

The Respondent submits that ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement was prudent and legally

justified. It states:

By terminating the Lease Agreement ANR simply acted as any prudent business
person and this step was by no means discriminatory. It would have been entirely
unreasonable to expect ANR to sit and watch its property being devastated and its
recommendations being ignored.*?5

Accordingly, the Respondent rejects that ANR’s conduct vis-a-vis Pol Farm, including the

termination of the Lease Agreement, constituted discriminatory treatment.

3. The Umbrella Clause

The Claimants have argued that the Treaty’s MFN Clause in Article IV permits the Claimants,
absent an express prohibition in the Treaty, to avail themselves of provisions in BITs with third
States. Accordingly, the Claimants wish to exercise their right to benefit from substantive

protections under Article 3(5) of the Dutch-Poland BIT.*”° That article provides:

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it may have entered into with
regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.*?7
Under the Dutch-Poland BIT, the Claimants submit that the Respondent would be obliged to fulfil
contracts that have previously been signed with investors of the Netherlands. Pursuant to their
interpretation of the Treaty’s MFN Clause, the Claimants argue that they may avail themselves

of the umbrella clause in Article 3(5) of the Dutch-Poland BIT.

In the Claimants’ view, ANR ‘did not have the right to terminate and, as such, breached the Lease
Agreement’ by issuing its Notice of Termination on 7 July 2009.*8 Accordingly, the Claimants
submit that the termination violates the umbrella clause in Article 3(5) and, by extension,

constitutes a violation of the Respondent’s obligations under the present Treaty.*”?

Even if the Claimants were permitted to proceed against the Respondent under the umbrella clause
in the Dutch-Poland BIT, the Respondent submits that such claims would fail. It does so on three

grounds: (i) the umbrella clause covers only contractual obligations entered into by a contracting

(iii) in any event, an umbrella clause cannot be breached by a non-sovereign act of an ordinary

contracting party such as ANR.**?

VI. THE TRIBUNAL’S CONCLUSIONS

A. JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMS

201. The jurisdictional arguments of the Parties are summarised in paragraphs 88 to 131 above. In the

Tribunal’s view, not all of these objections are properly speaking jurisdictional, and (since the
proceedings have not been bifurcated) to the extent they might arguably be treated as such, they
overlap substantially with issues belonging to the merits. There is no doubt that the two individual
Claimants were themselves investors of long standing in Poland; given their status as such, they
have standing to protect the contractual rights of Pol Farm, which formed the core of their
investment. Their principal claim is that their investment was indirectly expropriated as a result
of ANR’s wrongful termination of the Lease Agreement. That claim is within the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction both ratione personae and ratione materiae.

202. Other aspects of the claims can hardly be characterised as jurisdictional. In particular, the

Respondent objects to the umbrella clause claim by arguing that individual shareholders cannot
invoke contractual rights under a contract between ANR and Pol Farm, a Polish corporation.**3
According to the Respondent, an investor can rely on an umbrella clause only if it has a direct
contractual relationship with a host State. But that rule of privity, if it exists, does not prevent the
Tribunal from having regard to the Lease Agreement, and the issue of contractual enforcement
only arises once certain other obstacles are surmounted, notably whether ANR’s termination was

attributable to Poland.

B. THE SCOPE OF THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE ON THE MERITS

204. Turning to the merits, the Tribunal begins by stressing the restricted character of the claim
presented to it. The Claimants have focussed entirely on ANR’s conduct and alleged motivation
in terminating the Lease Agreement in July 2009. That claim raises an obvious issue of attribution,
since ANR is a separate legal entity from Poland and it purported to exercise contractual powers
in terminating the Lease Agreement; moreover, the Claimants never challenged the legality of the
termination by the prompt arbitration procedure provided for in Section 18 of the Lease
Agreement. In strong contrast, two other decisions affecting the Claimants, the bankruptcy order
against Pol Farm and the criminal convictions of the two Claimants, were unquestionably taken
by organs of the Polish State and are attributable to it. But these are explicitly not the subject of

the Claimants’ BIT case.**

205. Moreover, if ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement is not attributable to Poland, this not
merely affects the expropriation claim; it fatally undermines all its claims, including the fair and
equitable treatment and umbrella clause claims, and renders irrelevant the Claimants’ argument
that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to apply certain standards by virtue of the MFN Clause in the

BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal will first consider the issue of attribution.

206. In this context, the Tribunal takes note of the Parties’ agreement that the International Law
Commission’s 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts
(the ‘ILC Articles’),**> widely regarded by investment tribunals ‘as a codification of customary
international law’ ,**° provide the legally relevant yardstick to determine whether specific acts can
be attributed to a host State for purposes of establishing the latter’s responsibility for a breach of

international law.

34 Quite apart from the fact that the criminal convictions are still under appeal, the Claimants do not characterise
them as a denial of justice or a continuation of discriminatory action taken by Poland: Hearing Tr. (Day 2),
pp. 20-21, 38-39.

Cc. ATTRIBUTION

1. ILC Article 4 — Is ANR a State Organ?

207. Under Article 4(1), the conduct of any State organ acting as such is attributable to the State. The

commentary to Article 4 explains: ‘The reference to a “State organ” covers all the individual or
collective entities which make up the organization of the State and act on its behalf.’**” Article
4(2) further clarifies that ‘An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in
accordance with the internal law of the State.” Thus ‘domestic law is the starting point’ for the
determination of the status of an entity as a State organ.*** However, internal status does not
necessarily imply that an entity is not a State organ if other factors, such as the performance of
core governmental functions, direct day-to-day subordination to central government, or lack of

all operational autonomy, point the other way.*”

208. As the Respondent notes in the Rejoinder, tribunals have determined that an entity is not a State

organ according to the terms of a State’s legal order when it has independent personality in that
order.*° For example, in Bayindir v. Pakistan, the tribunal rejected the claim that Pakistan’s
National Highway Authority was a State organ, because of its separate domestic legal
personality.“! In EDF (Services) Ltd. v. Romania, the tribunal similarly determined than an
airport holding company and a State airline, ‘both possessing legal personality under Romanian
law separate and distinct from that of the State’, were not State organs.*” Similarly, the tribunal
in Hamester v. Ghana* concluded that the Ghanaian Cocoa Board could not be considered to be

a State organ in the sense of Article 4 of the ILC Articles, mainly because it was ‘not classified a

209. ANR is not a State organ under the domestic law of Poland, and the Claimants do not argue

otherwise. It has separate legal personality and exercises operational autonomy. Under Article 3
of the 1991 Act, ANR is ‘a state legal entity’ that is ‘supervised by the minister for rural
development’.*** It is authorised under Article 5 of the 1991 Act to ‘perform on its own behalf
the rights and obligations’ related to State agricultural property.™® In light of this, ANR cannot

be considered a State organ de jure under Polish law.

210. Moreover, ANR does not meet the criteria usually applied to determine whether an entity is a

de facto State organ. The ILC’s commentary to Article 4 suggests that ‘the conduct of certain
institutions performing public functions and exercising public powers (e.g. the police) is attributed
to the State even if those institutions are regarded in internal law as autonomous and independent
of the executive government’.**” By contrast, where an entity engages on its own account in
commercial transactions, even if these are important to the national economy, this inference will
not be drawn. In Hamester, it was argued that the Ghanaian Cocoa Board was a de facto State
organ.“ The tribunal emphasised the lack of direct governmental control over the Board’s
activities and concluded that it was not an Article 4 organ.” Jan de Nul concerned the Suez Canal
Authority.*°° The tribunal concluded that, while the Authority carried out public activities, it was
not structurally part of the Egyptian State: its statute required it to be managed in accordance with

business practice and it had a private budget and funds.*>!

ILC Article 5. The tribunal did not treat SODIGA as a State organ, de jure or de facto.>* Salini
was a decision on jurisdiction in a dispute over a motorway construction contract entered into by
two Italian companies with ADM, a majority State-owned company. The tribunal held it had
jurisdiction under the relevant BIT but no jurisdiction in relation to the contractual claim against
ADM.** It went on to hold, almost as obiter, that ADM was a de facto organ of Morocco on the
basis of effective control and because it was perceived (and apparently treated by the Moroccan
State) as performing public functions in the field of infrastructure.* The relevance of this early
decision is limited by its reliance on indeterminate categories of reference (‘State company’) and

above all by its denial of contractual jurisdiction over ADM.

212. In support of the position that ANR is a de facto organ, the Claimants argue that it exercises

‘executive functions of the state’ because it has the power to manage, sell and lease State
agricultural property.** But the power to lease agricultural land is not an executive government
function. An agricultural lease is a commercial transaction, even if entered into with a State entity

and even if it involves State-owned land.

213. In the present case, ANR shares features with the entities under consideration in Hamester and

Jan de Nul. While ANR is supervised by the Minister for Rural Development,*** Poland’s control
over ANR’s Board is limited to the appointment and removal of its president and vice-president.**”
Poland may direct ANR through regulations.*** The Council of Ministers additionally must
approve sales of shares held by ANR of stock in companies of strategic importance to agriculture,
a limited category of holdings.**° These facts suggest that overall, like the Cocoa Board in
Hamester, ANR enjoys a level of autonomy not consistent with its being considered a de facto

organ. This is confirmed by the financial factors which were considered as relevant in Jan de Nul.

In accordance with Articles 20(b)(1)(e) and 55 of the 1991 Act, ANR has its own bank account.

It holds property in its own name.**! In other words, it has financial autonomy similar to that
enjoyed by the Suez Canal Authority. In light of its autonomous management and financial status,

ANR is not a de facto organ of the Polish State.

2. ILC Article 5 — Was the Termination of the Lease performed in the Exercise of
Governmental Functions?

214. Under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the conduct of a separate entity (not a State organ) is

nonetheless attributable to the State when the entity exercises governmental authority in

performing that conduct.* Article 5 provides:

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4
but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of
governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international
law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular
instance>

215. As the tribunal explained in Jan de Nul v. Egypt, Article 5 has two elements:

- First, the act must be carried out by an entity empowered to exercise governmental
authority;

- Second, the act itself must involve the exercise of that governmental authority.**

216. This approach was confirmed by the tribunal in Hamester v. Ghana,*® which held that the

Ghanaian Cocoa Board, given its broad range of statutory tasks, was ‘an entity exercising
elements of governmental authority, as described in Article 5 of the ILC Articles.’*° For purposes
of attribution under Article 5, the Hamester tribunal correctly insisted that it had to be shown ‘that

the precise act in question was an exercise of such governmental authority.”*”

were ‘the undertaking of studies for the introduction of new industries into Galicia, seeking and
soliciting such new industries, investing in new enterprises, processing loan applications with
official sources of financing, providing guarantees for such loans, and providing technical
assistance.’** The entity further ‘was charged with providing subsidies and offering other
inducements for the development of industries.’* The tribunal concluded that many of these acts
could not be performed by private actors and thus were government functions for the purposes of

attribution under international law.*”°

218. In the present case, the powers of ANR fall into three broad categories. Under Article 5(1)-(3) of
the 1991 Act, ANR is entrusted with the State Treasury’s agricultural property and is entitled to
‘perform on its own behalf the rights and obligations’ related to it.” Under Article 6 of the 1991

Act, ANR shall also ‘perform tasks arising from state policy’, specifically in terms of:

creating and improving the area structure of family farms;

2

creating conditions facilitating the rational use of the production potential of
the Resources of the Agricultural Property of State Treasury;

3

restructuring and privatisation of the property of State Treasury used for
agricultural purposes;

4

trading in real estate and other assets of State Treasury used for agricultural
purposes;

5

managing the material resources of State Treasury intended for agricultural
purposes;

6

securing the property of State Treasury;

7

initiating development and agricultural works on the land belonging to State
Treasury and supporting the organisation of private agricultural farms on
such land.*”*

These tasks may be supplemented by regulation.*”* Finally, under the 2003 Act on the Shaping of

Stock.7”*

219. The Respondent argues that ANR was exercising contractual, not governmental authority in

terminating the Lease.*”* It is true that it entered into the relevant contract in the exercise of
statutory powers to manage State agricultural property. But the key point is that vis-a-vis the
Claimants, termination was not an exercise of public power but of a purported contractual right.
The management of real property, including the exercise of the contractual right to terminate a
lease, derives from the general law; it is a capacity of any entity that holds and rents out land.
Because ANR was not exercising whatever Polish government authority it may have had when it

terminated the Lease, its action is not attributable to the Polish State on the basis of Article 5.

220. The Claimants seek to counteract this prima facie compelling argument in essentially two ways.

First, they argue that the termination was not authorised by the Lease Agreement, or alternatively
that ANR is precluded from relying retrospectively on grounds not expressly referred to in the
Notice of Termination. Secondly, they argue that even if termination was purportedly an act done
in the exercise of contractual powers, the underlying policy motivation—redistribution of State
land to small Polish farmers—effectively converted the act to one in the exercise of State authority

covered by Article 5. These arguments will be addressed in turn.

(a) Was termination authorised under the Lease Agreement?

221. The Parties argued at length their positions on the legality of the termination of the Lease

Agreement. These arguments have been summarised in paragraphs 132 to 182 above. Although,
for reasons to be explained, it does not need to reach definitive conclusions on these issues, the

Tribunal would make the following observations.

i. Was ANR limited to the grounds cited in the Notice of Termination?

opinion the Claimants’ lawyer expressed the view that the 12 August 2009 letter from ANR

letter had effect.** Reference was made to Article 60 of the Civil Code, which provides:

of that person which manifests his intention sufficiently.**

Later, however, the Claimants’ expert asserts that the grounds given in the letter of 7 July 2009
constitute ‘integral elements’ of the declaration of intent.**° The Claimants’ expert additionally
suggests that reliance on alternative grounds for termination should be disallowed as inconsistent
with Article 58, Section 2 of the Civil Code, which provides that ‘[a] legal act contrary to the
principles of community life is invalid.’**° It is not explained how reliance on other subsisting

decide the point (which, for reasons that will appear, it is not), the Tribunal is inclined to the view
that Polish law did not prohibit reliance on other available grounds for termination, especially

since the Claimants had asked for clarification of the decision.

ii. The available grounds for termination

224. The Lease allows three reasons for immediate termination: misuse of the object, a two-period

arrears in rent payments, and failure to pay certain public dues related to the land (Lease

Agreement Sections 5, 14.1, and 17, respectively).

a. Misuse of the object

225. The primary ground for termination relied on by the Respondent is the misuse of the object of the

Lease. Section 17 of the Lease makes a violation of Section 5 of the Lease grounds for immediate

termination.**’ Section 5(1) reads:

The Lessee commits themselves to use and manage the rented property properly in
order to conduct their business activity there. At the same time they cannot change
the required use of the property.
The Respondent specifically raises the following points as evidence of mismanagement or misuse

of the object.

226. Klepezewo Buildings: In its Statement of Defence, the Respondent challenges Pol Farm’s failure

to reconstruct certain buildings in Klepezewo.** In their Reply, the Claimants acknowledge that
they did not reconstruct the buildings, and allege this is because they had not received the
insurance payment for the buildings from ANR in advance of reconstruction.” The Respondent
replies that its policy is to forward such insurance payments to lessees after reconstruction has
occurred in order to ensure that reconstruction actually takes place.*”? The only evidence in this
regard is the Witness Statement of the Deputy Director of ANR’s Koszalin branch, Mr Marek

Gil”! which confirms this (ex facie not unreasonable) policy.

11 December 2008 reports that no demolition works had yet been performed.*”? ANR’s inspection
memorandum of 8 May 2009 reports that the buildings had finally been demolished, but that

heaps of debris remained.‘

This evidence indicates that the heifer buildings were selected for demolition in late 2005. Even
if the agreements to demolish them were not binding, Pol Farm was made aware of ANR’s
concerns with the buildings by the agreements, and ANR reminded Pol Farm in its letters of
18 February 2008 and 7 October 2008. Concerns had previously been expressed within ANR, by
ANR to Pol Farm, and by the Swidwin Gmina to ANR“! that the Berkanowo buildings posed a
safety threat that required proper remediation. Upon their demolition, they appear to have been

left as rubble piles in a way inconsistent with the expectations ANR communicated to Pol Farm.

This points to a failure to manage the Berkanowo buildings, in breach of Section 5 of the Lease

Agreement.

230. Other Building Maintenance: In its Statement of Defence, the Respondent alleges Pol Farm’s

general failure to maintain buildings as a grounds for termination.*” In their Reply, the Claimants
argue that these buildings were repaired as is reflected in the specification of building works in
Exhibit R-13.4°? Additionally, the Claimants challenge the Respondent’s reliance on a
15 February 2010 expert report on the condition of the Farm“ because of the delay in its

405

preparation."” In its Rejoinder, the Respondent claims that this report reflects an inspection of the

Farm in December 2009, two-and-a-half months after its transfer to ANR.*°°

231. In the November 2007 inspection, the inspector reported that ‘[t]he property is maintained in an

average condition””” but stressed that, nevertheless, ‘the leaseholder must regularly renovate the
existing buildings. The deadline is now.”*°* This demand is repeated in the 15 February 2008 letter
from ANR to Pol Farm.*” In a 19 September 2008 report to ANR, Pol Farm identifies works that
have been done to five sites in Krosino, Klepezewo, and Stowiensko."!° The report from the
September 2008 inspection calls on Pol Farm to review the condition of its buildings and to
consider demolition of some of them.*!' But the only two documents which list particular
buildings as requiring repairs are the May 2009 inspection report*”? and the report of the post-

of Pol Farm to cultivate 200 hectares of land,*!* describing this as ‘letting land lie fallow’.*"° In
their Reply, the Claimants dispute this on two grounds.*” First, they challenge the categorisation,
describing the land as meadow (/gki) rather than fallow (ugor). Second, they argue that ANR had
given Pol Farm a deadline of 31 December 2010 to cultivate the land properly.*!* Because this
deadline had not been reached, the Claimants argue, any failure to cultivate this land could not
have been a breach of the contract justifying termination. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent adopts
the meadow characterisation and argues that the evidence shows the Claimants were allowing the
land to turn into wetlands.*!? On the issue of timing, the Respondent argues that, as it became
clear that the Claimants would not meet the deadline, it became necessary to terminate on these

grounds to protect the Farm.*”°

233. Asa preliminary matter, the relevant land categorisation seems to be ‘meadows’. This is the term

(/gki) used in the Polish version of the November 2011 inspection report submitted by the
Respondent.*! In the 2007 Report,*”? ANR notes that 200 hectares of meadow have been set aside
and must be ‘restored to use’ progressively—100 hectares by 2010 and the remainder by 2015.
Point II.1.2 clarifies that these 200 hectares ‘include reed plants, wetlands and bogs.’ The
Respondent additionally relies on the witness statements of Mr Marek Gil’? and Mr Tomasz
Wronski*™ to substantiate this point. The Claimants argue in their Reply that the purpose of the
land was ‘as pasture or for growing hay’. The slow regression of the land from meadow to wetland

seems inconsistent with this use.

234. However, the establishment of deadlines by ANR could raise an expectation by Pol Farm that it

had until the deadline to comply with a request. This is confirmed by the practice of ANR, in
some instances, to require immediate compliance.*?° As the deadline for compliance on the
restoration of the meadows had yet to pass, it is difficult to conclude that ANR was justified in

relying on this ground for termination of the Lease.

235. Plantation of Raspberries: In its Statement of Defence, the Respondent claims that Pol Farm

changed the purpose of the Lease by cultivating raspberries on 50 hectares of ‘arable land’.*”° In
their Reply, the Claimants argue both that ANR acquiesced in the planting of raspberries and that
this was consistent with the required use of the land. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent reiterates

its position.*”

236. On balance the evidence supports the conclusion that the use of the land for the plantation of

421

42

423.

424

425

426

427

raspberries was not anticipated at the time of the conclusion of the Lease. The Lease does not list
as part of the object any orchard land for the growing of fruit. The land register is consistent with

this. Additionally, Pol Farm was not organised for the purpose of growing fruit or berries. But

despite the extensive pleading on this point, the Tribunal regards it as of only minor significance,

affecting as it did only 50 hectares of the Farm.

b. Overdue payment of rent

237. Section 17 of the Lease reads:

The Lessor can terminate the Agreement without statutory notice if the Lessee lags
behind with rent for a minimum of two terms of payment.’

238. The Claimants see the condition of two terms of payment as a monetary value, with the

consequence that Pol Farm would have had to have been in arrears for two full rent payments to
meet the condition of Section 17. The Respondent does not contest this. Its illustrative
exhibit" indicates that at the time of termination, Pol Farm had failed to pay rent in full for two
terms but that it was less than two full rent payments in arrears. The Claimants do not challenge

the accuracy of this exhibit but rather rely on it.*?

c. Payment of public dues

239. The Respondent also relies on the failure to pay public dues to justify the termination of the

Lease.**} Section 14.1 of the Lease provides that Pol Farm must:

bear all the regulatory liabilities connected with the rented property for which,
according to legal provisions, either owner or the possessor is liable. In this case,
these include real estate tax, agricultural tax and other liabilities resulting from
possessing the property including obligatory insurance.*™

Section 17 of the Lease makes a violation of Section 14(1) grounds for termination.‘

240. The Respondent focuses primarily on real estate taxes owed to the Swidwin and Stawoborze

428

Gminas and on unpaid social security contributions amounting to approximate total arrears of

1.3 million PLN. The Claimants respond that Pol Farm was in compliance with relevant payments

Respondent concedes this in its Rejoinder,“** while noting that it was unaware of the

postponement at the time of the termination.”

t“° showing Pol

Farm’s arrears to the Social Security Institution.““! The Claimants do not challenge the fact that
it was seriously in debt at the time of the termination, but claims the debt was not ‘connected with

the property’ in the sense of Section 14.1.4?

243. During oral argument, the Claimants disputed the relevance of social security payments to the

legality of the termination of the Lease Agreement.** For its part, the Respondent observed that
the Claimants’ failure in this regard was relevant in showing Pol Farm’s pattern of conduct

vis-a-vis its creditors, and also the absence of a credible recovery plan for the Company.“**

244. If the Tribunal had to decide the question, it would tend to favour the Claimants’ argument that

442

social security arrears were not connected to the property for the purposes of Section 14(1). This
lists real estate tax, agricultural tax and mandatory insurance charges as illustrations of liabilities
covered, suggesting that the charge must be directly connected to the land in order to fall within
the scope of Section 14(1). On the other hand, the failure to meet its social security obligations,
very substantial in monetary terms, confirmed the legitimacy of ANR’s concerns as to the

financial viability of Pol Farm.

Award, 27 June 2016

d. The Tribunal’s provisional conclusions on available grounds of
termination

245. So far, the Tribunal would reach the following provisional conclusions:

(dd) Pol Farm was at the date of termination, and despite various concessions by ANR had
long been, in arrears with its rental payments. However, it apparently took care to ensure
that the arrears never exceeded two clear rental periods (totalling a year, i.e., six months

each), so this ground for immediate termination was not available.

(2) Ina letter dated 20 May 2009 Pol Farm offered a schedule of rental payments to reduce
if not remove the arrears, which ANR accepted; but the Company did not attempt to

comply with the schedule.“°

(3) Pol Farm was persistently in default on substantial payments associated with the

running of the farm, including salaries and social security fund payments.

(4) There were continuing difficulties about the condition and repair of farm buildings.
Through its farm manager, Pol Farm agreed to demolish certain buildings in danger of
collapse, but failed to do so. Penalty payments due under these agreements were

disputed and were not paid.

246. The Tribunal heard evidence from the then regional director of ANR, Mr Marek Gil, who made

446

447

the termination decision. According to Mr Gil, successive ANR inspections revealed the state of

2447

the Farm to be in ‘deplorable’*”’ condition, causing ANR to intervene with Pol Farm on numerous

occasions prior to making the determination to terminate the Lease. His testimony states that ANR
issued its Notice of Termination reluctantly and in accordance with legal requirements. The
Tribunal regards Mr Gil’s evidence as reliable, and no less so because he seems subsequently to

have come into conflict with ANR on unrelated issues.

There is conflicting evidence on whether ANR accepted the repayment offer. In its response dated 21 May
2009, ANR stated: ‘As the request to postpone payment deadlines has been filed after the respective maturity
dates, it cannot be approved as antici, by yours s. We are exp i i p of the debt
on account of all outstanding legal titles. Furthermore, we accept the debt service timetable submitted by the
company as effectively binding.’ Letter dated 21 May 2009 from ANR to Pol Farm (Exhibit C-61). The
Claimants consider the offer to have been rejected by ANR. On cross-examination, for instance, Mr Geir Almas
stated that ANR ‘didn’t accept our proposal’ by demanding immediate repayment of the debt. Hearing Tr.
(Day 2), pp. 106-107. Mr Kristian Almas noted that an agreement was ‘proposed that was never realised.”
Hearing Tr. (Day 2), pp. 142-143. It appears that Pol Farm made one partial payment—namely PLN 50,000—
but that it abandoned its proposed schedule shortly thereafter, without notifying ANR. Hearing Tr. (Day 1),
pp. 108-112.

Hearing Tr. (Day 3), p. 16.

14

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

247. Overall, the Tribunal concludes that the relevant ANR officers had genuine concerns as to the

conduct of Pol Farm’s operations, as to its solvency and as to its compliance with its agreements

and with Polish legal requirements.

248. Mr Gil readily accepted that local Polish farmers were seeking more land, but he denied that this

was the motivation for termination of the Lease Agreement.“ In support of this conclusion is the
fact that local government agencies gave Pol Farm support on several occasions, including the
letter of support from the local mayor and various extensions of time to pay.““? There is no
evidence of official discrimination against or obstruction to Pol Farm either at a local or central

level.

249. Jurisdiction over disputes concerning the Lease Agreement was vested by agreement in a local

arbitral tribunal under Section 18. There was some uncertainty before the Tribunal as to the
correct interpretation of Section 18, but the Parties eventually agreed on the following text,

submitted by the Respondent:

1. The parties agree that any disputes that may arise during performance of this
agreement will be resolved through arbitration.

2. In the event of a dispute, the parties will appoint one arbitrator each, who will
then choose an umpire from outside their circle as presiding arbitrator of the
arbitration panel.

3. The arbitration court is obliged to adjudicate a case within two weeks of the
day the statement of claim is filed by any party. A hearing will take place
irrespective of whether the parties appear.

4, The parties will set the arbitrators’ remuneration on each occasion.

5. Any matters not regulated above will be governed by the Code of Civil
Procedure provisions on arbitration courts.”

250. In fact, Pol Farm did not resort to arbitration under Section 18. In evidence, Mr Geir Almas said

that there was no time to do so;**! whereas his counsel argued that a 2-week schedule as provided

in Article 18 was unrealistic.” But Section 18 was mutually agreed, was applicable in terms to

Award, 27 June 2016

the dispute over termination, and in fact much more than two weeks elapsed between ANR’s

Notice of Termination and Pol Farm’s actual departure.

251. Especially in the light of Section 18, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to reach a definitive

conclusion as to the lawfulness of ANR’s termination of the Lease Agreement under Polish law,
even if it has jurisdiction to do so. All it needs to decide is that the termination was in purported
exercise of contractual powers, and it does so decide. That being so, the termination of the Lease

Agreement was not attributable to Poland under ILC Article 5.

(b) Was the termination of the Lease Agreement an exercise of unlawful policy?

252. The Claimants seek to avoid this conclusion by relying on the decision in Vigotop Limited v.

Hungary.

Vigotop addresses the question whether a measure that is not on its face an exercise
of puissance publique can nevertheless amount to an expropriation. The claimant there argued
that the Hungarian State expropriated its investment by the exercise of a termination provision in
a contract between its subsidiary and the Hungarian State.** The tribunal considered that ‘the fact
that Respondent purported to exercise a contractual right’ to terminate ‘does not exclude per se
the possibility that this conduct ... amounted to an expropriation.’*° It held that in order to
determine whether an expropriation had occurred, it was first necessary to determine whether the

termination was conducted with a ‘hidden political agenda, which was the true reason for its

 

termination’ and thus that the decision was taken in a sovereign capacity.*° If public policy
reasons for terminating the contract are found, a tribunal would then have to consider whether
contractual grounds to terminate existed and whether a termination consistent with those grounds

was consistent with the obligation of good faith.”

253. A short answer to the argument based on Vigotop Limited v. Hungary would be that it concerned

453,

454

455

456

457

termination of a contract with the State itself whereas in the present case the Lease Agreement
was with a separate entity with its own contractual capacity and whose conduct in terminating the

Agreement was not attributable to the Respondent under the law of State responsibility. The

76

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

Tribunal will, however, with the aim of being fully responsive to the arguments made before it,

consider whether the three conditions articulated by the Vigotop tribunal are satisfied here.

254. In applying its test, the Vigotop tribunal first considered whether Hungary had public policy

reasons for terminating the contract, a so-called ‘hidden agenda’.*** The tribunal identified three
potential policy reasons why Hungary’s government may have opposed the project:
anti-corruption concerns, concerns over the validity of a land-swap agreement concluded by the
previous interim government, and a new environmental and tourism policy.**” The tribunal
considered only anti-corruption, environmental, and tourism concerns to be ‘true public policy

reasons’ and considered each in turn.4°

255. First, as to the anti-corruption concerns, the tribunal considered political statements from a recent

general election campaign that this project in particular was one targeted for a corruption
investigation. These statements were evidence that this became an important reason to oppose the
project upon installation of the new Hungarian government.**! Additionally, the tribunal
considered evidence of the involvement of the government anti-corruption commissioner in the
decision to terminate the contract. This evidence led the tribunal to conclude that
anti-corruption was a policy concern for the government, one that may have, but was not proven
to have, motivated the decision to terminate, ‘and if so, would . . . constitute a public policy reason

for the contractual termination’.

256. Concerning environmental and touristic policy, the tribunal considered it established that Hungary

458

459

460

461

402

463

464

465

466

had a policy reason to prevent the implementation of the project.4 The tribunal relied primarily
on two witness statements, from a Minister and State Secretary,“ to the effect that the
government had revoked the special project status granted to the project in question ‘based in
part’ on the project’s inconsistency with environmental and ecotourism goals.“ Consequently,

the tribunal concluded that the claimant had ‘submitted conclusive evidence’ that environmental

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

and touristic concerns motivated that government’s desire to end the project, and that such

evidence was ‘sufficient to conclude that Respondent acted in its sovereign capacity’ .*”

257. Vigotop suggests two conditions that must be met in order for a policy motive to exist. The first

is that the motive must be a public policy motive rather than a contractual one. The second,
revealed particularly by the tribunal’s distinct conclusions regarding corruption policy versus
environmental and touristic policy, is that the policy motive must be shown to have decisively
influenced the State in terminating the contract. In fact, the Vigotop tribunal expressly held that
‘[iJf the Tribunal were ultimately to conclude that it was indeed legitimate for Respondent to
invoke its contractual grounds for terminating the Concession Contract, this would exclude a
finding of an expropriation, despite the parallel existence of public policy reasons.“ In the end
the tribunal concluded that the claimant had failed to prove that the ‘Respondent exercised its
contractual termination right contrary to good faith or abused such right in order to avoid its

liability to compensate under the Treaty.”

258. In the Statement of Claim in the present arbitration, the Claimants raise two possible policy

motives for the termination: a desire to distribute land to Polish farmers and a desire to sell State

470

assets,*”” although in their Reply as well as in oral argument the emphasis was largely on the first

of these.*”! The Respondent argues that the evidence only supports the conclusion that the land

472

was distributed to local farmers after the termination,*” and that there was no evidence of an

improper motive of terminating the contract in order to benefit third parties.

259. In support of its conclusion that land redistribution motivated the termination, the Claimants offer

467

468

469

470

41

an

473

four exhibits. First is an interview with ANR Szczecin Director Adam Poniewski,*”? which the
Claimants describe as being from a 19 August 2010 article in the Kurier Olsztynski newspaper.

In the interview, Director Poniewski says:

In those regions, where there is huge demand for land on the part of the farmers, we
do not renew lease agreements. This year alone I have decided not to renew lease
agreements for 2 500 hectares of land. Last year we terminated a lease agreement for

4 200 hectares with a Norwegian equity company. We let it to farmers who took part

in a close tender.‘
Second is an article in the Norwegian business newspaper Dagens Neringsliv on 9 April 2011,
which reports an email from an ANR spokesperson stating that a general goal is to sell as much
land as possible to Polish farmers.’ The third is the State Audit report for ANR Szczecin
covering the years from 2011 to 2013,*” although given its date it is not clear how the Claimants
rely on it in this regard. Fourth is a much later (October 2015) article from Kurier Szczecinski,*”
which reports the suspension of Mr Marek Gil, on grounds which the Claimants allege were

related to a corruption scandal.4”*

260. Together this evidence does not come close to showing that the decision to terminate the Lease

Agreement was made for extraneous reasons unrelated to the conduct of the Lease. The Dagens

479

Neringsliv article*”” establishes that ANR had a goal to sell as much land as possible to Polish

farmers. The Kurier Olsztynski article?

suggests (not entirely accurately) that this was indeed
done to the property that had been Pol Farm’s leasehold.**! Missing, however, is evidence, still
less convincing evidence, of a decision against Pol Farm motivated by such policy concerns.
Instead, as has been demonstrated, the record of ANR’s internal discussions leading up to the

termination“?

reflects real concerns regarding Pol Farm’s financial health, at protecting ANR’s
rights in anticipation of bankruptcy, and regarding the proper management of the land. There is
nothing illegitimate in a subsequent decision to sell land to local farmers if the decision to

terminate an existing lease is made for reasons other than redistribution of the land.

Article dated 19 August 2010 in Kurier Olsztyriski (Exhibit C-23). The area of Pol Farm was slightly over

4200 hectares (See Lease Agreement dated 14 February 1997 (Exhibit C-3)). The supports the inference that

Apparently some but by no means all of Pol Farm’s land was acquired by local farmers: Marek Gil noted that
‘still the majority of the land was not sold or leased,’ Hearing Tr. (Day 3), p. 110, and that the ‘potential interest
of local farmers, in a way, didn’t prove in actual tendering procedures’, necessitating an open tender in which
‘all citizens of Poland could bid’. Hearing Tr. (Day 3), p. 109.

261. The Claimants also suggest the desire to liquidate State assets was a policy motive behind the

termination.*** But this is not a public policy motive. Any landowner can seek to restructure its
assets by selling land previously leased. The fact that ANR sells land to the State Treasury’s
benefit does not change this: in relation to State land it would inevitably do so. The Tribunal finds
that any desire to liquidate the land was not an extraneous policy motive for the termination of

the Lease Agreement, but an aspect of general land management.

262. The second step of the Vigotop test requires the determination of whether valid contractual

grounds exist for the termination.“ In the Tribunal’s view, ANR had valid grounds for concern
based on Pol Farm’s financial failings, and its mismanagement and misuse of the object of the
lease (see paragraphs 245 to 247). For the reasons already explained, the Claimants’ failure to
utilise Section 18, the dispute resolution provision in the Lease Agreement, means that the
Tribunal does not have to decide for itself whether the termination was in breach of Polish law.
Even if it was in breach, it was not an exercise of public power and was not attributable to Poland

as a State.

263. Ifthe Respondent had both policy and contractual grounds to terminate, the Vigotop test concludes

486

with an inquiry into whether termination rights were exercised in good faith, which that tribunal
determined was a requirement of both the Hungarian law governing the contract and of
international law.*** According to Vigotop, the termination of a contract only amounts to an
expropriation if the contract was terminated in bad faith.**° In Polish law, the principle of good
faith is recognised in Civil Code Article 7, which provides that good faith is presumed.**’ In
assessing whether the termination rights were exercised in good faith, the Vigotop tribunal
focused on whether the investor’s legitimate expectations were frustrated.*** Because, the tribunal
held, none of Hungary’s actions, despite their policy motives, violated the contract or frustrated
the investor’s legitimately held expectations, the termination was held to have been carried out in

good faith.4*°

264. In the present case, neither Party made detailed arguments directly speaking to the issue of good

faith, if one sets aside (as the Tribunal has done) the allegation that the dominant motive for
termination was the redistribution of the land. However, the Claimants argue that ANR violated
its internal rules in two respects, and that this was evidence of bad faith.*”° First, the Claimants
argue that the termination was not recommended by a committee.*”! Rule 14.8.3, chapeau,
provides: ‘The director of a field branch makes the decision to terminate the Lease agreement

upon such request from a committee which is appointed by the director to investigate a given case

2492 43

of Lease.”*”* The Respondent argues that this is exactly what happene: It relies on the internal
ANR Memorandum detailing discussions of the Pol Farm case from May 2009 onward. The
ANR Memorandum reflects that the decision to terminate was taken after a meeting, which seems
sufficient to satisfy this requirement. Thus, it cannot be concluded that Rule 14.8.3, chapeau, was

breached.

265. The Claimants’ second argument is that ANR failed to send a letter notifying them of any failure

to correct irregularities.”° Rule 14.8.3, term 3, provides that:

[a] request for termination of the agreement may be formulated based on the
following in particular: . . . 3) the Agency permitted rectification of irregularities,
but the tenant has failed to implement its post-inspection recommendations. The
Agency will send a letter . . . containing comments from the latest inspection of the
leased property, within 14 days of the date of a visit."

The Claimants argue that ANR violated this rule by delaying its notification of various reports.*°”

They claim to have received the 23 November 2007 report*** only in January 2008.” ANR’s
correspondence that the Parties have submitted in apparent response to that report is actually dated

15 February 2008 and is unreadable in its English copy.*” The Claimants note that ANR’s letter

of 7 October 2008 claims to follow an inspection on 19 September 2008.°"! The Claimants make
no mention of the ANR inspection report of 8 May 2009.°°? The Respondent replies that the term
‘may’ makes this rule permissive and that, in any event, ANR legitimately decided not to offer
Pol Farm a further chance to rectify irregularities present in 2009*” before deciding to terminate

the Lease.*™

266. On the one hand, the Claimants are correct that reports sent to Pol Farm were sent more than

°° was sent

14 days after inspections. On the other hand, the most recent report sent to Pol Farm’
in October 2008, nine months before the Notice of Termination, which makes the delay in
reporting seem de minimis by comparison. Procedural slips are not to be equated with bad faith.
Throughout there was substantial contact between ANR and Pol Farm’s managers, who could not
have been, and were not, unaware of ANR’s concerns. Mr Geir Almas gave evidence that he was
surprised while on holiday to learn of the termination decision; that may be so, but it does not

evidence bad faith on the part of ANR.

267. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that none of the Vigorop criteria for treating a contractual

termination as an indirect expropriation attributable to the State are met here. That being so, it is
unnecessary to consider whether the Vigotop criteria were adequately articulated in relation to

contracts with separate State entities such as ANR.

 

3. ILC A le 8 — Was the Termination of the Lease performed on the Instructions of

might have been attributable to Poland under Article 8 of the ILC Articles. Under Article 8, the
acts of an entity ‘acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in
carrying out the conduct’ are attributable to the State. According to the commentary to Article 8,
‘the instructions, direction or control must relate to the conduct which is said to have amounted

to an internationally wrongful act.’*”” In order to satisfy this test, State instructions must have

been given ‘in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally

in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the

violation.”**°*

269. The tribunal in Jan de Nul v. Egypt emphasised that ‘[i]nternational jurisprudence is very
demanding in order to attribute the act of a person or entity to a State, as it requires both a general
control of the State over the person or entity and a specific control of the State over the act the
attribution of which is at stake; this is known as the “effective control” test.’*'° In a similar way,
the tribunal in White Industries v. India*"! held with regard to Article 8 that ‘for the allegedly
wrongful conduct of Coal India to give rise to the responsibility of India, White has to show that
India had both general control over Coal India as well as specific control over the particular acts
in question.’>!

270. There is no evidence in the present case of any instruction on the part of the Polish government
or of any other Polish State organ. The only State organ to comment in the period leading to the
termination was the Swidwin Gmina, the local governing body, whose head wrote to ANR in

513

May 2008 supporting Pol Farm’s continued presence.!’ Its support was also manifested in the

Gmina’s acquiescence to late payment of taxes in May 2009.°"4

271. The former director of ANR’s Regional Office denied in evidence that he had been instructed by

anyone in authority to terminate the Lease:

: Mr Gil, did anyone, whether in Sczeczin or Warsaw, who was in authority over
yone, ' ry
you, tell you to terminate the lease agreement?

A: No. Never such an order was issued to me.

Q: Did anyone in authority over you, whether in Sczeczcin or Warsaw, tell you to
redistribute land to Polish farmers?

A: I understand that the lands that were at the free disposal of agency, not those
under the lease agreements, at a certain point in time there was a procedure of
allocating freely available land to be sold in tendering -- limited tendering
procedures, closed tendering procedures. But as for any kind of instruction of
non-renewing agreements or terminating agreements in order to announce
tenders for the farmers, there was no such instruction made.*"*

 

272. To conclude, in the present case there is no evidence that ANR acted under Poland’s instructions,

direction or control when terminating the Lease, and correspondingly no basis for attribution

under Article 8.

D. OTHER ISSUES

273. Inthe light of this conclusion, the Tribunal has no need to consider the various other issues argued

before it. Unless ANR’s conduct complained of was attributable to Poland, there can have been
no breach of the BIT, whether with respect to fair and equitable treatment or (by incorporation

through the MEN Clause) under an umbrella clause.*!

274. But the Tribunal would add that the negative conclusion it has reached on attribution is consistent

with a line of arbitral awards distinguishing between contractual acts and sovereign acts when
considering the breach of contractual obligations owed to an investor.*'” In Siemens v. Argentina,
the tribunal, reviewing prior awards, distinguished between ‘being disappointed in the
performance of the State in the execution of a contract’ on the one hand and ‘outright interference
with contract execution through governmental action’ on the other hand.*'* The Siemens tribunal
went on to hold that Argentina exercised puissance publique to interfere with the contract by,
first, using a decree to terminate the contract,*!° exercising a State right to alter the terms of the
contract,°”° State interference in the performance of the contract,”! and a reliance on extra-

contractual justifications for failure to pay compensation promised in the decree.*” The tribunal

Hearing Tr. (Day 3), pp. 127-128.

It is therefore unnecessary to consider whether (which the Respondent denies) controlling shareholders can
invoke an umbrella clause by reference to a contract of the company to which they are not parties. See paragraph
114,

contrasted these with delays and procedures that ‘could be construed as the acts of a contractual

9923

party.
275. In Waste Management v. Mexico, the tribunal similarly considered that:

[t]he mere non-performance of a contractual obligation is not to be equated with a
taking of property, nor (unless accompanied by other elements) is it tantamount to
expropriation. Any private party can fail to perform its contracts, whereas
nationalisation and expropriation are inherently governmental acts.***4

The tribunal concluded that the acts challenged did not amount to an expropriatory taking of

contractual rights, contrasting the situation from a ‘final refusal to pay (combined with effective

obstruction and denial of legal remedies)’ “7

276. In Parkerings v. Lithuania, the tribunal considered similarly that ‘a breach of an agreement will
amount to an expropriation only if the State acted not only in its capacity of party to the agreement,
but also in its capacity of sovereign authority, that is to say using its sovereign power. The breach
should be the result of this action’.**° Because the respondent acted there only as a contracting
party would have done, the tribunal considered that the condition was not met and that no

expropriation had occurred.*””

277. Bayindir v. Pakistan is again similar. There, the tribunal determined that the expulsion of the
investor from the project site did not constitute an expropriation because the acts in question were
not shown to be ‘sovereign acts’.*** Instead the tribunal considered that ‘Pakistan can reasonably
justify the expulsion by Bayindir’s poor performance . . . with the consequence that the expulsion

9529

must be seen in the framework of the contractual relationship.

278. Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania** turned this analysis to a case concerning the termination of a

contract. The claimant asserted that Tanzania expropriated its investment by the repudiation of a
lease contract**! between its subsidiary and the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewage Authority.**?
Additionally, the claimant argued that political means chosen to implement the repudiation
amounted to expropriation.*** Ultimately, the tribunal did not find an expropriation based on the

termination as it concluded that the termination was done solely on contractual grounds.*4

279. The tribunal in Biwater Gauff began its analysis by noting the agreement of the parties that the

breach or termination of a contract does not per se constitute an expropriation.** Instead, the
tribunal said that ‘the critical distinction is between situations in which a State acts merely as a
contractual partner, and cases in which it acts “iure imperii”, exercising elements of its
government authority.’ In doing so, the tribunal relied on the holdings in Jmpregilo v.
Pakistan**’ and Joy Mining v. Egypt,** in both of which tribunals made the distinction between
acts of public entities as contractual counterparties and sovereign acts of the respondent State.”
The Biwater Gauff tribunal stressed that even when Tanzania acted as a shareholder of the
Authority, if its acts were ‘in the same manner as a private shareholder might have done’, they
did not involve the exercise of puissance publique. Only ‘acts which exceed the normal course
of conduct of a State shareholder’ could, in the tribunal’s view, be characterised as acts of
puissance publique."' The termination of the contract did not amount to expropriation because it

was done by the Authority rather than Tanzania, in the ‘ordinary behaviour of a contractual

counterparty’.**? ‘In other words, this was not the exercise of puissance publique’ >“ In support
of this conclusion, the tribunal cited the claimant’s record of alleged contractual failures,™* listing
the poor preparation of the claimant’s contractual bid, failure to take advantage of an available
programme to recalibrate base figures, failure to generate expected income, and a failed
renegotiation of the contract.** In light of these, the tribunal concluded that, at the moment of
contractual termination, ‘the normal contractual termination process was underway.’™“° The
question of the validity of the Authority’s action was a contractual question subject in that case
to a separate contractual dispute resolution mechanism.**” However, the tribunal did conclude that
political acts subsequent to the termination of the contract amounted to an expropriation.’ Such
acts included a subsequent public announcement of the termination by the Prime Minister in a
political speech, withdrawal of the claimant’s VAT exemption certificate, seizure of the

claimant’s assets and the deportation of the claimant’s management.”

280. The principle that, where a justified ground for termination of a contract exists such termination

cannot be regarded as expropriatory, was also confirmed in Malicorp v. Egypt.™ In this case, an
ICSID tribunal rejected the claim that Egypt had expropriated the investor’s contractual rights to
build and operate an airport at Ras Sudr. Egypt had terminated the contract for lack of progress
on the investor’s side. The tribunal considered these grounds as justifications for the termination
and thus rejected the allegation that they were merely a ‘pretext designed to conceal a purely

expropriatory measure.’*°! The Malicorp tribunal concluded that:

the reasons on which the Respondent relied in order to bring the Contract to an end
appear serious and adequate; the termination, justified in fact and in law, could not
be interpreted as an expropriatory measure.**

281. Convial Callao v. Peru provides a similar example. In that case, the tribunal emphasised the

contractual autonomy of the parties when determining that the respondent’s exercise of its right

993

to declare the expiration of a contract did not amount to an expropriation.*°’ The tribunal reasoned

that:

the prerogative to declare the expiration stems from the will of the contracting parties

who, exercising contractual autonomy, negotiated and agreed what the grounds

would be to declare the expiration of the Contract. From the above, it follows that

the MPC had the prerogative to declare the expiration for the sole reason that the

parties had so agreed. Consequently, the power of the MPC to declare the expiration

came from the concurrence of wills of the parties, that is, the Contract, not the

sovereign will of the State.**
The tribunal stressed that, in purporting to terminate the contract, the respondent relied on its
terms.**° The claimant had argued that this exercise of contractual rights was actuated by public
interest motives.** The tribunal considered that even so, the exercise of the termination rights for
a public purpose ‘did not imply that it was not exercising a power whose only source is the
Contract’.**’ Convial Callao was distinctive in that in the contract in question, the government
maintained the right to cancel at any time for reasons of public interest,*°* making a public interest

termination explicitly part of the parties’ negotiated bargain.

282. Investment tribunals have also made clear that the termination of a contract need not be actually

553

justified in accordance with the applicable law governing the contract in order to exclude it being
qualified as expropriatory or performed in the exercise of public powers/puissance publique. In
the absence of an applicable umbrella clause, the question is not whether contract termination was

lawful—that is a matter for the local courts or, as here, for the chosen contractual forum. The

283. For instance, the tribunal in /mpregilo v. Argentina’

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

question is whether action purportedly taken under a contract is properly referable to it or is a

disguised abuse of public authority.*°°

°® considered, with regard to the question

whether the termination of the concession of the investor’s subsidiary AGBA constituted an
expropriation, that ‘it is not decisive whether or not the Province had a correct understanding of
AGBA’s obligations under the Concession Contract. What is relevant is rather that the Province,
with some justification, considered that AGBA had grossly failed in fulfilling its contractual
obligations and terminated the Concession Contract on this basis. This is sufficient, in the Arbitral
Tribunal’s opinion, to exclude that the termination could be regarded as an act of — direct or
indirect — expropriation or other appropriation of AGBA’s property or Impregilo’s investment. ’**!
Thus the Tribunal’s conclusions in the present are case are consistent both with the jurisprudence

of attribution and that of alleged taking of contractual rights.

284. To conclude, even if the termination of the Lease Agreement had been attributable to Poland, the

claims based on the BIT would have failed on their merits. There is therefore no need to address

questions of quantum.*?

VII. COSTS AND EXPENSES

A. Costs CLAIMED BY THE PARTIES

1. The Claimants’ Arguments

285. The Claimants submit that costs should follow the event in the event that they are the successful

party. On that basis, they request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to pay all ‘fees and
expenditures of the Arbitral Tribunal and of the Permanent Court of Arbitration’ as well as the
Claimants’ costs of legal representation and of ‘experts and advisers’ °° They claim EUR 150,000
for Tribunal costs (based on their deposit payment to the PCA). They further claim
NOK 5,972,996.00 and EUR 15,000 as their party costs (comprising costs of legal representation

Cf. Vigotop, §331: ‘If the Tribunal were ultimately to conclude that it was indeed legitimate for Respondent to
invoke its contractual grounds for terminating the Concession Contract, this would exclude a finding of an
expropriation, despite the parallel existence of public policy reasons.’

of NOK 5,145,681; and expert and adviser expenses of NOK 827,315 and EUR 15,000). In the

event, the Claimants submit that the Respondent should bear its own legal costs.

286. The Claimants further submit that, even if the Respondent succeeds on the merits, it should,

‘taking into account the circumstances of the case and the Respondent’s conduct in the
proceedings,’ nevertheless bear the costs of the arbitration and the Claimants’ legal costs.** In
this regard, the Claimants highlight the Respondent’s conduct during the document production

stage and its submission of post-hearing materials on 8 April 2016.°°

287. With regard to the production of documents, the Claimants consider the Respondent to have failed

to comply with Procedural Order No. 2 on two counts, namely with respect to disclosure of
documents relating to ANR meetings held with Pol Farm and documents recording ‘what
happened with Polfarm’s land.’ These categories correspond to the Requests Nos. 5 and 7 in

Procedural Order No. 2, both of which were granted.**

288. The Claimants submit that the Respondent has not complied with these requests. First, they

564

consider the testimony of Mr Marek Gil to have ‘confirmed’ the existence of additional
documents relating to meetings held between ANR and Pol Farm over the course of 2008.° Such
documents ‘clearly fall within’ the scope of the aforementioned requests; in the Claimants’ view,
Mr Gil’s reference undermines the Respondent’s claim that ‘no further documents’ had been
drawn up by ANR in this respect.*” The Claimants also point to Mr Gil’s observation that

documents had been drafted in connection with a committee constituted in December 2008 to

Claimants’ Statement of Costs dated 22 April 2016, p. 2 (attached to Letter dated 22 April 2016 from the

Claimants).

Ibid., pp. 2-3.
Ibid., p. 2.

Request No. 5 was for Documents (minutes, memorandums, notes and internal documentation prepared by the
ANR) in respect of Top Farm’s proposed acquisition of Pol Farm and/or the Lease Agreement (whether under
existing or new lease) in the period | Jan. 2008 — 31 Dec. 2009. Request No. 7 was for Documents regarding what
happened to the Farm following the termination of the Lease Agreement in July 2009 and until it was first
transferred or sold by the ANR to one or more third parties. ‘The Claimants request that the Respondent produces
documents that: (i) shows who the land was transferred to after the termination; (ii) how the land was sold,
transferred or leased; and (ii[i]) shows how much the land was sold for and/or the value of any lease agreements,
and similar documentation.’ See Procedural Order No. 2 dated 6 November 2015, pp. 4, 8.

make recommendations concerning the Lease Agreement—including a ‘form [in] which the

committee stated its reason for the recommendation to terminate.’*”!
The Claimants additionally consider the Respondent to have ‘failed’ to provide documentation in
respect of ‘what happened with Polfarm’s land under the Lease Agreement,’ leading to ‘great

difficulties (and increased costs)’ in the Claimants’ pleadings on quantum.*””

In this regard, the
Claimants highlight the Respondent’s oral statement that it could ‘produce such documentation if

ordered by the Tribunal.’*

Finally, the Claimants submit that the Respondent should bear the costs of the arbitration on
account of its conduct relating to the submission of unsolicited post-hearing materials. The
Claimants refer specifically to the Respondent’s 8 April 2016 letter, including a ‘request for
reconsideration’ of the Tribunal’s earlier decision not to allow further briefing on an additional
ground for termination of the Lease, that had been raised on the final day of oral arguments.°”*

Accordingly, and in light of the Respondent’s ‘improper conduct and uncooperative behaviour,”
the Claimants submit that the Respondent should bear all costs of the arbitration, including the
Tribunal’s fees and expenditures and the Claimants’ legal costs, ‘regardless of the Tribunal’s

decision’ on any issue of liability under the Treaty.°”°

2. The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent does not address the Claimants’ assertions in its simultaneous pleading on costs.
It requests that the Tribunal ‘order Claimants to pay all the costs, disbursements and expenses
incurred by Respondent in the defence against this claim including, but not restricted to, legal,
expert and witness fees and expenses, and travel and administrative expenses, as well as the costs

of the Tribunal.’*°

  

The Respondent claims a total of EUR 341,546.17°” That claim includes its deposit payment to
the PCA of EUR 150,000 to cover the arbitration costs. It further includes as legal and other costs

B. THE TRIBUNAL’S RULING ON Costs
1. Relevant Rules on Costs

Article X(3) of the Treaty, relating to ‘disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor,’

provides:

Each party shall bear the costs of participation of its member in the arbitration
procedure.

The costs of participation of the chairman shall be borne in equal parts by both

parties. The Tribunal may, however, in its award decide on a different proportion of

costs to be borne by the parties and this award shall be binding on both parties.
Neither Party invoked Article X(3) in their submissions on costs or their other pleadings. The
Claimants noted the provision but drew attention to the fact that it leaves discretion to the Tribunal
to ‘decide on a different proportion of costs to be borne by the parties’ and argued instead that the
Tribunal should follow the provisions in the UNCITRAL Rules.*” The Respondent similarly
opted to seek an order that the Claimants pay ‘all costs’ including ‘the arbitration costs’ without

reference to the provision in Article X(3) of the Treaty.

The Parties chose Brussels as the legal seat of the arbitration. The Belgian Arbitration Act leaves
it to the Tribunal to decide in its discretion ‘which of the parties shall bear the [costs] or in what

proportion they shall be borne by the parties.’**°

In light of the Parties’ own preference to apply the UNCITRAL Rules and the express discretion
left to the Tribunal in Article X(3) of the Treaty to decide on a ‘different proportion of costs to be
borne by the parties,’ the Tribunal decides to dispense with the particular allocation of costs set
out in Article X(3) of the Treaty and to follow the provisions in the UNCITRAL Rules for the

fixing and allocating of costs.

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

298. In the UNCITRAL Rules, provisions relevant to costs are found in Articles 38 to 40. Article 38
of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules defines the ‘costs of arbitration’ as follows:

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term “costs”
includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator
and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) — The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) | The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral
tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are
approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if
such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the
extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses
of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The
Hague.
299. Paragraphs | and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules set out the following with
respect to the allocation of costs, differentiating between Tribunal costs on the one hand
(paragraphs (a) to (d), and (f) of Article 38) and the parties’ own costs of representation and

assistance on the other hand (paragraph (e) of Article 38)

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle
be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may
apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to
in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear
such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines
that apportionment is reasonable.

2. Fixing the Costs of the Arbitration

300. The Parties deposited with the PCA a total of EUR 300,000 (EUR 150,000 by the Claimants;
EUR 150,000 by the Respondent) to cover the costs of arbitration.

301. The fees of Professor Ola Mestad, the arbitrator appointed by the Claimants, amount to
EUR 48,800. His expenses amount to EUR 2,059.91. The fees of Professor August Reinisch, the

Award, 27 June 2016

arbitrator appointed by the Respondent, amount to EUR 41,400. His expenses amount to
EUR 2,055.51. The fees of Judge James R. Crawford, AC, the presiding arbitrator, amount to
EUR 59,200. His expenses amount to EUR 208.86.

Pursuant to the Terms of Appointment and the agreement of the Parties, the International Bureau
of the PCA was designated to act as Registry in this arbitration. The PCA’s fees for registry
services amount to EUR 33,857.50. Other tribunal costs, including court reporters, hearing rooms,
meeting facilities, travel, bank charges, and all other expenses relating to the arbitration

proceedings, amount to EUR 55,261.60.

Based on the above figures, the combined Tribunal costs, comprising the items covered in
Article 38 (a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as enumerated above, are fixed
at a total EUR 242,843.38. These costs are deducted from the deposit, and any unexpended
balance shall be returned to the Parties in accordance with Article 41(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

Finally, under Article 38(e), the Tribunal finds the costs claimed by the successful party, the
Respondent, to be reasonable in amount and proportionate to the nature and complexity of the
matter. For the purposes of Article 38(e), the Tribunal therefore fixes Respondent’s legal and
other costs of representation at EUR 191,546.17 (comprised of EUR 187,255.87 for its legal fees
and EUR 4,290.30 for its expert’s fees).

3. Allocating the Costs of Arbitration

With respect to the tribunal costs, the Tribunal applies the general principle of ‘costs follow the
event.’ That approach is the more compelling here given that the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
expressly contemplate the rule of ‘costs follow the event’ in Article 40(1) by its emphasis on
‘success’ or its opposite. This conclusion is bolstered by both Parties’ choice to argue that the
unsuccessful side in this arbitration bear the full amount of tribunal costs as well as the successful

Party’s costs of legal representation.

While the Tribunal retains discretion to apportion the tribunal costs between the Parties if it
determines that such apportionment is ‘reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case’, it is not persuaded that such circumstances exist in the present case. The Tribunal considers
the Respondent’s conduct during the course of these proceedings to have been reasonable overall,
and in this respect declines the Claimants’ request to shift certain costs of the arbitration onto the
Respondent, the prevailing side, as a result of its behaviour during the document production phase

or with respect to its post-hearing letter. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines, pursuant to Article

94

307.

308.

309.

310.

311.

Almas v. Poland
Award, 27 June 2016

40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, that it is reasonable to apportion the costs of the arbitration

between the Parties such that the Claimants shall bear the full costs of the tribunal.

With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in Article 38,
paragraph (e), the Tribunal notes that there is no equivalent presumption in Article 40(2) of the
UNCITRAL Rules that the unsuccessful party shall bear such costs. The Tribunal is ‘free to
determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it

determines that apportionment is reasonable.’

The Tribunal decides that each party shall bear their own costs for legal representation, as defined
under Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal considers that both Parties’ conduct
during the course of proceedings was reasonable, efficient and professional. Further, while the
Claimants were unsuccessful in their claim in this arbitration against the Republic of Poland for
breach of the BIT, their treatment in the context of the Lease termination raised arguable issues
with regard to a long-standing investment in a difficult sector of former state farms. The Tribunal
further notes that neither the Treaty nor Belgian arbitration law provides that the successful party
to have its legal costs reimbursed. Accordingly, it decides that each Party shall bear its own legal

costs.

Cc. REIMBURSEMENT OF DEPOSIT

The Tribunal notes that the Parties have cumulatively paid EUR 300,000 in deposits requested by
the Registry at the outset of the proceedings. As noted above, the total figure for tribunal costs of

the arbitration is EUR 242,843.38, leaving an unused balance of EUR 57,156.62.

The Tribunal directs the PCA to reimburse to the Respondent the remaining balance of the

deposit.

Taking into account the Tribunal’s determination that the Claimants shall bear the arbitration
costs in the amount of EUR 242,843.38, and that the Claimants have already advanced
EUR 150,000 of that amount, the Claimants remain responsible for payment of EUR 92,843.38.
The Claimants shall pay over to the Respondent within 60 days of this Award, an amount of
EUR 92,843.38, which together with the remaining deposit of EUR 57,156.62, will ensure the

Respondent is fully reimbursed for its advance on costs.
