IL. Introduction to the dispute

This case originates from a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement
of Investment Disputes ("ICSID" or the "Centre") in accordance with the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,
dated March 18, 1965 (the "I[CSID Convention" or the "Convention"), arising out of a
Power Purchase Agreement dated May 26, 1995 (the "PPA"), entered into by Tanzania
Electric Supply Company Limited ("TANESCO") and Independent Power Tanzania
Limited ("IPTL").

The claimant in the "Arbitration Proceeding" was Standard Chartered Bank (Hong
Kong) Limited ("SCB HK"), a company organised under the laws of Hong Kong, a
subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank ("SCB"), which is incorporated in the United
Kingdom. The Respondent in the arbitration was TANESCO (and together with SCB HK
the "Parties"), an entity wholly owned by the United Republic of Tanzania (""Tanzania"
or the "GoT") and designated as an agency of Tanzania pursuant to Article 25(1) of the

ICSID Convention.

The claim was brought on the basis of the arbitration clause contained in the PPA which
refers to ICSID arbitration (the "Arbitration Clause"). SCB HK brought its claim in its
capacity as assignee of IPTL's rights under the PPA. SCB HK originally requested from
the "Tribunal" in the Arbitration Proceeding a declaration that TANESCO owed it
outstanding payments in the sum of US$258.7 million, and an order to pay it US$138

million to discharge its loan or alternatively to pay it the amounts due under the PPA.!

A preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability was issued on February 12, 2014
(the "Decision on Jurisdiction" or the "Decision"), in which the Tribunal decided that
IPTL's rights had been validly assigned to SCB HK under the PPA and that it had
jurisdiction over the Parties and the dispute. The Tribunal specified that it lacked

jurisdiction over the relationship between SCB HK and IPTL which arises under the Loan

' Annex-1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 126

Facility Agreement dated June 28, 1997 (the "Facility Agreement"). Consequently, the
Tribunal only made a declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO to IPTL under the

PPA but did not order for payment of such amount.

On September 12, 2016, the Tribunal rendered its award (the "Award"), in which it
concluded that: (i) it had jurisdiction to reopen the Decision on Jurisdiction, and, in
addition to making a declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO to SCB HK, it
would also make an order for payment of such amount; (ii) the tariff should be determined
on the basis of an Internal Rate of Return ("IRR") of 22.31% applied to a shareholder
loan. Therefore, the amount owed by TANESCO under the PPA as of September 30,
2015 was US$148.4 million; (iii) the interest rate on the amount owing under the PPA
was to be simple three-month LIBOR plus 4%; (iv) TANESCO be ordered to pay to SCB
HK US$148.4 million with simple interest at three-month LIBOR plus 4% from
September 30, 2015 until the date of the Award. Interest was to continue at the same rate
until full payment was received; (v) all other claims were dismissed; and (vi) each Party
was to bear its own legal fees and expenses and the costs of the arbitration in equal

shares.”

On January 6, 2017, TANESCO filed an application for annulment in writing with the
Secretary-General of the Centre requesting the annulment of the Award (the

"Application for Annulment").

The Application for Annulment was made within the time-period provided in Article
52(2) of the ICSID Convention. TANESCO sought annulment of the Award on three of
the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention), specifically claiming

that, in the Award:*

? Additionally, the Tribunal made the following declarations: (i) that amounts paid by TANESCO into the
Escrow Account did not discharge TANESCO's obligations under the PPA, and thus cannot be used to reduce
the amount that TANESCO owes SCB HK, (ii) that payment out of the Escrow Account to IPTL/PAP did not
discharge TANESCO's obligation to SCB HK under the PPA, and thus cannot be used to reduce the amount

that TANESCO owes

 

SCB HK, (iii) that payments made to IPTL/PAP since August 2013 do not discharge

TANESCO's obligation to SCB HK under the PPA, and thus cannot be used to reduce the amount that
TANESCO owes SCB HK. See Annex-1, Award dated September 12, 2016, 414 (5-7).

A) the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*+

B) there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure;>

and

C) the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.°

The Application for Annulment also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the
ICSID Convention and Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration
Proceedings ("ICSID Arbitration Rules" or the "Arbitration Rules"), for a stay of

enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment is decided.

On January 13, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application for
Annulment, and provisionally granted the stay of enforcement of the Award. On the same
date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, ICSID transmitted
the Notice of Registration to the Parties. The Parties were also notified that, pursuant to

ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.

By letter dated February 10, 2017, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified by the Centre that an ad hoc Committee (the

"Committee") had been constituted, composed of Mr Claus von Wobeser (Mexican), as

wrongly exercising jurisdiction even though SCB HK made 'no investment’ under Article 25(1) of the
Convention; ii) assuming jurisdiction over the relationship between SCB HK and ITPL [sic] under the Facility
Agreement [...] and allowing SCB HK to step into the shoes of IPTL and gain standing in these proceedings;
iii) reconsidering its prior Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 12 February 2014 [...]; and iv)
incorrectly failing to apply the law of Tanzania, being the proper law under the relevant contract, contrary to its
obligation under Article 42(1) of the Convention".

6 Application for Annulment, 18-25; see also TANESCO's Memorial on Annulment, §2: "...c. failed to state
reasons, within the meaning of Articles 48(3) and Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention. In particular, the Tribunal:
i. held on purely formalistic grounds that SCB HK had made an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1)
of the Convention; ii. failed to take into account additional and decisive evidence regarding the interest
applicable to the Escrow Account (as defined at paragraph 25 below); iii. failed to take into account
contradictory evidence concerning SCB HK's knowledge [...] of the status of the Escrow Account; iv. failed to
take into account the evidence presented by TANESCO on the continuing existence of the tariff dispute; v.
reversed its earlier decision that it had no jurisdiction over claims relating to the Facility Agreement; and vi.
held that the tariff must be calculated on the basis of an Internal Rate of Return ("IRR") of 22.1% which directly
contradicted its earlier finding that this rate cannot apply".

President, Ms Bertha Cooper-Rousseau (Bahamian) and Mr Christoph Schreuer
(Austrian) as Members. On the same date, the Parties were informed that Ms Aurélia
Antonietti, Senior Legal Adviser of ICSID, would serve as Secretary to the Committee.
On February 10, 2017, the annulment proceeding commenced (the "Annulment

Proceeding").

By letter dated February 20, 2017, SCB HK responded to TANESCO's request to
continue the stay. By letter dated February 22, 2017, TANESCO requested that the
Committee rule on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award within the
30-day timeframe provided for by ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2). By letter of February
23, 2017, SCB HK responded to TANESCO's letter dated February 22, 2017. By letter
dated February 24, 2017, TANESCO, inter alia, reiterated its request that the Committee

rule on the enforcement of the stay within the 30-day timeframe.

On February 25, 2017, the Committee asked the Parties to indicate whether they would
agree to a procedure whereby: (i) the 30-day deadline (set for March 13, 2017) under
ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) be extended for an additional period of 30 days for the
Committee to rule on the continuance of the stay; (ii) the stay would remain in effect
within the extended period; (iii) the Parties would file one round of submissions,
conferring among themselves to determine the dates for their exchange; and (iv) the first
session would be held in London on March 29, 2017 to discuss both procedural aspects

of the proceedings and the continuation of the stay.

On February 28, 2017, the ICSID Secretariat transmitted to the Committee
communications indicating the Parties' agreed timetable for the proceeding as follows:
(i) on March 10, 2017, TANESCO was to file its submission in support of the
continuation of the stay; (ii) on March 21, 2017, SCB HK was to file its response; (iii)
on March 29, 2017, an in-person hearing was to take place in London; and (iv) the 30-
day deadline be extended for an additional period of 30 days for the Committee to rule

on the continuance of the stay, the stay remaining in effect during this period.

On March 3, 2017, upon the Committee's proposal and with the agreement of the Parties,

an in-person hearing (the "First Session") was rescheduled for March 30, 2017.

” Decisi
® Decision on Stay of Enforcement, 188.

On March 6, 2017 ICSID circulated the Committee's draft procedural order no. | to the
Parties ahead of the First Session. On March 27, 2017, the Parties submitted their

comments on the draft.

On March 10, 2017, TANESCO filed its submission in support of a continuation of the
provisional stay, and on March 21, 2017, SCB HK filed its reply.

On March 30, 2017, the First Session was held. The draft procedural order no. 1 and the
stay submission and reply were discussed. The Parties agreed that the decision on the

request for the stay would be rendered separately from procedural order no. 1.
On April 3, 2017, the Committee issued "Procedural Order No. 1".

On April 7, 2017, upon the Committee's proposal and agreed to by the Parties, Ms
Montserrat Manzano was appointed as Assistant to the President of the Committee in the

Annulment Proceeding.

On April 12, 2017, the Committee issued its Decision on TANESCO's Request for a

Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (the "Decision on Stay of Enforcement").

Therein, the Committee ordered that the stay of enforcement continue subject to the
following conditions’: "TANESCO provides, within 30 days of the decision of the
Committee, an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond issued by
a first-tier reputable international credit institution (outside of Tanzania and with no
principal branch in Tanzania) for the full amount of the Award rendered against
TANESCO, inclusive of all interest accrued to the date of issuance of said irrevocable
bank guarantee or security bond, and immediately payable to or cashable by SCB HK
upon the issuance of a final decision of the Committee rejecting the annulment, or if the
annulment proceedings are withdrawn or discontinued".® If such conditions were not

complied with, the stay of enforcement would be automatically terminated.

By letter to the Committee dated May 12, 2017, TANESCO acknowledged receipt of the
Decision on Stay of Enforcement and requested an extension of 45 days instead of the
30-day period set out in such decision. By letter to the Committee dated May 16, 2017,
SCB HK opposed TANESCO's request.

By letter dated May 19, 2017, the Committee instructed TANESCO to provide on or
before May 23, 2017, clear and irrefutable proof that it had initiated the necessary actions
to obtain the guarantee requested in the Decision on Stay of Enforcement and that it
would be able to obtain it and present it before the Committee by June 26, 2017. After
reviewing such information, the Committee would decide whether and under which terms
to reinstate the stay. By letter dated May 25, 2017, the Committee confirmed the

termination of the stay as a result of TANESCO's failure to provide such proof.

On June 2, 2017, TANESCO filed its Memorial on Annulment ("TANESCO's

Memorial on Annulment").

On July 21, 2017, SCB HK filed its Counter Memorial on Annulment ("SCB HK's

Counter-Memorial on Annulment").

On August 18, 2017, TANESCO submitted its Reply on Annulment ("TANESCO's
Reply on Annulment") and on September 29, 2017, SCB HK filed its Rejoinder on
Annulment ("SCB HK's Rejoinder on Annulment").

On November 2, 2017, the Committee held a pre-hearing conference call with counsel

Ill. Factual background

The Committee received the factual background to this dispute from: (i) the Parties’
submissions in the Annulment Proceeding, (ii) the Decision on Jurisdiction’; and (iii) the
Award.'° These were considered in detail by the Committee during the present

Annulment Proceedings.
IV. The scope of the Annulment Proceedings

TANESCO seeks the annulment of the Award, issued by the Tribunal in ICSID Case No.
ARB/10/20 brought by SCB HK against TANESCO.

i) TANESCO's arguments

TANESCO notes that it agrees with SCB HK's statement that annulment under the ICSID
Convention is a limited, discretionary remedy, and that it is distinct from an appeal.
However, it argues that its Application for Annulment is within the confines of that

limited, discretionary remedy.!!

TANESCO states that under the ICSID Convention, Article 52 is the sole means by which
a party can bring to account a tribunal that has exceeded its powers. Article 52 of the
ICSID Convention is therefore a limited but vital part of the ICSID regime, and the ad
hoc committee formed pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention constitutes the

only scrutiny of what is otherwise an unappealable award.'?

In this respect, TANESCO explains that the grounds for annulment enumerated in Article
52 of the ICSID Convention clearly define the limits of the remedy of annulment.

Therefore, it is not for SCB HK to attempt to limit them further by suppressing the

TANESCO agrees that it is not the role of ad hoc committees to substitute their own
views on the merits for those of the tribunals.'* However, TANESCO argues that ICSID
jurisprudence clearly states that an ad hoc committee should not be precluded from
scrutinising failings of a tribunal which fall squarely within the confines of Article 52 of
the ICSID Convention.'* TANESCO argues that this is precisely the role of the ad hoc
committee within the ICSID regime and is what TANESCO seeks in this Annulment

Proceeding.!°

TANESCO agrees with SCB HK's assertion that the scope of the annulment remedy is to
"provide emergency relief in rare cases of fundamental importance, but to uphold the
finality of awards in the face of alleged relatively minor substantive or procedural
flaws".!7 However, contrary to SCB HK's assertions, TANESCO states that the
procedural irregularities concerning the Award were not "relatively minor substantive or
procedural flaws".!®

TANESCO states that, in the Award, the Tribunal adopted an unjustified approach to
ICSID proceedings never seen before. According to TANESCO, that approach fell
outside of the prescribed limits set by the ICSID Convention.'? TANESCO states that
this abuse of procedure goes to the heart of the purpose behind the annulment procedure

under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.”°

In light of the above, TANESCO states that an ad hoc committee's role is paramount and
thus should not be limited to the extent suggested by SCB HK. Further, it argues that the
Committee is clearly entitled to exercise its powers under Article 52 of the ICSID
Convention, and to hear TANESCO’s request for annulment of a seriously flawed

award.7!

ii) SCB HK's arguments

the integrity of the award — meaning that the reasoning presented in the award should be coherent and not
contradictory, so as to be understandable by the Parties and must reasonably support the solution adopted by
the tribunal (Article 52(1)(e)). Integrity of the dispute settlement mechanism, integrity of the process of dispute
settlement _and integrity of solution of the dispute are the basic ii goals projected in the ICSID
annulment mechanism. [Emphasis added by TANESCO]".

SCB HK states that annulment is distinct from appeal and that this fundamental
distinction has been emphasised repeatedly by ad hoc committees and is a well-

established principle in ICSID annulment jurisprudence.”

In this respect, SCB HK argues that an ad hoc committee does not have the powers of a

court of appeal and cannot carry out a substantive review of an award.”* Rather, SCB HK

4

states that annulment is a remedy of limited scope,”* concerned with only the basic

legitimacy of the process of a decision, and not with its substantive correctness.
Therefore, its role is limited to providing emergency relief in rare cases of fundamental
importance and to upholding the finality of awards in the face of alleged relatively minor

substantive or procedural flaws of an award.?>

Furthermore, SCB HK argues that "...in exercising this 'narrow and limited mandate’, an
ad hoc committee is forbidden from making an inquiry into the substance of the case, the

misapplication of the law or any mistakes in analysing the facts because annulment is not

concerned with the substantive correctness of an award".”° Therefore, SCB HK argues
that an ad hoc committee cannot substitute its views of the law or its appreciation of the
facts for those of the tribunal, and that it must take the record before the tribunal as its

premise.?’

Accordingly, SCB HK argues that in exercising its annulment authority, an ad hoc
committee must be careful not to reverse an award on the merits or carry out a substantive
review under the guise of applying the narrow, exhaustive grounds of Article 52 of the

ICSID Convention.”*

SCB HK states that the narrowly circumscribed nature of this remedy is also evident from
the drafting history of the Convention, since "[t]he International Law Commission,
during the drafting deliberations of the 1953 United Nations International Law
Commission Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure, from which the grounds for
annulment in the ICSID Convention derive, stated that appeals against arbitral awards
should not be allowed, but the validity of awards may be challenged ‘within rigidly fixed
limits".”° As a result, SCB HK explains that the ICSID Convention specifically rejects
any right to appeal in Article 53(1), and states that the use of the annulment procedure

should not be allowed to circumvent this prohibition.*°

SCB HK emphasises that an annulment proceeding is not a retrial or an opportunity to
raise new arguments, which a party could and should have made during the underlying
arbitral proceedings, or to introduce new contemporaneous evidence. SCB HK also
argues that it must not be used as an opportunity to re-litigate the case on the merits, nor
as an opportunity to determine which party had better arguments before the tribunal nor

to fill gaps in a party's arguments.*!

SCB HK states that "[t]he Committee should also take into account the principle that
annulment is an ‘extraordinary remedy with a high threshold". According to SCB HK,
annulment is an "exceptional" remedy for unusual cases where there have been

"egregious" violations of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.*

SCB HK also calls the attention of the Committee to the fact that even if it were to find
that one or more of the grounds for annulment have been established by TANESCO, it is
not required to annul the award as Article 52(3) provides that: "[t]he Committee shall
have the authority to annul the award or any part thereof on any of the grounds set forth

in paragraph (1)".

According to SCB HK, this does not require an automatic exercise of that authority, since
saying that an ad hoc committee "shall have the authority to annul the award" is different
from saying that a committee "shall annul the award". Thus, SCB HK argues that an ad
hoc committee retains some flexibility and discretion in determining whether annulment
is appropriate and that whilst this discretion is not unlimited, it is well established that

there are circumstances where annulment will not be appropriate.**

SCB HK states that this understanding of said Article has been reiterated by several ad

hoc committees.*+

In view of the aforementioned, SCB HK states that an ad hoc committee may refuse to
exercise its annulment authority where it is clearly not required to remedy the procedural
injustice which the applicant alleges and where the annulment will unjustifiably erode
the binding force of the award.*> In support of this argument, SCB HK quotes the Hussein
Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates case (“Soufraki v. UAE”), in which the
committee ruled that "even where a ground for annulment is justifiably found, an

annulment need not be the necessary outcome in all circumstances".*°

Consequently, SCB HK explains that, in the present case, the Committee must consider
the significance of the annullable error in relation to the legal rights of the Parties, the
gravity of the circumstances which constitute the grounds for annulment, the effect on
the outcome of the case, the importance of the finality of the award and the overall

fairness to the Parties.>”

SCB HK argues that TANESCO has failed to satisfy the high threshold required for an
award to be annulled, therefore, the need for this exceptional remedy has not been made

out in the present case.*®

iii) Analysis and Decision of the Committee

Bearing in mind the Parties’ arguments and evidence submitted in the Annulment
Proceeding, especially that which concerned the drafting history of the Convention and
the recent developments in case law on annulment proceedings, the Committee's

conclusion regarding the scope of this annulment remedy is as follows.

Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that an award is binding on the parties
and not subject to any appeal or any other remedy except those provided for in the ICSID
Convention. Said Article reflects an important aspect of the ICSID system, namely, its
self-contained nature, since national courts have no role in the ICSID proceedings.
Instead, the ICSID system contains "all provisions necessary for the arbitration of
disputes, including provisions addressing the institution of proceedings, jurisdiction,
procedure, the award to be rendered by the Tribunal, post-award remedies, and
recognition and enforcement of the award".*? The remedies provided for in the
Convention reflect a "deliberate election by the drafters of the Convention to ensure
finality of awards", as the only way to review them is pursuant to five specific remedies:
rectification (Article 49), supplementary decision (Article 49), interpretation (Article 50),

revision (Article 51) and annulment (Article 52).*°

Regarding the annulment remedy under Article 52, the drafting history of the ICSID
Convention reflects that assuring the finality of ICSID arbitration awards was a
fundamental goal for the ICSID system. In this regard, the Committee recalls the Parties’
arguments regarding the scope of the annulment proceedings, specifically those dealing
with its limited nature and the fact that such remedy does not imply the possibility of
substituting their own views on the merits for those of the Tribunal's,*! and finds that
annulment grounds were designed purposefully to confer a limited scope of review,

which would safeguard against "violation of the fundamental principles of law governing

"it is not within the Committee's remit to review the substantive correctness of the Award, either in fact or in
law. However, the Committee must examine the legitimacy of the arbitration proceedings resulting in the
Award. This means that it is not the Committee's function to sit in appeal on the Award of the Tribunal. It must
not substitute its views for those of the Tribunal"; CLA-104, Tulip Real Estate v. Turkey, 142, which states:
"[a] decision-maker exercising the power to annul only has the choice between leaving the original decision
intact or annulling it in whole or in part. An appeals body may substitute its own decision for the decision that

the [t]ribunal's proceedings”.

The remedy has been characterized as one concerning
"procedural errors in the decisional process" rather than an inquiry into the substance of

the award.

Additionally, the Committee bears in mind the drafting history of the Convention, which
also demonstrates that annulment "is not a procedure by way of appeal requiring
consideration of the merits of the case, but one that merely calls for an affirmative or
negative ruling based upon one [of the grounds for annulment]".** It, therefore, does not
provide a mechanism to appeal any alleged misapplication of law or mistake in fact by a

tribunal.

Therefore, an annulment proceeding is not concerned with how the tribunal appreciated
the arguments and evidence submitted by the parties or the conclusion it arrived
therefrom. Instead, it is merely concerned that such assessment or evaluation indeed took
place, on a fair and equitable basis, and that the findings of the Tribunal were based in

its appreciation and analysis of said evidence and arguments, and thus is not arbitrary.

ICSID ad hoc committees have affirmed the reasonings on which this Committee is
basing its decision, having established that: (1) the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the
only grounds on which an award may be annulled; (2) annulment is an exceptional and

narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an ad hoc committee is limited; (3) ad

71: "7. The grounds for annulment in the ICSID Convention derive from the 1953 United Nations International
Law Commission Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure (‘ILC Draft’), [...] The ILC recognized that the
finality of an award is an essential feature of arbitral practice, but also recognized that there was a need for
‘exceptional remedies calculated to uphold the judicial character of the award as well as the will of the parties
as a source of the jurisdiction of the tribunal’. It thus 'sought to reconcile finality of the award with the need to
prevent flagrant cases of excess of jurisdiction and injustice.'. [...] 71. [...] the drafting history of the ICSID
Convention demonstrates that assuring the finality of ICSID arbitration awards was a fundamental goal for the
ICSID system. [...] The remedy has thus been characterized as one concerning ‘procedural errors in the
decisional process' rather than an inquiry into the substance of the award".

With regards to this, during the meetings held by the Legal Committee in 1964, it was confirmed by a vote that
even a "manifestly incorrect application of the law" is not a ground for annulment. See also 18, 21: "18. [t]he
Legal Committee held a series of meetings in November and December 1964{...]. 21. Chairman [...] confirmed
during the meetings that failure to apply the proper law could amount to an excess of power if the parties had
agreed on an applicable law. One proposal suggested adding the ‘manifestly incorrect application of the law' by
the Tribunal as a ground of annulment, but it was defeated by a vote of 17 to 8".

hoc committees are not courts of appeal and thus, annulment is not a remedy against an
incorrect decision and an ad hoc committee cannot substitute the tribunal's determination
on the merits for its own; (4) ad hoc committees should exercise their discretion not to
defeat the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of
awards; (5) Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose,
neither narrowly nor broadly; and (6) an ad hoc committee's authority to annul is
circumscribed by the Article 52 grounds specified in the application for annulment, but
an ad hoc committee has discretion with respect to the extent of an annulment, i.e., either

partial or full.4°

Considering the aforementioned, the Committee concludes that the grounds stated above
are the only grounds on which the Award may be annulled and that this remedy is not an
appeal nor a remedy against an incorrect decision or the Tribunal’s appreciation of the
facts and/or evidence. Therefore, the authority conferred upon the Committee to rule on
the annulment does not allow it to review the substantive determinations reached by the
Tribunal, but merely to establish which of its decisions affected the Award in such a way
as to amount to a ground for annulment. The Committee cannot issue a ruling regarding
the substance of the dispute, since, according to Article 52(6) of the Convention, should
the Award be annulled, the dispute shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to a

new tribunal in accordance with Section 2 of Chapter IV of the ICSID Convention.

Vv. Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction as a Preliminary

Matter

The Committee will address the issue of reconsideration as a preliminary matter, given
that the conclusions reached herewith will assist the analysis of the arguments on
reconsideration brought forward under each of the grounds for annulment. It is, therefore,
most efficient to establish certain common principles and conclusions by the Committee
at the outset. In this chapter the Committee provides: (V.A) the relevant provisions on
reconsideration, (V.B) the Tribunal's reasoning on reconsideration, (V.C) the Parties’
arguments on reconsideration and (V.D) its analysis of reconsideration and general

conclusions on the same.

Subsequently, when analysing the grounds under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention,
the Committee will, when necessary, explain and give a more detailed analysis of each

of the considerations submitted by TANESCO.
V.A Relevant Provisions on Reconsideration

The ICSID Convention:

"Article 41
The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.

Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the
jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence
of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine
whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits

of the dispute.

Article 44

Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in
accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the
parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which
is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed

by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.

tel
Article 48

The Tribunal shall decide questions by a majority of the votes of all its

members.

The award of the Tribunal shall be in writing and shall be signed by the

members of the Tribunal who voted for it.

The award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal and

shall state the reasons upon which it is based.

Any member of the Tribunal may attach his individual opinion to the
award, whether he dissents from the majority or not, or a statement of his

dissent.
The Centre shall not publish the award without the consent of the parties.

tel
Article 51

Either party may request revision of the award by an application in writing
addressed to the Secretary-General on the ground of discovery of some fact
of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that when the
award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the
applicant and that the applicant’s ignorance of that fact was not due to

negligence.

The application shall be made within 90 days after the discovery of such
fact and in any event within three years after the date on which the award

was rendered.

The request shall, if possible, be submitted to the Tribunal which rendered
the award. If this shall not be possible, a new Tribunal shall be constituted

in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter.

The Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay
enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a
stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be

stayed provisionally until the Tribunal rules on such request".

67. _ICSID Arbitration Rules:
"Rule 41

Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the
jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons, is not within the competence
of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the
objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the
time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection
relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder — unless the facts

on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.

The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the
proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within

the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence".

V.B The Tribunal's Reasoning on Reconsideration

68. TANESCO bases its Application for Annulment in part on the Tribunal's reconsideration
of its prior Decision on Jurisdiction that led the Tribunal to change from initially

awarding only declaratory relief to SCB HK from TANESCO to instead ordering

20

69.

70.

71.

TANESCO to pay the amount it owed to SCB HK under the PPA. In the following

paragraphs, the Committee reviews the Tribunal's reasoning on reconsideration.

The Committee observes that the Tribunal began its enquiry on whether it had authority
to reconsider its prior Decision on Jurisdiction under the ICSID system and the facts of
the present case by observing that there is nothing in either the ICSID Convention or the
ICSID Arbitration Rules dealing explicitly with the question of reconsideration of a
decision (as opposed to an award). It recalled that the power to reconsider an award is
dealt with in Articles 51 and 52 of the ICSID Convention, the former of which relates to
the revision of an award in light of "the discovery of some fact of such a nature as to
decisively affect the award", and the latter of which to an application for the annulment
of an award. However, there are no equivalent provisions relating to interlocutory

decisions.“°

The starting point for the Tribunal was the relationship under the ICSID Convention and
the ICSID Arbitration Rules between a decision and an award and the question of whether
a decision has the same res judicata effect as an award. The Tribunal determined that a
decision is not an award because in accordance with Article 48(3) of the ICSID
Convention, a decision must be incorporated into the award. The Tribunal noted that only
once incorporated, then as part of the award does a decision come "...within the ambit of
Article 50, Article 51, and Article 52 (annulment) of the ICSID Convention".47 Equally,
the Tribunal considered that provisions of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention dealing

with finality are applicable to awards but not directly applicable to decisions.

The Tribunal further noted that there was little arbitral jurisprudence on the question of
whether jurisdictional decisions can be reconsidered before the rendering of the final
award. The two existing cases the Tribunal found to be directly on point at the time of

the Tribunal's deliberations were ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*® and Perenco v.

Ecuador.” The majority in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela expressly concluded that
decisions were res judicata, and not just when they are incorporated into the final award.
However, the Tribunal concluded that while at the time of writing its decision no case
had directly found that there is a power to reconsider prior decisions, there were cases
that seemed to acknowledge the possibility of, or the existence of such a power, without

actually applying it to reopen a decision.*°

In the eyes of the Tribunal, the question was whether, notwithstanding the lack of any
provision in the ICSID Convention relating to the finality of decisions, a decision of a
tribunal is nevertheless final and res judicata. It concluded that this same finding by the
majority in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela was too broad considering that tribunals make
decisions on procedural matters and on provisional matters, all of which are subject to
being reviewed, reconsidered and revised, notwithstanding the absence of anything in the
ICSID Convention authorising this. Consequently, it held that the mere fact that
something is characterised as a decision of a tribunal cannot automatically make it res

judicata.*

The Tribunal also concluded that the fact that a decision is binding on the parties does
not mean the same thing as saying that it is res judicata.** In this respect, the Tribunal
explained that decisions are binding within the scope of the proceedings but that this did
not make them res judicata, since an essential feature of res judicata is that the judgment
in question produces effects on the parties outside of the proceedings in which it is
granted. However, it found that decisions of tribunals only have effect within the
proceedings until they have been incorporated into the final award as supported by Article
48(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal acknowledged that there is nothing
preventing a tribunal from making it clear that it considers that its decisions are final and

not subject to reopening as had appeared to be done by the tribunal in Electrabel v.

Hungary, but found that this does not mean that a tribunal can confer a status on its

decisions that they do not have under the lex arbitri.+

Moreover, the Tribunal considered that while nothing in the ICSID Convention prohibits
the reopening of decisions, Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention confers the general
power on tribunals to determine their own competence. Further, the Tribunal explained
that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention also grants a power to a tribunal to decide "any
question of procedure" that is not covered in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration
Rules or agreed by the parties. The Tribunal recalled the tribunal's decision in
ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, where it did not see this article as a basis for admitting a
reconsideration request, stating that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention "cannot be seen
as conferring a broad unexpressed power of substantive decision".** However, the
Tribunal did not find this reasoning compelling and held instead that a power to reopen
a decision has both procedural and substantive aspects, involving a procedural right to
bring a request for reconsideration and the substantive question of what is to be done with
such a request. It also found that the specific reference to "procedure" in Article 44 of the
ICSID Convention should not be seen to limit the tribunal's broader power under Article

41 of the ICSID Convention to determine its own competence.*°

Having thus found that decisions do not have res judicata effect before their
incorporation into a final award, the Tribunal went on to consider under which
circumstances the reopening of decisions would indeed be justified. In that context, it
noted that the Perenco v. Ecuador tribunal "[went] out of its way to say that it [was] not
dealing with facts similar to those in ConocoPhillips, where there [had been] an
allegation of recently discovered evidence that would justify reopening an award under
Article 51 [of the ICSID Convention]. While expressing some sympathy with the
approach taken by Professor Abi-Saab in his dissent in ConocoPhillips, [...] the Perenco
tribunal stated that the ‘facts in the ConocoPhillips case, in the view of the tribunal, are

so far removed as to deprive Professor Abi-Saab's views of any relevance to the instant

case". >” According to the Tribunal, while rejecting the idea of a general power to reopen,
the Perenco v. Ecuador tribunal appeared to avoid expressing a view on whether there

would be a specific power to reopen in the light of particular facts.**

The Tribunal in the present case held that exercising a power to reopen decisions under
certain limited circumstances has practical advantages: it avoids having a tribunal decide
issues on the merits on the basis of a decision which has been seriously called into
question. Later, such decision could be reopened or annulled, potentially wasting the time
and expenses incurred since a tribunal became aware that its decision would likely be
called into question. In the Tribunal's view, efficiency grounds alone suggest that there
may be circumstances where a tribunal should consider reopening a decision that it has

previously made.*?

In view of determining under which limited circumstances such a power to reconsider
would be warranted, the Tribunal suggested an analogy with Article 51 of the ICSID
Convention. It argued that in reconsidering a decision, a tribunal should be guided by,

although not bound by, the limitations on reopening that apply to awards.

The Tribunal stated that in the case at hand, SCB HK had raised an alleged error of law
in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and the subsequent coming to light of a fact
existing prior to that decision within the knowledge of TANESCO, which TANESCO
had wilfully withheld from the Tribunal. SCB HK's allegation was thus that the Tribunal
had reached its decision without knowledge of material facts, which had been deliberately
withheld by TANESCO, and that with the knowledge of those facts, the Tribunal might
have reached a different decision. The Tribunal considered that such an allegation, if
proved, would justify reopening its decision not to order payment of any amount owing

to SCB HK by TANESCO.*!

When determining whether to reopen its decision regarding the order for payment, the
Tribunal conducted an analysis of the Parties' arguments. It explained that SCB HK
argued that in the letter sent to the Tribunal on December 13, 2013 (“December 2013
Letter”), TANESCO misled the Tribunal in two important ways: first, while stating that
there had been no deterioration in SCB HK's position as a result of further developments
in Tanzania, it had failed to disclose that it had engaged in discussions for the release of
the monies in the escrow account -- which it had established with the Bank of Tanzania
due to an invoice dispute (“Escrow Account”), to IPTL/PAP, and; secondly, it failed to
disclose that it had agreed with IPTL to make payments to IPTL based on the full tariff
under the PPA in contradiction of the position taken in the arbitration that the tariff had

been incorrectly calculated.

TANESCO on the other hand argued that the Tribunal was not misled by the December
2013 Letter; that the alleged new facts would have had no impact on the Tribunal's
decision; and furthermore, that SCB HK was aware of those facts and did itself fail to

disclose them to the Tribunal.

The Tribunal considered in detail what was disclosed in the December 2013 Letter; what
was in fact known by TANESCO at that time, and what impact this might have had on
the Decision; as well as the state of knowledge of SCB HK at the relevant time. The
Tribunal found that: there was a failure by TANESCO to disclose the 2013 Settlement
Agreement;™ the Escrow Account had been deliberately emptied; there was no proof that
SCB HK had been aware of these facts; and that this lack of knowledge had not been the

result of negligence.°

The Tribunal more specifically found that while in its December 2013 Letter TANESCO
had given the impression that there was no agreement in existence relating to the sale of
electricity, it failed to disclose that there was in fact a new Settlement Agreement entered

into by TANESCO on October 3, 2013 under which IPTL/PAP would provide electricity

to TANESCO with TANESCO paying the full tariff. Further, TANESCO claimed in its
December 2013 Letter that it had no control over the Escrow Account but had failed to
disclose that it had already recommended jointly with IPTL/PAP that the funds in the
Escrow Account be released to IPTL/PAP, and some eight days before the letter in
question was written all the funds in the Escrow Account had been released. In the
Tribunal's view, this failure to disclose had been deliberate and TANESCO's response

had been misleading.

The Tribunal also held that there was no proof that SCB HK had been aware of the terms
of the 2013 Settlement Agreement between TANESCO and IPTL/PAP. Further, it would
have been illogical for SCB HK not to have brought the terms of that agreement and the
fact that the Escrow Account had been emptied to the attention of the Tribunal
immediately, had it been informed of these facts prior to the Tribunal’s decision. In the
Tribunal's view, it was "inconceivable" that SCB HK would not have sought to capitalise

on it had it known about it.°”

In addition, the Tribunal found that given that it found no evidence of knowledge of the
above-mentioned facts by SCB HK, it would be difficult to characterise SCB HK's
conduct as negligent. It consequently held that while with hindsight SCB HK might have
wished that it had pushed further, in light of TANESCO's December 2013 Letter, it had

had no obligation to do so and thus its actions could not be characterized as negligent.

Finally, the Tribunal concluded that the existence of the 2013 Settlement Agreement
between TANESCO and IPTL to settle the existing dispute between them as to whether
contributions to the capital of IPTL were consistent with the PPA (“Tariff Dispute”),
and the status of the Escrow Account were material to its decision to not make an order
for payment of the amounts owing to SCB HK under the PPA as the context in which the
Tribunal made its Decision was substantially different from that which it had been led to

believe.”

It followed for the Tribunal that grounds for reopening its decision not to make an order
for payment of the amount owing by TANESCO to SCB HK under the PPA had been

established.”

V.C The Parties' Arguments on the Tribunal's Reasoning on

Reconsideration

In short, TANESCO argues that there is no power under the ICSID Convention or the
ICSID Arbitration Rules to reopen a decision of an ICSID tribunal, which is final and res
judicata. It rejects the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab and relies instead on the
majority decision in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, which concluded that a decision once
issued is res judicata and cannot be reopened. It also relies on the award of the tribunal
in Perenco vy. Ecuador, which it alleges reached a similar conclusion. According to
TANESCO, tribunals do not have a general power to reopen decisions, nor a specific
power in the event of an error of law or the discovery of new facts. TANESCO further
argues that, even if there were a power to reopen, the facts in the present case would not

support reopening.

SCB HK, on the other hand, invokes the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in
ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela to support its view that a decision does not become final
and res judicata until it is incorporated into a final award. In addition, it argues that there
is no prohibition on reopening a decision in the ICSID Convention or the ICSID
Arbitration Rules; and that moreover, there are pragmatic reasons for recognising a power
to reopen under specific limited circumstances. Such circumstances include the

deliberate misleading of a tribunal — as it alleges was the case in the present proceedings.

The reasoning of each of the Parties is summarised in more detail as follows.

i) TANESCO's arguments

In the present annulment proceedings, TANESCO argues that the Tribunal manifestly

exceeded its powers by disregarding the res judicata effect of its Decision on Jurisdiction

7 Annex-1, Award, 1348.

27

91.

92.

when it reconsidered its determination that its jurisdiction was limited to making a
declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO to SCB HK and made an order for
payment of that amount to SCB HK. According to TANESCO, the Tribunal's
reconsideration of its previous decision also amounts to a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure; and the fact that the Tribunal only premised its
reconsideration of the scope of its jurisdiction on one of the legal bases on which it had
established that jurisdiction and did not address or reject the other independent legal bases
for establishing that limited scope of its jurisdiction should also lead to annulment for

failure to state reasons.”!

In TANESCO's view, the Tribunal's reconsideration of its prior Decision on Jurisdiction
represents an unprecedented denial of the principles of res judicata and due process, as
so far recognised and applied by well-established ICSID case law, including the case of
Electrabel v. Hungary. TANESCO states that therein the tribunal affirmed the principle
of res judicata with respect to decisions under the ICSID Convention resolving points of
dispute between the parties, which was later followed by ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela.”
TANESCO asserts in particular that the tribunal in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela had no
trouble in concluding that "[i]t is established as a matter of principle and practice that
such decisions that resolve points in dispute between the Parties have res judicata effect.
They are intended to be final and not to be revisited by the Parties or the [t]ribunal in any
later phase of their arbitration proceedings".’”> TANESCO goes on to remind the

Committee that the same point was also endorsed by the tribunal in Perenco v. Ecuador."

In TANESCO's view, the reasoning of the Tribunal on these points is weak.” It argues
that the Tribunal seems to be equating a minor procedural decision with its Decision on
Jurisdiction, which was made after many rounds of written submissions and an oral

hearing. According to TANESCO, this was a binding determination on all but a few

75 TANESCO's Memorial on Annulment, {140, quoting {311 of Annex-1, Award: "...to the extent that the
ConocoPhillips tribunal was stating that all decisions of ICSID tribunals are res judicata, the statement is, at
the very least, too broad. Tribunals make decisions on procedural matters, on provisional matters [...] the mere
fact that something is characterized as a decision of a tribunal cannot automatically make it res judicata".

remaining quantum issues, on which the Parties relied in order to seek to settle those
remaining issues at the Tribunal's direction. It states that the fact that the Parties might
well have settled those remaining issues in reliance on the Tribunal's Decision
demonstrates its binding character. It asks the Committee whether the Tribunal would
have unwound such a settlement on the basis that its prior Decision had actually not been

final.”

TANESCO also refutes the Tribunal's reliance on Articles 41(1) and 44 of the ICSID
Convention. In its view, this reliance is entirely inappropriate. TANESCO states that if
Article 44 of the ICSID Convention could be used in this way, it would render the
remainder of the ICSID Convention useless. It cites ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela in
support of this argument, recalling that the tribunal in that case held that the power under
Article 44 of the ICSID Convention "cannot be seen as conferring a broad unexpressed
power of substantive decision".””

TANESCO further argues that it is a central tenet of the consensual dispute resolution
process under the ICSID system that States expect certainty. In its view, this certainty is
assured by determining that awards are binding and have res judicata effect, which is
clearly and expressly provided for in Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention. TANESCO.
infers from this that if a decision is binding, it is not open to the Tribunal to reconsider
it; and consequently, if a tribunal does decide to reconsider a prior decision, it is acting
contrary to the express wording of the Convention, which constitutes a clear example of
manifest excess of power. In TANESCO's view, the Tribunal cannot reconsider a
previous determination just because it is contained in a "decision" rather than an "award".
TANESCO argues that while the Tribunal states that "clearly a decision is not an award",
the Decision on Jurisdiction is a substantial determination as opposed to a procedural
decision, and that, under other arbitral regimes, this Decision would be deemed a Partial
Award. TANESCO states that irrespective of the label attached to the Decision, it is

binding in the proceedings and is res judicata.”

TANESCO stresses that the Tribunal's conduct fundamentally undermines the rule-based
system of ICSID (on the basis of which Contracting States consent), and if not annulled
will lead to a lack of certainty in the process. TANESCO states that this was
acknowledged by the Tribunal in Methanex v. United States as long ago as 2005: "[t]here
is little point in any arbitration tribunal making jurisdictional decisions intended and
understood to be final and binding on the parties if much later a disappointed party can
reargue its jurisdictional case and turn the arbitration into the equivalent of Sisyphus'
torment or the film Groundhog Day". ”? TANESCO therefore urges the Committee to

appreciate the potential of the Tribunal's Award to unsettle ICSID's rule-based system.*°

  

Replying to the Tribunal's efficiency concerns, TANESCO considers that the Tribunal's
argument that re-opening decisions serves the purpose of saving time is feeble. In its
view, "re-writing the ICSID Rules and throwing certainty out of the window is hardly
likely to promote efficiency, even if efficiency were a goal in itself capable of overriding
the Tribunal's fundamental duties to act within the boundaries of its powers, and to
respect fundamental rules of procedure".*! It counters these arguments by stating that

rather than increasing efficiency, the Tribunal granting itself the power to reconsider

   

previous decisions leads to more inefficiency by providing an unnecessary opportunity

for issues previously settled to be reopened.**

TANESCO also rejects the Tribunal's reference to Article 51 of the ICSID Convention.
It states first that this provision relates to the revision of final awards and is therefore not
applicable to reconsideration of interlocutory decisions, even if only by analogy.
TANESCO further states that in applying Article 51 of the ICSID Convention by
analogy, the Tribunal failed to satisfy itself that all the requirements thereunder were
met.** In TANESCO's view, the Tribunal's decision to reconsider was based on facts

which were neither of such a nature as to decisively affect the Award nor were they

unknown to the Tribunal or SCB HK at the time of the Decision on Jurisdiction, and in

any case, SCB HK could not have ignored them without negligence.

TANESCO also points out that at paragraph 318 of the Award, the Tribunal stated that if
the decision that SCB HK wished to have reopened were res judicata then, by analogy
with Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, "it might be reopened in defined
circumstances", without expanding, however, on what those defined circumstances might
be. This amounts to writing a new rule.* It argues that taking the ICSID Arbitration Rules
and applying elements of them by analogy to new contexts is a dangerous precedent.**
According to TANESCO, its expert, Professor Reinisch, supports these arguments stating
that "instead [of granting] itself a broad unwritten power to reconsider core judicial
findings, [...] the Tribunal should have rendered the Award on the basis and within the
confines of its Decision [...]".°° In his view, since the Convention expressly provides for
the possibility of revision of awards, there is no room for any informal application of the

grounds laid down in Article 51 of the ICSID Convention.*’

In TANESCO's view, the Burlington v. Ecuador decision, referenced by SCB HK in the
Annulment Proceeding, is not relevant to the proceeding before this Committee. It recalls
that the decision in Burlington v. Ecuador was published almost three years after the
Decision on Jurisdiction was issued and five months after the publication of the Award.
Thus, according to TANESCO, even if Burlington v. Ecuador supported SCB HK's
position, it would be impossible to justify the Tribunal's reconsideration of the Decision

by reference to a later case, which of course it did not consider.®8

TANESCO further states that the Burlington v. Ecuador tribunal recognised the
established body of jurisprudence, which confirms that ICSID tribunals have had no
hesitation in finding that preliminary decisions bind the parties and the tribunal in the

course of the proceedings.*? And while TANESCO admits that the same tribunal

acknowledged that prior decisions can be reconsidered in exceptional and limited
circumstances, it argues that it made it clear that this could only be done if the five
conditions of Article 51 of the ICSID Convention are satisfied, something that,

TANESCO alleges, the Tribunal in the present case failed to do.”

Finally, TANESCO takes issue with the Tribunal's finding at paragraph 333 of the Award
that TANESCO was somehow under a duty or obligation to the Tribunal to disclose an
agreement with a third party because it settled with that third party on terms that it
disputes in the arbitration. TANESCO does not accept SCB HK's version of events, and
states that it was not for TANESCO to make SCB HK's case for it when SCB HK could
have made document production requests since it had knowledge of TANESCO's
settlement with IPTL and court-sanctioned payments from the Escrow Account.*! In
TANESCO's view, the Tribunal showed bias against it in the Award by holding, for
example, that the factual position as set out by the Parties with regard to SCB HK's
knowledge of the 2013 Settlement Agreement between TANESCO and IPTL/PAP was
“unclear and at times even self-contradictory", but yet decided that it had "no difficulty
in concluding that the failure of TANESCO to disclose these facts was anything other
than deliberate".°? In any event, TANESCO is of the view that SCB HK did have
knowledge of the existence of the 2013 Settlement Agreement prior to the Decision being
issued, and consequently there were no new facts before the Tribunal to warrant any
reconsideration of that Decision. TANESCO concludes that even if one were to agree
with the Tribunal's view that it possessed a power to reconsider a prior decision under

"exceptional and very limited circumstances", it transgressed its own standard.?

ii) SCB HK's arguments

SCB HK, on the other hand, is of the view that TANESCO's assertion that reconsideration
is "contrary to the express wording of the Convention" is without merit. SCB HK states

that the Tribunal correctly identified the starting point to be that the ICSID Convention

and ICSID Arbitration Rules are silent on the question of reconsideration of decisions.
SCB HK argues that TANESCO does not mention any specific provision of the ICSID
Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules that supports its conclusion that decisions are
final and binding and may not be reconsidered under any circumstances. SCB HK states
that Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention that TANESCO cites refers to awards and

not decisions.

According to SCB HK, considering that there is no provision expressly precluding a
tribunal from reconsidering its decision, or expressly permitting it to do so, the question
becomes how the ICSID Convention should be interpreted, where it is silent on the issue.
SCB HK argues in this context that the structure and architecture of the ICSID
Convention supports the distinction between an award and a decision. SCB HK states
that the conclusion that decisions can be reconsidered under specific limited
circumstances is supported by the following reasoning: (1) a decision does not become
final unless and until it is incorporated into an award which determines every question
submitted to the tribunal in line with Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention; (2) the fact
that a decision is not subject to the post-award remedies provided in Articles 50 to 52 of
the ICSID Convention indicates that a decision is not final and can be reconsidered by a
tribunal; (3) there is no provision of the ICSID Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules
which compels (or indeed supports) the conclusion that decisions are final and may not
be revisited under any circumstances; (4) properly construed, the ICSID Convention
permits a tribunal to reconsider its decision, particularly given the results that would
follow if there was no scope for a tribunal to reconsider its decision until it is incorporated
into an award; (5) concluding that a decision is final and not open to reconsideration may
lead to procedural inefficiencies arising as a result of proceedings continuing to the award
stage on the basis of a defective decision which could have been reconsidered earlier; (6)
the fact that a tribunal will in practice only reopen a decision under exceptional
circumstances mitigates any inefficiency or uncertainty which may arise from
recognising that a decision is not final, and these concerns are in any event outweighed

by the injustice of proceedings building on an improper decision.”°

105.

SCB HK further defends the Tribunal's reliance on Articles 41 and 44 of the ICSID
Convention in reopening its Decision on Jurisdiction. In its view, (TANESCO's expert)
Professor Reinisch's interpretation of the power of ICSID tribunals to determine their
own competence under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention is unnecessarily narrow.
SCB HK points out that while it is correct that this provision provides ICSID tribunals
with an exclusive power to decide on matters of their jurisdiction vis-a-vis national
courts, the principle of Kompetenz-Kompetenz empowers ICSID tribunals to determine
their jurisdiction more generally, including allowing them to determine whether they
have the jurisdiction to reconsider an interlocutory decision under the circumstances of a
specific case.”° It similarly recalls that the Tribunal found that the decision to reconsider
had a significant procedural aspect — the right to bring a request for reconsideration, as
well as the substantive question of what is to be done with such a request. Thus, SCB HK
alleges that the Tribunal held that the power to reconsider was consistent with Article 44
of the ICSID Convention and was not limited by that article's reference to "any question
of procedure”.°” According to SCB HK, the Tribunal's reasoning in relation to Articles
41 and 44 of the ICSID Convention is therefore entirely consistent with the well-
established principle that tribunals have inherent powers to make decisions regarding the
conduct of proceedings in order to fulfil their judicial function, which go beyond the
specific rules under which they are constituted, provided that such decisions do not
contradict those specific rules. Article 41 of the ICSID Convention expressly recognises
the inherent power of Kompetenz-Kompetenz, and Article 44 of the ICSID Convention is
an express recognition of the inherent powers possessed by the Tribunal to decide on

questions of procedure necessary for the resolution of the case.°*

SCB HK also recalls that the Tribunal found that it had the power to reconsider prior
decisions only under exceptional limited circumstances and was guided in the
determination of what these should be by the grounds for reopening an award in Article

51 of the ICSID Convention.” In further support of this reasoning, SCB HK cites

Burlington v. Ecuador, which also found that a pre-award decision might be revised
under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention applied by analogy, provided the conditions

of that article are satisfied.!°°

SCB HK argues, more generally, that none of the cases cited by Professor Reinisch in
support of the proposition that a tribunal is precluded from reopening jurisdictional
matters which have been decided, despite a final award not having been issued, concerned
an ICSID decision which was procured by the deliberately misleading conduct of one of
the parties.'°! The Perenco v. Ecuador tribunal for example appears to avoid expressing
a view on whether there would be a specific power to reopen in the light of such particular

facts, while at the same time rejecting the idea of a general power to reopen. !°

Similarly,
Professor Reinisch fails to mention anywhere in his opinion that the Burlington v.
Ecuador tribunal expressly and repeatedly endorsed the reasoning of the Tribunal in the
Award and stated that an interim decision may indeed be subject to reconsideration in

"exceptional and very limited circumstances".!°

With regard to efficiency issues, SCB HK points out that Professor Reinisch fails to
address the fact that following his opinion requires tribunals and parties to go through the
remainder of a case to obtain a final, flawed award even though the process would be
tainted. In SCB HK's view, this would not only lead to an inordinate waste of time and
costs, but also damage the credibility of the ICSID system as a whole if the parties and
tribunal are required to continue with proceedings, in the face of compelling evidence

that a decision is improper and should be reversed. !°

Finally, SCB HK refers to ICSID tribunals' inherent power to take measures to preserve
the integrity of their proceedings, which was recognised, for example, by the tribunals in
Hrvatska Elektroprivreda v. Slovenia and Libananco v. Turkey, and in part finds a textual
foothold in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention. SCB HK argues that the Tribunal's use
of Articles 41 and 44 of the ICSID Convention should be seen in light of this inherent

power that allows tribunals to take measures they consider necessary to protect the
integrity of arbitral proceedings and to safeguard the judicial function, including

reconsidering a prior decision.!°

SCB HK goes on to recall that the Tribunal did find that TANESCO misrepresented the
state of affairs in relation to the 2013 Settlement Agreement and concluded that the facts
that TANESCO failed to disclose were material and would have had an impact on its
Decision.!°° In SCB HK's view, these factual findings should not be overturned by the
Committee.'°’ SCB HK further states that the Tribunal served for five years, read
numerous rounds of pleadings and submissions, and held three substantive oral hearings.
Thus, in SCB HK's view, the questions of whether the December 2013 Letter was
misleading and whether SCB HK was negligent were fully argued before it, both orally
and in writing.'°> SCB HK is of the view that the problem with all of TANESCO's
arguments is that they wilfully ignore the central issue in the case at hand, which is that
the Tribunal found as a matter of fact that TANESCO had deliberately and materially
misled it in relation to a key issue in the proceedings, and that had the Tribunal known
the truth, it would have made a different decision. When it learned of the true facts, the
Tribunal considered it appropriate to reconsider its Decision on Jurisdiction and order

payment to SCB HK.!°?

request!!°, the Parties submitted their views on the interpretation and relevance of ICSID

("Helnan y. Egypt"); Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador (ICSID Case No.
ARB/09/12) ("Pac Rim y. El Salvador").

In summary, TANESCO submits that neither ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2), nor the
rulings in the three cases reviewed in accordance with the Committee's instructions,
undermine its case for annulment in any way, especially regarding the inability of a
tribunal to reconsider a decision in advance of the award being rendered because: (i)
according to TANESCO, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) when properly interpreted does
not apply to reconsideration; (ii) the interplay between ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1)
and 41(2) means in any event that SCB HK waived its right to seek reconsideration due
to its own conscious decision; and (iii) it would be wrong and dangerous for the
Committee to reconstruct the Award through the imposition of ICSID Arbitration Rule

41(2).

In SCB HK's view, Rule 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules does allow a tribunal to
consider on its own initiative, at any stage of the proceedings, its own jurisdiction. SCB
HK submits that tribunals have used this rule as a basis for entertaining late objections to
jurisdiction, including objections that were raised after a tribunal had issued a decision
on jurisdiction. Thus, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) confirms a power of reconsideration
in respect of jurisdictional decisions, and that decisions on jurisdiction in ICSID
arbitration are not res judicata. Moreover, SCB HK argues that ICSID Arbitration Rule
41(2) is another manifestation of a tribunal's inherent power to determine its own

jurisdiction and protect the integrity of the proceedings.!!!
The reasoning of each of the Parties is summarised in more detail as follows:

i) TANESCO's arguments

According to TANESCO, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) allows a tribunal to consider its
jurisdiction on its own initiative but not to reconsider it once a decision has been
rendered. In its view, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) allows a tribunal to proprio motu

consider jurisdictional issues that have not been raised by the parties, or that have not

"1 SCB HK's PHB on Annulment, 46-7.

37

115.

116.

117.

been litigated and decided upon already but does not affect the finality of jurisdictional

decisions already rendered.!!”

In support of this position, TANESCO submits that, save for Pac Rim v. El Salvador,
none of the tribunals that have dealt with the issue of whether they had a right to
reconsider a previous decision on jurisdiction have ever referred to ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(2).!'? TANESCO draws particular attention to ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela and
the fact that Professor Abi-Saab did not seek to rely on ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) in
his dissenting opinion in favour of reconsideration.''* TANESCO also relies on Professor
Bucher's statement that "[i]t can hardly be disputed that there does not exist any provision
in the Convention or in the Arbitration Rules providing for [the reconsideration of pre-
award decisions on jurisdiction]"!'> and his related comment that "[w]hile the wording
[of Rule 41(2)] would permit to raise a jurisdictional matter whatever decisions have

already been made, this is not the prevailing understanding of the purpose of the rule”.!!©

Additionally, in TANESCO’s view, neither the tribunal in CSOB v. Slovak Republic nor
in Helnan v. Egypt were concerned with a request to reconsider an existing decision but
instead had to consider an entirely new objection to their jurisdiction — which, according

to TANESCO is not analogous to the matters in the present case.!!7

TANESCO explains that, despite the fact that the Pac Rim v. El Salvador award does
address the ability of a tribunal to reconsider a previously rendered decision on
jurisdiction through the application of Rule 41(2), this was not what the tribunal in that
case was asked to do.''® TANESCO further states that while the request was described

as being for "reconsideration", the respondent in that case subsequently framed its

objection as a request that the tribunal: "...issue a new decision based on new

submissions, rather than revise what it had decided previously".!!°

118. Additionally, TANESCO argues that even though the Pac Rim tribunal decided to
entertain the respondent's additional objections to its jurisdiction on the basis of Article
41(1) and Rule 41(2) notwithstanding its previous decision on the matter, it also explicitly
recognised that "...[i]t would be detrimental to the effectiveness of ICSID arbitration and
to the proper administration of ICSID arbitrations if significant decisions could be subject
to change at any point prior to the award, upon request of an aggrieved party".'?° Further,
according to TANESCO, the Tribunal found that "imparting a degree of finality to
decisions on jurisdiction would have significant benefits".!2! Thus, TANESCO stresses,
first, that even if the Pac Rim tribunal decided to depart from this approach, it was simply
on the basis of the facts of that case and it did not make a general statement as to decisions
not having res judicata effect or not being binding upon the parties to the proceedings. !7?
Second, that the Pac Rim tribunal merely considered the issue under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(2), as with the other objections that it had determined failed to comply with
ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), choosing not to investigate further whether that new
objection could have been addressed by reference to Rule 41(1) only.'?> According to
TANESCO, the decision of the Pac Rim tribunal to assess whether it ought to reconsider
its decision as a matter of Rule 41(2) is the first and only award to determine that the said
rule operates in this manner. However, TANESCO argues that this decision is an outlier

and ought not to be relied upon as authority for the use of Rule 41(2) in this manner.!”4

119. Finally, TANESCO submits that the Pac Rim award makes extensive reference to the
importance of raising jurisdictional objections as early as possible in compliance with
ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), and that this supports TANESCO's submissions in respect
of SCB HK's failure to comply with the aforementioned rule. Additionally, TANESCO

claims that, although the tribunal in that case on its own initiative addressed some of the
objections that would have been considered waived, the tribunal's reasoning in Pac Rim
has no application in the present Annulment Proceeding, since, according to TANESCO,

SCB HK has waived its rights to raise its objection.'?>

In this context, TANESCO submits that even if the Committee considers that it is possible
to apply ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) to the reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision
on Jurisdiction, the timing and circumstances of when it can be applied must be
addressed. Therefore, an analysis of the interplay between Arbitration Rules 41(1) and

41(2), viewed in the context of Article 41, is required. !76

Accordingly, TANESCO explains that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) encourages parties
to raise any jurisdictional objections as soon as possible, while ICSID Arbitration Rule
41(2) empowers tribunals to address jurisdictional issues on their own initiative to hedge
against the risk of rendering unenforceable awards due to the parties' mistakes and
omissions regarding jurisdictional objections. According to TANESCO, this creates a
certain tension between ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), which entails the possibility of
waiving jurisdictional objections by not raising them as soon as possible; and ICSID
Arbitration Rule 41(2), which allows tribunals to consider jurisdictional objections that

might otherwise have been waived.!’

TANESCO notes that tribunals have often faced the question of alleged waiver under
ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 when deciding on belated jurisdictional objections, and admits
that approaches have varied.!** It explains that while certain tribunals have relied
expressly upon the authority granted to them as a matter of Rule 41(2) to overcome the

failure of a party to comply with Rule 41(1),'?° others have determined that a belated

jurisdictional objection was out of time and therefore waived, regardless of a plea under

Rule 41(2).!3°

Additionally, TANESCO argues that SCB HK has admitted that it failed to raise the new
facts as soon as possible, and that it, instead, waited almost a year to bring them to the
attention of the Tribunal; thus, TANESCO argues SCB HK waived the right to make the

jurisdictional objection at a later stage in the Arbitration Proceeding.!*!

TANESCO asserts that an ICSID tribunal's inherent powers, the concept of which takes
root in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, extend only to matters of procedure, not to
substantive issues such as reconsideration of a decision on jurisdiction. !?? According to
TANESCO, the tribunal in Siag v. Egypt considered both the concept of a tribunal's
inherent power to protect the integrity of proceedings, and a plea under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(2) in the context of a late jurisdictional objection but did not link the two.
TANESCO submits that if the Siag v. Egypt tribunal had considered that a tribunal's
inherent powers extended beyond procedural matters, and that ICSID Arbitration Rule
41(2) constituted an element of such inherent powers, it would expressly have said so,

which it did not.!33

In addition, TANESCO points out that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) was first raised by
the Committee in its question to Professor Reinisch at the Hearing, but had not been
raised by SCB HK in any of its submissions before, nor referenced by the Tribunal in its
Award.'*# It thus submits that references by the Committee to ICSID Arbitration Rule
41(2) would amount to reconstructing the Tribunal's reasoning in the Award using
implicit reasons, which, according to TANESCO, would be wrong for the following

reasons.!°

128.

129.

First, TANESCO recalls that the Tribunal clearly stated that "[...] there is nothing in
either the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules dealing explicitly with the question
of reconsideration of a decision", and that its decision on the issue of reconsideration
"should be guided by, although not bound by, the limitations on reopening that apply to
awards [i.e. Article 51]". This shows that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) was far from the

Tribunal's mind and should not be read into its analysis. !*°

Second, TANESCO further distinguishes the present case from previous ad hoc
committee decisions which did reconstruct a tribunal's reasoning otherwise missing on
the face of an award on the basis of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and its
interpretation in Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No.
ARB/98/4, (“Wena Hotels v. Egypt”).'>’ Therein, the committee determined that a
tribunal's reasons can be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in an
award, as long as they could be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.
However, TANESCO considers that the decisions it references as adopting this approach
dealt with awards where the respective tribunals perhaps only omitted to take an extra
step to spell out specific reasoning for particular determinations, whereas in the present
case, the Committee is concerned with a substantive right that the Tribunal "grant[ed]

itself unilaterally" .!°*

Third, TANESCO adds that the Committee should follow the jurisprudence constante of
previous investment tribunals, which, like the Tribunal, held that the ICSID Convention
and ICSID Arbitration Rules do not provide for an explicit power to reconsider a

decision.!°

Finally, TANESCO argues that allowing the Award to stand on the basis of repurposing
ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) would set a dangerous precedent emboldening aggrieved
parties to seek reconsideration of decisions that went against them before the rendering

of a final award. In its view, applying ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) to the reconsideration

of jurisdictional decisions would put a new guerrilla tactic at the parties’ disposal that
would stifle the ICSID system as a whole and go against procedural efficiency. In
particular, it would deprive the bifurcation system of much of its benefit, and it would
mostly neuter Article 51 of the ICSID Convention by making it easier for parties to seek
reconsideration during the proceedings under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) than to wait
until the close of proceedings to ask for reconsideration on the basis of Article 51 of the

ICSID Convention.'“°

ii) SCB HK's arguments

SCB HK argues that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) provides tribunals with broad powers
to review whether certain claims are within their jurisdiction during the course of the
arbitration. It submits that under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2), a tribunal may review its
jurisdiction of its own volition, without the need for an objection to have been raised by
a party in a timely manner or at all; and, most importantly, a tribunal may review its
jurisdiction "at any stage of the proceeding".'*! Additionally, SCB HK states that
Arbitration Rule 38(2) permits the tribunal to reopen proceedings before an award has
been rendered, and argues that this suggests that there is no blanket prohibition on

reconsidering decisions before an award, under exceptional circumstances. 4?

In SCB HK's view, this interpretation of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) is consistent with
the fact that a preliminary decision on jurisdiction is expressly contemplated in Article
41(2) of the ICSID Convention, but pursuant to Articles 48(3) and 53(1) of the ICSID
Convention only becomes "final and binding" once it is incorporated into an award.'* It
affirms that nothing in the ICSID Convention ascribes res judicata status to jurisdictional
decisions such that they cannot be revisited unless incorporated into a final award.'#
SCB HK submits that interlocutory decisions are not awards and they do not have res
judicata effect. They will normally be binding in the course of proceedings on both the

tribunal and parties, but there are certain circumstances where a tribunal may reopen its

decision. According to SCB HK, this reasoning of the Tribunal is consistent with the
reasoning of the Pac Rim v. El Salvador tribunal, which held that interlocutory ICSID
decisions do not have res judicata effect, and while they are binding within the scope of
the proceedings, they may be reopened under certain circumstances (for example where

the tribunal has been deliberately misled).'*5

SCB HK argues that tribunals retain the discretion to examine their own jurisdiction,
even if the parties’ objections are not timely.'#° It states that the tribunals in Helnan v.
Egypt and Pac Rim v. El Salvador found that the respondents' additional objections to
jurisdiction were not raised in a timely manner under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), but
nevertheless examined those objections on their own initiative under ICSID Arbitration

Rule 41(2) even though they had already issued a decision on jurisdiction.'*”

SCB HK agrees that in addressing the further objections raised to its jurisdiction, in a
second decision, the CSOB v. Slovak Republic tribunal did not expressly rely on a specific
tule to give it the power to revisit its jurisdiction. It simply addressed the new
jurisdictional issues presented to it, indicating that it considered it had a self-evident
power to do so. While the CSOB v. Slovak Republic tribunal found that it did not have
jurisdiction over the new claims, SCB HK claims that the implication of the tribunal's
reasoning is that it would have been open to it to find that it had jurisdiction over the new
claims. For SCB HK it follows that the CSOB v. Slovak Republic decision shows that a

tribunal has the power to re-examine its own jurisdiction in light of new submissions. '4*

Similarly, SCB HK points out that the tribunal in Helnan v. Egypt did not treat its first
decision on jurisdiction as having res judicata effect and engaged with the substance of
Egypt's additional objection to jurisdiction, thus also supporting its submission that
jurisdictional decisions can be subject to reconsideration before a final award is

rendered.'*?

Moreover, SCB HK argues that although the tribunal in Pac Rim v. El Salvador stated
that it would not engage in the debate raised by ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela as to
whether ICSID interlocutory decisions are res judicata in nature, the tribunal's reasoning

confirms that interlocutory decisions can be subject to reconsideration. !*°

SCB HK explains that the Pac Rim tribunal found that it had the power to examine, on
its own initiative, the objections to jurisdiction raised by El Salvador after the tribunal
had already issued a decision affirming jurisdiction over the dispute and based this power

on ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2).!>!

According to SCB HK, the Pac Rim tribunal did not treat its previous decision affirming
jurisdiction as having res judicata effect and engaged with the substance of El Salvador's
additional objections to jurisdiction. The tribunal examined the new objections raised by
El Salvador which were based both on new facts which had come to light, as well as

objections that were not based on new facts. !*?

Thus, SCB HK argues that while not expressly stated, the Pac Rim tribunal applied the
same reasoning as the tribunals in CSOB v. Slovak Republic and Helnan v. Egypt, which
it gave as examples of cases where tribunals faced with additional objections to their
jurisdiction had examined the later objections but did not consider that their earlier

decisions on jurisdiction had res judicata effect.!*?

SCB HK further submits that Pac Rim v. El Salvador specifically recognises a broad
power of reconsideration in circumstances where a party has improperly procured a
decision. It emphasises that it was "particularly the case" that interlocutory decisions on
jurisdiction would not have res judicata or final effect "where a party is guilty of material
fraud, perjury, or other improper means used to procure the impugned earlier decision

from an international tribunal".!*4

SCB HK goes on to address the following factual allegations by TANESCO as to SCB
HK's knowledge in respect of the 2013 Agreement and the emptying of the Escrow

Account in the context of its alleged waiver of its right to seek reconsideration. '!*>

According to SCB HK, TANESCO alleges that: (i) SCB HK knew the true terms of the
2013 Settlement Agreement and of the emptying of the Escrow Account in November
2013, and yet deliberately delayed drawing the true position to the Tribunal's attention
for almost a year;!*° (ii) SCB HK admitted that it failed to draw the Tribunal's attention
to the true position as soon as possible;!*’and (iii) SCB HK's alleged delay in disclosing
the true position to the Tribunal amounts to a waiver of SCB HK's right to rely on the

true facts, !8

In turn, SCB HK refutes these allegations by pointing out:

First, that the Tribunal made the factual finding in its Award that SCB HK did not have
knowledge of the true position relating to the 2013 Settlement Agreement and of the
emptying of the Escrow Account. It found that it was "inconceivable" that SCB HK
would not have capitalised on the true position regarding the 2013 Settlement Agreement

had SCB HK known about it.!°°

Second, that SCB HK has consistently explained that it did not have such knowledge and
has not admitted that it failed to raise the new facts as soon as possible. What it did was
to state that in hindsight it should perhaps have pushed for document production, not that
it was aware of the true position regarding the 2013 Settlement Agreement or the
emptying of the Escrow Account. There was no suggestion that SCB HK had withheld

its knowledge of the true position from the Tribunal.!°

Additionally, SCB HK states that, in any event, there is no evidence that SCB HK had

such knowledge or engaged in such a strategy.'°!

Third, SCB HK argues that it did not waive its right to rely on the true facts, including
by negligence. According to SCB HK, the Tribunal had considered TANESCO's
argument that if SCB HK had been unaware of the true position regarding the 2013
Agreement and the emptying of the Escrow Account, such ignorance was due to SCB
HK's negligence because it should have pushed for disclosure and rejected it in its Award:
the Tribunal held that in light of TANESCO's deliberately misleading conduct, SCB HK

had not been obliged to push for disclosure and SCB HK was not negligent.'?

SCB HK recalls that in the Award the Tribunal reconsidered its decision on jurisdiction
on the basis that it had been deliberately misled by one of the parties in relation to a
material fact. More specifically, the Tribunal found that it had the power to reconsider an
interlocutory decision in specific limited circumstances, based on Articles 41(1) and 44
of the ICSID Convention.'® In SCB HK's view, this was an example of a tribunal
exercising its inherent power to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings, and was

justified by the facts of the case.'*

Finally, according to SCB HK, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) is an aspect of the inherent
power of a tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction and to protect the integrity of the
proceedings.'® However, it is not the only pathway available to reopen a decision and
the Tribunal was justified in finding that it could reopen an interlocutory decision on

jurisdiction by reference to Articles 41 and 44 of the ICSID Convention.'

SCB HK submits that the Tribunal's motivation to protect the integrity of the arbitral
process is clear in its Award, and in particular its findings that (i) a power to reopen in
certain limited circumstances would have the practical advantage of avoiding having the
Tribunal decide issues on the merits on the basis of a decision which has been seriously

called into question; and (ii) the Tribunal would be justified in exercising a power to
reopen if it could be shown that it reached its decision without knowledge of material
facts which had been deliberately withheld by one of the parties, and that with the

knowledge of those facts the Tribunal might have reached a different decision.!°

V.E The Committee's Conclusions on Reconsideration of the Decision on

Jurisdiction

The Committee concurs with the Tribunal's reasoning that neither the ICSID Convention
nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules explicitly allow or disallow reconsideration of
jurisdictional decisions. Consequently, it is necessary to analyse whether the existing
provisions of the Convention and the Arbitration Rules provide tribunals with the power

to reopen prior decisions before issuing a final award.

The Committee equally follows the Tribunal's reasoning that not every decision rendered
by a tribunal has a res judicata effect. Procedural orders and provisional measures for
example are subject to being revised even though neither the ICSID Convention nor the
ICSID Arbitration Rules expressly provide for this. Tribunals derive this power from
provisions such as Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which allows them to decide "any
question of procedure" that is not covered in the ICSID Convention or the ICSID

Arbitration Rules or agreed by the parties.

However, the tribunal in ConocoPhilips held that Article 44 "cannot be seen as conferring
a broad unexpressed power of substantive decision".!®° The Tribunal explained that the
power to reopen a decision under Article 44 involved both a procedural right to bring a
request for reconsideration and the substantive question of what is to be done with such
request. In this respect, the Tribunal held that the specific reference in Article 44 to "any
question of procedure" does not limit a tribunal's broader power under Article 41 to
determine its own competence.'® The Committee agrees with the Tribunal's reasoning

on these points and concludes that it assessed its jurisdiction not only taking into account

‘61 SCB HK's PHB on Annulment, [47 and 50, footnotes 63 and 64, referring to SCB HK's Rejoinder on
Annulment, {84-87 and 90.

Article 44 but also Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, which, in the view of the
Committee, conferred on the Tribunal the power to reconsider its previous Decision in

light of the principle of Kompetenz-Kompetenz.

The Committee finds that the clear wording of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2), allowing a
tribunal to consider jurisdictional objections "at any stage of the proceedings", i.e.
including after having already rendered an interlocutory decision on jurisdiction, implies

that such earlier findings on jurisdiction are subject to reconsideration.

TANESCO cites Professor Bucher's dissenting opinion in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela,
in which he states that while the wording of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) would permit
a party to raise a jurisdictional matter irrespective of decisions already made, this is not
the prevailing understanding of the purpose of the rule. TANESCO focuses on the latter
part of Professor Bucher's statement but ignores his acknowledgement that Rule 41(2)

does allow for the reconsideration of jurisdictional decisions.

"This seems also implicit in Arbitration Rule 41(2), authorizing the
[t]ribunal to raise a jurisdictional issue 'on its own initiative’, and this ‘at
any stage of the proceedings'. While the wording would permit to rise a
jurisdictional matter whatever decisions have already been made, this is
not the prevailing understanding of the purpose of the rule. [emphasis and

text in brackets added by the Committee]".!”

This observation is confirmed by the decision of the tribunal in Pac Rim v. El Salvador,
which explicitly found that it had the power under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) to
reconsider its decision on jurisdiction before it had rendered a final award. In this case,

the tribunal stated that:

' TANESCO's PHB on Annulment, 12, footnote 10, referring to Annex-105, ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela,

"At the same time, the [t]ribunal is also aware of its mandate under Article
41(1) of the ICSID Convention and of its power under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(2) to consider, 'at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute
or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and
within its own competence’. With this in mind, the [t]ribunal has the power
to examine, upon its own initiative at any time, any jurisdictional question
it considers pertinent, even if it entails a matter that was raised belatedly
by a party or not raised by a party at all... [text in brackets added by the

Committee]".!7!

TANESCO argues that the Committee raising for the first time the potential authority of
a tribunal to reconsider an award under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2), which was not
referenced in the Award, amounts to the Committee reconstructing the Tribunal's

reasoning using implicit reasons.

As referenced by TANESCO, the Wena Hotels annulment committee interpreted Article
52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention to mean that annulment committees can reconstruct a
tribunal's reasoning that is otherwise missing on the face of an award, as long as those
reasons are implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in that award and
can be reasonably inferred from the terms used. This has been followed by other ad hoc

committees, !”

The Committee sees no reason why it should not adopt this approach in the present case.
The Committee considers it obvious that reliance on ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) is
implied in the Tribunal's reasoning. The Tribunal explicitly relied on Article 41(1) of the
ICSID Convention stating that "[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence".
Both ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1) and 41(2) are simply more detailed articulations of

the Kompetenz-Kompetenz power, enshrined in Article 41 of the ICSID Convention.

Further, it is TANESCO's submission that both ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1) and 41(2)

"should be viewed in the context of Article 41 [of the ICSID Convention]".!”

The Committee therefore agrees that the Tribunal correctly identified its power to judge
its own competence including the power to reconsider prior jurisdictional decisions, as
provided by Articles 41(1) and 44 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules
41(1) and 41(2).

Additionally, SCB HK claims that under Arbitration Rule 38(2), there is no blanket
prohibition on reconsidering decisions before an award, and that it may occur in

exceptional circumstances. !”4 The Committee agrees with this position.

In this respect, the Committee notes that in determining under which circumstances
reconsideration of a prior jurisdictional decision would be justified, the Tribunal
proposed that"... a tribunal should be guided by, although not bound by, the limitations

on reopening that apply to awards" under Article 51 of the ISCID Convention.!7>

Under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention, revision is justified: (1) on the ground of
discovery of some fact (2) of such a nature as decisively to affect the award; (3) provided
that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the
applicant; and (4) that the applicant’s ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.
Pursuant to Article 51(2) of the ICSID Convention, the application shall be made within

90 days after the discovery of fact.

TANESCO argues that the Tribunal's reliance on Article 51 of the ICSID Convention
was improper insofar as it only applies to the revision of awards but not to reconsideration
of interlocutory decisions. Further, TANESCO contends that even if reliance on Article
51 of the ICSID Convention were justified, the Tribunal failed to ensure the five

conditions of that provision were satisfied in the present case.

164.

166.

167.

The Committee disagrees. As mentioned above in paragraph 161, the Tribunal did not
"apply" Article 51 of the ICSID Convention but simply turned to it seeking guidance on
the nature of a discovery that would justify reconsideration of the Decision on
Jurisdiction. In the Committee's view, this reliance on Article 51 of the ICSID
Convention by analogy did not require the Tribunal to follow that provision to the letter.
The Tribunal's reliance on Article 51 of the ICSID Convention was inspired by its desire
to make sure that the circumstances before it reached the threshold required to justify the

exceptional remedy of reopening an interlocutory decision — which it did.'”°

The Tribunal allocated several pages of its Award to its analysis of whether: (i) the facts
alleged by SCB HK were of such a nature as to decisively affect the award; (ii) these
facts had previously been unknown to the Tribunal and to SCB HK; and (iii) SCB HK’s
ignorance of these facts was due to negligence. It found that TANESCO's failure to
disclose the 2013 Settlement Agreement and the emptying of the Escrow Account were
deliberate; that there was no proof that SCB HK had been aware of these facts; and that

this lack of knowledge had not been the result of negligence.!””

It is not the role of annulment committees to review the factual findings made by
tribunals. Therefore, the Committee refuses to delve into a review of the Tribunal's
factual conclusions but instead relies on the same. Thus, it accepts the Tribunal’s
conclusion that: the Tribunal had reached its Decision on Jurisdiction without knowledge
of material facts which had been deliberately withheld by TANESCO; that with the
knowledge of those facts, the Tribunal would have reached a different decision; and that

SCB HK's ignorance of those facts had not been the result of negligence.

The Committee is not persuaded by TANESCO's related argument that SCB HK waived
its right to seek reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction due to SCB HK's
negligence. The Tribunal found that SCB HK did not have knowledge of the true position
relating to the 2013 Settlement Agreement and the emptying of the Escrow Account and

found it "inconceivable" that SCB HK would not have capitalized on the true position

"76 Annex-1, Award, 1322.

regarding the same, had it known about it. The Tribunal also held that in light of
TANESCO’s deliberately misleading conduct, SCB HK had not been obliged to push for

disclosure, thus SCB HK was not negligent.

The Tribunal's reference to Article 51 of the ICSID Convention to affirm that the facts
before it passed the threshold justifying reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction
is analogous to the analysis conducted by the tribunal in Pac Rim v. El Salvador, which
decided upon its competence under Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention to entertain
the respondent's additional objections to its jurisdiction notwithstanding its previous
decision on jurisdiction. Among other things, the tribunal in Pac Rim v. El Salvador

stated that:

"5.36 [...] Since decisions affirming jurisdiction are limited to the
settlement of jurisdictional questions prior to issues as to the merits, they
do not have the status of an award under the ICSID Convention until their
incorporation into the award that addresses all questions and thus decides

the parties' dispute...

[J

5.38 [...]. The Tribunal is also aware of the debate generated by the
ConocoPhilips [sic] procedural decision and the dissent concerning its res
judicata effect, and that other ICSID and other tribunals faced with
additional objections to their jurisdiction have examined these later
objections without considering that their earlier decision had res judicata
or final effect. The latter is particularly the case where a party is guilty of
material fraud, perjury or other improper means used to procure the

impugned earlier decision from an international tribunal.

be]

5.49 The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Respondent has failed to
fulfil the 'as early as possible’ requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1)

53

in regard to its additional jurisdictional objections to the Claimant's

pleaded claims [...]

5.50 At the same time, the Tribunal is also aware of its mandate under
Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention and of its power under ICSID
Arbitration Rule 41(2) to consider, 'at any stage of the proceeding, whether
the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the
Centre and within its own competence’. With this in mind, the Tribunal has
the power to examine, upon its own initiative at any time, any jurisdictional
question it considers pertinent, even if it entails a matter that was raised

belatedly by a party or not raised by any party at all [...]

5.51 Finally, as to the request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's
Jurisdiction Decision regarding the Respondent's objection based upon
alleged abuse of process and misrepresentation by the Claimant, the
Tribunal observes that this request is based on new information arguably
first made available by the Claimant [...] the Tribunal considers that it may
have been raised timeously, ‘as early as possible’ in accordance with ICSID
Arbitration Rule 41(1). However, as with the Respondent's other
objections, the Tribunal prefers to address also this objection upon its own

initiative under ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1) and (2)".!78

169. In the Committee's view, both the Tribunal in the present case and the tribunal in Pac
Rim v. El Salvador, despite not having made a declaration as to the res judicata principle,
concluded that a tribunal has broad powers to reconsider an earlier decision and to correct
it, rather than relying on an improperly based decision on jurisdiction that would likely

affect the final award.

170. In the view of the Committee, this conclusion is also in line with Professor Abi-Saab's

dissenting opinion in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, where he stated that:

"8 Anmex-114, Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. The Republic of El Salvador, Award, October 14, 2016, 15.36, 5.38,
5.49, 5.50 and 5.51.

54

"36. However, the fact that a Tribunal reaches conclusions, makes findings
or takes decisions does not mean that they are or make them, by any logical
or legal necessity, ‘final’ or ‘binding’, particularly on the Tribunal itself (if

it becomes aware for example that it has committed an error).

51. All the same, I dare presume, with all due respect to the eminent
members of that Tribunal, that if they become aware, before the final
award, that they have made a crucial error of fact or of law that led them
astray in their findings, or of new evidence or changing circumstances to

the same effect, they may not hesitate to revisit their decisions..."!””

171. Moreover, it seems to be implied by the tribunal in Perenco v. Ecuador, which stated:

"82. That said, the Tribunal can see how Professor Abi-Saab could form
his view that it was necessary for that tribunal to revisit a prior factual
finding. His dissenting opinion was predicated upon Venezuela's
submission of new evidence that was not available to the tribunal when it
rendered its earlier merits decision and which he considered to be of great
decisiveness on a particular issue going to the question of whether or not
the respondent had breached its obligation to negotiate compensation for

an expropriation in good faith.

85. He argued both for a general power of reconsideration and further, that
if he was wrong on that point, for a specific power of reconsideration 'based

on a particular or certain particular legal grounds': [...]

86. The present Tribunal takes a different view as to the existence of a

general power of reconsideration as well as on Arbitration Rule 38(2). But

in any case, the type of situation which so concerned Professor Abi-Saab

is simply not present in the present case".'®?

TANESCO argues that allowing reconsideration of jurisdictional decisions would
embolden aggrieved parties to seek reconsideration of decisions that went against them
before the rendering of a final award, and thus put a new guerrilla tactic at their disposal,
which would endanger procedural efficiency and deprive the bifurcation system of its
benefits. The Committee agrees that caution is required when offering an opportunity to
aggrieved parties to seek reconsideration of any interlocutory decisions they disagree
with before the rendering of a final award. As TANESCO rightly points out, a generalised
practice of challenging decisions on jurisdiction before the issuing of the award on the
merits would impair the efficiency of the arbitral process. However, the Committee is of
the view that in consideration of the relevant facts which came to light after the Decision
on Jurisdiction was issued, procedural efficiency was safeguarded by allowing the
Tribunal to reconsider its Decision, rather than basing its further findings on a decision

it knew to be erroneous.

In summary, the Committee considers that the Decision on Jurisdiction was subject to
reconsideration under the exceptional circumstance where the Tribunal was deliberately
misled as to facts, the knowledge of which the Tribunal would have reached a different
decision. In the Committee's view, the Award correctly allowed reconsideration of the
Decision on Jurisdiction and this action was most apt to safeguard both the efficiency

and integrity of the Arbitration Proceeding.

VI. ‘The grounds for annulment

VLA Introduction

In this case, TANESCO raises several arguments with respect to: (i) the Tribunal's
findings regarding its jurisdiction; (ii) the applicable law to determine whether SCB HK
had standing in the Arbitration Proceeding; (iii) the Tribunal's power to reconsider the

Decision on Jurisdiction; and (iv) the reasons given by the Tribunal supporting its ruling.

178.

Therefore, TANESCO relies on three of the five grounds for annulment provided for in
the ICSID Convention, Article 52(1), namely: a) manifest excess of power, b) serious

departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and c) failure to state reasons.

In the following sections, the Committee will address individually the different grounds
for annulment TANESCO raises and the corresponding arguments of each of the Parties.
In order to do so and bearing in mind that the reconsideration issue has been dealt with
previously, the Committee divides its analysis into the following sections: (VI.B)
manifest excess of powers, (VI.C) serious departure from a fundamental rule of

procedure, and (VID) failure to state reasons.
VIB Manifest excess of power (Article 52(1)(b))
1) The standard of "manifest excess of power"

i) TANESCO's arguments

TANESCO argues that for the Committee to determine that the Tribunal has manifestly
exceeded its power, the Committee must conclude that there was both an "excess" of
powers, and that this excess was "manifest" in nature. In this respect, it argues that ICSID
jurisprudence demonstrates that a "manifest" excess of powers is an excess which "is

obvious, self-evident and clear on the face of the Award".'8!

In this respect, TANESCO states that it is widely accepted that "manifest excess of
powers" within the Convention refers to cases where a tribunal has gone beyond the scope
of the parties’ agreement or compromise or has decided points which were not submitted

or which were not properly submitted.!**

TANESCO explains that ICSID jurisprudence establishes that a manifest excess of

or misinterprets the applicable law.'*#

ii) SCB HK's arguments

179. SCB HK states that only if a tribunal commits a manifest excess of power, whether on a
matter related to jurisdiction or the merits, is there a basis for annulment. In this respect,
it argues that the requirement that an excess of power must be "manifest" applies equally

if the question is one of jurisdiction.!*

180. According to SCB HK, numerous ad hoc committees have accepted that the requirement
of a "manifest" excess of powers will only be satisfied if "it is obvious, without deeper
analysis, that a tribunal lacked or exceeded jurisdiction, but that if 'reasonable minds'
might differ as to whether or not the tribunal has jurisdiction, that issue falls to be

resolved definitively by the tribunal in exercise of its power under Article 41 before the

award is given".!8°

Cameroon, 94; Regarding its argument against a third-party's standing, TANESCO quotes Annex-59,
Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador, as follows: "[a] natural consequence of international investment law" and
"protected investors cannot transfer beneficial ownership and control in a protected investment to an
unprotected third party, and expect that the arbitral tribunal retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between
the third party and the host State. To hold the contrary, would open the floodgates to an uncontrolled expansion
of jurisdiction rationae personae, beyond the limits agreed by the States when executing the treaty".

181. In light of the express wording of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and the Parties'
arguments,'*’ the Committee is convinced that Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention
provides a two-fold requirement to annul an award, namely, the Tribunal has: (i)
exceeded its powers; and (ii) the excess is "manifest". The excess is "manifest" in nature
if it is obvious, clear, self-evident, and discernible without the need for an elaborate
analysis of the award.'** This interpretation of the "manifest" nature of the excess of
powers is also consistent with rulings of several ad hoc committees.'*? In addition, some

ad hoc committees have interpreted the meaning of "manifest" to require that the excess

be serious or material to the outcome of the case.!°°

182. Particularly, ad hoc committees have identified two methodologies, which this
Committee will be guided by, to determine whether an award can be annulled under
Article 52(1)(b). The first is a two-step analysis determining whether there was an excess
of powers and, if so, whether the excess was "manifest".!°! The second is a prima facie

test, consisting of a summary examination to determine whether any of the alleged

excesses of power could be viewed as "manifest".!°?

183. The Committee agrees with SCB HK's position that numerous ad hoc committees have
accepted that the "manifest" requirement will not be satisfied if "reasonable minds" differ

as to whether or not the tribunal issued a correct decision. !>

184. In the Committee's view, it is clear that the drafters of the ICSID Convention anticipated
an excess of powers, for example, in cases where a tribunal: (i) went beyond the scope
of the parties’ arbitration agreement; (ii) decided points that had not been submitted to it;
or (iii) failed to apply the law agreed to by the parties. Thus, the main powers of a tribunal
that appear to have been contemplated by this provision relate to a tribunal's jurisdiction

and to the applicable law.!*+

185. Inthe present case, TANESCO argues that the Tribunal exceeded its powers with respect
to these specific actions: the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction in the absence of a
qualifying investment (section 2); the Tribunal's failure to apply the proper law under the
relevant contract, as mandated by Article 42(1) of ICSID Convention (section 3); the
Tribunal's reconsideration of its Decision on Jurisdiction (section 4); and the Tribunal
improperly assuming jurisdiction over SCB HK and IPTL under the Facility Agreement

(section 5).

186. In the following paragraphs the Committee will address the Parties' arguments regarding
each of these matters. The Parties' arguments regarding the reconsideration will be dealt

with succinctly as it has already been addressed as a preliminary matter.

whether the Tribunal i errors in the ii of the i of i law or in the
ascertainment or evaluation of the relevant facts to which such law has been applied. Such scrutiny is properly
the task of a court of appeals, which the ad hoc Committee is not.'"; see also TANESCO's Memorial on

2) The existence of a manifest excess of power of the Tribunal by wrongly

exercising jurisdiction even though SCB HK made no "investment" under

Article 25 (1) of the Convention.

i) TANESCO's arguments

187. TANESCO recalls that the absence of a qualifying investment is a circumstance which
may give rise to annulment based on the grounds of manifest excess of powers and failure

to state reasons, as confirmed by Mitchell v. DRC.'

188. In this respect, TANESCO asserts that the Tribunal incorrectly found that SCB HK had
a qualifying investment under the Convention,!*° since SCB HK's purported acquisition
in 2005 of the loan granted to IPTL by a consortium of Malaysian banks under the 1997
Loan Facility Agreement (the "Facility Agreement") lacks the characteristics of an
investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.!*” In this respect, TANESCO
argues that whilst the ICSID Convention does not provide a definition of an "investment",
this does not create a "free-for-all" in which the parties have the absolute freedom to

determine what does. TANESCO refers to ICSID jurisprudence to interpret this term.!°*

189. TANESCO submits that ICSID jurisprudence is clear on two matters. First, that the
"concept of an investment [...] is objective in nature" and must be determined by a
tribunal.!? Second, that a loan is not an investment as envisaged by Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention or the Salini test.” In support of this, TANESCO refers to MNSS B.V

v. Montenegro, in which it was confirmed that a loan in itself is not an investment, since

ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, July 31, 2001 ("Salini v. Morocco"), (52-57, According to TANESCO, the Salini
Test sets out four cumulative requirements, which must all be met in order to conclude that an ICSID tribunal
has jurisdiction; these requirements are: (i) the investor participated in the risks of the transaction; (ii) there was
a substantial contribution by the investor of money or assets; (iii) there is a certain minimum duration; and (iv)
there is a significant contribution to host state's economic development.

it did not contribute to the economic development of a State -- the final requirement of

the cumulative criteria established by the Salini Test.?°!

190. In this case, TANESCO submits that the purchase of the distressed debt did nothing to
further the economic development of Tanzania, since SCB HK only acquired the
distressed debt long after the facility was contracted for, financed and built and there was
no expectation of receiving an economic return going beyond the mere repayment of the
loan with interest.?°? In TANESCO's view, SCB HK's purchase of the loan was only a
commercial transaction made for its own financial benefit.?°

191. Regarding jurisdiction, TANESCO argues that the Tribunal had a positive obligation to
assess its jurisdiction from all relevant angles, regardless of the Parties' submissions on
the issue as to whether there was a valid investment.”** TANESCO claims to have raised
this point during the Arbitration Proceeding and that the Tribunal, even when it correctly
acknowledged its duty to "examine its jurisdiction in light of Article 25", failed entirely
to engage with this crucial question. Further, TANESCO asserts that the Tribunal failed
to carry out an adequate test, disposing of the issue in a two-sentence paragraph of its
Decision on Jurisdiction, in a cursory and insufficient way, providing inadequate
reasons.”°°> TANESCO argues that, had the Tribunal performed a proper examination, it
would have concluded that there was no such qualifying investment.?°

SCB HK. Instead, it merely made submissions on this matter on the mistaken basis that
TANESCO has not argued this point previously and as a consequence is estopped from
doing so now.’ TANESCO argues that, contrary to SCB HK's assertions, its objection
to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the basis that Article 25(1) was not satisfied is not
a new argument, since it had questioned the nature of the transaction during the course
of the underlying proceedings.?°* TANESCO asserts that this made it clear that it did not
consider that SCB HK had a qualifying investment, and that it reserved its rights

concerning the Tribunal's jurisdiction.?°

193. In support of its argument, TANESCO refers to the case Standard Chartered Bank v.
United Republic of Tanzania, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12, in which, according to
TANESCO, the tribunal ruled in favour of GoT and dismissed SCB's claim on the basis
that it lacked jurisdiction since "[p]assive ownership of shares in a company not
controlled by the [applicant] where that company in turn owns the investment is not
sufficient".?!° Accordingly, TANESCO states that there can be no doubt that it raised
inquiries as to the nature of the investment, since its submission made direct reference to

parallel proceedings in which the tribunal, having considered the issue of investment,

refused to assume jurisdiction.7!!

alleges that it made no detailed submissions at that point as to other jurisdictional issues
following the Tribunal's determination but that it reserved the right to do so.?'? Explicitly,

it stated that:

"The conclusions reached in the Decision are later to be incorporated in the
award, and may then, and only then, be subject to review within the limits

Tribunal issues its final award in order to challenge the conclusions

195. In light of all the arguments above, TANESCO submits that: (i) it argued that SCB HK's
purchase of distressed debt did not amount to an investment during the Arbitration
Proceeding; and (ii) the Tribunal should have determined its own jurisdiction regardless
of the Parties' submissions; (iii) the Committee must consider this issue within the context

196. In summary, TANESCO claims that the Tribunal improperly exercised its jurisdiction,
which constitutes a manifest excess of powers justifying annulment under Article

52(1)(b).7!°
ii) SCB HK's arguments

197. SCB HK states that TANESCO is incorrect to argue that any jurisdictional mistake
constitutes a manifest excess of powers,”"” since, as stated in paragraph 179, only if a

tribunal commits a manifest excess of power on a matter related to jurisdiction, is there

a basis for annulment.7!*

198. In this respect, SCB HK opposes TANESCO's assertion that the Tribunal assumed

219

jurisdiction in the absence of an investment by SCB HK,~"’ and asserts that there is no

uncertainty or doubt as to whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction: it clearly had
jurisdiction. It argues that there was no excess of powers and the question of whether an

excess of powers was "manifest" simply does not arise.?7°

199. SCB HK further explains that, even if the Tribunal exceeded its powers by assuming

jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (which it denies), it did not

221

"manifestly" exceed its powers,””! since it is not "clear and obvious".?”? SCB HK further

submits that such a finding would need to be grounded in a deep analysis of the Article

25 jurisprudence in order to explain why the Convention requirements are not satisfied.

In SCB HK's view, this appears to be a clear example of a legal dispute arising from an
investment, and the fact that TANESCO did not raise an objection before the Tribunal

indicates that any lack of jurisdiction under Article 25(1) is neither clear nor obvious.???

jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the basis that Article 25(1) was not satisfied,?”* nor made
any submissions on the "investment" requirement,””> despite TANESCO's counsel being
aware of these matters in the underlying proceeding, they chose not to raise any

objections on this point.

trial,” and that, as such, new arguments or evidence on the merits are irrelevant to the
annulment process and are not admissible.??” In this respect, SCB HK recalls

TANESCO's statement in its Reply on Annulment that it "made clear in the proceedings

that it did not consider that SCB HK had a qualifying investment",?”* and argues that this

that SCB HK addressed the Article 25 requirements in the PPA Arbitration and that the Tribunal, after
considering the issue, found that it possessed jurisdiction under Article 25, and that TANESCO never raised an
objection in respect of Article 25(1), whether in the written pleadings or oral hearings.

 

 

66

202. SCB HK explains that in its Reply on Annulment, TANESCO refers to three
documents?” which TANESCO alleges placed the Article 25(1) point in dispute before
the Tribunal.?*! Nevertheless, SCB HK argues that none of these documents achieve this
because the extracts TANESCO quotes referred to: (i) a different proceeding between the
Government of Tanzania (GoT) and SCB HK's parent company; or (ii) the "reservation
of rights" made by TANESCO in its Submissions on Tariff dated February 13, 2015,
which was too late since it only contested jurisdiction after the Tribunal had already
issued its Decision on Jurisdiction (in which it concluded that Article 25(1) was satisfied)
and only a passing general statement which did not put the Tribunal on notice of an

Article 25(1) objection.?*4

203. In addition, SCB HK argues that TANESCO had commenced ICSID proceedings under
the PPA in 1998 ("ICSID 1")> on the basis that the dispute arose out of an "investment",
and through the ICSID 1 proceeding procured tariff reductions. Thus, it cannot claim

now that there is no jurisdiction under Article 25(1) because disputes about payment

under the PPA did not arise directly out of an investment.?*°

204. Accordingly, SCB HK concludes that for these reasons: (i) TANESCO's argument on the

"investment" requirement under Article 25(2)(b) must be rejected,” (ii) the Tribunal's

230 SCB HK's Rejoinder on Annulment, 129: A paragraph in TANESCO's Counter Memorial dated August 24,

TANESCO's Submi ns on Tariff dated February 13, 2015.

Corporate Authority Argument (not the Article 25(1) ground now run by TANESCO). This passing reference
to grounds of challenge in the BIT Arbitration was just that—a passing reference. The point was not mentioned
again by Tanesco and no objection on the basis of Article 25(1) was made in the remainder of the Counter-

233 TANESCO reserved the right to challenge the award on jurisdiction once rendered, especially with respect

the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Parties and the dispute.

finding that the Article 25(1) requirement was satisfied and thus that it had jurisdiction
was correct, and (iii) that even in the event that TANESCO had raised an objection under

Article 25(1), such objection is unfounded on the merits.?**

SCB HK responds to the substance of TANESCO's Article 25(1) objection in Appendix
2 to its Rejoinder. Therein, it submits that, among other things, there was no requirement
in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention that the national of the Contracting State
bringing the claim must itself be the investor that made the initial investment giving rise
to the dispute, but that the only question for the purposes of the "investment" requirement

is whether there is a legal dispute arising from an investment.?*?

Additionally, SCB HK submits that the Power Plant has continued to contribute to the
development of Tanzania, including after it became the lender. SCB HK explains that
despite the ongoing dispute, in October 2009 the President of Tanzania ordered that the

Power Plant be re-started to address a power crisis in Tanzania.”*°

However, SCB HK argues that, while it has responded to TANESCO's allegations, it
does not accept that the Committee needs to, or indeed should, embark upon a substantive
review of the Tribunal's findings on jurisdiction, as TANESCO has invited it to do. For
SCB HK, Article 52(1)(b) does not provide a mechanism for de novo consideration of,
or an appeal against, a decision of a tribunal under Article 41(1) of the Convention, once
the tribunal has given its final award. Annulment is only a form of review on specified
and limited grounds which take as their premise the record before the tribunal and is not

Bearing in mind the Parties' arguments, the Committee's decision regarding whether the
Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by exercising jurisdiction in light of Article

25(1) of the Convention, is as follows.

There is no doubt for the Committee that the wording of Article 41 of the ICSID
Convention as well as ad hoc committees’ previous decisions recognise the Kompetenz-
Kompetenz principle, by which a tribunal is the judge of its own competence. This means
that a tribunal has the power to decide whether the jurisdictional requirements under
Article 25 of the Convention are met and thus, whether it has jurisdiction to hear the

parties' dispute based on the parties’ arbitration agreement.

In this respect, ad hoc committees have held that when a tribunal: (i) incorrectly

concludes that it has jurisdiction, (ii) rejects jurisdiction when jurisdiction exists,?

or (iii) exceeds the scope of its jurisdiction,”* such determinations amount to an excess

of powers.?45

Consistent with the position of the Parties’4° and following the decision in paragraphs
181-1867” the Committee finds that for such an excess to amount to a ground for
annulment, it has to be "manifest", namely, it has to be obvious, self-evident and

discernible without deeper analysis, that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction.

The Committee is of the view that, as established by the express wording of Article 25(1),
the ICSID Convention prescribes certain mandatory requirements that must be fulfilled
for a tribunal to have jurisdiction. These are: (i) "a legal dispute"; (ii) "arising directly

out of an investment"; (iii) "between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision

or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State)"; (iv) "and a
national of another Contracting State"; (v) "which the parties to the dispute consent in

writing to submit to the Centre”.

In this respect, TANESCO states that the Tribunal had a positive obligation to assess its
jurisdiction regardless of the Parties' submissions but that it failed to engage with this
crucial question and to conduct an adequate test of criteria, disposing of it in a two-
sentence paragraph. The Committee agrees with TANESCO that tribunals have a duty to

analyse their jurisdiction ex officio.74

The Committee turns now to the Decision on Jurisdiction to assess whether the Tribunal,
when deciding upon its jurisdiction, conducted this ex officio analysis of the requirements

of Article 25(1).

In its Decision, the Tribunal correctly acknowledged its duty to examine its jurisdiction
in light of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, regardless of whether the Parties had
raised any objections on this matter and identified four conditions which needed to be

fulfilled. These conditions are as follows.”

First, the Tribunal identified a condition ratione personae, establishing that the dispute
must oppose a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. Here, the
Tribunal concluded that this condition was fulfilled, since: (i) SCB HK was a company
organised under the law of Hong Kong; (ii) China was an ICSID Contracting State; (iii)
TANESCO was an entity wholly owned by Tanzania and designated as an agency of
Tanzania pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; and (iv) Tanzania was an

ICSID Contracting State.?°°

As to the second condition, the Tribunal concluded that the dispute must have been a
legal dispute arising directly out of an investment (condition ratione materiae). The
Tribunal also found this requirement to be satisfied, since "...by virtue of its purchase of

the outstanding debt under the loans to IPTL and the assigning of the rights under the

248 Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention; see also Annex-52, Salini v. Morocco, 152.

relevant agreements, SCB HK has an investment for the purposes of the ICSID

Convention".?*!

The third condition, ratione voluntatis, pursuant to which the Contracting State and the
investor must consent in writing that the dispute be settled through ICSID arbitration,
was considered by the Tribunal to be fulfilled since the arbitration agreement contained

in the PPA concluded between IPTL and TANESCO had been assigned to SCB HK.?*

The last condition, that the ICSID Convention must have been applicable at the relevant
time (ratione temporis), was found by the Tribunal to have been complied with, since the
ICSID Convention was applicable at the initial time of consent, i.e. May 26, 1995, when
the PPA was concluded, and on August 17, 2005, when SCB HK became entitled to

exercise the rights, discretions and remedies under the PPA.23

Additionally, after having analysed its jurisdiction in light of Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention, the Tribunal went on to examine the assignment of the PPA and the impact

of the proceedings before Tanzanian courts on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.”

Thus, despite TANESCO's allegations to the contrary, the Committee concludes that, as
can be seen from the Decision on Jurisdiction, which was later incorporated into the
Award, the Tribunal analysed its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention, pursuant to
Article 25(1). Therein, it took into account the Parties' arguments and the evidence
presented by them during the jurisdictional phase of the Arbitration Proceeding, and
concluded that, by virtue of its purchase of the outstanding debt under the loans to IPTL
and the assigning of the rights under the relevant agreements, SCB HK had an investment

for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.?>>

Applying the requirement that an excess of power must be "manifest", addressed

above,” the Committee does not find the answer to the question of whether the Tribunal

had jurisdiction "obvious", nor does it find that it is a question that can be solved "without
deeper analysis". It is widely accepted that, when "reasonable minds" differ as to whether
a tribunal has jurisdiction, the "manifest" requirement is not fulfilled, and the excess of

powers of the tribunal, even if it exists, does not amount to a ground for annulment.

Consequently, the Committee does not find that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its

power by exercising jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

3) The existence of a manifest excess of power of the Tribunal by failing to apply
the law of Tanzania, being the proper law under the relevant contract, contrary

to its obligation under Article 42(1) of the Convention

The Committee identifies two areas where TANESCO asserts that the Tribunal failed to
apply Tanzanian law: (i) the statutory assignment and the registration requirement; and
(ii) the assignment under the alleged winding up procedure. In the following paragraphs,

the Committee will address the Parties’ arguments regarding these matters.

i) TANESCO's arguments
The validity of the assignment and the registration requirement

As a preliminary matter, TANESCO argues that SCB HK is simply wrong to state that
the validity of the assignment and its lack of effectiveness due to non-registration were
not placed before the Tribunal when it issued the Decision on Jurisdiction.?*’ It explains
that, in the Decision itself, the Tribunal stated that: "[a]ccording to [TANESCO], SCB
HK was wrong when it considered that the assignment of the PPA was an absolute
assignment and need not be registered. [TANESCO] argues that, whilst an absolute
assignment needs no registration, an assignment by way of charge or a security
assignment must be registered under Tanzanian law, which follows English companies

law. [Text in brackets added by the Committee]".?°*

227.

TANESCO argues that in accordance with Article 42(1) of the Convention, "[t]he
Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by
the parties". In this respect, TANESCO states that the PPA contains a provision for the
assignment of IPTL's rights under certain specified conditions, and claims, first, that such
assignment must have been carried out in accordance with the governing law of the PPA,

namely, Tanzanian law;2°?

and second, that the applicability of Tanzanian law to
determine the validity of the assignment was considered by the Tribunal as a common

ground between the Parties.”

With regard to the validity of the assignment, TANESCO submits that the legal
requirements for the registration of a security interest are subject to Tanzanian law and
are a matter of Tanzanian public policy.7°! TANESCO further explains that the source of
the obligation to register a charge under Tanzanian law to ensure its enforceability is
Section 79 ("Section 79") of Tanzania's Companies Ordinance ("Companies

Ordinance"), which establishes that:

"(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this act, every charge created
after the fixed date by a company registered in Tanzania and being a charge
to which this section applies shall, so far as any security on the company's
property or undertaking is conferred thereby, be void against the liquidator
and any creditor of the company, unless the prescribed particulars of the
charge, together with the instrument, if any, by which the charge is created
or evidenced, or a copy thereof verified in the prescribed manner are
delivered to or received by the Registrar for registration in the manner

required by this Act within forty two days after date of its creation

2) This section applies to the following charges —

(e) a charge on book debts of the company;

(f) a floating charge on the undertaking of property of the company..."

228. TANESCO also refers to Sections 96 and 97 of the Companies Act (No. 12 of 2002)
("Companies Act"), which has superseded the Companies Ordinance. Sections 96 and

97 establish that:

"96(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this act, every charge created
by a company registered in Tanzania and being a charge to which this
section applies shall, so far as any security on the company's property or
undertaking is conferred thereby, be void against the liquidator and any
creditor of the company, unless the prescribed particulars of the charge,
together with the instrument, if any, by which the charge is created or
evidenced, or a copy thereof verified in the prescribed manner are
delivered to or received by the Registrar for registration in the manner

required by this part within forty-two days after date of its creation.
97(1) Section 96 applies to the following charges —

tel

(e) a charge on book debts of the company;

(f) a floating charge on the undertaking of property of the company...".7°

229. TANESCO maintains that these legal provisions are clear: a charge on book debts of the
company must be registered with the Tanzanian Registrar of Companies, and considers

that even the Tribunal agreed with this, when it concluded that "...clause 3.2.1 of the

22 TANESCO's Memorial on Annulment, 149, footnote 103, referring to Annex-62, [Extracts from]

74

Security Deed ("Security Deed") creates a charge over future book debts and thus had

to be registered pursuant to section 79 of Tanzania's Companies Ordinance".”*

230. In this respect, TANESCO submits that this position has been acknowledged by the
Tanzanian Court of Appeal (the highest Tanzanian court), in the Shinyanga case,?°
which is a binding Tanzanian precedent. According to TANESCO, it stated that, further
to the provisions of Tanzania's Companies Ordinance or the later Tanzanian Companies
Act, assignment of a security becomes void unless it is registered within forty-two
days.?6° TANESCO states that the interpretation of Section 79 held by the Court of
Appeal of Tanzania in this case is clear: an unregistered charge is void.?®’ Thus,
TANESCO argues that considering neither SCB HK nor IPTL registered the security
interests assigned under the Security Deed with the Tanzanian Companies Registrar, SCB
HK's purported security interest is void for want of registration,” and thus, that SCB

HK's claim should have been dismissed on the basis of Tanzanian Law.”

231. With respect to the law applicable to this case, TANESCO's expert, explains that the
Shinyanga case (dated 1997) is applicable in Tanzania by virtue of the Judicature and
Application of Laws Act ("JALA").7”° TANESCO further explains that English law is
not applicable to the present case, because English judicial decisions are binding on

Tanzanian courts only when issued prior to July 22, 1920 and when not subsequently

modified in Tanzania.*”!' TANESCO further states that unless and until legislation

Section 79 is "a secured creditor". According to TANESCO, SCB HK's assertion is unsubstantiated, and goes
against the clear wording of section 79. In TANESCO's view, if Section 79 had meant creditor to mean "secured
creditor", it would have said so; see also (205, footnote 193, where TANESCO stated that: "Marungu Sisal
Estate Ltd v. The CRDB Bank Ltd and Another, Civil Case No. 7 of 2000, High Court of Tanzania. In that case,
the debenture holder attempted to distinguish Shinyanga so that it could enjoy the debenture, arguing inter alia
that the company should not be allowed to benefit from its own wrong because the duty to register a debenture
rests with the company. The Judge of the High Court disagreed, and confirmed the law to the effect that once a
debenture become voids, it is as if it never existed at all".

contrary to Shinyanga is enacted by the Parliament of Tanzania or there is a decision by

the Court of Appeal of Tanzania departing from Shinyanga, this case remains binding

law in Tanzania.?””

232. Accordingly, TANESCO submits that the Tribunal, contrary to the obligations placed on
it by Article 42(1),2” disregarded binding Tanzanian law precedent by referring to
English law on the registration issue and quoting extensively from English doctrine in an
attempt to show that the assignment of rights to SCB HK under the Security Deed was a
statutory one.?”4 However, TANESCO explains that, first, under Tanzanian law, even if
the benefit of the PPA was transferred by way of statutory assignment (which TANESCO,

denies was the case), such assignment would only be valid if it had been registered; and

5

second, that the extract quoted by the Tribunal from English doctrine?’> omits an

important sentence from the middle, which changes the meaning.””° TANESCO states
that: "[t]he fact that the assignment is expressed to be by way of security for a loan does
not by itself prevent it from being absolute, though combined with other factors such

expressions may have this effect. Thus, a provision that the assignor was entitled to

275 Annex-1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 147: "[i]n respect of the first requirement, which is identical in terms
to section 136 of the LPA, the following analysis appears in Chitty on Contracts: '[t]he assignment must be
absolute and not purport to be by way of charge only. An assignment by way of mortgage may, however, be
absolute within the meaning of the section, if there is an express or implied proviso for reassignment on
repayment of the loan: for the reassignment would involve fresh notice to the debtor, who would thus be in no
doubt as to whom he ought to pay the debt. An assignment of all moneys due or to become due from the debtor,
which was expressed to be by way of continuing security for all moneys due from the assignor to the assignee,
has been held to be absolute. On the other hand, where the assignor charged a sum which would become due to
him from the debtor as security for advances made to him by the assignee, and assigned his interest in that sum
until the advances were repaid to the assignee with interest, this was held to be by way of charge and not within
the section [...] The test seems to be, has the assignor unconditionally transferred to the assignee for the time
being the sole right to the debt in question as against the debtor? If so, the assignment will be absolute; but if
the debtor cannot tell whether to pay the assignor or the assignee without examining the state of accounts
between them, it will be held to be by way of charge only. Much may depend on the language of the particular
instrument; in construing it, the court will look at the whole of its language. The words italicised above are of
crucial importance, for it is no concern of the debtor whether the assignor and gnee have some private
arrangement for the disposal of the debt after it has been paid by the debtor. Thus the fact that the assignee is
to hold the proceeds of the debt, or the surplus proceeds beyond a stated amount, on trust for the assignor does
not prevent the assignment from being absolute. [Emphasis added by the Committee]".

exercise all its rights over the property until in default under the loan agreement has

prevented an assignment from being absolute".?””

The winding-up procedure

In addition, TANESCO argues that the Tribunal did not make any reference to Shinyanga
nor to Section 79 when addressing the issue of the non-registration of the security interest,

but that it directly went to resolve the matter under English law.?”*

TANESCO further states that the fact that it acknowledged a notice of assignment does
not negate the need for the security to be registered in Tanzania in accordance with
Tanzanian law. Equally, TANESCO states that the registration of the share charges in
Malaysia in no way impacts upon the effect of the non-registration of the assignment in

Tanzania.?”

Consequently, TANESCO argues that in concluding "[t]here is no doubt that the non-
registration of the assignment did not invalidate the charge against [IPTL]", the Tribunal
did not misapply Tanzanian law, including the Shinyanga precedent, but entirely failed
to apply the proper law, both in the Decision and in the Award.”*° This resulted in the
Tribunal allowing SCB HK to step into IPTL's shoes,”*! thereby manifestly exceeding its
powers.”*? In TANESCO's view, if the Tribunal had applied Shinyanga, as it was bound
to do, it would have held that the security became void and that therefore SCB HK did

not have the right to step into IPTL's shoes to recover monies from TANESCO.”*?

TANESCO argues that whilst it is by no means clear whether the Tribunal did consider
that it could disregard Shinyanga on the basis it was decided "per incuriam", as alleged

by SCB HK, this is irrelevant because the Tribunal's failure to consider and apply

Shinyanga is an example of its failure to apply the law of Tanzania. Further, according
to TANESCO, it is incomprehensible how SCB HK can argue that Shinyanga can be
disregarded in favour of pre-1920 English case law, as its expert, Mr Nicholas Zervos,
argued in his expert report.?*+ According to TANESCO, whilst such case law constitutes
binding legal authority in cases of uncertainty or /acunae within Tanzanian legal
authority, as is accepted by the Parties, such case law cannot and does not prevent the
development of a modern Tanzanian system of jurisprudence, appropriate to the specific
prevailing conditions within the country.”°>
237. In light of the above, TANESCO argues that the assignment is void as a matter of
Tanzanian law under Section 172 of the Companies Ordinance, irrespective of whether
the formal requirements were met to have a valid statutory assignment. It highlights the
fact that SCB HK has failed to engage with TANESCO's argument that the Tribunal
wrongfully failed to apply Tanzanian law concerning the effect of such non-

registration.**°

238. TANESCO also disagrees with SCB HK's allegation that it conceded that the non-
registration of the security interest did not render it void in the absence of a liquidator or
administrator.2*” It argues that SCB HK selectively relied upon Mr Range's statements
during the last hearing before the Tribunal rendered the Decision on Jurisdiction, in
March 2013 ("March 2013 Hearing"),”** which, in its view, do not demonstrate any
such concession by TANESCO. On the contrary, TANESCO argues that it has made

239. In addition, TANESCO maintains that the assignment from the Malaysian banks to

Danaharta was highly questionable as a matter of Tanzanian law and that Article 15.2 of

290

the Implementation Agreement,“ which is governed by Tanzanian law, requires that the

Government of Tanzania give prior written approval before any assignment of rights

relating to financing the construction and operation of the Facility took place.7*!

Governmental approval, according to TANESCO, was not sought nor obtained in respect
of the assignment to Danaharta, in breach of Article 15.2, rendering the assignment from
Danaharta to SCB HK invalid.?°* Accordingly, TANESCO argues that the question of

who owns IPTL and/or who has the right to enforce rights on behalf of IPTL is a matter

of Tanzanian law which can only be determined by the Tanzanian court.

240. On this same issue, TANESCO recalls SCB HK's statement in its Counter Memorial that
TANESCO was attempting to suggest that: (i) the New York court agreed with
TANESCO that only the Tanzanian court could properly decide the ownership of IPTL;
(ii) the quote from the New York court cited by TANESCO was in respect of a tortious
action brought by VIP Engineering and Marketing Ltd ("WIP") against SCB HK's parent
company, not SCB HK itself; and (iii) the jurisdiction issue in New York was related to

the issue of whether that tort claim by VIP against Standard Chartered Bank should be

tried in New York or Tanzania.?4

241. According to TANESCO, SCB HK's statements regarding the New York proceedings in
its Counter Memorial miss the point. TANESCO explains that, as SCB HK

"111. Tanesco also attempts in paragraph 59 of its Memorial to suggest that the New York court agreed with
Tanesco that only the Tanzanian Court can properly decide the ownership of IPTL. However, the quote from
the New York court cited by Tanesco was in respect of a tortious action brought by VIP against Standard
Chartered Bank (SCB HK's parent company, not SCB HK itself) on the basis that Standard Chartered Bank had
wrongly claimed to be a secured creditor of IPTL. The jurisdiction issue in New York to which the quote applies
related to the issue of whether that tort claim by VIP against Standard Chartered Bank should be tried in New
York or Tanzania. It is wrong for Tanesco to suggest that New York court's quote had any bearing on the
position of Mechmar's 70% shareholding in IPTL, which had already been determined by the Malaysian Court
and the BVI Court".

acknowledges, these proceedings, relating to issues concerning the ownership of IPTL,

concerned VIP and SCB.7> TANESCO states that it is highly relevant that the New York

court independently determined that the issue of ownership of IPTL (and therefore the

right to bring an action on behalf of IPTL) is an issue of Tanzanian law and can only

rightly be determined by the Tanzanian courts.”°°

242. Furthermore, TANESCO argues that SCB HK's assertion that Mechmar's””” shareholding
in IPTL had already been determined by the Malaysian and British Virgin Islands
("BVI’) courts, whilst not admitted, is in any event irrelevant, since, according to
TANESCO's position throughout these proceedings, the orders set down by the

Malaysian and BVI courts were invalid and have no legal effect in Tanzania.?**

243. In this respect, TANESCO maintains that the Tribunal failed to apply Section 172 of the
Companies Ordinance.””? TANESCO argues that, if this section had been applied, the
Tribunal would have held that the assignment from Danaharta*” to SCB HK in 2005 was
void, because no permission was obtained from the High Court of Tanzania for the

transaction.*”! With regards to this, TANESCO further explains the following.

244. First, TANESCO states that SCB HK's assertion that IPTL was "not in liquidation" at the

time of the transfer is irrelevant, as Section 172 of the Companies Ordinance applies "in

302

a winding up by the court". The fact that the Winding Up Order’’” was subsequently

issued in 2011 and quashed in 2012 is also irrelevant, since, according to TANESCO, the
relevant date is not the date that the order was issued, but the date on which the petition

was presented.*”> Moreover, at the time of the purported assignment, IPTL had been

temporarily wound up since February 2002, with the result that Section 172 squarely

applied.*°*

245. Second, TANESCO argues that SCB HK's argument that the loan did not amount to
property of IPTL*°° should also be rejected, due to the fact that permission from the High
Court of Tanzania must be obtained for the transfer of assets and interests of a company

undergoing winding up proceedings.*°°

246. Finally, TANESCO maintains that SCB HK's argument that the validity of the transfer
under the Facility Agreement is a question of English law is without merit and should be
rejected. In TANESCO's view, it is clear that the transfer took place in Tanzania, and —
notwithstanding the law of the contract between SCB HK and Danaharta — permission
from the High Court of Tanzania was required when dealing with the actionable interests

of IPTL which were being wound up before it.*°”

247. In TANESCO's opinion, SCB HK's insistence that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to
consider this matter, despite it clearly being a matter for the Tanzanian court, is indicative

of SCB HK's approach to the Tanzanian legal system throughout these proceedings.?°°

248. TANESCO thus submits that if the Committee does not conclude that there has been a
complete failure to apply the applicable law (as TANESCO submits that there has been),
it must conclude that the misapplication of Tanzanian law by the Tribunal, in failing to
apply Shinyanga, is an egregious misapplication of the law which constitutes a failure to

apply the applicable law.*°? TANESCO states that no reasonable person could accept that

the Tribunal's disregard of Tanzanian law was correct.*!°

In this regard, TANESCO explains that, as ICSID jurisprudence clearly establishes, even
where a tribunal has sought to apply the correct applicable law but has grossly or
egregiously misapplied or misinterpreted such law, that is sufficient to constitute a
manifest excess of powers and, as a consequence, the award issued by that tribunal must

be annulled.*"!

TANESCO emphasises that a gross or egregious misapplication or misinterpretation of
the applicable law differs from a mere erroneous misapplication of the law, the latter of
which is not a ground for annulment. However, TANESCO submits that the Tribunal's
actions and decisions in the present case constitute more than a minor misapplication of
the law, but amount to, and surpass the standard of, a gross or egregious

misapplication.*!?

On this basis, TANESCO submits the Award should be annulled on the ground of
manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) given that the Tribunal has grossly

and/or egregiously misapplied the applicable Tanzanian law.?!*

ii) SCB HK's arguments

SCB HK states that TANESCO's complaint that the Tribunal misapplied, or
misinterpreted Tanzanian law seeks to erode the distinction between non-application and
erroneous application of the proper law,*'+ and thus, that TANESCO's arguments are

hopeless, for the following reasons. *!°

SCB HK states that an alleged misapplication of the applicable law does not constitute a
manifest excess of powers,*!° and explains that the drafting history of the Convention
supports such an interpretation of Article 52(1)(b). In the course of the Convention's

drafting, the failure by a tribunal to apply the law chosen by the parties was given by the

chairman as an example of a manifest excess of power. However, a potential ground of
annulment of "manifestly incorrect application of the law" was rejected by the drafters

of the Convention!”

In this respect, SCB HK argues that when an allegation is made that there was a manifest
excess of powers for failure to apply the applicable law under Article 52(1)(b) of the
Convention, it is not the role of an ad hoc committee to verify whether the interpretation
of the law by the tribunal was correct, or whether it correctly ascertained the facts or
whether it correctly appreciated the evidence. In SCB HK's view, a contested

interpretation of the applicable law is not reviewable in annulment proceedings.*!®

Consequently, SCB HK states that allowing TANESCO to challenge the Tribunal's
findings on the basis of an error of law would undermine the finality of ICSID awards
and the credibility of the ICSID annulment system. SCB HK argues that this is an obvious
attempt to convince the Committee to second-guess the merits of the Tribunal’s

interpretation of Tanzanian law, and therefore should be rejected.*!

SCB HK submits that even if the Committee is minded to accept TANESCO's complaint
that the Tribunal misapplied or misinterpreted Tanzanian law so egregiously that it failed
to apply the proper law, the standard for a finding of such a gross or egregious
misinterpretation or misapplication is very high. It will only be satisfied where "no
reasonable person" could accept such an interpretation.*”° SCB HK explains that such
high standard poses a difficulty for TANESCO because its arguments as to the correct
interpretation and application of Tanzanian law are completely without merit on any

standard.>7!

257. Furthermore, SCB HK argues that TANESCO's position regarding the failure to apply
the proper law conflates two separate points: (i) whether Clause 3.2.1 of the Security
Deed effected a statutory assignment of the PPA under Section 25(6) of the Supreme
Court of Judicature Act ("SCJA"),>”? and (ii) whether the assignment — statutory or not
— effected by Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed was void by reason of the non-registration

of the security under Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance.*”3

258. Regarding the first point — whether there was a statutory assignment — SCB HK states
that this depends only on whether the requirements of Section 25(6) of the SCJA were
satisfied. According to SCB HK, the assignment must be made in writing under the hand
of the assignor and express written notice of the assignment must be given to the
counterparty. SCB HK highlights that there is no registration requirement and affirms

that the assignment of the PPA was absolute and not by way of charge only.**+

259. Further, SCB HK states that TANESCO's counsel conceded at the hearing that the form
of the assignment would comply with the SCJA in terms of meeting the formal
requirements of a statutory assignment.*”°

260. In these circumstances, SCB HK argues that TANESCO's further attempts to resile from
its concession and conflate the statutory assignment point with the registration point must
be rejected. In SCB HK's opinion, TANESCO cannot agree before the Tribunal that
Clause 3.2.1 effected a statutory assignment under Tanzanian law, and then complain

that the Tribunal has failed to apply Tanzanian law in reaching that conclusion.*?°

261. SCB HK states that TANESCO's complaint, in its Memorial on Annulment, that the

TANESCO's counsel conceded at the March 2013 Hearing that the assignment of the
PPA was a statutory assignment within the meaning of Section 25(6) of the SCJA.?8
Second, because, in SCB HK's view, the assignment of the PPA satisfied the
requirements of Section 25(6) of the SCJA, and thus, TANESCO's allegation that the

assignment was not statutory is without merit.*”?

262. Consequently, SCB HK argues that TANESCO's complaint that the Tribunal failed to

apply Tanzanian law, or egregiously misapplied Tanzanian law in deciding the statutory

assignment point must be rejected.**°

263. As to the second point — whether the assignment, statutory or not, effected by Clause
3.2.1 of the Security Deed was void by reason of the non-registration of the security under
Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance — SCB HK argues that a finding by the Tribunal
that Section 79 only voids registrable but unregistered security as against a liquidator,
administrator or secured creditor (i.e. refusing to apply Shinyanga) cannot be
characterised as a failure to apply Tanzanian law or an egregious misapplication of
Tanzanian law since the better view is that the Shinyanga case was wrongly decided and

does not represent Tanzanian law.**!

264. During the March 2013 Hearing, SCB HK referred to Mr Zervos' report, its expert on
Tanzanian law, who explained that English law is adopted with qualifications when
needed in Tanzania under Section 2(3) of the JALA. This provision incorporates the
Common Law doctrine of equity and statutes of general application enacted in England
before July 22, 1920. This date is deemed to be the reception date of English law in
Tanzania ("Reception Date"). According to Mr Zervos, when Tanzanian law is silent on

a matter, one can resort to the common law to fill the gap.**”

265. SCB HK states that the Shinyanga case directly contradicts the express language of
Section 79, which provides only that a registrable but unregistered charge shall "be void
against the liquidator and any creditor of the company".*** SCB HK refers to its expert,
Mr Zervos, who explained that Shinyanga was decided without reference to the English
authorities before the Reception Date (like Re Ehrmann Bros Ltd). These authorities were
binding on the Tanzanian court and provide that an unregistered charge is not void as

against the whole world.>*4

266. According to SCB HK, TANESCO's argument for annulment on the basis that there was
a failure to apply Tanzanian law (or an egregious misapplication of Tanzanian law) on
the Section 79 point must fail in circumstances where TANESCO's counsel accepted at
the March 2013 Hearing that Section 79 only voids a security as against a liquidator or
administrator, but not against the whole world.**> Therefore, SCB HK claims that having

properly made the concession, TANESCO cannot now complain that the Tribunal failed

somehow survive or not the voiding of the security? [...] [T]he reason in our post-hearing brief that we re-
included the arguments with respect to the voiding of the security, if an administrator or a liquidator was
appointed, is that we certainly anticipate that that issue is going to be arise. But technically speaking, right now
where we are is simply the automatic stay in section 249. I don't think that we can argue that, until such time as

to apply or egregiously misapplied Tanzanian law in correctly deciding the point in line

with the concession and reaching the same conclusion.**°

SCB HK states that even if the Committee ignores TANESCO's concession on the
Section 79 point, the conclusion reached by the Tribunal when deciding that failure to
register a charge does not void the charge against the whole world and thus that the

assignment was not voided by Section 79 was correct on the merits.>97

Additionally, SCB HK opposes TANESCO's expert's statement that the Tribunal did not
make any reference to the Companies Ordinance or to Shinyanga in this respect and
argues that the Tribunal did mention Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance and the
Shinyanga case in its Decision on Jurisdiction, when delimiting the fourth issue
addressed in the Decision, regarding the effects of the non-registration of the security

interest, and later in its analysis of such matter.>38
The winding-up procedure

SCB HK addresses TANESCO's complaint that the Tribunal failed to apply Section 172
of the Companies Ordinance which provides that in a winding up by the court, "any
disposition of the property of the company" shall be void unless the court orders
otherwise. According to SCB HK, TANESCO argues that this provision invalidated the
assignment of the Facility Agreement from Danaharta to SCB HK in 2005, because at
that time a minority shareholder's winding up petition ("Winding Up Petition") was

pending against IPTL.*”

SCB HK argues that to the extent TANESCO is suggesting that the Tribunal has failed
to apply or egregiously misapplied Tanzanian law on the validity of the transfer of the

loan, the argument must be rejected for the following reasons.**”

First, SCB HK explains that the first time TANESCO questioned the validity of the
transfer of the loan in these proceedings was in its Memorial on Annulment. According
to SCB HK, TANESCO has not even attempted in its Reply on Annulment to engage
with the fact that the point was not raised before the Tribunal during the jurisdiction and
merits phase.*“! In SCB HK's view, TANESCO cannot complain that the Tribunal failed
to apply or egregiously misapplied Tanzanian law on a point that was never raised before
it.342 SCB HK argues that, even if the argument had been before the Tribunal, it would

have been rejected.*47

Second, SCB HK explains that the Facility Agreement contained a non-exclusive English
jurisdiction clause and was subject to English law. Thus, under private international law
principles, the validity of the assignment of an English law contract is a question of
English law.*“* In support of this argument, SCB HK refers to a case brought before the
English High Court pursuant to the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Facility
Agreement, where Judge Flaux ruled that the assignment of the loan was valid and SCB
HK is a creditor under the Facility Agreement.*4° SCB HK claims that TANESCO's
attempt in this Annulment Proceeding to challenge the validity of the assignment in
circumstances where the validity has already been confirmed by the English court
pursuant to a non-exclusive English jurisdiction clause is meritless and must be

rejected.*4°

Finally, SCB HK recalls that TANESCO claims that IPTL was in "a winding up by the
court" in 2005 because Section 174(2) of the Companies Ordinance provides that a
winding up shall be deemed to commence at the time the petition for winding up is
presented. According to SCB HK, TANESCO's position is that IPTL had therefore been
"temporarily wound up" since 2002 by reason of the 2011 Winding Up Order,

notwithstanding the fact that the 2011 Winding Up Order was quashed in 2012.*47 SCB
HK submits that this argument is wrong since Section 174(2) of the Companies
Ordinance is a "relating back" provision, which operates retrospectively to invalidate
certain property dispositions made after the winding up petition is presented in the event
that a winding up order is made, but that, unless a winding up order is made, property

dispositions are not invalidated.*4*

In this respect, SCB HK explains that in the present case, the Tanzanian Court of Appeal
ruled that all proceedings in the conduct of the Winding Up Petition after the date of the
Revised Administration Petition (i.e. September 17, 2009) were a "nullity" and the 2011
Winding Up Order was accordingly "revised, quashed and set aside". SCB HK thus
submits that the quashing of the Winding Up Order means that there is nothing to trigger
the operation of Section 174(2) of the Companies Ordinance. In support of this argument,
SCB HK states that this was the conclusion reached by Judge Flaux in his Jurisdiction
Judgment, who held that Section 172 could only apply to void a disposition "where there
was a winding up order by the Court. There is no such extant Order by the Tanzanian
court, the Order made by Judge Kaijage [the Winding Up Order] having been held to be
a nullity by the CAT".*?

In addition, SCB HK argues that TANESCO's submission regarding IPTL's property

rests on a false premise and is misguided for two reasons.

First, the Tribunal did not, in fact, determine ownership of IPTL, because the Tribunal
was not asked to decide, and did not decide, who owned or controlled IPTL. As proof of
this, SCB HK calls the attention of the Committee to the fact that TANESCO remains
unable to point to any passage in the Award in which the Tribunal considers and decides

the legitimate owner of IPTL under Tanzanian law.*°°

Second, the question of whether SCB HK can enforce the rights of IPTL under contracts
entered into by IPTL in 1995 depends on whether the relevant contract was legally
assigned in accordance with the governing law of the contract and that is a separate
question from who owns IPTL. SCB HK states that the Tribunal held that the PPA, which
was governed by Tanzanian law, was legally assigned to SCB HK under section 25(6)

SCJA?*!

SCB HK states that the consequence of the PPA being legally assigned to SCB HK was
that SCB HK, as the legal owner of the benefit of the PPA, was entitled to recover sums
due under the PPA from TANESCO without joining IPTL. Thus, SCB HK argues that
since the question of ownership of IPTL was not before the Tribunal nor was it necessary
to its Decision, it is beside the point whether the Tanzanian court is the only forum which

is entitled to decide ownership.***

SCB HK recalls paragraphs 225 to 227 of TANESCO's Reply in which TANESCO.
quoted decisions from proceedings before the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (which concerned VIP and SCB HK's parent company)
in support of its position that the question of ITPL's ownership and/or who had the right
to enforce rights on its behalf is a matter of Tanzanian Law.*** The relevant quote from
the New York court's decision is as follows: "[t]he focus of the parties' dispute is whether
VIP relinquished its 30 percent interest in IPTL as collateral for a loan, now owned by a
Standard Chartered subsidiary, made to IPTL. [...] It appears that all facts relevant to this
case occurred in the Republic of Tanzania, that all documents relevant to VIP's claim
were executed in the Republic of Tanzania, and that the necessary parties and witnesses
are located there. [...] [T]he Court finds that the Republic of Tanzania is an available and
adequate forum for VIP's suit and that 'in the interest of justice and all other relevant

concerns the action would be best brought in’ the Republic of Tanzania..."*>+

280. SCB HK argues that TANESCO misrepresents what the New York court said and invents
a finding which the court did not make, in an attempt to re-write the court's decision.**>
SCB HK claims that the New York court did not make any ruling that the Tanzanian
court was the only appropriate forum to determine the ownership of IPTL, much less any

ruling that was binding on SCB HK (which was not a party to the proceeding).

281. Consequently, SCB HK argues that the Tribunal's decisions on these issues were correct.
It claims that there is no basis for arguing that the law was misapplied, let alone
misapplied to such a gross or egregious extent that it amounted to an excess of
jurisdiction.**° Thus, in SCB HK's view, TANESCO's allegations that there has been a
misapplication of the applicable law in the three areas it identifies (the statutory
assignment, the need for registration and the assignment under the alleged winding up

procedure) are without merit on any standard.

iii) Analysis and Decision of the Committee

282. The drafting history of the ICSID Convention shows that a tribunal's failure to apply the
proper law can constitute a manifest excess of powers, but that an erroneous application
of the law cannot amount to an annullable error. There is no basis for an annulment due
to an incorrect decision by a tribunal. This principle has been expressly recognised by

many ad hoc committees.*°7

witnesses, suggest that the Republic of Tanzania is the proper forum for this action. [...] In short, the Court
finds that the Republic of Tanzania is an available and adequate forum for VIP's suit and that ‘in the interest of
justice and all other relevant concerns the action would best be brought in’ the Republic of Tanzania"; see also

357 CLA-112, Background Paper on Annulment, May 5, 2016, 90, referring to §{[15 and 21 of the same
document, which state: "15. Other suggestions were to add the words 'a serious misapplication of the law' or
‘including the failure to apply the proper law’ to the ground concerning excess of powers. In this connection,
Chairman Broches remarked that 'a_mistake in the application of the law would not be a valid ground for
annulment of the award,’ stating that ‘[a] mistake of law as well as a mistake of fact constituted an inherent risk
in judicial or arbitral decision for which appeal was not provided.’ However, the legal expert from Lebanon
observed that if the parties had agreed to apply a particular law and the Tribunal in fact applied a different law,
the award would violate the parties’ arbitration agreement and could be annulled. [...] 21. Chairman Broches

   

 

 

91

283. In regard to the law to be applied by a tribunal, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention
provides as follows: "[t]he Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules
of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the [t]ribunal
shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the

conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable".***

284. Therefore, the Committee finds, and ad hoc committees agree, that where the parties
choose an applicable law, a disregard of this choice of law would be equivalent to a
departure from the mandate conferred on a tribunal by the parties, and thus would amount
to a manifest excess of powers. This is also the case when a tribunal acts ex aequo et
bono without agreement of the parties to do so as required by the ICSID Convention.**?
However, ad hoc committees have taken different approaches on whether an error in the
application of the proper law may effectively amount to non-application of the proper

law.

285. Inthe present case, TANESCO maintains that the Tribunal failed to apply Tanzanian law
to determine the validity of the assignment of IPTL's rights under the PPA and its lack of
effectiveness due to SCB HK's failure to register its security interest in Tanzania, as
ordered by Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance. According to TANESCO, under
Tanzanian law, even if the assignment of the benefit of the PPA were made by way of
statutory assignment (which it denies), such assignment would only be valid if it had

been registered.
286. Inthe Committee's view, this argument does not stand for the following reasons.

287. As can be seen from the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal recognises as "common
ground" between the Parties that the validity of the assignment of rights in the PPA must

be determined in accordance with Tanzanian law.*°°

confirmed during the meetings that failure to apply the proper law could amount to an excess of power if the
parties had agreed on an icable law. One proposal d adding the 'manifestly incorrect i of
the law’ by the Tribunal as a ground of. but it was defeated by a vote of 17 to 8 [ hi: added]".

563 Annex-1, Decision on Juri

In its analysis of this issue, the Tribunal concluded that the assignment effectuated
pursuant to Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed was a chose-in-action, and that, as such, it
could be the object of a statutory assignment or an equitable assignment under Tanzanian
law. The Tribunal explained that, if the assignment fulfilled the conditions for a statutory
assignment, the assignee would acquire a legal right to the chose-in-action and could sue
in its own name. If the assignment of the chose-in-action did not conform to the
conditions for a statutory assignment, it was an equitable assignment and it was generally

necessary to have the assignor joined as a claimant.**!

To determine whether the assignment was a statutory assignment, the Tribunal conducted
an analysis pursuant to Section 25(6) of the SCJA which is the applicable statute in

Tanzania,*~ and identified that the main issues to be resolved were the following.

The first issue is whether a valid mortgage had been created in respect of the benefit of
the PPA pursuant to Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed, such that there had been an
effective transfer to SCB HK of the legal right to that benefit and all the remedies relating

to that benefit by a statutory assignment, in accordance with Section 25(6) of the SCJA2°

It is clear to the Committee that the Tribunal analysed the Parties' arguments in relation
to the nature of the security interest created pursuant to Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed,
in light of the requirements for a statutory assignment under Section 25(6) of the SCJA.
As a result, the Tribunal concluded that such requirements were fulfilled and that Clause
3.2.1 of the Security Deed was a valid statutory assignment of IPTL's rights under the
PPA to SCB HK.*4

The second issue the Tribunal went on to analyse were the consequences of its previous
decision in relation to its jurisdiction which SCB HK asserted on the basis of the

arbitration agreement in Clause 18.3 of the PPA. It stated that the security assignment

293.

294.

365 Annex-1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 152-153. Specifically, the Tribunal explained that its jurisdiction

that SCB HK has over the benefit of the PPA conferred a more extensive range of rights
in relation to the PPA than would be the case if Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed had
given SCB HK merely an equitable charge over certain assets. It concluded that pursuant
to Section 25(6) of the SCJA, SCB HK became the legal owner of rights arising under
the PPA, and that, as such, it was entitled to invoke the arbitration agreement in Clause
18.3 of the PPA as a right that had been assigned to it and could bring proceedings against
TANESCO without joining IPTL as a party to the action. The Tribunal thus concluded

that it had jurisdiction over the Parties and the dispute.*°

The third issue the Tribunal addressed was whether the security interest was required to
be registered under Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance, in whole or in part. The
Tribunal analysed the arguments of the Parties on whether Clause 3.2.1 of the Security
Deed was a charge on future book debts and/or a floating charge that was required to be
registered under Section 79.*°’ The Tribunal concluded that Clause 3.2.1 of the Security
Deed created a charge over future book debts since the contractual payments to be made
by TANESCO to IPTL under the PPA were not contingent debts but future debts that
would have been entered into IPTL's books as book debts and thus that it had to be

registered pursuant to Section 79 of Tanzania's Companies Ordinance.**

The fourth issue the Tribunal addressed were the consequences that follow if the security
interest was required to be registered but was not. There was no dispute that the security
interest was not, in fact, registered.°? On this issue, the Tribunal first took into
consideration Professor Goode's leading treatise Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law,
which was quoted by the Tanzanian Court of Appeal in its judgment quashing the

liquidation order against IPTL:

extended in particular to the questions of whether there is a valid security assignment, whether the security
interest had to be registered and whether SCB HK was entitled to step into the shoes of IPTL and assert rights
against TANESCO under the PPA (since this later was an issue arising in connection with the PPA, covered by
the wording of the arbitration clause).

"In [sic] should be borne in mind that registration is purely a perfection
requirement designed to give notice to third parties; it is not a condition of
validity of the charge, which remains fully enforceable against the
company prior to winding up or administration. It follows that if the
company does go into liquidation or administration the consequent
avoidance of the unregistered charge has no impact on the charge to the
extent that he has already realised his security or perfected it by seizure or
judicial foreclosure or has otherwise obtained payment, for to that extent

his security has been satisfied and there is nothing for him to enforce".>”°

295. Additionally, the Tribunal addressed case law referred to by TANESCO when analysing
the consequences of the non-registration. Specifically, the Tribunal analysed the

Shinyanga and the Esberger & Son cases, stating that:

"Neither of these cases, however, assists [TANESCO] because they relate
to the validity of a single security interest. In Esberger, a security interest
over the title deeds to a parcel of land was deemed to be void because the
interest was not registered in due time. There was no issue of severability
raised in that case. Likewise, in Shinyanga, the issue was simply the
validity of an unregistered debenture and the power of sale conferred by
that debenture. No issue of severance was raised in that case. [TANESCO]
accepted in oral submissions that there were 'no cases whatsoever in

Tanzania on [the severance point]".>7!

296. The Tribunal concluded that the failure to perfect a security interest does not invalidate
other parts of the relevant instrument that do not require registration, since it was possible
to sever one from the other. Therefore, the Tribunal decided that the right to bring
arbitration proceedings against TANESCO to enforce its obligation under the PPA was

clearly a valuable right that was not subject to registration and could be severed from

those interests that did require registration.*’” Accordingly, the Tribunal ruled that the

registration issue would have no effect on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.*”7

In addition, the Tribunal concluded that the failure to register a charge over future book
debts in relation to Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed did not have an effect on the relief
requested by SCB HK in the proceedings, since the non-registration of a security interest
did not invalidate the charge against the company, and also because, at that moment, no

liquidator or administrator was appointed in respect of IPTL.*”*

With respect to the Shinyanga case, the Committee finds that, as can be seen from the
Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal was indeed aware of that case and analysed its
content when addressing the effect of the non-registration. Thus, contrary to TANESCO's
allegations, the Committee does not find a failure to apply the proper law exists in this

respect.

It is clear to the Committee that the Tribunal: (i) determined the existence and validity of
a statutory assignment of IPTL's rights under the PPA under Section 25(6) of the SCJA,
the applicable statute in Tanzania;*”* (ii) concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the
Parties' dispute, taking into account its previous decision in light of Section 25(6) of the
SJCA;3”6 (iii) determined the need for registration of the security interest under Section
79 of Tanzania's Companies Ordinance;3”’ and finally (iv) addressed the consequences
of the non-registration of the security interest, taking into consideration Tanzanian case

law, including the Shinyanga case.>”

It is also clear to this Committee that the Tribunal, whenever it considered it necessary
to determine whether it had jurisdiction and the extent of its jurisdiction, conducted its

analysis and conclusions pursuant to Tanzanian law.

The Committee notes that in some parts of its analysis, for example when analysing

whether there was a valid statutory assignment,*”?

the Tribunal quoted English doctrine.
However, it did make clear that the reference to this doctrine was to a proviso in the
English Law of Property Act 1925 which was identical to Section 25(6) of the SCJA.
Therefore, the fact that the Tribunal had quoted English doctrine to support its
interpretation of the first issue cannot be regarded as an application of English law. The

Tribunal's analysis was always in light of Section 25(6) of the SCJA.

Thus, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did apply Tanzanian law, the proper
law, to decide the aforementioned matters regarding the assignment of IPTL's rights
under the PPA, including its validity. Therefore, there was no manifest excess of powers

by the Tribunal in this respect.

4) The existence of a manifest excess of power of the Tribunal by reconsidering its

prior Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, dated 12 February 2014

In this section, the Committee addresses only the Parties' arguments that are specifically
concerned with the Tribunal's reconsideration as a reason for annulment under the
manifest excess of powers ground and will not deal with general arguments regarding
reconsideration. These general arguments are addressed in Section v. above. The

Committee has taken these arguments into account in its analysis and decision.

i) TANESCO's arguments

TANESCO submits that in reconsidering its prior, binding Decision, the Tribunal
disregarded the res judicata effect of the Decision and subverted the express provision

in Article 53(1) of the Convention and thus, manifestly exceeded its powers.**°

3 Annex-1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 144-147.
380 TANESCO's Memorial on Annulment, {{]127-129.

97

305. According to TANESCO, the Tribunal accepts (at paragraph 318 of the Award) that
decisions (although not considered res judicata upon the parties or other Contracting

States outside the proceedings) are binding within the scope of the proceedings.**!

306. TANESCO recalls that, as confirmed by Prof. Reinisch in his opinion, it is not by
accident that the ICSID Convention "does not allow for any review mechanisms
concerning interim decisions", but that it intentionally restricts them to final awards (into
which preceding decisions, if any, have to be incorporated), in order to avoid the
circumstance of opening endless possibilities of one party to frustrate or delay the
proceedings. That was confirmed by ConocoPhillips.**? Thus, TANESCO argues that
decisions, whether on jurisdiction or the merits, "are meant finally to settle a subset of

issues that are later incorporated in the final award, and may then, and only then, be

383 384

subject to review as part of the award",’*° and have therefore res judicata effects.

307. Additionally, TANESCO submits that the Tribunal (at paragraph 318 of the Award),
when stating that if the Decision was res judicata then, by analogy with Article 51, "it
might be reopened in defined circumstances", was writing itself a new rule, without
explaining on what basis it purported to apply by analogy a rule which explicitly applies
only to final awards. TANESCO states that the Tribunal did not provide an explanation
because there can be no basis for the Tribunal to apply Article 51 by analogy to decisions
and that its attempt to do so was a manifest excess of its powers.**° TANESCO states that
if SCB HK had any issue with the award or the decision, it should have sought revision

of the Award under Article 51.7%

ofa tribunal should be binding, is underlined by the travaux preparatoires..."; Annex-60, [Extract from] History
of the ICSID Convention; see also (318 of the Award: "318. The Tribunal is of the view that it is incorrect to
characterize the decisions of ICSID tribunals, as opposed to their awards, as res judicata. They are binding
within the scope of the proceedings but do not impose obligations upon the parties or other Contracting States
outside the proceedings as is the case with awards that are res judicata...".

308. Furthermore, TANESCO objects to SCB HK's statement that "the issue of whether SCB
HK had the relevant knowledge... is a matter going to the substance of the Award".
TANESCO explains that, in order to ascertain whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded
its powers or seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in reconsidering
the Award, it is de facto necessary to ascertain what SCB HK did or did not know prior

to the Decision.**”

309. Finally, in light of TANESCO's arguments set out above in chapter V, and specifically
because, according to TANESCO, the Tribunal reconsidered its Decision on the same
facts and in disregard of solid legal precedents, the Tribunal's reconsideration of the

Decision on Jurisdiction clearly met the standard of manifest excess of powers thus, the

Award should be annulled.**8

ii) SCB HK's arguments

310. SCB HK recalls that it has been accepted by numerous ad hoc committees that the
requirement of a "manifest" excess of powers will only be satisfied if it is obvious,
without deeper analysis, that a tribunal lacked or exceeded jurisdiction, but that if
"reasonable minds" might differ as to whether the tribunal has jurisdiction, that issue falls
to be resolved definitively by the tribunal in exercise of its power under Article 41.°°°
SCB HK notes in this regard that "reasonable minds" continue to debate the interaction
between the principle of res judicata and the power of an ICSID tribunal to reconsider a

decision or award.*”° SCB HK refers to a commentary on the ConocoPhillips v.

Venezuela case, which states that: "...Charles N. Brower and Paula F. Henin have
observed that: '[w]Jhile it appears to the authors that Professor Abi-Saab's position [in
favour of reconsideration] was, under the specific circumstances of the case under
review, more sensible than the majority's reasoning and conclusions, both approaches
have legitimate appeal. In the absence of a doctrine of binding precedent in international
arbitration, it remains to be seen which of these two approaches will be followed by other

ICSID tribunals in the future’".*?!

In such circumstances, SCB HK argues that an excess of power grounded upon a
tribunal's differing view as to its power to reconsider a decision in light of res judicata

principles is not "manifest".*°?

As to TANESCO's allegations that reconsideration is contrary to the express wording of
the Convention, SCB HK submits that the Convention is silent on the question of
reconsideration of decisions, and that Article 53(1), that TANESCO refers to in support

of its assertions, is referring to an award and not a decision.>%°

SCB HK argues that TANESCO, after having had its objections to reconsideration
rejected by the Tribunal, now seeks to raise them again before the Committee alleging a
"manifest excess of powers" in an attempt to appeal against the substantive findings of

the Tribunal.3*

According to SCB HK, an examination of the relevant passages in TANESCO's Reply
on Annulment demonstrates that TANESCO is seeking to re-open the substantive factual
findings of the Tribunal and to reargue its case on the state of SCB HK's knowledge, and

whether SCB HK was negligent.**>

Finally, and recalling its arguments set out in chapter V, SCB HK submits that a tribunal
has the power to reconsider its decisions under specific limited circumstances, i.e.
TANESCO's misrepresentation of the facts before the Tribunal in the Arbitration
Proceeding, and thus, that TANESCO's allegation under the manifest excess of powers

ground due to the Tribunal's reconsideration of the Decision must be rejected.*°°

iii) Analysis and Decision of the Committee

The Committee notes that TANESCO's main arguments for alleging the existence of a
manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal when it reconsidered its Decision on
Jurisdiction are: (i) the Tribunal subverted the express wording of Article 53(1),
disregarding the res judicata character of decisions; (ii) the Tribunal "attempted" to apply
Article 51 of the Convention by analogy, when there is no basis for doing so; and (iii) the

Tribunal's reconsideration was made in disregard of solid legal precedents.

To address these questions, the Committee first recalls its previous decision in chapter V

regarding the Tribunal's power to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction.

In that chapter, the Committee followed the Tribunal's reasoning that neither the ICSID
Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules explicitly allow or disallow reconsideration
of jurisdictional decisions and that an analysis as to whether the existing provisions of
the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules provide tribunals with the power to

reopen prior determinations before the issuance of the final award was needed.

When conducting the required analysis, the Tribunal considered whether decisions in an
arbitration proceeding have res judicata effect to be of crucial importance. It concluded
that, despite the fact that decisions of tribunals are binding within the scope of the
proceedings, this does not make them res judicata. The Tribunal referred to procedural
orders and provisional measures as examples of decisions that are subject to revision,
even though neither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules expressly provide

for this. The Committee shares this view.

321.

322.

323.

The Tribunal found that, even if the conclusion were that decisions have res judicata
status, then, by analogy with Article 51 of the Convention, they might be reopened in
defined circumstances. If they were not res judicata, then a fortiori they could be

reopened without the constrains of the requirements of Article 51.7°”

In light of the above, the Tribunal decided to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction
basing its reasoning on the Kompetenz-Kompetenz principle as expressed in Articles 41
and 44 of the Convention. In the Committee's view, ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1) and
41(2) are simply more detailed articulations of the Kompetenz-Kompetenz principle
enshrined in Article 41 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal correctly identified its
power to rule on its own competence, including the power to reconsider prior
jurisdictional decisions, as provided by Articles 41(1) and 44 of the ICSID Convention,
ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1) and 41(2).

The Committee finds that the Tribunal conducted a thorough examination of the res
judicata character of decisions. Only after having analysed the provisions of the ICSID
Convention, the Arbitration Rules and case law submitted by the Parties (such as
ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, as well as the dissenting opinion in that case and Pac Rim

v. El Salvador), the Tribunal concluded that they did not have that character.

The Committee recalls the requirement that for any excess of powers to be "manifest": it
must be obvious without deeper analysis that a tribunal exceeded its powers. However,
if "reasonable minds" differ as to the power of an ICSID tribunal to reconsider a prior
decision, the tribunal's exercise of its power under Article 41 of the Convention cannot
constitute a manifest excess of powers. Currently, there exist opposing views about a
tribunal's power to reconsider a decision and the applicability of the res judicata
principle.*°* This is evidenced by the Burlington case and the dissenting opinion of
Professor Georges Abi-Saab in the ConocoPhillips case which demonstrate that the
views of arbitral tribunals regarding the power of reconsideration of decisions are under

debate.

The Committee is of the view that the reconsideration of the Decision did not disregard
the res judicata principle, nor undermine Article 53 of the Convention, since that

provision expressly establishes that it applies to awards only, not to decisions.

The Tribunal made reference to Article 51 when determining under what circumstances
reconsideration of the Decision would be justified. The Committee notes that the
Tribunal did not "apply" Article 51 of the Convention, but only turned to it for guidance.
The Tribunal explained specifically that it could take this Article into consideration but
was not bound by it. Under these circumstances, the Committee is of the view that the
reference made by the Tribunal to Article 51 does not amount to an excess of powers by

the Tribunal, and even less to an excess that is manifest.

Further, the Committee is mindful of TANESCO's assertions that the Tribunal
reconsidered the Decision on Jurisdiction in disregard of solid legal precedents, which
TANESCO claims support its argument as to the Decision having res judicata effect.
Specifically, the Tribunal examined two cases directly on point: ConocoPhillips v.
Venezuela and Perenco v. Ecuador. The Tribunal analysed these decisions in some detail,

disagreeing with some of the points made by the two tribunals.

The Committee is of the view that it is desirable for ICSID arbitral tribunals to endeavour
to build a coherent case law (jurisprudence constante) and that it is common practice that
tribunals take into account their peers' awards and decisions. It is also undeniable that
this case law does not constitute binding precedents for other arbitral tribunals.*”? In this
case, the Tribunal followed the common practice of taking into account ICSID
precedents. The Committee finds no reason for this "disregard" of precedents to be an

excess of powers.

Finally, SCB HK argues that an examination of the relevant passages in TANESCO's

Reply demonstrates that TANESCO is seeking to re-open the substantive factual findings

3° TANESCO's Reply on Annulment, 193.

103

331.

332.

of the Tribunal and to reargue its case on the state of SCB HK's knowledge, and on

whether SCB HK was negligent.*°°

The state of knowledge of SCB HK and whether it was negligent during the Arbitration
Proceeding, are matters of appreciation of evidence and of facts which were to be
determined by the Tribunal. It is not for this Committee to enter into a review of the

substantive findings reached by the Tribunal in this regard.4°!

For all the above-mentioned reasons, the Committee concludes that there was no manifest
excess of powers by the Tribunal when it reconsidered its Decision on Jurisdiction.
Therefore, the Committee finds no reason why the Award should be annulled as a

consequence of the reconsideration of the Decision.

5) The existence of a manifest excess of power of the Tribunal by assuming
jurisdiction over the relationship between SCB HK and IPTL under the Facility
Agreement, allowing SCB HK to step into the shoes of IPTL and gain standing

in this proceeding

i) TANESCO's arguments

TANESCO calls the Committee's attention to the fact that Article 19.4 of the PPA states
that the PPA "shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
Tanzania". It also points out that SCB HK acknowledged Tanzanian law as being the
applicable law pertaining to the assignment, and the Tribunal in its Decision on

Jurisdiction recognised this as well.*°?

TANESCO argues that, although SCB HK acted as Security Agent under the multipartite
financing arrangements and under the Security Deed, it failed to register its asserted

security interest with Tanzania's Registrar of Companies, as required by Tanzanian law,

being the law governing the PPA.*° Thus, according to TANESCO, SCB HK is not a
valid assignee of IPTL's rights or, in any case, cannot enforce any such rights against
TANESCO, since the failure to register the assignment of the security voided the

assignment and precluded SCB HK from enforcing any rights under the PPA.**

333. TANESCO emphasises that the PPA was the sole agreement which it entered into.*”

334. In this respect, TANESCO recalls that allowing a third party to arbitrate even though it
has no standing, amounts to a manifest excess of powers,*°° and argues that it is clear,
too, from the travaux preparatoires to the Convention, that the absence of jurisdiction

was central to the grounds for annulment.*°”

335. Therefore, TANESCO states that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its jurisdictional
powers by allowing SCB HK to bring proceedings against it. According to TANESCO,
SCB HK unlawfully instigated and pursued this arbitration on an unfounded premise that
a security interest automatically grants a right to step into IPTL's shoes and claim

amounts allegedly owed to IPTL under the PPA directly against TANESCO.*°°

336. In addition, TANESCO points out that in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal
determined that it could make a declaration as to any amounts owed by TANESCO to
IPTL, but that it could not make an order requiring TANESCO to pay any such amounts
to SCB HK independently of IPTL. According to TANESCO: "[iJt follows that the

registration issue is irrelevant so long as the Tribunal confines itself to giving declaratory

relief, which the Tribunal is obliged to do in the circumstances of this case".40

TANESCO points out that, by contrast, in the Award the Tribunal held that it had
jurisdiction to make an order for payment because, "the possibility of IPTL being placed
in liquidation seems much more remote..."4!° and TANESCO "...had agreed with IPTL
/ PAP to pay the equivalent of the full amount claimed by SCB HK in the tariff dispute
and the Escrow Account had been emptied".*!! However, TANESCO recalls that IPTL
being placed into liquidation was only ever a possibility, and the process in Tanzania was
complex. TANESCO states that it is unclear how remote a possibility the liquidation of
IPTL was considered by the Tribunal to be when making its Decision, and how much
more remote the Tribunal considered it became in light of the alleged "new" facts; or why

this was considered a ground to reverse its previous decision on jurisdiction.*!”

According to TANESCO, the reversal of its position, in circumstances where it had
previously made clear that it did not have jurisdiction, amounts to a manifest excess of
powers on behalf of the Tribunal.*!? TANESCO argues that the Tribunal's failure to apply

Tanzanian law resulted in it wrongfully assuming jurisdiction under the PPA.*!

ii) SCB HK's arguments

According to SCB HK, TANESCO's arguments appear to be: (i) the Tribunal was wrong
to allow SCB HK to bring a direct claim against TANESCO in its capacity as assignee
of the PPA;*" (ii) the Tribunal was wrong to assume jurisdiction between SCB HK and
IPTL under the Facility Agreement;*"® and (iii) the Tribunal was wrong to reconsider its
Decision that it lacked jurisdiction to order the payment to SCB HK of the outstanding

sum under the PPA.*!”

As to the Tribunal wrongly allowing SCB HK to bring a direct claim against TANESCO,
SCB HK considers that the decision of the Tribunal was a straightforward application of
the rules of assignment, and that these conclusions were reached as a result of the correct

application of Tanzanian law.*!®

In this regard, SCB HK states that the findings which supported the Tribunal's decision

that SCB HK was entitled to bring a direct claim against TANESCO are as follows.*!”

First, SCB HK argues that the assignment of the PPA from IPTL to the Security Agent
(now SCB HK) was a statutory assignment within the meaning of 25(6) of the SCJA, the
legislation in force in Tanzania, and stresses that this point was accepted by TANESCO's
counsel at the March 2013 Hearing. According to SCB HK, the effect of the statutory
assignment was that it took the legal benefit of the PPA, including the right to receive
payments under the PPA and the right to invoke the arbitration agreement contained in

the PPA without joining IPTL to the Arbitration Proceeding.*”°

Second, SCB HK states that the failure to register the charge on book debts meant that
the charge was void against a liquidator or administrator under Section 79 of the
Companies Ordinance, and argues that, since IPTL was not in liquidation or

administration, the charge remained valid.47!

Finally, SCB HK claims that in any event, even if IPTL were in liquidation or
administration, the registration requirement applied to the charge on book debts, not the
entire bundle of security interests granted by the assignment of the PPA. SCB HK's right
to arbitrate under the PPA was severable from any rights which were invalidated by the

registration requirement, and thus remained valid.*”?

345. SCB HK argues that TANESCO has not identified any flaws in the Tribunal's reasoning,

save that it complains that the failure to register the security interest invalidated the

assignment.*??

346. SCB HK also argues that TANESCO cites an extract from Occidental Petroleum v.
Ecuador in paragraph 121 of its Memorial on Annulment, which, if read in isolation, may
suggest that the right to arbitrate under the ICSID Convention cannot be assigned.**4 SCB
HK argues that, if this is TANESCO's submission, then the submission is wrong.*?> SCB
HK explains that the case was making a different point, namely "that the nationality
restrictions under BITs cannot be evaded by bringing a claim in the name of the legal
owner in respect of an investment which is beneficially owned by a national of a third

state not protected by the BIT".476

347. Therefore, SCB HK states that despite the impression that may have been created in

TANESCO's submissions, there was no suggestion in Occidental Petroleum that an

arbitration clause (or the right to arbitrate under the Convention) cannot be assigned.*?”

international law is uncontroversial: as Arbitrator Stern has stated in her Dissent the dominant position in
international law grants standing and relief to the owner of the beneficial interest — not to the nominee. [...]
262. The position as regards beneficial ownership is a reflection of a more general principle of international
investment law: claimants are only permitted to submit their own claims, held for their own benefit, not those
held (be it as nominees, agents or otherwise) on behalf of third parties not protected by the relevant treaty. And
tribunals exceed their jurisdiction if they grant compensation to third parties whose investments are not entitled
to protection under the relevant instrument. 263. This subjective limitation of ICSID jurisdiction is a natural
consequence of international investment law. Arbitral tribunals are not courts of justice holding unfettered
jurisdiction. The role of arbitral tribunals is not to redress torts worldwide. Arbitral tribunals are instruments
created by and subject to the consent of States, as formalized in the relevant instrument, and are only empowered
to adjudicate disputes between protected investors and consenting States. Other disputes are outside their remit.

HK to claim directly against TANESCO in its capacity as the assignee of the PPA, in
SCB HK's view, this submission is wrong.*?5 It explains that, in the Decision on
Jurisdiction, the Tribunal indicated that it could not make the order sought by SCB HK
since determining the amount owing between IPTL and SCB HK would involve a
determination of the parties' rights under the Facility Agreement, rather than a

determination of TANESCO's rights and SCB HK's rights (as assignee) under the PPA.*?°

As to the Tribunal wrongly reconsidering its Decision that it lacked jurisdiction to order
the payment to SCB HK of the outstanding sum under the PPA, SCB HK argues that the
Decision on this point is the result of the fact that in the subsequent phase of the
arbitration, SCB HK instead sought an order for payment of the full amount due under
the PPA, as it was entitled to do under the assignment of the PPA.**° SCB HK states that
in the Award, the Tribunal made an order that TANESCO pay to SCB HK the sum owing
under the PPA. It did not order TANESCO to pay a sum which depended on the amount

owing between IPTL and SCB HK under the Facility Agreement.**!

SCB HK argues that this was a straightforward application of assignment rules, which
permit the legal assignee of a contract to recover sums owing under the contract from the
debtor, without the need to join the assignor/original creditor. In addition, SCB HK states
that, as was clearly explained by Lord Hoffmann in his expert evidence, such an order
does not involve an adjudication of rights between the assignor and the assignee. In SCB
HK's view, it is noteworthy that TANESCO did not adduce expert evidence to challenge

Lord Hoffmann's evidence.**”

351. In the Decision on Jurisdiction,

the Tribunal explicitly declared that it did not have
jurisdiction over the relationship between SCB HK and IPTL which arose under the
Facility Agreement.*™ Therefore, it was not in a position to make an order determining

what amount was allegedly owed by IPTL to SCB HK.

352. In the Decision, the Tribunal decided that: (i) it had jurisdiction over TANESCO and
SCB HK as the assignee of IPTL's rights by virtue of the PPA,*** and (ii) that it was able
to make a declaration of any amount owing by TANESCO to IPTL to which SCB HK
had a claim as assignee of all of IPTL's rights.**° The Tribunal explained that, by
restricting itself to making a declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO under the
PPA and not making any order for payment of monies, it left open the question of priority
amongst creditors in domestic court. According to the Tribunal, an order that TANESCO
pay a specific sum to SCB HK would have potentially interfered with the question of
priority amongst creditors, which was a matter for a liquidator and Tanzanian courts to
decide. By contrast, a declaration that TANESCO owes a specific sum under the PPA.

left to the Tanzanian courts any question of priority amongst creditors.4*”

353. In the Award, the Tribunal concluded, among other matters, that it had jurisdiction to
reopen its Decision on Jurisdiction, and, in addition to making a declaration of the amount
owing by TANESCO to SCB HK, it would also make an order for payment of such
amount.8

354. Based on the above, the Committee is not persuaded that the Tribunal assumed
jurisdiction over the relationship between SCB HK and IPTL under the Facility

Agreement. Both in its Decision on Jurisdiction and in its Award, the Tribunal concluded

 

433 Annex-1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 9239-245.

435 Annex-1, Decision on jurisdiction, 1244.

436 Annex-1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 245.

437 Annex-1, Decision on jurisdiction, 9240-241.

438 Additionally, the Tribunal made the following declarations: (i) that amounts paid by TANESCO into the
Escrow Account did not discharge TANESCO's obligations under the PPA and thus cannot be used to reduce
the amount that TANESCO owes SCB HK, (ii) that payment out of the Escrow Account to IPTL/PAP did not
discharge TANESCO's obligation to SCB HK under the PPA and thus cannot be used to reduce the amount that
TANESCO owes SCB HK, and (iii) that payments made to IPTL/PAP since August 2013 do not discharge
TANESCO's obligation to SCB HK under the PPA and thus cannot be used to reduce the amount that
TANESCO owes SCB HK.

 

 

110

358.

that the sum owed by TANESCO was under the PPA. When it made a declaration for
payment of this amount in favour of SCB HK, it was also under that agreement, as a
result of a straightforward application of assignment rules, which permit the legal
assignee of a contract to recover sums owing under the contract from the debtor, without

the need to join the assignor/original creditor.

Therefore, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not order TANESCO to pay a
sum which depended on the amount owing between IPTL and SCB HK under the Facility

Agreement.

The Committee now turns to the standard of a manifest excess of power as defined in
Section V.B (1). It does not find an "excess" and even less an excess that is "manifest"
regarding the Tribunal's power to decide on its own jurisdiction and to exercise its power
accordingly. The Tribunal restricted itself to act within the confines of the PPA and the
rights and obligations assigned with regard to the PPA. Thus, the Committee finds no
reason to conclude that the Award should be annulled due to a wrong exercise of

jurisdiction by the Tribunal under the Facility Agreement.*”

Whether the reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction amounted to a
manifest excess of powers under which the Award ought to be annulled, was dealt with
as a preliminary issue. The Committee concluded that the Tribunal had the power to
reconsider its prior Decision on Jurisdiction and thus, that the reconsideration did not
amount to a manifest excess of power.*#° In addition to the previous, the Committee
hereby concludes that TANESCO's claim that the Tribunal's reconsideration of its
position to order payment (and therefore its jurisdiction to do so) was not a manifest

excess of powers.
VIL.C Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure

According to TANESCO, certain procedural conduct by the Tribunal vis-a-vis
TANESCO demonstrates a failure of the Tribunal to treat TANESCO in an impartial and

equal fashion.*#! TANESCO states that this conduct consists of: (i) the Tribunal's
reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction; (ii) failure to give TANESCO a proper
opportunity to brief SCB HK's request for reconsideration; and (iii) failure to apply basic

tules on the burden of proof.

1. The existence of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by

improperly reconsidering the Decision on Jurisdiction

i) TANESCO's arguments

In order to establish what rules of procedure are considered to be fundamental,
TANESCO refers to the Total S.A. v. Argentina ad hoc committee, which, as quoted by
TANESCO, stated that "[w]ith respect to the rules of procedure that are to be considered
fundamental, the Committee considers that they are the rules of natural justice i.e., rules
concerned with the essential fairness of the proceeding.... [These] include: (i) the equal
treatment of the parties; (ii) the right to be heard; (iii) an independent and impartial
[t]ribunal; (iv) the treatment of evidence and burden of proof; and (v) deliberations

among members of the [t]ribunal" “4?

In this respect, TANESCO states that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in
improperly reconsidering its prior decision and in doing so also seriously departed from
a fundamental rule of procedure. TANESCO argues that the Tribunal disregarded the
binding and res judicata effect of the Decision, which, in TANESCO's view, also

constitutes an unprecedented denial of the principle of due process.

In support of its argument, TANESCO submits that these principles have been recognised
and applied by well-established ICSID case law and refers the Committee to the
Electrabel v. Hungary case. Therein, according to TANESCO, the tribunal affirmed the
principle of res judicata with respect to decisions under the ICSID Convention, and thus

that a decision cannot be challenged by way of a request for reconsideration.*+

362.

363.

364.

Additionally, TANESCO states that the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary recognized that
its approach was followed subsequently by, inter alia, the tribunal in ConocoPhillips v.

Venezuela.“

TANESCO argues that despite the fact that the Tribunal recognised there was little
arbitral jurisprudence on this question, it decided to disregard the clear decision reached
in ConocoPhillips and Perenco, which, according to TANESCO, were the only two cases

directly concerning the issue of reconsideration at the date of the Award.*#°

Additionally, TANESCO submits that the Tribunal cannot justify its reconsideration of
the Decision on Jurisdiction by referring to Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, which
the Tribunal purported to apply by analogy. According to TANESCO, this is because:
firstly, such provision is evidently not applicable in this case, since it relates to the
revision of final awards; and secondly, the Tribunal failed to satisfy itself that all
requirements under this Article were met. In this regard, TANESCO states that it is
unclear why the Tribunal should be permitted to apply Article 51 by analogy to decisions
but should not be bound by the limitations on reopening that apply to awards nor by the

specific procedures set out in Article 51(1) and 51(4).44”

Referring to Prof. Reinisch's observations with respect to the Perenco tribunal's
discussion of Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, TANESCO states that it is Prof.
Reinisch's opinion that in order to meet the standard of decisively affecting the award
(under Article 51) the newly discovered fact must be of such a nature that it would have
led the tribunal to reach a different opinion had the fact been known to the tribunal at the
time.*48 However, TANESCO claims that the Tribunal's reconsideration was based on
facts that were neither of such a nature as to decisively affect the Award nor were they

unknown to the Tribunal or SCB HK at the time of the Decision.*“” Additionally,

TANESCO argues that, in any event, SCB HK could not have ignored them without

negligence.**°

Furthermore, TANESCO recalls the Tribunal's argument that re-opening decisions serves
the purpose of saving time, and states that this argument is not only feeble, but also that

it amounts to re-writing the ICSID Arbitration Rules and undermines certainty.**!

Finally, TANESCO submits that in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that
its jurisdiction was limited to making a declaration as to amounts owing under the PPA
for a number of reasons, which were: (i) that the Tribunal could not make an order
requiring TANESCO to pay amounts to SCB HK independently of IPTL, as SCB HK
had no rights against TANESCO as the lender to IPTL;*>? and (ii) that if a liquidator or
administrator were appointed in respect of IPTL, "this would only have an impact in
respect of any order of the Tribunal requiring the enforcement of SCB HK's security
interest against IPTL's assets. But for independent reasons, the Tribunal has concluded

that it has no jurisdiction to make such an order in any case".*>*

TANESCO states that these reasons were brushed aside by the Tribunal in the Award,
when it concluded that the Decision had been "based to a significant extent on the
likelihood that priorities of claims would have to be determined in the courts of Tanzania
in the context of appointment of a liquidator".** Thus, TANESCO submits that it is a
serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure for a tribunal to make a decision
based on reasons, and subsequently to reverse that decision, without even addressing

those reasons.*°

TANESCO submits that the Tribunal's reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction

was made not only despite the fact that ICSID tribunals do not have that power under the

ICSID Convention or the ICSID Arbitration Rules, but also, that such reconsideration is
contrary to basic notions of justice and fairness. Thus, it constitutes a serious departure

from a fundamental rule of procedure.*°°

Therefore, TANESCO states that the Committee must conclude that the Tribunal's
actions constituted a "substantial", as opposed to a minor, departure from a rule of
procedure since it has been deprived of the protection the rule was intended to provide,
and that this deprivation constitutes a "substantial" departure from the rules of

procedure.**”

As a result, TANESCO submits that the Award should be annulled in accordance with
Article 52(1)(d) on the basis that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental

rule of procedure.*°*

ii) SCB HK's arguments

SCB HK notes that under Article 52(1)(d), two requirements must be fulfilled for a
committee to find a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: first, that
the rule in question must be so essential that it qualifies as a fundamental rule of
procedure; and second, the tribunal must have committed such a grave violation of a
procedural rule that it constitutes a serious departure from that rule. In support of this,

SCB HK referred to the ad hoc committee in CDC v. Seychelles, and quoted:

"48. ... Not just any departure from any rule of procedure will support
annulment. Prior ad hoc [c]ommittees have held that it is the duty of the
party seeking annulment to ‘identify the fundamental rule of procedure’ and

to show that any departure from it ‘has been serious" .4°°

In this respect, SCB HK argues that TANESCO fails to both identify the fundamental

rule on procedure and to show that any departure was serious.*°

SCB HK states that TANESCO's argument on this point overlaps substantially with its
argument on res judicata and the Tribunal's power to reconsider its Decision on

Jurisdiction, and its arguments concerning the reasons given in the Award.*!

According to SCB HK, TANESCO's arguments that the Tribunal departed from a
fundamental rule of procedure when it reconsidered its Decision on Jurisdiction are based
on the following arguments: (i) the Tribunal's Decision was binding within the scope of
the proceedings and has res judicata effect, irrespective of the fact that the Tribunal's
determination was expressed as a "Decision" rather than an "Award"; (ii) the Tribunal
had no power to reconsider its Decision under the ICSID Convention; (iii) the Tribunal
did not distinguish the ICSID cases of ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela and Perenco v.
Ecuador, which, according to TANESCO, held that a decision is res judicata and an
ICSID tribunal has no power to reconsider a decision; and (iv) the Tribunal therefore had
no power to reverse its finding in the Decision that it had no jurisdiction to make an order

for the payment of amounts owing under the PPA.*°?

SCB HK states regarding the first and second arguments above, that TANESCO does not
identify any specific provision in the ICSID Convention or in the ICSID Arbitration
Rules which supports its assertion that decisions are final and binding and may not be
reconsidered. According to SCB HK, Article 53(1) referred to by TANESCO deals with
awards and not with decisions.“? SCB HK submits that the structure and architecture of
the Convention support the distinction between awards and decisions. SCB HK therefore
claims that, properly construed, the Convention permits a tribunal to reconsider its

decision.“

As to the third argument regarding the ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela and Perenco v.
Ecuador cases, SCB HK asserts that the Tribunal did engage with the Parties' arguments
regarding these cases and did distinguished them but was not convinced by the reasoning

in those cases. The Tribunal explained that tribunals make decisions on procedural

matters and on provisional measures, all of which are subject to review, notwithstanding
the absence of anything in the ICSID Convention authorising this.*°° Thus, it opposed

TANESCO's assertion in this respect.4°

With regard to the fourth argument, SCB HK states that the Tribunal first determined that
it had the power to reopen its Decision, and then specified the limited circumstances
under which it could be reconsidered. It referred to Article 51 of the Convention only as
guidance, explaining that the power to reconsider a decision must at least extend to the
grounds for reopening an award.**’ In SCB HK's view, this is not "writing a new rule"

but applying logical reasoning in resorting to Article 51 by analogy.4*

SCB HK submits that the Tribunal found that it would be justified to reconsider its
Decision if SCB HK could prove that TANESCO deliberately withheld the 2013
Settlement Agreement which was a material fact in the Tribunal's Decision that it had no

jurisdiction to order TANESCO to pay SCB HK under the PPA.*°

SCB HK argues that, after discovery of TANESCO's misrepresentation, SCB HK sought
to explain the errors in the liquidation ground*”°

for the full amount due by TANESCO under the PPA. According to SCB HK, the

and sought an order from the Tribunal

Tribunal concluded that this concern was no longer valid and thus, reconsidered its

Decision. “7! It held that:

"347. ... [T]he facts that [TANESCO] failed to disclose in its December
13, 2013 Letter were material and would have had an impact on its decision
not to make an order for payment. That decision was based to a significant
extent on the likelihood that priorities of claims would have to be

determined in the courts of Tanzania in the context of the appointment of

a liquidator. The facts that [TANESCO] had kept from the Tribunal change

that assumption.

348. ... [The] grounds for reopening [the Tribunal’s] decision not to make
an order for payment of the amount owing by TANESCO to SCB HK
under the PPA have been established. The fact that TANESCO had agreed
to settle the invoice dispute with IPTL on the basis of the full tariff, the fact
that IPTL was now in receipt of sufficient funds to pay its creditors and the
fact that the Escrow Account had been emptied, were all material to the
decision taken by the Tribunal, and all of these facts had been withheld by
[TANESCO] from the Tribunal. [Text in brackets added by the

Committee]".*”

In SCB HK's view, TANESCO's complaint regarding the reconsideration of the Decision
on Jurisdiction is an attempt to challenge the substance of the Tribunal's Award, since,
according to SCB HK, TANESCO claims that the Tribunal was incorrect in making the
findings of fact which let it to reconsider its Decision on Jurisdiction. Therefore,
according to SCB HK, the issue of whether the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in
reconsidering its Decision turns not only on a question of law, but also on a question of

fact.473

SCB HK submits that ad hoc committees have repeatedly stated that the ICSID
annulment process does not provide an appeal against the substantive findings of the
tribunal, and that it is not part of an ad hoc committee's functions to review the tribunal's

decision, still less to substitute its own views for those of the tribunal.47*

As to the findings of facts made by the Tribunal that led to the reconsideration of the
Decision, SCB HK submits that ad hoc committees will not review a tribunal's findings

concerning the appreciation of evidence. SCB HK refers to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1),

which provides that: "[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any

evidence adduced and of its probative value".4”>

Finally, SCB HK addresses TANESCO's allegations that in the Award the Tribunal did
not address the "independent legal bases" that led it not to order payment in the Decision,
such as finding that TANESCO could not be ordered to pay any amount to SCB HK
independently of IPTL.4’° SCB HK explains that these "independent legal bases" are just
expressions of the Tribunal's decision that it could only address debts between
TANESCO and IPTL under the PPA and not debts as between IPTL and SCB HK under
the Facility Agreement. However, SCB HK did not pursue its claim for an amount to
discharge the debt under the Facility Agreement, therefore, the issue did not arise and did

not need to be addressed in the Award.4””

384. Consequently, SCB HK concludes that the Tribunal acted well within its powers and

TANESCO's allegations on this ground must be rejected.*”* In any event, even if there
was a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (which it denies), such a departure

was not serious.*”?

iii) Analysis and Decision of the Committee

385. After considering the Parties' arguments and its previous decision regarding the power of

reconsideration of the Tribunal, the Committee concludes that, by reconsidering its prior
Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal did not depart from a fundamental rule of

procedure. Its reasons are as follows.

386. In the Committee's view, it appears from the drafting history of the ICSID Convention

that the ground of a "serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure" has a wide

connotation, including principles of natural justice, but that not all rules of procedure
would be covered. According to the drafters, the phrase "fundamental rules of procedure"
was a reference to principles. The drafting history thus shows that this ground is

concerned with the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process.**°

387. Ad hoc Committees have established a dual analysis based on the words "serious" and
"fundamental" in this ground, namely: the departure from a rule of procedure must be
serious and the rule must be fundamental.**! Thus, not every departure from any rule of
procedure justifies annulment.*** According to several ad hoc committees, examples of
fundamental rules of procedure concern: (i) the equal treatment of the parties;**? (ii) the
right to be heard;** (iii) an independent and impartial tribunal;*** (iv) the treatment of
evidence and burden of proof;**° and (v) deliberations among members of the tribunal.*®”
Additionally, some ad hoc committees have required that the departure have a material

impact on the outcome of the award for the annulment to succeed.***

388. The Background Paper on Annulment under the ICSID Convention,**? submitted as an
exhibit by one of the Parties, describes the drafting history of the annulment remedy in

the Convention. It states that the task of determining whether a fundamental rule of

procedure has been seriously breached is usually very fact specific, involving an
examination of the conduct of the proceeding before the tribunal.*°° The Committee

shares this view.

As previously concluded, the ICSID Convention is silent on whether a tribunal has the
power to reconsider its prior decisions. This Committee has concluded that the
reconsideration of its Decision on Jurisdiction was within the Tribunal's power under the
ICSID system, under the defined circumstances found by the Tribunal.*?! Decisions of
this kind, even when intended to be binding upon the Parties in the proceeding, are not

res judicata until they are incorporated into the award.

Accordingly, in the present case, the reconsideration of a decision, per se, does not
amount to a ground for annulment under the rubric of "serious departure from a

fundamental rule of procedure”.

The fact that the act of reconsidering is not a ground for annulment on its own, does not
mean that an arbitral tribunal may overlook fundamental rules of procedure during the

. : . . 2
reconsideration process, such as the ones mentioned in paragraph 387 supra.”

The ad hoc Committee notes TANESCO's allegations concerning the Tribunal's: (i)
failure to allow the Parties to properly brief the issue of reconsideration; and (ii) wrong
reversal of the burden of proof. As these are matters that concern the equal treatment of
the Parties and their right to be heard, the Committee must examine whether the Tribunal

violated them.

2. The existence of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by

failing to allow the Parties to brief the issue of reconsideration

(i) The equal treatment of the parties; (ii) the right to be heard; (iii) an independent and impartial Tribunal;

(iv) the treatment of evidence and burden of proof; and (v) deliberations among members of the Tribunal.

121

393. TANESCO states that even if the power to reverse a prior decision exists (which
TANESCO argues it does not), the Tribunal accepted allegations made by SCB HK
without allowing TANESCO to properly address the issue or adduce evidence in
response. TANESCO claims that this is a gross breach of due process and constitutes a

serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.*?

394. TANESCO argues that the Tribunal's "conclusion that grounds for reopening have been
established" suggest: (i) that those grounds exist in the Arbitration Rules and are known
to the Parties, and (ii) that a thorough and fair process to establish those grounds or
otherwise has been followed. In TANESCO's opinion, neither is the case here, thus

constituting a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.***

395. With regards to the application by the Tribunal of Article 51 by analogy, TANESCO
explains that in order for this Article to be applied, it would require, inter alia (i) a fact
which decisively affected the Decision, (ii) a new fact, and (iii) a proper opportunity to
brief.45

396. First, as to a fact which decisively affected the Decision on Jurisdiction, TANESCO
argues that the question of whether payments had been made out of the Escrow Account,
the extent of the agreement between IPTL and TANESCO in October 2013 and the state
of SCB HK's knowledge of these matters, were not decisive to the decision not to order
payment. This is because, in its view, the Tribunal had already concluded that it had
independent grounds for reaching its decision that it had jurisdiction only in relation to

the amount of the tariff, but not to order payment.*%°

only has rights against TANESCO as the assignee of IPTL's rights under the PPA. [...] If a liquidator or
administrator were to be appointed in respect of IPTL, this would only have an impact in respect of any order
of the Tribunal requiring the enforcement of SCB HK's security interest against IPTL's assets. But for
independent reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that it has no jurisdiction to make such an order in any case".

 

 

122

397.

398.

399.

Second, TANESCO states that SCB HK did not discover new facts, as it was fully aware
that an agreement had been reached in October 2013 between TANESCO and IPTL, and
that the escrow monies might be paid out to IPTL as a result. SCB HK elected to take no
substantive action and thus SCB HK's choice not to act is not something which
TANESCO should be permitted to take the blame for.*?’ The Tribunal's decision to focus
on the narrow (and incorrect) finding that "there is no evidence that the [SCB HK] knew
that the escrow account had in fact been emptied" ignored the evidence on the record and
failed to take account of the logical inference that a party aware of the existence of an
escrow held pending full or partial resolution of a dispute would obviously understand

that a full or partial resolution may result in the escrow funds being disbursed.***

Third, regarding the fact that parties must be given proper opportunity to brief,
TANESCO highlights that at the hearing of August 19-21, 2015, the Tribunal for the first
time suo moto invited the Parties to make submissions on the application of Article 51
by analogy. TANESCO argues that the issue was dealt with to the extent possible in the
Parties' submissions on tariff. Furthermore, TANESCO claims that the Tribunal directed
that the post-hearing briefs, which also had to cover any further elaboration of the Parties’
respective arguments and submission on costs, had to be limited to 50 pages. In
TANESCO's opinion, this seriously limited the ability of the Parties to fully address the
issue of the applicability of Article 51 by analogy. TANESCO argues that the process
was not fair and proper. SCB HK's argument that TANESCO could have made

submissions on the applicability of Article 51 in the Tariff Submissions*”” is baseless.*”

Moreover, TANESCO states that the suggestion by the Tribunal that Article 51 could be
applied by analogy raised a novel approach to the Convention, which would at least have
required substantial submissions and consideration. Instead — according to TANESCO —
the Parties were given overnight to prepare their comments. TANESCO's counsel did not

consider that it would be possible meaningfully to make oral submissions on this point

“off the cuff" with such little notice, and so it had no option other than to limit its
submissions on this point to written submissions.*°! TANESCO states that its counsel
noted its concern about the "inadequacy" of SCB HK making oral and written
submissions while TANESCO was able to make submissions only in writing, but that
this was disregarded by the Tribunal. Therefore, in TANESCO's view, it should not be
penalised for not having contemplated the need to make submissions ahead of time on an
argument which, according to TANESCO, runs contrary to all established understandings

of the Convention.

400. In terms of procedure, TANESCO also takes issue with the Tribunal's finding at
paragraph 333 of the Award,>”’ that TANESCO was somehow under a duty or obligation
to the Tribunal to disclose an agreement with a third party because it settled with that
third party on terms that it disputes in the arbitration. *°* According to TANESCO, it was

for SCB HK to ask for the relevant information.*”

401. In addition, TANESCO states that at paragraph 336 of the Award, the Tribunal further
set out its assumption that SCB HK did not have knowledge about the emptying of the

escrow funds.>° According to TANESCO, this was the first time that these issues had

third party on precisely the terms it is disputing under that agreement, then the party has an obligation to disclose
that settlement to the tribunal. It is no answer to fall back on some notion of burden of proof and say that the
other party has an obligation to prove the existence of such an agreement. Silence here was not an option.

been raised, and TANESCO had no chance to make submissions on these crucial points.
TANESCO argues that, in circumstances where SCB HK had knowledge of the 2013
Settlement Agreement, the Tribunal wrongfully concluded that TANESCO had an
obligation to disclose the document, notwithstanding there being no disclosure requests
by SCB HK and no general duty of disclosure. TANESCO also argued that the Tribunal

wrongfully assumed SCB HK's state of knowledge without any evidence on this point.°”

TANESCO argues the Tribunal showed bias against TANESCO in the Award, while
being quick to show SCB HK the benefit of the doubt on issues which the Tribunal rightly
acknowledged were issues in dispute. As an example, TANESCO states that on the
question of whether "...there is proof that SCB HK was aware of the terms of the 2013
Settlement Agreement between TANESCO and IPTL/PAP", the Tribunal willingly
acknowledged that the factual position as set out by the Parties was "unclear and at times
even self-contradictory".*°° However, it "...[had] no difficulty in concluding that the
failure of TANESCO to disclose these facts was anything other than deliberate".°°? In
respect of SCB HK, TANESCO states that the situation was different: it claims that even
though the Tribunal noted that "[i]n its letter of November 27 2013, SCB HK indicates
that it has been informed of the existence of an agreement setting [sic] the tariff dispute
and facilitating the release of the Escrow Funds",°!° it concluded that "... there is no
evidence that the SCB HK knew that the Escrow Account had in fact been emptied".*!!
According to TANESCO, the Tribunal was eager to assume SCB HK's state of
knowledge, despite there being "no evidence", when seeking a reversal of the Decision,

even though it was inconsistent with evidence on the record.>!”

403. TANESCO argues that, in this case, TANESCO did not bear the burden of proof,*'3 and

that the procedural bias and unwarranted actions of the Tribunal constitute a serious

departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.*!+

404. According to TANESCO, although the Tribunal held it was unconvinced, there is proof

that SCB HK was aware of the terms of the settlement agreement. SCB HK was aware
as early as August 2013 that the petition for the winding up of IPTL was being withdrawn
and that the affairs of IPTL would then pass from the Official Receiver and Provisional

Liquidator to PAP!

405. Also, TANESCO maintains that the Tribunal's reversal of its prior Decision on

Jurisdiction is sufficient for this Committee to annul the Award,>!® because the Parties
were not given the opportunity to present expert evidence on this point, and there would
have been no opportunity for the cross-examination of such experts in any event. In
TANESCO's opinion, this amounted to a clear failure by the Tribunal to brief the issue

of reconsideration.>!”

406. TANESCO states that even if (which it denies) Article 51 could be applied by analogy,

TANESCO was not provided sufficient opportunity to brief regarding the state of
knowledge of SCB HK as it pertained to the 2013 Settlement Agreement.>!*

407. Insum, TANESCO states that the Tribunal made these findings unilaterally in the Award

without giving TANESCO the opportunity to brief the issue. TANESCO argues that if it
had been given such an opportunity, it would have pointed out that SCB HK had

knowledge of the 2013 Settlement Agreement, and yet took no action to seek a copy

and/or to obtain an injunction concerning the funds in the Escrow Account. TANESCO
explains that it would therefore have made clear that it had no duty to make SCB HK's
case for it, in circumstances where SCB HK had full ability to make appropriate
submissions about the 2013 Settlement Agreement and the Escrow Account before the
Decision was rendered. TANESCO concludes that on the basis that the Tribunal made
these findings in the Award, without allowing TANESCO to make appropriate

submissions, the Award should be annulled.>!?

ii) SCB HK's arguments

SCB HK notes that, under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, two requirements
must be fulfilled: first, the rule in question must be so essential that it can be qualified as
a fundamental rule of procedure; second, the tribunal must have committed such a grave

violation of a procedural rule that it constitutes a serious departure from that rule.>”°

SCB HK recalls TANESCO's arguments that the Tribunal seriously departed from a
fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention, by failing to
allow TANESCO properly to address the issue of reconsideration of the Decision in
submissions, or to adduce evidence in response to allegations made by SCB HK which
were then relied on by the Tribunal to justify reconsideration of its Decision.*?!

According to SCB HK, TANESCO seeks to advance the following propositions.>””

First, SCB HK states that the points regarding whether Article 51 was applicable by
analogy relate to the substance of the Award, and not to the procedure by which it was
reached. SCB HK argues that just because TANESCO disagrees with the conclusions of
the Tribunal as to the state of the Parties' knowledge (or as to the significance of new
facts to the Decision), it does not follow that the procedure followed by the Tribunal to

reach those conclusions must therefore have been defective.°”*

411. SCB HK argues that, in any event, it did not have knowledge of the relevant facts about

the 2013 Settlement Agreement prior to the publication of the CAG and PAC Reports.*7*4

412. Secondly, SCB HK states that TANESCO had multiple opportunities throughout the
proceedings to make submissions and adduce evidence on the issues relevant to
reconsideration of the Decision, and that in each case TANESCO either took advantage
of those opportunities or voluntarily declined to do so. In SCB HK's view, TANESCO's
suggestions to the contrary are contrived attempts to reinstate the Decision by
circumventing the Tribunal's conclusions on SCB_ HK's_ application for

reconsideration.°”>

413. Thirdly, SCB HK claims that, in the alternative, even if (which it denies) the Tribunal
did not give TANESCO sufficient opportunity to brief the issue of reconsideration,
TANESCO failed to object to this absence of opportunity in a timely manner. SCB HK
states that TANESCO raised no concern as to the sufficiency of the argument on the
matter of reconsideration before the Award was issued and must therefore be deemed,
pursuant to Rule 27 of ICSID Arbitration Rules, to have waived its right to make any

such objection at this stage.**°

414. SCB HK maintains that the allegation that the Parties were not allowed to brief the issue
of reconsideration is patently incorrect. According to SCB HK, the Parties were given a
full opportunity to brief the Tribunal on SCB HK's application for reconsideration of the
Decision, and the question of whether the Tribunal had the legal power to reconsider the
Decision was a central issue in the proceedings from the time of SCB HK's Submissions

on Tariff>” dated November 11, 2014 onwards.>?8

considered the process followed by the Tribunal to be defective. According to SCB HK,
the record shows that TANESCO believed it had sufficient opportunity to present its case.
SCB HK states that it does not follow from the fact that the Tribunal rejected
TANESCO's case that the procedure followed by the Tribunal before doing so was

unfair”?

416. SCB HK maintains that TANESCO had sufficient opportunity to brief and adduce
evidence on the applicability of Article 51 by analogy. In this respect, SCB HK claims
that it first applied for reconsideration of the Decision in its Submissions on Tariff, dated
November 11, 2014. The application from SCB HK included discussion of the
overarching issue of whether, in principle, the Tribunal had the power to reconsider the
Decision, and TANESCO made detailed submissions on this issue in both its Submission
on Tariff (dated February 13, 2015) and its Rejoinder on Tariff**? (dated May 21, 2015).
In SCB HK's opinion, had TANESCO wished to adduce evidence on the possibility of
reconsideration generally, it could have done so, but it did not.>*!

417. SCB HK therefore submits that both TANESCO and SCB HK had two opportunities to
set out their case in writing on this point before the August 2015 Hearing. SCB HK states
that, at the August 2015 Hearing,>*? counsel for TANESCO actually complained that too
much time and effort had been expended on arguments regarding SCB HK's application
for reconsideration, which in TANESCO's view should have been rejected "without even

needing to first hear [TANESCO] on the issue".>**

[SCB HK]'s application for reconsideration without even needing to first hear [TANESCO] on the issue. Just

without hearing Perenco. [Text in brackets added by the Committee]".

   

129

418. According to SCB HK, the specific issue of whether Article 51 of the Convention could
apply by analogy to the Decision was first raised by Professor Stern, member of the

Tribunal, on the first day of the August 2015 Hearing.***

419. SCB HK states that TANESCO's case that it was not given sufficient opportunity to
respond fully to the question, or to adduce evidence in support of its response is

fundamentally flawed.>*°

420. SCB HK argues that the issue was posed by the Tribunal as a purely legal question
regarding the scope of the Tribunal's power under the Convention and was accepted as
such by both counsel for the Parties.**° Accordingly, SCB HK states that it was a matter

for legal submission which did not require reference to additional factual evidence.**”

421. SCB HK states that the question had not previously been addressed by either party, and
the Parties were given the same opportunity to respond to it. According to SCB HK,
TANESCO chose to deal with the matter exclusively in writing in its post-hearing brief
and cannot now contend that it has been the victim of unfairness as a result of its own

decision.***

422. SCB HK states that in its post-hearing brief of November 2, 2015, TANESCO devoted
more than 30 paragraphs to a discussion of Article 51.**? According to SCB HK, only
one of those paragraphs advances an argument that Article 51 of the Convention does not
apply to decisions, and it does so by reference to TANESCO's previous submissions in
the proceedings (to the effect that no remedies exist other than those expressly provided

for in the Convention).“? Further, SCB HK states that the remainder of TANESCO's

submissions on Article 51 were directed to whether the conditions for revision under
Article 51 were satisfied, as opposed to whether it was possible (as a matter of law) to

apply Article 51 by analogy to the Decision in the first place.*4!

423. In consequence, SCB HK claims that it is not open to TANESCO to argue that it was
denied a full opportunity to make submissions on the applicability of Article 51 by
analogy, when it declined the opportunity to do so orally at the August 2015 Hearing. It
agreed to do so in writing and then felt able to do so solely by reference to its earlier

pleadings.**?

424. SCB HK points out that TANESCO also argues that although it did address the Article
51 point in its post-hearing brief, "the process was not fair and proper" due to the
limitation of those briefs to a length of 50 pages. According to SCB HK, TANESCO
describes this as having "seriously limited the ability of the parties to fully address the
issue of the applicability of Article 51".°4? However, SCB HK states that TANESCO has
never before raised any concerns about the page limit and did not request any extension
of that limit before filing its post-hearing brief. Therefore, SCB HK argues that, given
that the Parties were consulted by the Tribunal on the proposed limit after the August
2015 Hearing at which the Article 51 question was raised, this absence of an objection is
striking.** In addition, SCB HK argues that, in its response to the Tribunal's proposal,
on September 11, 2015, TANESCO stated clearly that "[TANESCO] has no objection to
the 50-page limit on the length of the post-hearing briefs proposed by the Tribunal".
According to SCB HK, at this stage, TANESCO knew about the Article 51 issue and

knew that it had agreed to deal with it in the post-hearing brief.*°

131

425. SCB HK argues that the level of detail with which the Article 51 issue was addressed
was therefore a matter of TANESCO's own judgement, and not the result of any

procedural restriction imposed by the Tribunal.*#°

426. In SCB HK's view, it also follows from the above that even if (which it denies) there was
any inadequacy in the procedure by which the Article 51 question was addressed by the
Tribunal, TANESCO has waived any right to object to it>4”

427. Further, SCB HK states that it was not open to TANESCO to wait and see whether the
Award would be in its favour before making a complaint as to the sufficiency of the
opportunity for argument on the point, as it now attempts to do. In support of this
argument, SCB HK quotes the ad hoc committee in Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine as
follows: "a party that is aware of a procedural violation should react immediately by

objecting to the violation ... [A] party that has failed to object to a violation of procedure

before the arbitral tribunal may not rely on this violation as a ground for annulment" .*4*

428. Similarly, SCB HK recalls TANESCO complains that the Tribunal "wrongfully
concluded that TANESCO had an obligation to disclose the [2013 Settlement
Agreement]", without giving TANESCO the opportunity to make submissions on the
existence of any such disclosure obligation.*“? In this respect, SCB HK states that this
argument is based on a misreading of the Award. It states that, as further set out in its
Appendix 5, this was a live issue throughout the tariff phase and both Parties made

extensive submissions on the point.>°

429. According to SCB HK, the Tribunal did not find that TANESCO had an independent

obligation to disclose the 2013 Settlement Agreement or "make SCB HK's case for it".*>!
SCB HK argues, however, that the Tribunal did find that in light of the positive
statements voluntarily made by TANESCO in the December 2013 Letter, TANESCO
could not omit the details of the 2013 Settlement Agreement without misleading the
Tribunal as to the factual position. SCB HK claims that, as set out at Appendix 5,
TANESCO had multiple opportunities to make, and did make, submissions on the issue

of whether the December 2013 Letter was misleading.*>”

430. SCB HK further states that TANESCO had sufficient opportunity to brief and adduce

evidence on the issue of SCB HK's knowledge.**

431. In SCB HK's view, the issue of whether SCB HK had the relevant knowledge (which it
did not in any event) is a matter going to the substance of the Award. SCB HK states that
the relevant question, for purposes of the present application for annulment, is whether
TANESCO was given sufficient opportunity to present its case on the question of SCB
HK's knowledge to the Tribunal and to adduce evidence on the point. SCB HK claims
TANESCO clearly did have such opportunities.***

432. SCB HK's application for reconsideration of the Decision, made in its Submissions on
Tariff dated November 11, 2014, expressly relies on the detail of the 2013 Settlement
Agreement as something which was concealed both from the Tribunal and from SCB
HK.** TANESCO had multiple opportunities to argue in response that these matters had

not been concealed and were known to SCB HK: the point could have been developed in

133

both TANESCO's Submission on Tariff and TANESCO's Rejoinder on Tariff, as well as

at the August 2015 Hearing and in the subsequent post-hearing brief.*°

433. Furthermore, SCB HK asserts that TANESCO did in fact take advantage of these
opportunities to set out its case. In its Rejoinder on Tariff, TANESCO expressly
submitted that "the TANESCO-IPTL Settlement and the release of the monies from the
Escrow Account were known to the parties and the Tribunal at the time the Decision was
issued", and subsequently advanced a number of arguments to support this proposition.**”
Similarly, TANESCO's post-hearing brief dated November 2, 2015 devoted 14
paragraphs over five pages to arguing either that the relevant facts were known to SCB
HK and the Tribunal, or that SCB HK's alleged ignorance of these facts was due to SCB

HK's own negligence.***

434. SCB HK states that, had TANESCO wished to adduce further evidence in support of
these arguments, it could have done so. However, SCB HK submits that TANESCO
made no application to the Tribunal to serve further evidence in advance of the August
2015 Hearing. SCB HK explains that, similarly, in the course of the August 2015
Hearing, TANESCO neither indicated any wish to rely on further evidence, nor expressed
any dissatisfaction with the opportunity afforded prior to the hearing for TANESCO to
put its case on this issue. To the contrary, prior to the August 2015 Hearing, TANESCO.
itself expressly submitted that because "[t]he parties have exchanged two rounds of
written submissions and neither has requested that any witnesses be heard or other
evidence be taken with regard to [SCB HK's application for reconsideration]", the
Tribunal should deal with the application by means of a preliminary ruling on the

papers.°°?

necessarily aware that whatever amount might have been agreed in the TANESCO-IPTL Settlement, such
amount was at least equivalent to the value of the monies deposited in the Escrow Account". [Text in brackets

438.

Thus, in SCB HK's view, TANESCO did have such opportunity (across two rounds of
written argument, a hearing, and a post-hearing brief), and did actually make submissions
on the point. That TANESCO did not attempt to adduce further evidence on this issue
was its own decision, which does not cast any doubt on the fairness or propriety of the

procedure adopted by the Tribunal.*°

Finally, SCB HK states that, in any event, even if (which it denies) TANESCO was not
given sufficient opportunity to brief and adduce evidence on the issue of SCB HK's
knowledge, TANESCO has clearly waived its right to make any objection to this effect.
TANESCO was aware of the argument and evidence which had been put to the Tribunal
on this point before the August 2015 Hearing, and was aware of the significance of the
issue to its case. Had TANESCO considered that the Tribunal did not have sufficient
material before it fairly to determine the state of SCB HK's knowledge, TANESCO
should have raised an objection at that stage. TANESCO did not do so, believing (and
asserting) at the time not merely that the state of the argument and evidence before the
Tribunal was adequate, but in fact that it was sufficient to permit SCB HK's application

to be determined on the papers without any further hearing.**!

iii) Analysis and Decision of the Committee

TANESCO's main argument in support of this ground of annulment is that in deciding
on its power to reverse the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal accepted allegations
made by SCB HK without allowing TANESCO to properly address the issue or adduce
evidence in response. TANESCO claims that this is a gross breach of due process and

constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.*°?

TANESCO argues that, in the Award, the Tribunal's "conclusion that grounds for

reopening have been established" suggests two elements: (i) that those grounds exist in

Order No. 13 dated July 3, 2015, following a hearing organisational meeting which took place by telephone on
July 2, 2015.

the Arbitration Rules and are known to the Parties, and (ii) that a thorough and fair
process to establish those grounds or otherwise has been followed. TANESCO states that
neither was satisfied in this case, constituting a serious departure from a fundamental rule

of procedure.**

In the Committee's opinion, these requisites have been met, and thus there is no departure
from a fundamental rule of procedure, let alone one that could be considered serious.
Regarding the first element, the Committee has already determined that the Tribunal
properly exercised its power to reconsider its Decision and that such power derives from
the Arbitration Rules (discussed above at paragraphs 150-173, thus the first element is

met.

As to the second element, the Committee, having analysed the Award and the
submissions in the Annulment Proceeding, concludes that a fair process was followed by
the Tribunal with respect to the reopening application and the Parties were allowed a due
opportunity to plead their positions, including those regarding the application by the

Tribunal of Article 51 by analogy.

With regard to the application by the Tribunal of Article 51 by analogy, TANESCO has
explained that in order for this Article to be applied, it would require: (i) a fact that
decisively affected the Decision; (ii) a new fact; and (iii) a proper opportunity to brief.

In the Committee's view, all three of these elements have also been satisfied.

First, as to a fact which decisively affected the Decision on Jurisdiction, TANESCO
argues that the question of whether payments had been made out of the Escrow Account,
the extent of the agreement between IPTL and TANESCO in October 2013 and the state
of SCB HK's knowledge of these matters, were decisive to the reversal of the decision
not to order payment. However, the Committee notes that whether Article 51 was
applicable by analogy relates to the substance of the Award, and not to the procedure by

which the Award was reached.

443. Second, the Committee is not in a position to second guess the Tribunal's conclusion that

SCB HK's assertions that it discovered new facts were correct and that they were not

countered by any evidence established on the record.

444. Third, regarding the proper opportunity to brief, the Committee considers that

TANESCO had the opportunity to state its position before the August 2015 Hearing, at
the Hearing and thereafter. That there were restrictions to the timing of these submissions
does not in itself result in a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. This

is demonstrated by a brief recapitulation of the procedure:

- SCB HK first applied for reconsideration of the Decision in its Submissions on
Tariff, dated November 11, 2014. The application from SCB HK included
discussion of the overarching issue of whether, in principle, the Tribunal had the
power to reconsider the Decision.

- TANESCO made detailed submissions on this issue in both its Submission on
Tariff, dated February 13, 2015 and its Rejoinder on Tariff, dated May 21, 2015.

- At the August 2015 Hearing, counsel for TANESCO actually complained that too
much time and effort had been expended on arguments regarding SCB HK's
application for reconsideration, which in TANESCO's view should have been
rejected "without even needing to first hear [TANESCO] on the issue [Text added
by the Committee]".>©

- The specific issue of whether Article 51 of the Convention could apply by analogy
to the Decision was first raised by Professor Stern, on the first day of the Hearing.»

- TANESCO chose to deal with the matter exclusively in writing in its post-hearing

brief and made no objection to the page limit proposed by the Tribunal.

TANESCO did in fact take advantage of these opportunities to set out its case. In its
Rejoinder on Tariff, TANESCO expressly submitted that "the TANESCO-IPTL
Settlement and the release of the monies from the Escrow Account were known to the
[P]arties and the Tribunal at the time the Decision was issued", and subsequently
advanced a number of arguments to support this proposition.*” Similarly, TANESCO's
post-hearing brief dated November 2, 2015 devoted over five pages to arguing either that
the relevant facts were known to SCB HK and the Tribunal, or that SCB HK's alleged

ignorance of these facts was due to its own negligence.

In the Committee's view, it is important that TANESCO did not request more time or an
additional opportunity to brief the issue, whether through submissions or at a subsequent
hearing, or to present factual or expert evidence on the reconsideration of the Decision
or on the Article 51 application by analogy. Thus, the Committee considers that
TANESCO, pursuant to Rule 27 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, waived its right to make
any such procedural objections later on in the arbitration or annulment proceeding. As
stated by the ad hoc committee in Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine: "a party that is aware of
a procedural violation should react immediately by objecting to the violation ... [A] party
that has failed to object to a violation of procedure before the arbitral tribunal may not

rely on this violation as a ground for annulment".>°

The Committee does not find bias against TANESCO in the Award and considers that a
reasonable explanation was given for the assessment of the evidence on the record and

the allocation of the burden of proof.

The Committee, having reviewed Appendix 5 to SCB HK's Rejoinder on Annulment, is

further convinced that TANESCO had multiple opportunities to make, and did make,

  

submissions on whether the December 2013 Letter was misleading and had suffici

necessarily aware that whatever amount might have been agreed in the TANESCO-IPTL Settlement, such
amount was at least equivalent to the value of the monies deposited in the Escrow Account").

opportunity to brief and adduce evidence on the issue of SCB HK's knowledge of the

facts.5°

The Committee further determines that the issue of whether SCB HK had any relevant
knowledge is a matter going to the substance of the Award. For purposes of the present
Application for Annulment, the question is whether TANESCO was given sufficient
opportunity to present its case to the Tribunal on the question of SCB HK's knowledge
and to adduce evidence on this point. In the Committee's view, it did have sufficient
opportunity to argue that these matters had not been concealed and were known to SCB
HK. The point could have been developed in both TANESCO's Submission on Tariff and
TANESCO's Rejoinder on Tariff, as well as at the August 2015 Hearing and in the
subsequent post-hearing brief. In conclusion, the Committee does not find any departure

from a fundamental rule of procedure in connection with the present allegation.

3. The existence of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by
reversing the burden of proof without giving TANESCO the opportunity to brief
this point

i) TANESCO's arguments

According to TANESCO, the Tribunal unilaterally took the decision to reverse the
burden of proof without giving TANESCO the opportunity to brief this point. TANESCO
explains that these were crucial questions that the Parties should have had a chance to

fully brief and adduce witness evidence on.°””

TANESCO refers to the Tribunal's argument that SCB HK could not have known about
these facts, otherwise it is "illogical" that it would not have made its case sooner. In
response, it states that whether illogical, erroneous, tactical, or somehow influenced by
SCB HK's strategy in the complex web of parallel proceedings in multiple jurisdictions,
it is not for the Tribunal to perfect a party's case, or to make assumptions about SCB HK's

knowledge without further evidence.°”!

455.

TANESCO argues that SCB HK failed to make a point at the relevant time (for whatever
reason) and failed to do so despite its knowledge which (at least) was undeniably

sufficient to request documents from TANESCO.>””

TANESCO also argues that the Tribunal wrongly reversed the burden of proof by putting
the burden upon TANESCO to prove facts upon which SCB HK relied. It considers that
SCB HK bore that burden of proof when seeking to rely on these facts to prove its case,
after giving TANESCO an opportunity to respond in full. Upon SCB HK's request to
reopen the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal shifted the burden of proof onto
TANESCO to prove that SCB did have knowledge of the facts. At paragraph 341 of the
Award, "the Tribunal concludes that [TANESCO] has failed to prove that SCB HK had
knowledge of the facts which [TANESCO] had withheld from the Tribunal in its
December 13, 2013 Letter".5”

TANESCO states that without being allowed to make submissions on the point, the
Tribunal unilaterally took in the Award the decision to reverse the burden of proof. On
the basis of an incorrect assumption of lack of knowledge by SCB HK, the Tribunal held
that TANESCO should prove that SCB HK did have knowledge of the facts. SCB HK
alleged misrepresentation in TANESCO's letter dated December 13, 2013 in order to
bypass the issue of knowledge or somehow to negate its "negligence" in not seeking
disclosure. The Tribunal wrongly endorsed this approach. Accordingly, TANESCO

concludes that the Award should be annulled.°”4

ii) SCB HK's arguments

SCB HK explains that the burden of proof was correctly allocated to TANESCO to show
that SCB HK had knowledge of the relevant facts, e.g. the 2013 Settlement Agreement

and the payments from the Escrow Account.>”>

SCB HK argues that TANESCO had actively and knowingly misled the Tribunal as to
the likelihood of a liquidator or administrator of IPTL being appointed in the future.
Accordingly, the burden on SCB HK was to prove that the alleged representations were
made, that they were false, and that TANESCO knew them to be false. SCB HK duly

discharged this burden in its submissions to the Tribunal.>”°

In SCB HK's view, the relevant aspect of TANESCO's defence is its assertion that SCB
HK and the Tribunal could not have been misled by the representations because they had
knowledge of the relevant facts. SCB HK states that the burden to prove this lies with
TANESCO, because it was an element of its positive argument to refute SCB HK's
claims. It was not for SCB HK to prove a negative statement (that it did not have
knowledge of the facts), merely because TANESCO made an assertion to the contrary.
TANESCO put forward the allegation that SCB HK's misrepresentation argument could
not succeed because SCB HK had knowledge of the true facts and, as TANESCO itself

observes, "the burden lies with the party seeking to prove the allegation".*””

SCB HK explains that the Tribunal did not reverse the burden of proof by so finding, but
rather determined simply that TANESCO had failed to discharge a burden of proof which

properly rested with it.°7*

Finally, even if (which is denied) insufficient opportunity was given for the Parties to
brief any issue in the Arbitration Proceeding, and this constituted a departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure, SCB HK asserts that the departure was not serious. SCB
HK states that the Arbitration Proceeding was conducted according to an entirely
conventional procedural timetable, and the Parties' submissions were structured in an

entirely conventional way.*”? Even if certain issues could have been ventilated further,

the Parties had the opportunity to make, and did make, detailed submissions on the key

points relied on in the Award.>*°

In summary, SCB HK states that had TANESCO believed that the manner in which issues
were being addressed constituted a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, or
that any such departure was serious, TANESCO would have raised an objection while
the proceedings were pending. That TANESCO did not do so indicates that either there
was no departure, or it was not serious, and by reason of its silence TANESCO has now
waived any right it had to object to any such procedural violation as may (which is

denied) have occurred.**!

iii) Analysis and Decision of the Committee

After considering the position of the Parties, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal
properly determined that the burden to prove SCB HK's knowledge was with TANESCO,
because it was an element of the positive argument made by it to refute SCB HK's claims.
It was not for SCB HK to prove a negative, given that the "the burden lies with the party

seeking to prove the allegation".>*

In conclusion, the Committee considers that there was no departure from a fundamental

tule of procedure, or that any such departure was serious.
VLD Failure to state reasons on which the Award is based

In this section, the Committee will address the Parties' arguments regarding the Tribunal's
failure to state reasons on which the Award is based, invoked by TANESCO as a ground

for annulment according to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.

i) TANESCO's arguments
a) The standard of the "failure to state reasons" ground

TANESCO submits that, pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, a party
may request annulment of an award if the award has failed to state the reasons on which
it is based. TANESCO further states that this follows from Article 48(3) of the
Convention, which obliges a tribunal to ensure that an award "shall state the reasons upon
which it is based", and also from ICSID jurisprudence, which has confirmed that an
award must "enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact

and law".583

According to TANESCO, ICSID jurisprudence also confirms that reasons which are
contradictory are akin to a failure to state reasons given that "two genuinely contradictory
reasons cancel each other out".>* It refers to the ad hoc committee in the MINE case,
where, according to TANESCO, "...the ad hoc committee stated that an award must be
sufficiently clear so as to enable a reader to understand how the tribunal proceeded from
'A to B' and that this 'minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either

contradictory or frivolous reasons".>*°

b) The Tribunal's failure to state reasons on which the Award is based by holding on
purely formalistic grounds that SCB HK had made an investment within Article

25(1) of the Convention

TANESCO submits that the Tribunal's analysis of whether there was an investment rested
on purely formalistic grounds with no engagement of the Tribunal as to whether SCB
HK's alleged investment satisfied the threshold of an investment under Article 25(1) of

the ICSID Convention or as required under the Salini test and ICSID jurisprudence.>*°

467. In this respect, TANESCO states that it is clear that the transaction in this case did not
constitute an investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention, and that the Tribunal's
conclusion on this issue is wrong, however, the Committee does not need to go this far
in its analysis. According to TANESCO, the Committee needs simply to consider
whether the Tribunal has complied with Article 48(3) of the Convention and has therefore

ensured that the Award states the reasons upon which it is based.>*”

468. TANESCO argues that given the complex considerations which are involved in
determining whether there was an investment on the specific facts, the Tribunal's cursory
consideration of this issue is wholly insufficient for TANESCO or any other party to

understand the reasons for the Tribunal's conclusions.***

469. Furthermore, TANESCO submits that SCB HK's arguments that the Tribunal's reasoning

was perfectly adequate on this issue are inadequate as well for the following reasons.**?

470. First, TANESCO states that SCB HK's assertion that there was "plainly a legal dispute
arising from an investment" is unsubstantiated. TANESCO submits that SCB HK's
speculative acquisition of a distressed debt, at a substantive discount, plainly cannot

constitute an investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention.*”

471. Second, TANESCO submits that further to SCB HK's claim that it gave reasons as to
why it considered that the investment requirement was satisfied, the adequacy of these
submissions is irrelevant.*?'! TANESCO elaborates that the Parties’ submissions on this
issue as well as whether the Tribunal read and considered those submissions are
irrelevant, since TANESCO is raising this argument on the basis that the Tribunal itself

failed to state reasons why it concluded that there was an investment. Accordingly,

587 TANESCO's Reply on Annulment, 247; TANESCO's Memorial on Annulment, §202. As to the reasons
why TANESCO considers that there was no investment and thus that the Tribunal reached a mistaken
conclusion, TANESCO refers the Committee to [101-116 of its Memorial.

475.

TANESCO states that what is of paramount importance is whether the Tribunal's

reasoning on an issue is clear.>°”

TANESCO explains that the Tribunal dedicated a 56-word paragraph to the fundamental
issue of the existence of an investment and provided no reasoning as to why it considered
SCB HK had one.**? According to TANESCO, in that paragraph the Tribunal merely
asserted that it was "satisfied" that by virtue of the purchase of outstanding debt due under
loans to IPTL, and the assignment of the rights under the relevant agreements, SCB HK
had an investment. Nevertheless, TANESCO argues that there were numerous valid
reasons why SCB HK did not make a qualifying investment under the ICSID Convention,

and the Tribunal failed to consider a single one.>**

Thus, TANESCO submits that the Tribunal merely restated a factual situation that SCB
HK had purchased the outstanding debt due under loans to IPTL — without engaging in

any consideration of the requirements of what constitutes an investment.°*>

Lastly, TANESCO opposes SCB HK's assertion that TANESCO raised no objections to
the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the Convention.** According to
TANESCO, it made clear in its submissions that it did not consider the distressed debt to
amount to a qualifying investment. In support of this, TANESCO refers the Committee
to paragraphs 156-187 of its Reply on Annulment, where, among other things, it argues
that it questioned the nature of the transaction during the course of the underlying

proceedings, and reserved its rights concerning the Tribunal's jurisdiction.°””

TANESCO states that, in any event, the objective requirements of Article 25(1) should
have been taken into account by the Tribunal irrespective of the arguments made by the

Parties. According to TANESCO, had the Tribunal performed a thorough examination

of the relevant transactions to determine whether or not there was a qualifying

investment, it would have concluded that there was no such investment.>%

Consequently, TANESCO submits that the Award should be annulled for failure to state
reasons on which it is based regarding the Tribunal's conclusion that SCB HK had made

an investment within Article 25(1) of the Convention»?

c) The Tribunal's failure to take into account additional and decisive evidence

regarding the Parties interest in the Escrow Account

TANESCO states that the Tribunal failed to take into consideration additional decisive
evidence submitted by TANESCO regarding the Parties’ interest in the Escrow Account,
specifically showing that SCB HK had declared that it had no interest in the funds of the
account, and that, contrary to SCB HK's assertions, the release of these funds did not end

the Tariff Dispute.°”

TANESCO argues that it exhibited an email from SCB HK dated December 6, 2013,
which purported to explain the "purpose and scope" of SCB HK's November 27, 2013
letter.©! By this email, SCB HK confirmed that it did not consider the Tribunal had
jurisdiction with respect to the Escrow Account, and stated that: "[f]or the avoidance of
doubt, SCB HK accepts that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction in respect of the
Escrow Agreement. SCB HK does not assert any claim in this arbitration to the monies
held in the Escrow Account; nor does it contend that the Escrow Agreement is relevant
to the matters to be determined by this Tribunal in its award. However, SCB HK reserves
the right to seek relief against the funds in the Escrow Account in other proceedings,
including in any proceedings seeking enforcement of any award by this Tribunal in SCB

HK's favour".

TANESCO asserts that this statement was effectively a waiver by SCB HK, which should
have precluded SCB HK from asserting that the Escrow Account was material to the
Tribunal's determinations in the proceedings. The Tribunal failed to pay attention to this
waiver. Instead, it asserted that, despite SCB HK's self-declared lack of interest in the
Escrow Account, TANESCO's silence regarding the Escrow Account was a relevant

factor in its decision to reconsider the Decision.©™

Additionally, TANESCO states that in further seeking to justify its reconsideration of the
Decision, the Tribunal held at paragraph 345 of the Award what it claimed it knew or
believed at the time of the Decision and which includes "...that some protection for the
interests of SCB HK in collecting any judgment remained because of the existence of
funds within the Escrow Account". In TANESCO's view, it was never appropriate for the
Tribunal to treat the Escrow Account as some additional security for SCB HK,
particularly given that it recognised that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction over the escrow

and SCB HK had no rights over the funds therein.6™*

Thus, TANESCO submits that the Tribunal apparently disregarded this important

evidence and failed to give reasons for doing so.°°>

d) The Tribunal's failure to take into account the evidence presented by TANESCO on

the continuing existence of the Tariff Dispute

TANESCO states that the Tribunal was presented with evidence demonstrating that
negotiations regarding the level of the tariff payable under the PPA by TANESCO to

IPTL were ongoing and that the Tariff Dispute was not settled in full.

According to TANESCO, the evidence presented proved that elements of the nine-year
long dispute between TANESCO and IPTL continued after the signing of the 2013

Settlement Agreement and the release of the funds in the Escrow Account, and that they

are still ongoing to this day.”

In this respect, TANESCO submits that whilst the Tribunal did set out the Parties’
arguments in paragraphs 183 to 198 of its Award, including TANESCO's arguments that
elements of the dispute continued notwithstanding the 2013 Settlement Agreement, it
failed to deal with these in paragraph 331 of its Award, by which it simply stated that

there had been a settlement.°*

Consequently, TANESCO submits that the Tribunal disregarded this evidence and failed

to explain its reasons for doing so.°?

e) The Tribunal's failure to take into account contradictory evidence concerning SCB

HR's knowledge of the status of the Escrow Account

TANESCO maintains that the Tribunal failed to take into account contradictory evidence

concerning SCB HK's state of knowledge of the emptying of the Escrow Account.*!?

As a starting point, TANESCO recalls the Tribunal's assertion at paragraph 336 of the
Award, where it found that: "...there is no evidence that [SCB HK] knew that the Escrow
Account had in fact been emptied".°!! However, it also identifies that the Tribunal noted
that: "...the fact that the Administrative Receiver, Martha Renju, had a copy of the
agreement when she filed a request for an injunction to prevent the monies in the Escrow
Account from being dispersed, some ten days before [SCB HK] wrote its November 27
letter that [SCB HK] must have had some knowledge of the 2013 Settlement

Agreement".°!?

488. TANESCO further explains that it submitted evidence of direct knowledge of the
managing director of SCB HK, Mr Joseph Casson, regarding the release of the funds,
from November 13, 2013 at the latest, well before the Decision on Jurisdiction was
issued. Here, TANESCO refers the Committee to paragraph 337 of the Award, where the
Tribunal stated: "[TANESCO] also refers to negotiations between Mr. Casson of SCB
HK and Mr Sethi of PAP on November 13, 2013, as related by Mr. Casson in his witness
statement in proceedings before the Commercial Court in London where he stated that
during such negotiations: 'it was made clear [to him] by Mr Sethi that 'there was no cash
available to SCB HK because USD$75,000,000 was being paid to settle PAP's purchase
of VIP's 30% shareholding in IPTL' and that SCB HK [would have] received no cash
now because (Mr Sethi said) none of the USD$100,000,000 sitting in the escrow account
would be left after paying VIP, the Tanzania Revenue Authority and ‘other creditors' [text

in brackets added by the Committee]".°!?

489. According to TANESCO, it is undeniable based on Mr Casson's evidence that SCB HK
knew that the Escrow Account was likely to be emptied or already had been emptied.
TANESCO further states that even the Tribunal acknowledged that this information
might have prompted SCB HK's letter to the Tribunal on November 27, 2013.°!

490. Additionally, TANESCO opposes SCB HK's statement that there was an "obvious mix-
up" by the Tribunal in its finding that Ms Renju had a copy of the 2013 Settlement
Agreement by November 17, 2013 at the latest.°'* TANESCO considers that, in any

event, it is a matter of record that SCB HK had knowledge of the existence of the

615 TANESCO's Reply on Annulment, 261, referring to SCB HK's Counter-Memorial, 459, where SCB HK
stated that: "Tanesco first complains about the Tribunal's consideration of the evidence that Ms Renju ‘had a
copy of the settlement agreement’ when she filed an injunction to prevent the dissipation of the Escrow Account.
This argument is opportunistic and cynical in that it relies on an obvious mix-up by the Tribunal about the
agreement that was available to Ms Renju and the timing of her injunction application. As footnote 421
(paragraph 336) of the Award correctly records, the injunction application was made on 6 September 2013 (i.e.
before the October 2013 Agreement settling the Tariff Dispute) and the application exhibited the PAP-VIP SPA
of August 2013, not the October 2013 Agreement. As discussed above in paragraph 153, it is important to
distinguish between these agreements, notwithstanding Tanesco's efforts to take advantage of the confusion";

agreement by its letter dated November 27, 2013, so the question of whether Ms Renju

did have a copy of it 10 days earlier is ultimately moot.°'®

According to TANESCO, SCB HK's letter of November 27, 2013 confirmed that it knew
that TANESCO had entered into an agreement with IPTL that purported to settle the
outstanding tariff payment under the PPA, thereby facilitating release of the funds placed
in escrow by the GoT as security for TANESCO's obligations under the PPA.°!”
TANESCO quotes this letter as follows:

"[SCB HK has been informed that TANESCO] has now entered into an
agreement with IPTL (through PAP) that purports to settle the outstanding
tariff payments under the PPA that are in issue in these proceedings,
thereby facilitating release of the funds placed in escrow by the GoT as

security for Tanesco's obligations under the PPA".°!®

In TANESCO's view, this letter could not be clearer: SCB HK knew of the existence of
the 2013 Settlement Agreement and recognised that it permitted the release of the funds
from the Escrow Account and that this might well be emptied imminently.°!? TANESCO
argues that despite knowing this, SCB HK took no action either to obtain a copy of the

2013 Settlement Agreement, or injunct the monies in the Escrow Account.®?

On this point, TANESCO argues that even SCB HK's own counsel admitted that "[i]t
may have been a tactical error" on his part not to seek disclosure and make further
inquiries regarding said agreement. In this respect, TANESCO submits that, on the
contrary, SCB HK made clear its intention not to interfere with the escrow funds, stating

that the Escrow Account was not relevant to the issues in dispute.°?!

However, TANESCO states that SCB HK cannot rely on a "tactical error" to hide its own
procedural negligence or otherwise.°? Consequently, TANESCO states that Mr Casson's
evidence coupled with SCB HK's November 27, 2013 letter leave no doubt that the
existence of the 2013 Settlement Agreement and the status of the Escrow Account were

well known to both SCB HK and the Tribunal before the Decision was issued."

TANESCO argues that there is simply no reason why SCB HK or the Tribunal could not
have requested further information at that time. TANESCO explains that, instead, the
Tribunal came to the conclusion that although "with hindsight SCB HK might have
wished that it pushed further", the Tribunal's view that the December 2013 letter was
misleading somehow excused SCB HK's negligence in failing to make further disclosure
enquiries.°*

TANESCO submits that although it seemed the Tribunal was unable to understand why
SCB HK, if it had known of the existence of the 2013 Settlement Agreement, which
TANESCO states it did, would not have sought to capitalise on its knowledge of said
agreement prior to the issuance of the Decision, it hurriedly dismissed the evidence
merely labelling SCB HK's procedural negligence as a "tactical mistake", stating that it
was "not entirely clear" and that "it [was] inconceivable that the [SCB HK] would not
have sought to capitalise on that reversal..."°°° Nevertheless, TANESCO argues that
"[w]hether illogical, an error, tactical, or somehow influenced by SCB HK's strategy in
the complex web of parallel proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, it is not for the Tribunal
to perfect a party's case, or to make assumptions about SCB HK's knowledge without

evidence".

In TANESCO's view, the Tribunal simply did not properly consider the evidence on this
point. Further, the Tribunal: (i) did not provide reasons for coming to the conclusion that

SCB HK did not know about the terms of the 2013 Settlement Agreement despite

TANESCO's position that SCB HK had made a statement that it did know about it;627
and (ii) did not give reasons as to why it interpreted the evidence of Mr Casson in the
way that it did, stating that the Tribunal noted that Mr Casson had learned there "was an
intention to pay US$ 75 million to settle PAP's purchase of VIP's shareholding and that
after that was done nothing would be left of the US$ 100 million that was in the escrow

account".©?8

On this point, TANESCO argues that SCB HK's attempts to convince the Committee that
the Tribunal "carefully considered the evidence about Mr Casson's knowledge” are

insincere and misleading.”

Consequently, TANESCO submits that the Tribunal came to a one-sided conclusion
without explaining why it was disregarding the clear evidence before it and thus, that the
lack of reasoning in the Tribunal's Award and presumption that SCB HK did not have
knowledge despite its own admission that it did, is in itself a reason why the Award

should be annulled.°?

Sf) The Tribunal's reversal of its earlier decision that it had no jurisdiction over claims

relating to the Facility Agreement

TANESCO explains that the Tribunal based its reconsideration on the existence of the
2013 Settlement Agreement between TANESCO and IPTL to settle the Tariff Dispute
and on the fact that the Escrow Account had been emptied, stating that it considered such
premises to be “all material to the decision taken by the Tribunal" and that "all of these

facts had been withheld by [TANESCO] from the Tribunal".°?!

However, TANESCO states that the Tribunal concluded in the Decision that its

jurisdiction was limited to making a declaration as to amounts owed by TANESCO to

IPTL, on legal bases which, according to TANESCO, are completely independent from

those which subsequently led the Tribunal to reconsider the scope of its jurisdiction.”

In support of this, TANESCO quotes the Decision on Jurisdiction as follows: "[t]he
Tribunal has concluded elsewhere that, in so far as SCB HK has stepped into the shoes
of IPTL in respect of its rights under the PPA, this Tribunal only has jurisdiction in
respect of IPTL's rights against TANESCO under the PPA. As will be discussed later,
this means that the Tribunal can make a declaration as to any amounts owed by
TANESCO to IPTL, but it cannot make an order requiring TANESCO to pay any such
amounts to SCB HK independently of IPTL. SCB HK has no rights as against TANESCO.
as the lender to IPTL in these arbitration proceedings; it only has rights against

TANESCO as the assignee of IPTL's rights under the PPA".°?

Accordingly, TANESCO submits that the fact that the Tribunal only premised its
reconsideration of the scope of its jurisdiction on one of the legal bases on which it had
previously established it, without addressing or rejecting the other independent legal
bases taken into account in its Decision, should also lead to annulment for failure to state

reasons.°*+

g) The Tribunal's holding that the tariff must be calculated on the basis of an "IRR"

of 22.1% which directly contradicted its earlier finding that this rate cannot apply

TANESCO explains that, in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that,
before it could quantify the amount owing by TANESCO under the PPA, the tariff must
have been recalculated to reflect the fact that IPTL's equity contribution was not in the

form of paid-up share capital but, rather, was by way of a shareholder loan.*°

TANESCO further explains that the Tribunal encouraged the Parties to seek to agree the

basis on which the recalculation should be carried out and, in so doing, it set out its

position which the Parties were asked to adhere to when seeking an agreement.
According to TANESCO, the Tribunal concluded that it did "not believe that a tariff of
22.31% would be appropriate" as it had rejected the premise on which the tariff was

based, that an equity contribution could be made by way of a shareholder loan.°*°

However, TANESCO states that, in the Award, the Tribunal's determination that the tariff
must be recalculated on the basis of an IRR of 22.31% applied to a shareholder loan
directly contradicts the previous finding of the Tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction,

in which it concluded that an IRR of 22.31% would not be appropriate.°*”

TANESCO states that it has brought this inconsistency to the Tribunal's and SCB HK's
attention, but that this was dismissed by the Tribunal in the Award without adequate
reasons.°** TANESCO explains that, in dismissing its objection to the Tribunal's change
in position, the Tribunal asserted that its new approach was consistent with the conclusion

adopted by TANESCO's expert, Mr David Ehrhardt, in his expert report.®?

Additionally, TANESCO states that the Tribunal concluded that the entire purpose of the
recalculation of the tariff was to ensure that tax savings were transferred to TANESCO.
In this respect, TANESCO accepts that the Tribunal considered arguments on the issue
of the potential tax savings under differing tariffs, however, it states that the Tribunal's
reasoning for reversing its decision on the appropriateness of the 22.31% tariff is unclear

and contradictory.”

On this point, TANESCO argues that the Tribunal sought to justify its decision on an
expert report that pre-dates both the Award and the Decision on Jurisdiction. It states that
the evidence on which the Tribunal relied was fully before it at the time it made its earlier

contradictory decision.*! Consequently, TANESCO submits that it is unclear why the

Tribunal reached a wholly different conclusion as to the nature and level of the tariff in
its Award, despite having referred to evidence which was already in its possession at the

time it issued the Decision on Jurisdiction.“

Further, TANESCO submits that in a recent ICSID annulment decision, an ad hoc
committee decided that an award should be annulled because the tribunal had reached a
decision on the basis of an element that it had previously rejected. According to
TANESCO, in the present case, the Tribunal effectively dismissed — or at least
determined irrelevant or inapplicable — Mr Ehrhardt's expert evidence in its Decision on
Jurisdiction, and then sought to rely in the Award on the very same evidence to justify

why it had formed an entirely different view on the same issue.°**

Finally, TANESCO states that, as noted in Vivendi,“ the failure to state reasons: (i) must
leave a point lacking in any expressed rationale; and (ii) that point must be necessary to
the tribunal's decision. TANESCO claims that it is beyond doubt that consideration of
the level of the tariff is fundamental to the case and the Tribunal's reasoning as to its
ultimate conclusion must be readily apparent. It claims that the change in the Tribunal's
approach to the level of tariff to be imposed has no clear rationale and that the Tribunal's

reasoning as to why it reached the decision it did is impossible to follow.©*°

Consequently, TANESCO concludes that for all the reasons mentioned above, the Award
should be annulled on the basis that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons for applying a

tariff of 22.31%.

SCB HK recalls TANESCO's assertions that an award "must enable the reader to follow
the reasoning of the tribunal on points of fact and law", that it must be sufficiently clear
so as to enable a reader to understand how the tribunal proceeded from A to B and that
this "minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or
frivolous reasons".°4” SCB HK also recalls TANESCO's submission that reasons which
are contradictory are akin to a failure to state reasons since they "cancel each other
out",

In this respect, SCB HK submits that, while it agrees with these general statements of
principle, it also notes that not only did the ad hoc committee in MINE v. Guinea find
that the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow
how the tribunal proceeded to its conclusion, this committee also clarified that the
requirement to state reasons is a minimum requirement that is fulfilled even if the tribunal

made an error of fact or law.”

In support of this, SCB HK refers to the ad hoc committee in Vivendi I, which stated that:
"...it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a
failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state
correct or convincing reasons..."°°° In this respect, SCB HK argues that, as noted by the
ad hoc committee in MTD v. Chile, the test for failure to state reasons under said Article

is an absence rather than inadequacy or brevity of reasoning.**!

Additionally, SCB HK submits that not only must there be a failure to state any reasons,

but that the reasons themselves must be necessary to the tribunal's decision.*? On this

point, SCB HK referred the Committee to Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine, where the ad hoc
committee concluded that annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention should
only occur when two conditions are met: (i) the failure to state reasons must leave the
decision on a particular point essentially lacking of any expressed rationale; and (ii) that

point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision.°?

517. Further, SCB HK states that an evaluation of a tribunal's reasoning carries the risk of
blending into an examination of the award's substantive correctness, and hence to
crossing the border between annulment and appeal.°* SCB HK quotes here the ad hoc
committee in El Paso v. Argentina, which concluded that: "...there is no ground for
annulment of the award if it is based on an alleged inaccuracy of the arbitral tribunal's

reasoning or because the reasons underlying its decisions were not convincing to the

Party requesting the annulment of the [a]ward".°>

518. As to the existence of contradictory reasons, SCB HK states that the test for a finding of
such a nature is very high. In this respect, SCB HK argues that the ad hoc committee in
Rumeli v. Kazakhstan found that "...it is not clear that contradictory reasons constitute a

failure to state reasons unless they completely cancel each other out and therefore amount

to a total absence of reasons. It is believed that such cases would be extremely rare".°*°

519. In addition, SCB HK states that a similar conclusion was reached in Continental Casualty

v. Argentina, where the ad hoc committee concluded that "...[i]n cases where it is merely

 

arguable whether there is a contradiction of inconsistency in the tribunal's reasoning, it
is not for an annulment committee to resolve that argument. Nor is it the role of an

annulment committee to express its own view on whether or not the reasons given by the

tribunal are logical or rational or correct".°7

520. Thus, SCB HK submits that any allegation of contradictory reasoning must be examined
in context. According to SCB HK, this was explained by the ad hoc committee in Daimler
Finance AG v. Argentina, which found that the reasons in an award must be examined
with due regard to their context, highlighting an annulment committee's duty to satisfy

itself that these reasons have the effect of cancelling each other out, leaving the decision

without any rational basis, before it proceeds to annul it.>*

521. SCB HK further argues that, in any event, a tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the
award and the ad hoc committee may clarify and explain those reasons in its decision
without adding new elements previously absent rather than annul the award. SCB HK
states that this was explained by the ad hoc committee in Soufraki v. UAE®? and was also

recognised by the ad hoc committee in Vivendi I1.°?

158

522. SCB HK recalls TANESCO's complaint that the Tribunal did not provide sufficient

reasons for finding that the investment requirement under Article 25 (1) of the

Convention was satisfied and that its consideration was "merely cursory".°!

523. In response to this assertion, SCB HK states that the Tribunal devoted six paragraphs of
the Decision to the requirements under Article 25(1) of the Convention, including the
investment requirement. On this point, SCB HK argues that the Tribunal's reasons were
clear, and, in its view, the Tribunal correctly explained that the investment requirement
was met because SCB HK had an investment by virtue of its purchase of the loan and the
assigning of rights under the various agreements. °°?

524. In SCB HK's view, the Tribunal's reasons were perfectly adequate in circumstances
where: (i) there was plainly a legal dispute arising from an investment; (ii) SCB HK had
set out in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Quantum dated February 3, 2012,°°

how the investment requirement was satisfied; and (iii) TANESCO had raised no

objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article 25(1).°™ In this respect, SCB HK
states that while TANESCO might not agree with these reasons, the reasons themselves

why SCB HK did not make a qualifying investment under the ICSID Convention".*°

On these issues, SCB HK argues that TANESCO ignores the fact that the investment
requirement was plainly met and that, at the time, TANESCO did not raise an objection
nor contest that the requirements under Article 25(1) had been met.** In SCB HK's view,
the notion that the Tribunal should have to write lengthy reasons on uncontested and

obvious points is wrong.*

Accordingly, SCB HK concludes that TANESCO's claim that the Tribunal failed to
provide sufficient reasons in respect of its finding that Article 25(1) was satisfied are

without merit and must be dismissed.°”

c) The Tribunal's failure to take into account additional and decisive evidence

regarding the Parties interest in the Escrow Account

SCB HK points to TANESCO's assertion that the Tribunal failed to consider evidence
submitted by TANESCO regarding the Parties’ interest in the Escrow Account.” SCB
HK states that, in support of its argument, TANESCO quotes SCB HK's email of
December 6, 2013, in which SCB HK confirmed it did not consider that the Tribunal had

jurisdiction with respect to the Escrow Account.*”!

However, SCB HK submits that this assertion misunderstands the reason why the
Tribunal considered the emptying of the Escrow Account was relevant to its Award.
According to SCB HK, the Tribunal explained that the facts that: (i) TANESCO had
agreed to settle the invoice dispute with IPTL on the basis of the full tariff; (ii) IPTL was
now in receipt of sufficient funds to pay its creditors; and (iii) the Escrow Account had
been emptied, which TANESCO failed to disclose in its December 13, 2013 letter, were

all material and would have had an impact on its decision not to order payment.°”?

530. SCB HK states that the Tribunal further explained that its Decision was based to a
significant extent on the likelihood that priorities of claims would have to be determined
in the courts of Tanzania in the context of the appointment of a liquidator and concluded
that the facts that TANESCO had concealed from the Tribunal changed that

assumption.°7

531. In this respect, SCB HK argues that TANESCO's December 2013 letter sought to
persuade the Tribunal that such an appointment remained likely, and that, as such, its

concealment of the emptying of the Escrow Account was clearly relevant.°”*

532. Thus, SCB HK argues that it is clear that the Tribunal considered the fact it was misled
concerning the emptying of the Escrow Account was relevant not because it considered
it had jurisdiction, but because it was relevant to the likelihood of a liquidator being

appointed, which, in SCB HK's view, is an entirely separate point.°”

533. Additionally, SCB HK recalls TANESCO's argument that SCB HK's email of December
6, 2013 to the Tribunal was "effectively a waiver" by SCB HK and the Tribunal
"singularly failed to have regard to this waiver".°® SCB HK considers this argument

misconceived, since the reason why the Tribunal considered the emptying of the Escrow

 

Account to be relevant was that it was material to whether IPTL would have su:

funds to pay its creditors, and the likelihood of a liquidator being appointed.°””

534. On this point, SCB HK states that "[t]he Tribunal — which disagreed with SCB HK on

the significance of the prospect of a liquidator being appointment [sic] — considered that

the status of the Escrow Account was relevant to its analysis, and it was thus entitled to

take the emptying of the Escrow Account into consideration".°”*

Consequently, SCB HK states that given the clear nature of the Tribunal's reasoning (at
paragraphs 347-348 of the Award) as to why the emptying of the Escrow Account was
relevant, no further reasons were required and thus, SCB HK states that the Tribunal was
correct to disregard the confirmation that it had no jurisdiction nor had a claim to that

money.©”?

d) The Tribunal's failure to take into account the evidence presented by TANESCO on

the continuing existence of the Tariff Dispute

SCB HK opposes TANESCO's assertion” that it presented the Tribunal with evidence
demonstrating that negotiations regarding the level of the tariff payable under the PPA
were still ongoing but that the Tribunal "disregarded this important evidence and failed

to explain its reasons for doing so".°*!

SCB HK argues that, contrary to TANESCO's assertion, the Tribunal set out the Parties’
arguments on this point at length at paragraphs 183-198 of the Award. According to SCB
HK, at paragraph 331 of the Award, the Tribunal made specific reference to the minutes
of the October 8, 2013 meeting between TANESCO and IPTL,°*? and concluded on the
basis of the minutes that at that meeting TANESCO had agreed to settle the Tariff Dispute
on the basis of the full tariff, entering into a joint recommendation that the monies in the

Escrow Account be released to IPTL as soon as possible.**

Thus, SCB HK submits that the Tribunal clearly considered the evidence and came to its

own conclusion as to the nature of the 2013 Settlement Agreement. SCB HK further

argues that even TANESCO accepts at paragraph 259 of its Reply on Annulment that the

issue is "unlikely to be a decisive issue for the Committee".°**

SCB HK states that given TANESCO's inability to provide any evidence to support its
allegations, no further reasons were required.°*° Consequently, SCB HK argues that

TANESCO's complaint must be dismissed.°*°

e) The Tribunal's failure to take into account contradictory evidence concerning SCB

HR's knowledge of the status of the Escrow Account

SCB HK submits that TANESCO's complaint that the Tribunal failed to take into account
contradictory evidence concerning SCB HK's knowledge of the emptying of the Escrow
Account and that it also failed to provide reasons for its findings as to SCB HK's
knowledge of the emptying of such account, is not only wrong but also a demonstrably
misleading characterisation of the Tribunal's reasons.®*” According to SCB HK, contrary
to TANESCO's claim, it is patently clear in the Award that the Tribunal did consider the
evidence submitted by TANESCO.***

In SCB HK's view, TANESCO is, in substance, re-arguing its allegation that SCB HK
knew about the emptying of the Escrow Account, missing the key point which, according

to SCB HK, was explained in paragraphs 460 to 466 of its Counter-Memorial.°°

There, SCB HK stated that TANESCO's first complaint about the Tribunal’s
consideration of the evidence that Ms Renju "had a copy of the settlement agreement"
when she filed an injunction to prevent the dissipation of the Escrow Account, is
opportunistic since it relies on an obvious mix-up by the Tribunal about the agreement
that was available to Ms Renju and the timing of her injunction application.” On this

point, SCB HK explains that, as paragraph 336 of the Award correctly records, the

injunction application was made on September 6, 2013 (i.e. before the 2013 Settlement
Agreement settling the Tariff Dispute) and the application exhibited the PAP-VIP
agreement for sale and purchase of VIP’s shares in IPTL of August 2013, not the 2013
Settlement Agreement. SCB HK highlights that it is important to distinguish between
these agreements, notwithstanding TANESCO's efforts to take advantage of the

confusion.®!

543. SCB HK argues that, in any event, even if Ms Renju did have a copy of the 2013
Settlement Agreement (which SCB HK claims she did not), this was not evidence that
the Escrow Account had in fact been emptied, a point that, according to SCB HK, was
made by the Tribunal at paragraph 336 of the Award.” Thus, SCB HK argues that the
Tribunal did consider the evidence, but explained why it did not support the conclusion
that TANESCO was advocating. Consequently, in SCB HK's view, TANESCO's
allegation that the Tribunal did not take Ms Renju's application into account is

baseless."

544. Further, SCB HK states that TANESCO also claimed that it submitted evidence that the
Managing Director of SCB HK, Mr Joe Casson, had direct knowledge of the emptying
of the Escrow Account. SCB HK refutes TANESCO's allegation that the Tribunal
hurriedly dismissed this evidence labelling SCB HK's procedural negligence as a "tactical

mistake" and stating that it was "inconceivable" that SCB HK would not have sought to

[SCB HK] indicates that it had been informed of the existence of an agreement settling the tariff dispute and
facilitating the release of the Escrow Funds and states that the agreement had not been disclosed to it. It could
be inferred from the fact that the Administrative Receiver, Martha Renju, had a copy of the agreement when
she filed a request for an injunction to prevent the monies in the Escrow Account from being dispersed, some
ten days before [SCB HK] wrote its November 27 letter that [SCB HK] must have had some knowledge of the
2013 Settlement Agreement. But there is no evidence that [SCB HK] knew that the Escrow Account had in fact
been emptied. [Text in brackets added by the Committee]"

capitalise on the reversal of TANESCO's position in its submissions had it known about
it 64

SCB HK explains that the Tribunal carefully considered the evidence about Mr Casson's
knowledge before concluding that it did not establish that SCB HK knew about the
emptying of the Escrow Account. However, according to SCB HK, TANESCO
misrepresents both the evidence before the Tribunal and what the Tribunal said in its

Award.°°

SCB HK explains that at paragraph 337 of its Award, the Tribunal quoted a passage from
the witness statement of Mr Casson in which he records Mr Sethi as stating: "SCB HK
[would have] received no cash now because (Mr Sethi said) none of the
USD$100,000,000 sitting in the escrow account would be left after paying VIP, the
Tanzanian Revenue Authority and ‘other creditors'.©’ SCB HK states that TANESCO
in its Reply on Annulment quoted the next paragraph (paragraph 338), to draw the
conclusion that "the Tribunal also did not give reasons as to why it interpreted the
evidence of Joe Casson in the way that it did. [...] It is undeniable on Joe Casson's
evidence that SCB HK knew that the Escrow Account was likely to be emptied or had

already been emptied..."°*

However, SCB HK states that the passages quoted by TANESCO are contrary to what
the Tribunal stated in the very next paragraph of its Award, where it held that: "[w]Jhat
the statement by Mr Casson does not show is that the Escrow Account had been emptied
at that time; indeed Mr. Sethi stated that there was US$100 million sitting in the Escrow

Account..."

Thus, in SCB HK's view, the status of the Escrow Account was not clear, and the better
evidence was that it had not yet been emptied. Accordingly, SCB HK argues that while
it had knowledge of the existence of the 2013 Settlement Agreement, this is distinct from
knowledge of the terms of the 2013 Settlement Agreement, or that they involved settling
the tariff dispute at a level inconsistent with TANESCO's position in the Arbitration

Proceeding.’

With respect to TANESCO's allegation that "[t]here is simply no reason why SCB HK
or the Tribunal could not have requested further information at the time. Instead, the
Tribunal came to the conclusion that although ‘with hindsight SCB HK might have
wished that it pushed further’, the Tribunal's view that the 13 December 2013 letter was
misleading somehow excused SCB HK's negligence in failing to make further disclosure

enquiries".”°' SCB HK asserts that this statement is misleading for the following reasons.

First, SCB HK submits that it assumes that the reason the Tribunal did not request further
information in December 2013 was that it was misled by TANESCO as to the content of
the 2013 Settlement Agreement. Thus, in SCB HK's view, after having misled the
Tribunal, it is no response for TANESCO to say now that the Tribunal could have caught

TANESCO out had it sought further information at the time.”

Second, SCB HK explains that it believed that pursuant to the valid statutory assignment
of the PPA, SCB HK should be entitled to payment by TANESCO regardless of a
liquidator being appointed, and that considering those circumstances, it is not surprising
that SCB HK did not delay the proceedings to seek disclosure from TANESCO regarding
the 2013 Settlement Agreement.” SCB HK states that as of November 2013, TANESCO
had already failed without excuse to produce for nine months invoices that were clearly
relevant and would have contributed to a more accurate quantum calculation. Therefore,

in SCB HK's view, it was unlikely that TANESCO would have willingly provided such

production, in circumstances where such disclosure would have revealed the deliberately

misleading approach it had taken.”+

Finally, SCB HK opposes TANESCO's assertion that the Tribunal concluded that SCB
HK was negligent. On this point, SCB HK submits that the Tribunal did not "label SCB
HK's procedural negligence as a tactical mistake" but explains that it noted that counsel
for SCB HK had stated in the August 2015 Hearing that it may have been a "tactical

mistake" not to have requested more documents and information.”°5

In addition, SCB HK submits that the Tribunal concluded that SCB HK's failure to make
further enquiries "[could] not be characterized as negligent". According to SCB HK,
TANESCO does not engage with this point and instead continues, without excuse or

explanation, to assert that the Tribunal's finding was the opposite.’°°

SCB HK states that the Tribunal found the opposite of what TANESCO alleged in its
Memorial on Annulment and it stated that "342. ... While with hindsight SCB HK might
have wished that it had pushed further, the Tribunal considers that, in light of
Respondent’s [TANESCO’s] December 13, 2013 Letter, it had no obligation to do so and

thus its actions cannot be characterized as negligent".’°”

SCB HK submits that, in any case, it is wrong for TANESCO to suggest, as in its opinion
it did repeatedly in its submissions, that any such negligence by the Tribunal or SCB HK

would excuse TANESCO's own deliberately misleading conduct.’

Furthermore, SCB HK recalls paragraph 270 of TANESCO's Reply on Annulment,
which, in its view, is another misrepresentation of the Award. According to SCB HK, in
the first sentence of paragraph 270 TANESCO argued that: "[iJt [seemed] that the
Tribunal itself was at a loss to understand why SCB HK if it had known (which of course

it did) would not have sought to capitalise on its knowledge of the existence of the [2013

Settlement Agreement] prior to the issuance of the Decision, which it described as

‘illogical’ and 'unconceivable'. According to SCB HK, this is another misrepresentation
of the Award made by TANESCO since it was the terms of the 2013 Settlement
Agreement (not its existence), and the emptying of the Escrow Account (not the risk),
that the Tribunal felt unconceivable that SCB HK would not have drawn to its

attention.”

In support of this, SCB HK quotes the Award as follows: "340. ... it is relevant to note
that it would have been illogical for [SCB HK] not to have brought the terms of the [2013
Settlement Agreement] and the fact the Escrow Account had been emptied to the
attention of the Tribunal immediately, had it been informed of these facts prior to the
Tribunal's Decision [...]. In the months leading up to the Tribunal's Decision, it resolved
to pay the full tariff to IPTL. It is inconceivable that [SCB HK] would not have sought
to capitalise on that reversal of position by [TANESCO] in its submissions to this

Tribunal had it known about it".”"°

SCB HK also submits that paragraph 340 of the Award is in fact another of the reasons,
which TANESCO claims are non-existent, for the Tribunal's conclusion that SCB HK

did not know of these facts.7!!

As to the second part of TANESCO's argument,’!? SCB HK states that this conflates two
periods of time. It explains that it is the factual position as at late 2013 that the Tribunal
considered unclear and even at times self-contradictory and argues that it was three years
late - in 2016 - that the Tribunal "felt comfortable taking the step of reconsideration".’!

SCB HK further states that, at that point in time, it did not need to require disclosure of

the 2013 Settlement Agreement, as by that stage it had already been produced and the

Tribunal had it in front of it when writing its Award.7!*

Therefore, SCB HK argues that all of TANESCO's arguments on this point are without
merit, since the Tribunal did consider the arguments made by the Parties, considered the
evidence adduced by them, reached its conclusion as to SCB HK's knowledge and
provided reasons for reaching that conclusion.”!> In SCB HK's view, TANESCO cannot
claim that just because it disagrees with the Tribunal's reasoning, no adequate reasoning

was provided.’!°

Thus, SCB HK submits that TANESCO's challenge to the Award is an attempt to bring
an appeal on the merits under the guise of a complaint about a lack of reasons and that,

as such, it is groundless and must be dismissed.”

Sf) The Tribunal's reversal of its earlier decision that it had no jurisdiction over claims

relating to the Facility Agreement

According to SCB HK, TANESCO's complaint is that, in reconsidering the decision not
to order TANESCO to pay a specific sum to SCB HK, the Tribunal failed to address how

the 2013 Settlement Agreement affected its earlier decision.’!*

SCB HK starts by recalling TANESCO's statement that "...nothing resulting from the
new facts had any impact whatsoever on the several distinct reasons originally given in
the Decision as to why the Tribunal was unable to order Tanesco to pay a specific sum
to SCB HK".”!? In SCB HK's view, there is a fundamental flaw in TANESCO's
understanding of the Tribunal's reasoning in the Decision on Jurisdiction and the relief

granted later in the Award.’?°

SCB HK explains that, in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded the

following.

First, that it had jurisdiction over TANESCO and SCB HK as the assignee of IPTL's
rights under the PPA, but that it could not order TANESCO to pay a specific sum owing
to SCB HK under the PPA as such order would be enforceable in the Tanzanian court.
According to SCB HK, the Tribunal's concern when deciding this was the potential for
its decision to interfere with the question of priority among IPTL's creditors in view of
the possibility of a liquidator being appointed (SCB HK refers to this as the "Liquidation

Ground").”*!

Second, that it did not have jurisdiction over the relationship between SCB HK and IPTL.
under the Facility Agreement as IPTL was non-party to the Arbitration Proceeding (SCB
HK refers to this as the "Third-Party Contract Ground"). Thus, according to SCB HK,
the Tribunal could not engage with SCB HK's calculation of the amount owing under the
Facility Agreement and could not make an order requiring TANESCO to pay that
amount, as SCB HK had requested.’2?

SCB HK submits that, because the Tribunal declined jurisdiction to order payment of a
sum owed under the Facility Agreement, SCB HK did not seek to challenge the Third-
Party Contract Ground any further.’””> However SCB HK states that, following the
discovery of TANESCO's misrepresentation after the Decision had been issued, SCB HK
sought to explain the errors regarding the Liquidation Ground and sought an order from

the Tribunal for the full amount due from TANESCO to IPTL under the PPA.”

Consequently, SCB HK states that by the time of the Award, the Third-Party Ground had
fallen away considering SCB HK had not sought the payment of an amount to discharge

the debt under the Facility Agreement. SCB HK explains that the question was whether

the Liquidation Ground ought to be reconsidered, in light of the facts that the Tribunal

had become aware of since the Decision.’>

According to SCB HK, the Tribunal's predominant concern in its Decision was the
possibility of a liquidator being appointed and this had an impact on what was dealt with
and decided.’° SCB HK argues that TANESCO's misrepresentation of facts resulted in
"the context in which the Decision of the Tribunal was made [to be] substantially

different from that which the Tribunal had been led to believe".””

In support of this, SCB HK quotes the Tribunal as follows: "354. The concern of the
Tribunal was that, given the likelihood that the liquidation of IPTL would be back before
the courts of Tanzania, the Tribunal should not make an order for the payment of a sum
of money that would be binding in Tanzania and thus potentially interfere with the
jurisdiction of a liquidator and the Tanzanian courts to determine priority amongst

creditors. [...] 355. ... Given that TANESCO has agreed to pay the equivalent of the full

 

amount owing under the tariff dispute to IPTL/PAP, the possibility of IPTL being placed

in liquidation seems much more remote".’”

SCB HK explains that this led the Tribunal to reconsider its Decision on the Liquidation
Ground, and to hold that "in addition to making a declaration of the amount owing by
TANESCO to SCB HK, it [the Tribunal] can also make an order for payment of that
amount".”29 Considering this, TANESCO's assertion that the fact of the 2013 Settlement
Agreement had no "impact whatsoever" on the Tribunal's reconsideration of the Decision

on Jurisdiction is simply incorrect.”*°

SCB HK recalls TANESCO's complaint that in the Award the Tribunal did not address

or explain how the 2013 Settlement Agreement affected the "other independent legal

bases" which led the Tribunal not to order payment in the Decision (such as the finding
that TANESCO could not be ordered to pay amounts to SCB HK independently of IPTL).
SCB HK states that these "other independent legal bases" are just expressions of the
Tribunal's finding that it can only address debts between TANESCO and IPTL under the
PPA, not debts as between IPTL and SCB HK under the Facility Agreement. SCB HK
explains that, as discussed above, this ground fell away when SCB HK chose not to

pursue its claim for an amount to discharge the debt under the Facility Agreement.’?!

SCB HK argues that, had it sought the payment of a sum representing the amount owing
under the Facility Agreement, the Third-Ground Party would have barred the order
because the same limitation on the Tribunal exercising jurisdiction in respect of the
Facility Agreement would have remained. However, SCB HK highlights that it did not

seek such an order, and hence the Third-Party Contract Ground did not come into play.’**

Consequently, SCB HK denies that the Tribunal did not provide reasons for "revers[ing]
its earlier decision that it had no jurisdiction over claims related to the Facility
Agreement". According to SCB HK, this issue did not arise and did not need to be

addressed in the Award.”*

Therefore, SCB HK submits that TANESCO's complaints about a supposed lack of
reasons in respect of the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Facility Agreement and its
reconsideration of its jurisdiction to order payment, are misconceived and must be

rejected.”*4

g) The Tribunal's holding that the tariff must be calculated on the basis of an IRR of

22.1% which directly contradicted its earlier finding that this rate cannot apply

SCB HK recalls TANESCO's complaint that, by ordering that the tariff be based on a
22.31% IRR on a shareholder loan basis, the Tribunal has, without adequate reasons,

contradicted its finding at paragraph 339 of the Decision, that a 22.31% IRR would not

be appropriate.” In SCB HK's view, this argument is unfounded and seeks to sow

confusion about how the 22.31% IRR calculation works.”*°

SCB HK explains that, in order to understand the Tribunal's decision in this respect, it is
necessary to appreciate how the point was argued and decided in the Decision on
Jurisdiction. SCB HK explains the Tribunal's Decision in respect of the IRR dividing its
analysis into: (i) background to Decision; (ii) finding in Decision that 30% equity
contribution should have been by way of share capital; (iii) finding in Decision that tariff
must be recalculated to reflect the shareholder loan; (iv) different views on paragraph
339 of the Decision expressed by Parties in the tariff phase of the Arbitration Proceeding;
and (v) finding in the Award that the 22.31% IRR on the shareholder loan was

appropriate.”>”

Background to the Decision on the IRR

SCB HK states that a large part of the Tribunal's Decision focused on the meaning of the
70% debt / 30% equity split in the financing of the Power Plant, which was mentioned in
the May 31, 1995 letter.”* SCB HK highlights that neither the May 31, 1995 letter nor
the ICSID 1 tribunal provided a definition of the term "equity".”° SCB HK further states
that, despite the lack of an express definition of "equity", precision around this concept
was needed because the tariff under the PPA was to be calculated by reference to, among

other things, a 22.31% IRR on equity.”

According to SCB HK, it was common ground that Mechmar had in fact provided the
30% funding largely by way of a shareholder loan to IPTL, rather than by paid-up share

capital in IPTL.”4! SCB HK submits that this is important because a higher tariff is needed

to provide a 22.31% IRR on share capital than is needed to provide a 22.31% IRR ona

shareholder loan.”

Thus, SCB HK states that the key issue before the Tribunal was whether the 30% equity
contribution needed to be made by way of share capital or could be made by way of a

shareholder loan.”

Finding in the Decision that 30% equity contribution should have been by way of share

capital

SCB HK explains that, in considering what type of equity contribution was required, the
Tribunal concluded that because the financial model that was subsequently agreed by the
parties to the PPA before commencement of operations ("Implementation Model")
which calculated the tariff did so based on a 30% equity contribution by way of share
capital, IPTL's equity contribution should not have been provided by way of a

shareholder loan.”

SCB HK states that an important factor in this decision was Mr Ehrhardt's evidence,
TANESCO's own expert, that higher tariffs are needed to provide an equivalent internal
rate of return on share capital than on shareholder loans, because shareholder loans are
repaid before tax, while dividends to shareholders are paid from profits after tax and are

subject to more constraints.”>

According to SCB HK, the Tribunal quoted Mr Ehrhardt's explanation about this feature
in the Decision, where he stated that the Implementation Model showed that all of the
payments made to achieve the 22.31% return on equity are to be made through dividend
payments subject to dividend payment constraints, rather than by payments on a loan
(which would not be subject to the dividend payment constraints). SCB HK submits that

Mr Ehrhardt concluded that if the shareholder loan had been permitted in lieu of an equity

contribution, the payments to shareholders would not have been subject to the dividend
payment constraints, which would have eliminated or reduced the "trapped cash" and
would have required a much smaller Capacity Payment”® to provide the agreed 22.31%,

after-tax return on equity.”47

SCB HK's explains that the Tribunal was concerned that the contribution by way of
shareholder loan rather than share capital meant that the same 22.31% IRR could have
been delivered with a lower tariff than that computed by the Implementation Model.
According to SCB HK, the Implementation Model assumed that taxes would need to be
paid before dividends were paid to the shareholder, but explains that, in fact, taxes did
not need to be paid, and those tax savings were not returned to TANESCO under the
Model, as explained by the Tribunal in its Decision as follows from this extract as

follows:74

"[...] The Capacity Payment is deemed to pay for the cost of capital, i.e.
for the reimbursement of the loans, the taxes to be paid and the dividends
on equity. Because loans are repaid before taxation and dividends after
taxation, the replacement of equity by loans necessarily has an influence
on the amount of taxes to be paid. The simple explanation is that, if taxes
are paid on the amount earned less repayment of the debt, then they are
higher because they are calculated on a higher amount of income than if
they are calculated on the amount earned after both repayment of the senior
debt and repayment of the shareholders' loan. The difference in the global
cost — on which the Capacity Payment's calculation was based — is the
economy realized in tax payments, which has not been taken into account
in the calculation of the Capacity Payment. The Tribunal concurs with
[TANESCO]'s observation that: '[a]s a result, TANESCO was being

charged to ‘reimburse’ IPTL for millions of dollars in taxes that would

746 This term has been defined in the Award as: "The Capacity Payment is reimbursement for the cost of capital

never be incurred’. Whilst the Tribunal has not made its own calculation of
the amount in taxes, it is clear that in principle TANESCO was effectively
reimbursing IPTL for taxes that would only have been incurred if the
project sponsors had contributed paid-up capital instead of shareholders'

loans [Text in brackets added by the Committee]".””

SCB HK argues that in these circumstances, the Tribunal concluded that there was an
assumption built into the Implementation Model under which the tariffs were calculated
that IPTL would contribute equity by way of "true equity" (i.e. paid-up share capital) and
not by way of a shareholder loan, and that "before this Tribunal [could] quantify the
amount owing by TANESCO to IPTL under the PPA, the tariff must be recalculated to
take account of that fact that there had not been a 30% equity contribution in the form of

paid up share capital".”°

Finding in the Decision that tariff must be recalculated to reflect the shareholder loan

On this point, SCB HK explains that, in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal
concluded that the tariff must be recalculated to reflect that the equity contribution was
by way of a shareholder loan and not by way of paid up share capital, and thus, it ordered
the Parties to attempt to agree on the recalculation tariff taking into account the

considerations set by the Tribunal in paragraphs 337-343.”>!

According to SCB HK, these considerations include the view expressed by the Tribunal
at paragraph 339 of the Decision, which forms the basis of TANESCO's Application for

Annulment, that:

"\..[T]he Tribunal does not believe that a tariff of 22.31% would be
appropriate. That tariff was based on an assumption that IPTL's equity

contribution could be made by way of shareholder loan, which the Tribunal

has rejected. Furthermore, as the Tribunal has pointed out in this Decision,
the substitution of a shareholder loan for equity resulted in benefits
accruing to IPTL, in particular in relation to taxation, which were not
contemplated under the PPA. Simply, to agree on a tariff of 22.31% would

effect no change in the situation between the Parties".”>

SCB HK states that the Tribunal concluded that, if the Parties failed to reach an
agreement within a stipulated timeframe, the Tribunal would decide whether a further

hearing on recalculation was necessary.’>

Different views on paragraph 339 of the Decision expressed by Parties in the tariff phase

of the Arbitration

In its Submissions on Tariff on November 11, 2014, SCB HK explained its understanding
that when the first sentence of paragraph 339 is read in the context of the remainder of
the paragraph, it does not rule out a tariff based on an IRR on shareholder loans.’** In this
respect, SCB HK submits that it understood the references to "a tariff of 22.31%" to be
shorthand for a tariff calculated to give an IRR of 22.31% on the assumption that the

shareholder's equity would be invested by way of paid up share capital.”°°

In support of this, SCB HK refers the Tribunal to the supplemental report of its expert,
Mr Johnson, in which he explained that "...if [...] the required IRR [was] left unchanged
at 22.31%, but the assumption instead [was] made that the shareholder's contribution is
invested by way of shareholder loan, and appropriate taxation levels on shareholder loans
are included in the model, then the tariff will be reduced by US$81.6 million over the

course of the PPA".”5°

592. SCB HK argues that an agreement that the tariff be set at a level providing an IRR of
22.31% on a shareholder loan would therefore effect a change in the situation between
the Parties and result in a reduction in the tariff to reflect the benefits accruing to IPTL
as regards taxation. Accordingly, SCB HK submits that it understood paragraph 339 of
the Decision to rule out a tariff based on an IRR of 22.31% on share capital, not an IRR.

of 22.31% in shareholder loans.”*7

593. SCB HK states that its expert, Mr Colin Johnson, confirmed that it is possible to calculate
the tariff using a 22.31% IRR on a shareholder loan basis, which preserves the agreed
rate of return on the investment but recognises that the shareholder loan will be repaid

before taxes.”°*

594. SCB HK recalls TANESCO's Submissions on Tariff of February 13, 2015, where,
according to SCB HK, TANESCO quoted the first sentence of paragraph 339 of the
Decision out of context, in support of an argument that paragraph 339 in fact excluded
the possibility of a tariff based on an IRR of 22.31% on shareholder loans.’*? In response,
SCB HK explained why, when the context is taken into account, including the remainder
of paragraph 339, a tariff based on an IRR of 22.31% on shareholder loans is not ruled
out by paragraph 339 of the Decision.’

595. SCB HK states that the debate between the Parties as to their understanding of paragraph

339 of the Decision continued and was addressed at the August 2015 hearing and in post-

hearing briefs.’°!

598.

Finally, SCB HK submits that TANESCO pretends to be confused about why the
Tribunal was saying that a 22.31% IRR was inappropriate in the Decision but settled on
a 22.31% IRR in the Award. According to SCB HK, TANESCO knows that the answer
to this is that the 22.31% IRR is applied on different bases (share capital basis versus
shareholder loan basis) and produces different results. On this point, SCB HK explains
that: "changing the basis of calculation from a share capital basis to a shareholder loan
basis reverses the tax savings that would accrue to SCB HK (which was the Tribunal's
concern in the Decision) and returns those savings to Tanesco. Accordingly, the Tribunal
fixed the tariff by reference to a 22.31% IRR on a shareholder loan basis, rather than the

share capital basis that had previously been used".”°?

Finding in the Award that 22.31% IRR on shareholder loan was appropriate

SCB HK explains that, when drafting the Award, the Tribunal had before it two
understandings of paragraph 339 of its Decision. According to SCB HK, the Tribunal
decided that SCB HK's understanding was correct, and confirmed SCB HK's argument
that TANESCO's reliance on the first sentence of paragraph 339 took that sentence out
of context. On this point, SCB HK quoted paragraphs 370, 378, and 382-386 of the

Award.”

In addition, SCB HK claims that, in its Memorial on Annulment, TANESCO again takes
the first sentence of paragraph 339 of the Decision out of context, quoting that sentence
in isolation without acknowledging the sentences that follow. Contrary to TANESCO's
assertions that the Tribunal's reasons for its conclusions in its Award are inadequate, the
reasons it gave are entirely adequate. SCB HK states that TANESCO's argument only
attempts to conflate a tariff based on a 22.31% IRR on share capital with a tariff based
on a 22.31% IRR on shareholder loans.”

602.

SCB HK highlights that these two calculations are different and that paragraph 339 only
ruled out the former but not the latter. In SCB HK's view, TANESCO can only argue to
the contrary by taking an isolated sentence in the Decision out of context, giving it a
meaning which, according to SCB HK, even the Tribunal has confirmed it does not

have.’°

Therefore, SCB HK submits that in making its complaint of contradictory reasons,
TANESCO has actually made a claim that the Tribunal's reasons were factually incorrect.
According to SCB HK, they were not, and in support refers to the ad hoc committee in
MCI v. Ecuador, which concluded that: "contradictory reasons should be distinguished

from reasons which are claimed to be legally or factually wrong".’°°

Consequently, SCB HK submits that the Tribunal gave clear reasons for why it was
adopting a tariff based on a 22.31% IRR on shareholder loans, and thus, it holds that
TANESCO's argument that the Tribunal provided inadequate reasons is baseless and

must be rejected.’*”

iii) Analysis and Decision of the Committee

For the sake of good order, the Committee will divide its analysis regarding the Parties’
arguments on the "failure to state reasons" ground into: (a) standard of the "failure to
state reasons" ground; (b) the Tribunal's failure to state reasons on which the Award is
based by holding on purely formalistic grounds that SCB HK had made an investment
within Article 25(1) of the Convention; (c) the Tribunal's failure to take into account
additional and decisive evidence regarding the Parties’ interest in the Escrow Account;
(d) the Tribunal's failure to take into account the evidence presented by TANESCO on
the continuing existence of the tariff dispute; (e) the Tribunal's failure to take into account
contradictory evidence concerning SCB HK's knowledge of the status of the Escrow
Account; (f) the Tribunal's reversal of its earlier decision that it had no jurisdiction over

claims relating to the Facility Agreement; and (g) the Tribunal's holding that the tariff

606.

must be calculated on the basis of an IRR of 22.1% which directly contradicted its earlier

finding that this rate cannot apply.
a) Standard of the "failure to state reasons" ground

The Committee agrees that, as correctly stated by TANESCO, Article 48(3) of the ICSID
Convention imposes upon a tribunal the duty of ensuring that an award states the reasons
on which it is based. If the tribunal does not comply with this obligation, any party can
request annulment of the award under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention. Therefore, in
the Committee's view, there is a clear link between the provision requiring the tribunal
to state reasons and the ground for annulment when there has been a failure by the tribunal

to do so.78

The Committee is aware that the ICSID Convention does not provide further guidance as
to when a failure to provide reasons has occurred, nor does it specify the manner in which
the tribunal's reasons should be stated.” However, the Committee considers that the

Parties' arguments and the case law quoted by them shines some light on this matter.

The Committee notes that the Parties have stated that ICSID jurisprudence confirms two
elements: (i) that an award must enable the reader to understand the reasoning of the
tribunal, and (ii) that reasons that are contradictory amount to a failure to state reasons.’”°

The Committee shares this view.

However, the Committee is also aware that, as correctly stated by SCB HK, not only
must there be a failure to state reasons, but the reasons themselves must be necessary to
the tribunal's decision. The Committee shares the view of the ad hoc committee in Joseph
C. Lemire v. Ukraine, which stated that annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only

occur when two conditions are met: (i) the failure to state reasons must leave the decision

on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and (ii) that point

must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision.””!

607. Other ad hoc committees, especially the one in Vivendi J, have held that the ground of

failure to state reasons is a remedy concerned only with a failure to state any reasons, and

7712

not with a failure to state correct or convincing reasons.’'~ The requirement to state

reasons is "...intended to ensure that parties can understand the reasoning of the
[t]ribunal, meaning the reader can understand the facts and law applied by the [t]ribunal
in coming to its conclusion".’”> It is irrelevant whether the parties agree with that

conclusion or with the interpretation given by the tribunal.

608. SCB HK argues that a tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the award and that the ad hoc
committee may clarify and explain those reasons in its decision, without adding new
elements previously absent. In support of this, SCB HK quotes the ad hoc committees in

Soufraki v. UAE™ and Vivendi 11.7”

609. The Committee is of the view that a clarification of the Tribunal's reasoning would not
amount to filling gaps in the Tribunal's reasoning if it only clarifies an already existing

reasoning and proves that: (i) apparent obscurities in the Award are not real; (ii) that

inadequate statements have no consequence on the solution; or (iii) that succinct

reasoning does not actually overlook decisive facts or evidence.””°

As to the existence of contradictory reasons, the Committee recalls TANESCO's
argument that contradictory reasons amount to a failure to state reasons. The Committee

accepts this position but points out that, as noted in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,’”

only
contradictory reasons that cancel each other out, leaving the award with a total absence
of reasons, will amount to a failure to state reasons and thus to a ground for annulment.’78

This view is also held by SCB HK.”””

Having established that annulment will only occur i

 

i) the Tribunal's failure to state

 

reasons left the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed
rationale and if that point was itself necessary to the Tribunal's decision, or (ii) if the
Tribunal stated contradictory reasons that completely cancel each other out, leaving the
Award with a total absence of reasons, the Committee will now address the Parties'

arguments.

b) The Tribunal's failure to state reasons on which the Award is based by holding on
purely formalistic grounds that SCB HK had made an investment within Article

25(1) of the Convention

The Committee starts by recalling TANESCO's argument that the Tribunal held on purely
formalistic grounds that there was an investment with no engagement of the Tribunal on
whether the alleged investment satisfied the threshold of Article 25(1) of the Convention

or met the criteria established in the Salini test and ICSID jurisprudence.

TANESCO asserts that it did raise the issue of the investment requirements under Article

25(1), but the Tribunal did not engage in any consideration of the "numerous valid

reasons" as to why SCB HK had not made a qualifying investment.’*° TANESCO refers
to its Counter Memorial dated August 24, 2012,78! in which, according to TANESCO, it
stated that the purchase of the debt by SCB HK could not be treated as an investment in

Tanzania.

The Committee finds that, as raised by SCB HK, TANESCO makes this assertion only
as part of the background of the dispute when referring to arbitration No. ARB/10/12
(“BIT Arbitration”) but not as part of its arguments opposing the Tribunal's jurisdiction
in the Arbitration Proceeding, where it focuses primarily on SCB HK's failure to register

the security interest.’**

When the Tribunal considered its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention, it stated in
the Decision that "[TANESCO] did not raise any objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction
under the ICSID Convention".’*? Therefore, the Tribunal considered that the fulfilment

of the requirements under Article 25(1) was an uncontested and obvious point.

Nevertheless, and as stated by SCB HK, it is evident from the record that the Tribunal
addressed the requirements of Article 25(1) of the Convention, including the investment
requirement, in the Decision on Jurisdiction (which was later incorporated into the

Award) on its own initiative. The exact finding of the Tribunal was as follows:

"Regarding the second condition, the Tribunal is satisfied that by virtue of
its purchase of the outstanding debt under the loans to IPTL and the
assigning of the rights under the relevant agreements, SCB HK has an
investment for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. There is

undoubtedly a legal dispute arising out of the investment".”**

The Committee is of the view that a succinct reasoning does not, per se, imply that

decisive facts or evidence have been overlooked by the Tribunal. In this case, the length

of the Tribunal's reasoning regarding the investment requirement does not, on its own,
amount to a failure to state reasons. Instead, the Committee must analyse if this succinct
paragraph provides the Decision and thus the Award with reasons as to why the Tribunal

considered that Article 25(1) of the Convention was complied with.

On this point, the Committee applies the standard for a failure to state reasons: (i) the
failure to state reasons leaves the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any
expressed rationale, and that point was itself necessary to the tribunal's decision, or (ii)
the tribunal stated contradictory reasons that completely cancel each other out, leaving

the award with a total absence of reasons.

The Committee notes that the Tribunal stated that "by virtue of its purchase of the
outstanding debt" and "the assigning of the rights under the relevant agreements" SCB
HK had an investment for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. Thus, in the
Committee's view, the Tribunal did not leave this particular point lacking any expressed
rationale: it considered that the purchase of the outstanding debt and the assigning of the
rights under the relevant contracts were reasons enough to conclude that the investment
requirement under Article 25(1) of the Convention was met. In addition, the Committee
is of the opinion that, since the Tribunal considered the investment requirement not to be

a contested point, it did not consider it necessary to write lengthy reasons on this point.

Finally, the Committee does not find any contradictory reasons given by the Tribunal on

this point.

Consequently, the Committee finds no reasons for annulment of the Award under the
"failure to state reasons" ground with respect to the Tribunal's decision that the

requirements under Article 25(1) of the Convention were met.

c) The Tribunal's failure to take into account additional and decisive evidence

regarding the Parties interest in the Escrow Account

The Committee now turns to TANESCO's argument that the Tribunal failed to take into
consideration additional decisive evidence submitted by TANESCO regarding the

Parties’ interest in the Escrow Account. Specifically, TANESCO argues that the Tribunal

185

623.

624.

625.

626.

627.

did not consider an email from SCB HK dated December 6, 2013, where, according to
TANESCO, SCB HK confirmed that: (i) it did not consider the Tribunal had jurisdiction
with respect to the Escrow Account; and (ii) it did not assert any claim to the monies held

in that account.’*°

In TANESCO's view, this email was effectively a waiver by SCB HK, which should have
precluded SCB HK from asserting that the Escrow Account was material to the Tribunal's
determinations in the Arbitration Proceeding. TANESCO states that the Tribunal failed

to have regard to this waiver.’*°
The Committee's conclusions on this point are, as follows.

First, the Tribunal referred to this email in paragraphs 182 and 271 of the Award,
indicating that it was aware of the existence and content of that email. Therefore, contrary
to TANESCO's allegations, the Tribunal did "have regard to" said email, regardless of

whether its decision reflected the position TANESCO wanted the Tribunal to adopt.

Second, the Tribunal's reasons for considering that the emptying of the Escrow Account
was relevant to the Award were entirely different from the issue of whether the Tribunal

considered it had jurisdiction over the account.

In the Award, the Tribunal explained that "What the Tribunal was not able to do was to
assess the impact of the Respondent having agreed to pay the full tariff in its 2013
Settlement Agreement with IPTL/PAP, the impact of the fact that IPTL/PAP had now
received substantial funds under the 2013 Settlement Agreement which reduced even
further the likelihood of the appointment of a liquidator, and that the Escrow Account
had been emptied. In short, the context in which the Decision of the Tribunal was made
was substantially different from that which the Tribunal had been led to believe".’*”
Additionally, the Tribunal held that the likelihood of a liquidator being appointed also

played a material role in its Decision.’**

628.

629.

630.

631.

632.

Bearing this in mind, the Committee shares SCB HK's view that, given the Tribunal's
reasoning in the Award, especially at paragraphs 347-348, as to why the emptying of the
Escrow Account was relevant to its analysis, the Tribunal’s decision was based to a
significant extent on the likelihood that priorities of claims would have to be determined
in the courts of Tanzania in the context of the appointment of a liquidator and that some
protection for the interests of SCB HK in collecting any judgement remained because of

the existence of funds within the Escrow Account.’%

Accordingly, the Committee finds that the Tribunal provided the Parties with an
expressed rationale as to why the emptying of the Escrow Account was material to its
decision. Consequently, TANESCO does not have any possible explanation as to why

the Tribunal disregarded the alleged waiver made by SCB HK.

Therefore, the Committee does not find any failure by the Tribunal to state reasons on
the evidence presented by the Parties regarding their interest in the Escrow Account, and

thus there is no ground for annulment in this respect.

d) The Tribunal's failure to take into account the evidence presented by TANESCO on

the continuing existence of the tariff dispute

The Committee recalls TANESCO's argument that the Tribunal was presented with
evidence demonstrating that negotiations regarding the level of the tariff payable under
the PPA by TANESCO to IPTL were ongoing and that the tariff dispute continued even
after the signing of the 2013 Settlement Agreement. According to TANESCO, the

Tribunal failed to engage with this argument.””°

According to SCB HK, in the Award the Tribunal clearly considered the evidence
presented by TANESCO, specifically the Minutes of October 3, 2013. However, it

reached its own conclusion as to the nature of the 2013 Settlement Agreement, finding

70 TANESCO's Reply on Annulment, 258.

187

633.

634.

635.

that TANESCO had agreed to settle the tariff dispute on the basis of the full tariff.”°! The

Committee agrees with this position for the following reasons.

From the Award, it can be seen that the Tribunal made specific reference to the existence
and content of the Minutes of the October 3, 2013 meeting between TANESCO and

IPTL, at which the 2013 Settlement Agreement was reached.7°?

When analysing this document, the Tribunal found not only that TANESCO had
concluded an agreement to settle the tariff dispute on the basis of the full tariff, but also
that: (i) TANESCO participated with IPTL in a joint recommendation that "monies in the
escrow account be released to IPTL as soon as possible", despite having declared in its
December 13, 2013 letter that it had no control over the Escrow Account; (ii) eight
days before the December 13, 2013 letter was written, the Escrow Account had already

been emptied;”*

and (iii) although the December 2013 Letter neither admits nor denies
that there was an agreement between TANESCO and IPTL to settle the outstanding tariff
payments under the PPA, TANESCO had given the clear impression that there was no
new arrangement and that it knew nothing about the account. TANESCO had given that
impression by responding to SCB HK's allegation that there was an agreement facilitating
the release of the funds held in escrow, claiming that since SCB HK had produced no
proof of any such arrangement there was nothing to respond to, and that the Escrow

Account was beyond its control.

The Tribunal concluded that TANESCO's failure to disclose these facts was anything
other than deliberate since it knew of the agreement's existence, having entered into it.
Thus, the Tribunal found that TANESCO's response in its December 2013 Letter was
misleading and that the facts TANESCO failed to disclose in that letter would have had
an impact on its decision not make an order for payment of the amounts owing to SCB

HK under the PPA.””°

On this point, the Tribunal explained that "what [it] was not able to do was to assess the
impact of [TANESCO] having agreed to pay the full tariff in its 2013 Settlement
Agreement with IPTL/PAP, the impact of the fact that IPTL/PAP had now received
substantial funds under the 2013 Settlement Agreement which reduced even further the
likelihood of the appointment of a liquidator, and that the Escrow Account had been
emptied. In short, the context in which the Decision of the Tribunal was made was

substantially different from that which the Tribunal had been led to believe".””°

The Committee applies the standard for the failure to state reasons to this situation: the
failure must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed

rationale and that point must itself be necessary to the Tribunal's decision.

The Committee notes here that whether TANESCO agreed to settle the tariff dispute on
the basis of the full tariff was relevant to the Tribunal's decision as to whether to reopen
its decision to order payment to SCB HK. The Committee finds that the Tribunal
concluded that it would reopen its decision not only on the basis of its finding that
TANESCO had agreed to pay the full tariff, but also on the fact that the Escrow Account
had been emptied and that IPTL had received "substantial funds under the 2013
Settlement Agreement which reduced even further the likelihood of the appointment of
a liquidator".”"’ According to the Tribunal, its prior decision was based to a significant
extent on the likelihood of the appointment of a liquidator. These facts had changed that

assumption.”°°

Consequently, the Committee finds that, although the Tribunal did not explain why it
concluded that TANESCO had agreed to settle the tariff dispute on the basis of the full
tariff, this was not essential to its determination to reopen its Decision and this step does
not create a lack of expressed and coherent reasoning. Whether TANESCO had agreed
to pay the full tariff was not "necessary" to the decision to reopen, but merely one of the
many factors the Tribunal considered to reach its conclusion to order payment under the

PPA.

e) The Tribunal's failure to take into account contradictory evidence concerning SCB

HR's knowledge of the status of the Escrow Account

TANESCO argues that the Tribunal failed to take into account contradictory evidence
concerning SCB HK's state of knowledge of the emptying of the Escrow Account when
concluding that there was no evidence that SCB HK knew that the Escrow Account had

in fact been emptied.’””

Specifically, TANESCO refers to: (i) negotiations held between Mr Sethi and SCB HK's
managing director, Mr Joseph Casson, regarding the release of the funds in the Escrow
Account from November 13, 2013 at the latest (before the Decision on Jurisdiction was
issued); (ii) the fact that the administrative receiver, Ms Martha Renju, had a copy of the
agreement when she filed a request for an injunction to prevent the monies in the Escrow
Account from being released;®” and (iii) SCB HK's letter of November 27, 2013, by
which, according to TANESCO, it confirmed that it knew TANESCO had entered into
an agreement with IPTL that purported to settle the outstanding tariff payment under the

PPA, thereby facilitating release of the funds placed in escrow.
The Committee disagrees with TANESCO for the following reasons.

It is clear to the Committee that, in the Award, the Tribunal explicitly addressed the

question of SCB HK's state of knowledge.*”!

‘When examining this question, the
Tribunal, at paragraph 336 of the Award, explained the content of SCB HK's November
27, 2013 letter and addressed the fact that Ms Martha Renju had a copy of the 2013

Settlement Agreement, stating that: "... [SCB HK] indicates that it had been informed of

 

the existence of an agreement settling the tariff dispute and facilitating the release of the
Escrow Funds and states that the agreement had not been disclosed to it. It could be
inferred from the fact that the Administrative Receiver, Martha Renju, had a copy of the
agreement when she filed a request for an injunction to prevent the monies in the Escrow

Account from being dispersed, some ten days before [SCB HK] wrote its November 27

letter that [SCB HK] must have had some knowledge of the 2013 Settlement Agreement.

But there is no evidence that [SCB HK] knew that the Escrow Account had in fact been

 

emptied. [Text in brackets added by the Committee]".*°

Later, at paragraph 337 of the Award, the Tribunal referred to negotiations between Mr
Casson of SCB HK and Mr Sethi of PAP on November 13, 2013, as related in Mr
Casson's witness statement. The Tribunal quoted that statement as follows: "it was made
clear [to him] by Mr Sethi that 'there was no cash available to SCB HK because
USD$75,000,000 was being paid to settle PAP's purchase of VIP's 30% shareholding in
IPTL' and that SCB HK [would have] received no cash now because (Mr Sethi said) none
of the USD$100,000,000 sitting in the escrow account would be left after paying VIP,

the Tanzania Revenue Authority and ‘other creditors'".8°

The Tribunal stated that "[wJhat the statement by Mr Casson does not show is that the
Escrow Account had been emptied at that time; [...] And it certainly does not show that
TANESCO had been involved in approving the release of the Escrow Funds, something
that was quite contrary to TANESCO's assertion in the December 13, 2013 Letter that it
had no control over the Escrow Account. Moreover, Mr Sethi's alleged statement says
nothing about the terms of any settlement of the tariff dispute. As a result, the Tribunal
cannot agree that Mr Casson's witness statement supports a claim of knowledge by SCB
HK either in respect of the emptying of the Escrow Account or the settlement of the tariff
dispute” .8

Finally, the Tribunal explained that it considered it would have been illogical for SCB
HK not to have brought the terms of the 2013 Settlement Agreement and the fact the
Escrow Account had been emptied to the attention of the Tribunal immediately, had it
been informed of these facts prior to the Tribunal's Decision.*°° The Committee recalls

SCB HK's assertion that it was the terms of the 2013 Settlement Agreement — not its

existence — and the emptying of the Escrow Account — and not the risk — that the Tribunal

felt unconceivable that SCB HK would not have drawn to its attention.

Consequently, the Tribunal concluded that TANESCO had failed to prove that SCB HK
had knowledge of the facts that TANESCO had withheld from the Tribunal in the

December 2013 letter.5°°

Thus, contrary to TANESCO's assertions, the Tribunal clearly considered the evidence
submitted regarding SCB HK's state of knowledge and stated reasons why it did not

believe the evidence was persuasive to conclude that SCB HK knew these facts.

In any event, the Committee recalls its previous decision that annulment proceedings are
not concerned with how the tribunal appreciated the evidence and arguments submitted
by the parties or the conclusion it arrived therefrom but are only concerned with ensuring
that the evidence and arguments were fairly evaluated. In the Committee's opinion, this

was the case in the Arbitration Proceeding.°””

Additionally, TANESCO argues that when the Tribunal was unable to understand why
SCB HK, had it known of the existence of the 2013 Settlement Agreement, would not
have sought to capitalise on this knowledge prior to the issuance of the Decision, it
hurriedly dismissed the evidence by labelling SCB HK's procedural negligence as a

"tactical mistake", somehow excusing SCB HK's negligence.°°*

On this point, the Committee disagrees with TANESCO. At paragraph 343 of the Award,
after conducting an analysis of the Parties' arguments and evidence, the Tribunal found
that it was unable to conclude that SCB HK was negligent in respect of its lack of
knowledge of the fact that TANESCO had settled the tariff dispute with IPTL or that the
funds had been released from the Escrow Account. This was due to the fact that
TANESCO's letter of December 13, 2013 "...was an implicit denial of any new
agreement and a statement that suggested that TANESCO had no involvement with the

Escrow Account". Therefore, the Tribunal considered that SCB HK had no obligation to

654.

655.

make further enquires about the October 2013 Settlement and its actions could not be
characterised as negligent.*” In the Committee's view, this is not the same as "excusing"

SCB HK's negligence.

Finally, with regard to TANESCO's assertion that there is no reason why the Tribunal
and SCB HK did not request further information regarding the Escrow Account at the

time,®!°

the Committee does not find this to be a ground for annulment under a failure to
state reasons. This was not an issue submitted by the Parties to the decision of the
Tribunal and thus it is not a matter upon which the Tribunal has ruled in the Award.
Therefore, the Committee does not deem it necessary to deal with the Parties' argument

in this respect.

Accordingly, the Committee does not find any failure by the Tribunal to state reasons
when assessing TANESCO's evidence concerning SCB HK's knowledge of the status of

the Escrow Account.

Sf) The Tribunal's reversal of its earlier decision that it had no jurisdiction over claims

relating to the Facility Agreement

TANESCO states that the Tribunal based its reconsideration on the existence of the 2013
Settlement Agreement between TANESCO and IPTL and on the fact that the Escrow
Account had been emptied but failed to address the other independent legal bases on
which it had based its Decision on Jurisdiction.*!! Accordingly, TANESCO submits that
when premising its reconsideration of the scope of its jurisdiction on one of the
previously established legal bases, without addressing or rejecting the other independent
legal bases for its Decision, the Tribunal failed to state reasons on which the Award is

based and that this must lead to annulment.*!?

The Committee disagrees with TANESCO for the following reasons.

Bis

First, as can be seen from the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that it did not
have jurisdiction over the Facility Agreement nor over IPTL, since the only parties to the
Arbitration Proceeding were SCB HK and TANESCO. Accordingly, the Tribunal held
that it only had jurisdiction in respect of IPTL's rights against TANESCO under the PPA
and that it could make a declaration as to the amount owed by TANESCO to IPTL, but
that it could not make an order for payment of such amounts. The Tribunal stated that
"SCB HK has no rights as against TANESCO as the lender to IPTL in these arbitration
proceedings; it only has rights against TANESCO as the assignee of IPTL's rights under
the PPA".8!3

Second, the Committee recalls that the Tribunal held in the Decision that the potential
appointment of a liquidator or administrator in respect of IPTL had an impact not to order
payment, but also held that "for independent reasons" it had no jurisdiction to make an

order for payment.*!4

Later in the Decision, the Tribunal explained what those "independent reasons" were. At
paragraph 241 of the Decision, the Tribunal held that, considering the potential
appointment of a liquidator for the winding up of IPTL, an order by the Tribunal that
TANESCO pay a specific sum to SCB HK, which would be enforceable in domestics
courts, would potentially interfere with the question of priority amongst creditors, which,
according to the Tribunal, was a matter for the Tanzanian courts to decide. By contrast,
the Tribunal held that a declaration that TANESCO owes a specific sum under the PPA

left to the Tanzanian courts any question of priority amongst creditors.*!°

At paragraph 242, the Tribunal held that an order for the payment of a specific amount
would potentially encroach on the power of Tanzanian courts to determine priority
amongst IPTL's creditors, stating that: "[t]his limitation on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
applies whether the Tribunal were to make an order for the full amount owing by

TANESCO to SCB HK as the assignee of IPTL's rights or whether it were to make an

 

order for an amount equivalent to the sum needed to discharge IPTL's obligations to SCB

HK".!6 The Committee finds two important points in this statement: (i) the Tribunal
recognised the possibility of making an order for payment of the amount owed by
TANESCO to SCB HK under the PPA; and (ii) the Tribunal considered the interference
that any order for payment by TANESCO to SCB HK might have on the power of the
Tanzanian courts to decide priority amongst creditors, was a "limitation on [its]

jurisdiction".

Later, at paragraph 243, the Tribunal stated that "[t]here [were], however, further reasons
why the Tribunal [was] unable to make an award of an amount owing sufficient to
discharge the debt of IPTL to SCB HK". Here, the Tribunal explained that, in its post-
hearing brief, SCB HK had identified the sum of US$138,726,761.95 as the amount
sufficient to discharge the debt of IPTL to SCB HK. However, the Tribunal found that
this amount had been calculated only by SCB HK and that it had not been put to the

methods of proof that are normally undertaken before a tribunal makes an order.*!”

Additionally, the Tribunal explained that since it did not have jurisdiction over the
relationship between SCB HK and IPTL under the Facility Agreement, it was not in a
position to make an order determining what amount was allegedly owed by IPTL to SCB
HK, nor could it take into account what SCB HK stated was the amount owing under the

Facility Agreement in the framework of the calculation of the debt under the PPA.*!®

Finally, the Tribunal concluded that the only relief it was able to provide in the
Arbitration Proceeding was a declaration of any amount owing by TANESCO to IPTL
to which SCB HK has a claim as assignee of all of IPTL's rights.*!?

The Committee finds that the reasons why the Tribunal did not order payment to be made
by TANESCO to SCB HK under the PPA were: (i) the potential appointment of a
liquidator; (ii) the fact that SCB HK was claiming amounts to discharge IPTL's debt to
SCB HK under the Facility Agreement, without having put such amounts to the methods
of proof normally undertaken by tribunals before issuing an order for payment; and (iii)

the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction regarding the Facility Agreement, and thus the
impossibility of using the calculation made by SCB HK under that agreement to

determine the amount owed under the PPA.

Having established these reasons, the Committee will now analyse the Award in order to
determine whether the Tribunal addressed these reasons when it reconsidered its

Decision.

The Committee starts by referring to paragraph 344 of the Award. Here, the Tribunal
addressed whether the existence of the 2013 Settlement Agreement between TANESCO,
and IPTL to settle the tariff dispute and the status of the Escrow Account were material

to its decision.6”°

The Tribunal explained that what it knew at the time of the Decision was that: (i)
TANESCO had contested any obligation to pay the full tariff; (ii) that although the
winding up petition had been withdrawn, the likelihood of the appointment of a liquidator
remained a real possibility; and (iii) that some protection for the interest of SCB HK in
collecting any judgement remained because of the existence of the funds in the Escrow

Account.*?!

The Tribunal further stated that what it was not able to do at the time it issued its Decision
was to assess the impact of, among other things, the fact that IPTL had now received
substantial funds under the 2013 Settlement Agreement, which reduced even further the
likelihood of the appointment of a liquidator and that the Escrow Account had been
emptied. These facts substantially changed the context in which the Decision had been

made.*”

The Committee finds that the fact that IPTL had received substantial funds is a
consequence of the emptying of the Escrow Account, from where these monies were
taken, and this reduced the likelihood of the appointment of a liquidator. In the

Committee's view, the Tribunal's statement in the Award that the reconsideration of the

Decision was based on the existence of the 2013 Settlement Agreement and on the fact
that the Escrow Account had been emptied, was not "completely independent" of the
legal reasons in the Decision (i.e. the likelihood of the appointment of a liquidator), which

originally led the Tribunal to limit its jurisdiction to only making a declaration.

As to the fact that SCB HK was claiming amounts enough to discharge IPTL's debt to
SCB HK under the Facility Agreement and the impossibility to use this quantification to
determine the amount owed by TANESCO under the PPA, the Committee refers first to
SCB HK's argument whereby it states that "...these ‘other independent legal bases' are
just expressions of the Third Party Ground i.e. that the Tribunal can only address debts
between Tanesco and IPTL under the PPA, not debts as between IPTL and SCB HK
under the Facility Agreement".*? Second, SCB HK states that, since it did not choose to
pursue its claim for an amount to discharge the debt under the Facility Agreement, but
instead sought payment of the amount owing by TANESCO under the PPA, the "Third

Party Ground" fell away.°**

The Committee agrees with SCB HK's position in this respect. The issue of determining
an amount under the Facility Agreement did not arise when the Tribunal issued the
Award. Therefore, it did not need to be addressed by the Tribunal. However, the
Committee finds that the Tribunal did consider SCB HK's new approach to seek payment
of the amount owing by TANESCO under the PPA instead of claiming any amount under
the Facility Agreement in the Award. In paragraph 247 of the Award the Tribunal stated
that:

"c) [SCB HK] seeks an order for the full amount due under the PPA

247. In the event that the Tribunal accepts to reconsider its previous
Decision and order payment to SCB HK, [SCB HK] has now changed its
approach from seeking payment of only the amount it calculates as
necessary to discharge its loan to IPTL to seeking the full amount due from

TANESCO to IPTL, even though in excess of the amount due to IPTL to

SCB HK under the Facility Agreement. [Text in brackets added by the

Committee]".5*

In the Committee's opinion, from this statement it can be logically concluded that the
Tribunal did not address in the Award the matter of its jurisdiction under the Facility
Agreement or the impossibility of ordering payment of an amount calculated pursuant to
it as the other "independent legal reason", because this was no longer SCB HK's request.
Thus, the Committee does not believe that the decision on this point was "essentially
lacking" in any rationale, leaving the Parties without the possibility to follow the

Tribunal's reasoning.

Consequently, the Committee does not find a failure of the Tribunal to state reasons

regarding the reconsideration of its decision not to order payment.

g) The Tribunal's holding that the tariff must be calculated on the basis of an IRR of

22.1% which directly contradicted its earlier finding that this rate cannot apply

TANESCO asserts that the Tribunal's determination that the tariff must be recalculated
on the basis of an IRR of 22.31%, directly contradicts its previous finding in the Decision
on Jurisdiction. There, the Tribunal had concluded that an IRR of 22.31% would not be
appropriate. Additionally, TANESCO states that it brought this inconsistency to the
Tribunal's attention but that it was dismissed by the Tribunal without adequate reasons.
Additionally, the Tribunal sought to justify its new decision with a witness statement that

pre-dates both the Award and the Decision.*?°

In support of its argument, TANESCO refers to paragraph 339 of the Decision on

Jurisdiction,®”’ which stated:

"(T]he Tribunal does not believe that a tariff of 22.31% would be
appropriate. That tariff was based on an assumption that IPTL's equity

contribution could be made by way of shareholder loan, which the Tribunal

has rejected. Furthermore, as the Tribunal has pointed out in this Decision,
the substitution of a shareholder loan for equity resulted in benefits
accruing to IPTL, in particular in relation to taxation, which were not
contemplated under the PPA. Simply to agree on a tariff of 22.31% would

effect no change in the situation between the Parties".*

The Committee disagrees with TANESCO's position for the following reasons.

At paragraph 371 of the Award, the Tribunal recalled its Decision with regard to the
recalculation of the tariff where it set out the parameters for the Parties to negotiate it. At
this paragraph, the Tribunal expressly stated that it had concluded that "...a 22.31% IRR
would not be appropriate because it had been calculated on the basis of paid-up equity
and not a shareholder loan. [...] Third, the calculation of the tariff could not be based on
any new assumptions..."°°

Later, at paragraph 375, the Tribunal stated that the main problem it identified in the
Decision on Jurisdiction regarding the tariff was that "...it had been calculated on the
basis of paid up equity and not on the basis of a shareholder loan with the result that 'in
replacing equity by a shareholder loan, IPTL was incurring less costs than the costs used
for the recalculation of the Capacity Payment'". The Tribunal, at paragraphs 377-384,
went on to consider the Parties' arguments on which IRR to use: 26.08%, proposed by

SCB HK, and 13.69%, proposed by TANESCO.

Regarding these IRRs, the Tribunal concluded that both approaches were based on new
assumptions of what the Parties would have decided if they had abandoned the 22.31%
IRR and stated that neither of those calculations "focus[ed] on permitting TANESCO to
recapture what it was paying in excess of the actual costs that IPTL was incurring".**°

Under those considerations, the Tribunal rejected these proposals and turned to the
suggestion of an unchanged IRR of 22.31% based on a shareholder loan and not paid up

share capital. When conducting this analysis, the Tribunal pointed out that the result of

®8 Annex-1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 1339.
9 Annex-1, Award, 1371.
80 Annex-1, Award, 9375-377.

199

this approach would be "a transfer of the tax savings from the use of a shareholder's loan

to TANESCO".*?!

679. Additionally, the Tribunal specifically addressed TANESCO's assertion that an IRR of
22.31% was not permitted by the terms of the Decision, referring to the first sentence of
paragraph 339 of the Decision.*** The Tribunal stated that: "[TANESCO] [took] this out
of context ignoring the following sentence, which provide[d] that such tariff 'was based
on an assumption that IPTL's equity contribution could be made by way of a shareholder
loan, which the Tribunal has rejected” .8° In the Committee's view, this is a clear
statement by the Tribunal that in its Decision it did not consider the IRR of 22.31% to be
appropriate because it was applied on a shareholder's loan basis and not because of the

percentage of the IRR (i.e. 22.31%).

680. TANESCO asserts that the Tribunal sought to justify its decision on the basis of a witness
statement that was fully before it prior to the issuance of both the Award and the Decision
on Jurisdiction. Therefore, according to TANESCO, it is unclear why the Tribunal
reached a wholly different conclusion as to the nature and level of the tariff in its Award,
despite relying on evidence that was already in its possession at the time it issued the
Decision on Jurisdiction.*** The Committee disagrees with TANESCO for the following

reasons.

681. As it can be seen from the Decision on Jurisdiction at paragraphs 268-271, the Tribunal
took into consideration and addressed thoroughly Mr Ehrhardt's expert report.
Specifically, the Tribunal quoted Mr Ehrhardt's assertion that "[i]f the shareholder loan
had been permitted in lieu of an equity contribution, the payments to shareholders would
not have been subject to the dividend payment constraints, which would have eliminated
or reduced the 'trapped cash' and would have required a much smaller Capacity Payment

to provide the agreed 22.31 percent, after-tax return on equity..."**> The Tribunal agreed

with the expert and concluded that "[t]he financial effect of replacing true equity, i.e. paid
up capital by a shareholder loan, was explained by Mr Ehrhardt. The Tribunal is
persuaded that a shareholder's loan would cost a substantial amount less than true equity
over the life of the project, even if both earned exactly the same_rate of return...

[emphasis added by the Committee]".°°°

In the Award, the Tribunal referred again to Mr Ehrhardt's statement, explaining that
"[TANESCO] itself was saying that the IRR could remain the same, but the tariff should
have been lower because payments to shareholders under a shareholder loan would not
have been subject to dividend payment constraints. The fundamental point is that the tax
savings that IPTL gained from the actual use of shareholder loans rather than equity
should have been transferred to TANESCO. The objective of the recalculation was to
transfer those tax savings to TANESCO and that was what the negotiations between the

Parties were to be directed to".8°”

It its clear to the Committee that, both in the Decision on Jurisdiction and in the Award,
the Tribunal interpreted the expert report as allowing the possibility of the IRR to remain
the same (22.31%). In the Committee's view, the Tribunal's approach in the Award with
respect to the tariff was perfectly consistent with its determination in the Decision on
Jurisdiction. Therefore, there is no contradictory reasoning behind the Tribunal’s

determination in the Award regarding the applicability of an IRR of 22.31%.

Additionally, the Tribunal explained that, since tax savings were transferred to
TANESCO on the basis of an IRR of 22.31%, which was the whole point of the
recalculation, it could not see on what basis a deviation from that IRR would be justified
without speculating on what the Parties might have done under a theoretical negotiation
at the time the PPA was entered into, had the Parties been on notice that shareholder loans

rather than equity would be used.***

Finally, the Tribunal stated that, when the Parties explained their arguments regarding
the IRR to the Tribunal, both their approaches were inconsistent with the parameters set
out in the Decision. Thus, the Tribunal concluded that the tariff had to be determined on

the basis of an IRR of 22.31% applied to a shareholder loan.**?

The Committee concludes that the Tribunal provided the Parties with explicit reasoning
as to why it considered that an IRR of 22.31% applied to a shareholder loan was suitable.
The Committee does not find contradictory reasons nor any failure by the Tribunal to
state reasons as to why in the Award it considered that the tariff should have been
determined on the basis of an IRR of 22.31%. Consequently, there is no ground for

annulment under this argument.
VII. Costs

The Committee will now address the Parties' arguments regarding the allocation of costs

in this proceeding.

i) TANESCO's arguments
Relief sought

Pursuant to both its Costs Submissions and the Reply Cost Submissions, TANESCO

seeks the following relief:

In the event that the Committee annuls the Award, in whole or in part, on the basis of the
Tribunal's reconsideration of its Decision of Jurisdiction, an order that SCB HK (i) bears
the full costs of this Annulment Proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the
Members of the Committee; and (ii) reimburses TANESCO for its legal costs and

expenses.*4?

In the event the Committee annuls the Award, in whole or in part, on any basis other than

the Tribunal's reconsideration of its Decision on Jurisdiction, an order that the Parties (i)

share in equal proportions the full costs of this Annulment Proceeding, including the fees

and other expenses.**!

In the event that the Committee does not annul the Award, in whole or in part, an order
that the Parties (i) share in equal proportions the full costs of this Annulment Proceeding,
including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee; and (ii) each bear

their own legal costs and other expenses.*4?
Costs Incurred by TANESCO

TANESCO states that during the annulment phase of this Proceeding, it was and remains
represented by Tanzania-based counsel from the law firms Crax Law Partners and R.K.
Rweyongeza & Co. in Dar es Salaam, together with international law firm Clyde & Co
LLP. The remuneration of both firms is based upon on a joint lump-sum fixed fee of
10,291,160,000 TZS. This sum is inclusive of expenses and disbursements incurred
during the course of the Annulment Proceeding, including the fees and expenses of
TANESCO's expert witness, Professor August Reinisch. TANESCO explains that it
selected its counsel in this Annulment Proceeding on the basis of a tender process on
December 21, 2016. As of that date, the US$/TZS exchange rate was 1/2174.4999.
Accordingly, the US$ equivalent of the joint lump-sum fixed fee is US$ 4,732,656.00.84

Additionally, TANESCO indicates that it has made the following advance payments to
ICSID in accordance with Regulation 14 of the Centre's Administrative and Financial
Regulations: US$ 94,972.84 (allocated from the original proceedings at TANESCO's
request); US$ 100,000 (confirmed as received by way of the Centre's letter dated May
11, 2017); and US$ 200,000 (confirmed as received by way of the Centre's letter dated
August 2, 2017). To these amounts, the Committee adds US$ 200,000 (confirmed as

received by way of the Centre's letter dated June 6, 2018).

84 TANESCO's Costs Si
845 TANESCO's C
846 TANESCO's C

In its Costs Submissions, TANESCO states that in the event that the Committee
determines that the Award ought to be annulled, in full or in part, on the basis of the
Tribunal's reconsideration of its Decision on Jurisdiction, SCB HK should cover the full

costs that TANESCO has incurred.*“*

TANESCO argues that annulment proceedings concern the actions of the tribunal in
producing an award and not necessarily the actions of the parties to the proceedings.
However, it considers that the genesis of this Annulment Proceeding was SCB HK's
application that the Tribunal reconsider its Decision. Thus, it submits that this initial step,
and SCB HK's subsequent conduct, justifies an order that SCB HK pay TANESCO's

costs.*45

First, TANESCO considers that SCB HK opportunistically grasped the chance to have a
second bite at the jurisdictional cherry through its application contained within its
Submissions on Tariff dated November 11, 2014. TANESCO considers that the Tribunal

was induced to adopt SCB HK's position in the Award.*4°

Second, TANESCO argues that SCB HK waited almost a year to file the application for
reconsideration. It is TANESCO's position that SCB HK either knew or had the means
to know of the emptying of the funds in the Escrow Account far earlier than it maintained
in its application for reconsideration. The application itself made reference to articles
from the Citizen newspaper dated March 9 and 17, 2014 which, according to TANESCO,
described the emptying of funds in escrow, published circa eight months in advance of

SCB HK's application for reconsideration.**”

Third, TANESCO argues that SCB HK littered its application for reconsideration with
accusations of corruption within the various Tanzanian judicial and political institutions

and that this influenced the Tribunal to adopt the course that led to this Annulment

Proceeding. SCB HK subsequently withdrew the allegations within the course of this

Annulment Proceeding.*#8

In sum, TANESCO submits that but for the actions of SCB HK relating to its belated
application for reconsideration and its conduct in respect of that application, it is likely
that these proceedings would not have been necessary or, alternatively, that the

proceedings would have required far less resources.**?

In its Reply Costs Submissions, TANESCO states that an ad hoc committee has the
power to award costs as it deems fit and is not bound to follow any general rules or
practices of other ad hoc committees, as provided for in Articles 52(4) and 61(2) of the
Convention. Furthermore, it argues that pursuant to Arbitration Rules 47(1)(j) and 53,
the Decision of the Committee should also include its decision with respect to the cost of

the Annulment Proceeding.**°

In response to SCB HK's arguments, TANESCO states that the Committee is not required
to adopt a "costs follow the event" approach in respect of the administrative costs of the
annulment proceedings. TANESCO refers to Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID
Administrative and Financial Regulations which provides that advance payments are
made "without prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article 52(4)
of the Convention to decide how and by whom expenses incurred in connection with the
annulment proceeding shall be paid". Accordingly, the Committee retains its discretion

as to who ought to be responsible for these costs.**!

TANESCO opposes SCB HK's argument that there is a "default" position to the effect
that administrative costs follow the event in the case of an unsuccessful application. It
explains that, in Azurix v. Argentina it was acknowledged that rendering an order that an
unsuccessful applicant pay the full costs of the annulment proceedings was a departure
from previous practice. That previous practice had been that administrative costs be

shared between the parties even in the event of an unsuccessful application and was

established in the decisions in Wena Hotels v. Egypt, MTD v. Chile, Soufraki v. UAE and

Lucchetti v. Peru.S>?

Furthermore, TANESCO notes that in Wena Hotels v. Egypt, the ad hoc committee
rendered its decision "in light of the importance of the arguments advanced by the Parties
in connection with this case..." TANESCO considers that its Application for Annulment
raises highly significant issues going to the very heart of the ICSID arbitration process
which the Committee ought to take into account when considering the issue of the

allocation of administrative costs.°3

TANESCO states that the cases cited by SCB HK in its Cost Submissions may suggest a
trend, but that there is no such "default" or "normal" rule that the Committee either ought
to, or is bound to, apply in the event that the Application for Annulment is unsuccessful.
In the event the Committee rejects the Application for Annulment, it should nonetheless
render an order that the administrative costs of the Annulment Proceeding be shared

between the Parties in equal proportions.**+

TANESCO states that the Parties ought to each bear their own legal costs in the event
that the Committee rejects the Application for Annulment. TANESCO notes that ad hoc
committees have consistently determined that, even in the event of an unsuccessful
application, each party bears its own legal costs. TANESCO points out that this was the
approach adopted by each of the ad hoc committees in the decisions expressly referred
to in SCB HK's Cost Submissions (in alleged support of its position that TANESCO

ought to be responsible for the administrative costs of the Annulment Proceeding).°*

TANESCO indicates that SCB HK makes no reference to a recent decision whereby an
ad hoc committee considered that the proposed threshold for a costs order against an

unsuccessful applicant is when the case is "fundamentally lacking in merit" and "to any

reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed", thereby ordering that each

party bear its own costs.°°°

Applying this same reasoning, TANESCO argues that its Application for Annulment
clearly has significant merit. It argues that, by contrast, the three decisions that SCB HK
seeks to rely upon contain minimal justification in respect of the adverse cost order
against the unsuccessful applicant and that none of these cases assist the Committee in

respect of the exercise of its discretion on costs in these proceedings.*°7

Finally, TANESCO states that there are strong policy grounds against ad hoc committees
adopting the approach suggested by SCB HK in its Cost Submissions. TANESCO
explains that annulment is the only recourse that an unsuccessful party has under the
ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. To apply a general "costs follow the event"
approach to both legal and administrative costs would risk deterring bona fide

applications.*°*

If the Application for Annulment is unsuccessful, TANESCO requests that the

Committee orders that each party bear its own legal costs.°°°

TANESCO considers that it ought not to be responsible for SCB HK's costs in the event
that the Application for Annulment is unsuccessful. In addition, TANESCO disputes
SCB HK's alleged position that even in the event the Annulment Application is
successful, the Committee ought to punish TANESCO with an adverse cost order based

on its bad conduct.

To the contrary, TANESCO states that its conduct in respect of this Annulment
Proceeding has been at all times professional and in good faith. TANESCO explains that
it has had no choice but to respond to SCB HK's accusations in order to correct the record.

TANESCO does so by reference to the paragraph numbering contained in SCB HK's

Cost Submissions: a) Paragraph 23(i) and (ii): it was the application for reconsideration
that led the Tribunal to reconsider its Decision on Jurisdiction. In any event, and
notwithstanding their complete lack of merit, SCB HK's submissions at paragraph 23(i)
and (ii) are nothing more than further belated additional submissions in respect of the
substantive proceedings. TANESCO submits that the Committee ought to ignore and/or
disregard paragraph 23(i) and (ii) on the basis that they are unauthorised; b) Paragraph
23(iii): SCB HK asserts that costs have been "substantially" increased as a result of
TANESCO allegedly (i) raising new objections not argued before the Tribunal, (ii)
raising new objections previously conceded before the Tribunal, (iii) re-opening issues
of fact from the underlying arbitration and, (iv) making new allegations of fact not argued
before the Tribunal. First, SCB HK provides no detail as to the level of time spent
addressing any of these alleged issues. Its bare assertion that costs were increased
substantially has no factual or evidential foundation and ought to be ignored by the
Committee on that basis. Second, TANESCO states that it has already responded to SCB
HK's incorrect accusations in respect of these alleged issues in the context of both its
written and oral submissions; c) Paragraph 23(iv): TANESCO rejects any accusation that
it has sought to mislead the Committee in any way during this Annulment Proceeding.
TANESCO has relied upon, inter alia, contemporaneous documentation in respect of
demonstrating that SCB HK's level of knowledge regarding the 2013 Settlement

Agreement was in excess of that put before the Tribunal.*°

TANESCO states that SCB HK is at least correct in saying that it is common practice for
international tribunals to take into account the conduct of the parties when allocating
costs. It further argues that SCB HK could have found specific support for this
proposition from certain ad hoc committee decisions referred to elsewhere in its Cost
Submissions.®°! Those decisions, explains TANESCO, refer to the conduct of the parties

and counsel throughout the respective annulment proceedings as well as the general

importance of the issues raised by the applicant in considering adequate cost orders. Each

of these decisions provided for each party to bear their own legal costs.

TANESCO submits that the conduct of SCB HK during the course of this Annulment
Proceeding fell short of that expected of a party to ICSID arbitration. TANESCO
considers that SCB HK: (i) deployed a number of guerrilla tactics during the proceeding,
including when it attacked Professor Reinisch's standing to present a legal opinion in
support of TANESCO's position via unfounded allegations concerning his connection
with a member of the Committee, and (ii) instigated a smear campaign against
TANESCO and Tanzania. TANESCO was forced to respond to this unwarranted attempt
to prejudice the Committee against TANESCO and the Tanzanian judiciary and SCB HK
soon abandoned its efforts in this respect. Nonetheless, TANESCO was required to set
the record straight, devoting significant time to explain the true nature of CAG and PAC

reports, Tanzanian law, and the integrity of Tanzania's legal system.°®

TANESCO states that its conduct during the Annulment Proceeding was as required by
a party applying in good faith for the annulment of an award and that it is clear that the
issues raised by way of the Application for Annulment are of significant importance to
the integrity of the ICSID framework. Accordingly, it considers that under no
circumstances should TANESCO be faced with a costs order requiring it to reimburse
SCB HK for its legal costs and other expenses — especially in the event that its

Application is successful.5°*+

With respect to the volume of costs incurred by TANESCO and SCB HK, respectively,
TANESCO notes that the costs incurred by it in respect of the Annulment Proceeding are
in excess of those incurred by SCB HK. However, it explains that SCB HK's counsel has
remained constant throughout the duration of its dispute with TANESCO and thus
possessed an extensive and recyclable fount of knowledge. By contrast, Clyde & Co LLP
were instructed only after the Application for Annulment had been lodged with the ICSID

secretariat (i.e. circa one year ago) and did not enjoy the same level of knowledge of the

extensive and detailed factual background, and the spectrum of legal argument, as
counsel for SCB HK. TANESCO further explains that its counsel had to perform the
substantial exercise of reviewing information exchanged during the course of almost a
decade to understand the arguments raised and positions taken during the course of the
underlying proceedings in order to fully plead TANESCO's case on annulment before the
Committee. Furthermore, it argues that TANESCO, as applicant, had the burden of
positively asserting its annulment case, including by reference to expert evidence
provided by Professor August Reinisch. This allegedly required significant resources to
be devoted to this matter by TANESCO and for appropriate provision to be made when
determining the fixed fee allocated to the case. It explains that this allocation was justified
when it came to the Annulment Proceeding and, in particular, in response to SCB HK's
tactics and approach to written pleadings, which required TANESCO's counsel to expend

significant time and resources.*°

ii) SCB HK's arguments

SCB HK seeks the following relief: (i) an order that TANESCO bear the full costs and
expenses incurred by ICSID in relation to this Annulment Proceeding, including the fees
and expenses of the Members of the Committee; and (ii) an order that TANESCO
reimburse SCB HK for the legal costs and expenses SCB HK has incurred in defending
this Annulment Proceeding within sixty days of the date of dispatch of the Committee's
decision on annulment, increased by simple interest at the rate of three month LIBOR
plus 4% (rate of interest under the PPA and rate of interest used by the Tribunal in its

Award), until full payment is received.
Costs Incurred

SCB HK states that this Annulment Proceeding had lasted over 13 months at the date of
its Costs Submissions and has involved the submission of lengthy written pleadings, as
well as oral proceedings before the Committee. In light of these considerations, SCB HK

considers that its costs in defending the Application for Annulment were reasonably

incurred and are reasonable in amount. The legal fees of Herbert Smith Freehills LLP

and Linklaters LLP were charged on an hourly basis.°°”

SCB HK claims the following costs from TANESCO: Herbert Smith Freehills LLP —
legal services and disbursements (to March 2, 2018) £593,692.21. Linklaters LLP — legal
services and disbursements (to March 2, 2018) £69,670.21. Total costs (to March 2,
2018): £663,362.42.5%

SCB HK explains that it is well established that a party recovering costs from the other
party in investment arbitration can only recover costs which were incurred reasonably.
The costs TANESCO claims are not reasonable and SCB HK should not be ordered to

pay those costs, regardless of the Committee's decision on annulment.*”

SCB HK considers the costs claimed by TANESCO are entirely disproportionate to these
proceedings and therefore unreasonable, because: (i) they are far higher than is usual in
ICSID annulment proceedings. A recent study into costs in investment arbitration found
that the average costs claim for applicants in annulment proceedings was US$ 1.26
million. TANESCO has claimed costs of over US$ 4.7 million (US$ 4,732,656.00),
nearly four times this amount; and (ii) they are disproportionately high compared with
the costs incurred by SCB HK in this Annulment Proceeding. SCB HK's costs amount to
£663,362.42, or approximately US$ 912,541.25.35.87

SCB HK notes that there is no reason why TANESCO's costs should be so much higher
than SCB HK's because of the following considerations: (i) on average, applicants claim
less costs in annulment proceedings than respondents; (ii) the fixed fee of US$
4,732,656.00 bears no resemblance to the length and complexity of these proceedings
(e.g. TANESCO has presented no factual witnesses and only one expert witness. The
Hearing was short); (iii) TANESCO claims that it informed its counsel of their success

in a tender process on December 21, 2016. Taking this as a starting point for when their

work began on these proceedings, TANESCO's counsel has done around 11 months of

work for their fixed fee.8”!

SCB HK further notes that TANESCO's changes of counsel have inflated its costs
unreasonably, as Clyde & Co LLP is the third international law firm TANESCO has used
during the Arbitration Proceeding and this Annulment Proceeding. Each time TANESCO
changes its counsel, the new counsel must necessarily spend time familiarising

themselves with the case.°”*

Additionally, SCB HK notes that TANESCO has offered no explanation of: how these
fees were split between local and international counsel; how the fixed fee relates in any
way to the anticipated length and complexity of these proceedings; and the disbursements
actually incurred on behalf of TANESCO and how much of the fixed fee was apportioned

to an estimated allocation for disbursements and expenses.*”*

Finally, SCB HK notes that TANESCO has not confirmed in its Costs Submissions when
the fixed fee lump sum falls due, or if there are any conditions attached to payment, or
whether it has actually paid the fixed fee lump-sum to its local and international

counsel.8”4
Allocation of Costs

SCB HK states that if the Application for Annulment fails the Committee should follow
the principle of "costs follow the event" and if it succeeds the Committee should make a

costs order against TANESCO in any event.*”>

SCB HK provides that Article 61(2) of the Convention grants ICSID tribunal's broad

discretion as to how to allocate the costs of the arbitration between the parties.*”°

 

85 SCB HK's Costs Submissions, 17.
87 SCB HK's Costs Submissions, 14.

212

727. SCB HK also refers to ICSID Arbitration Rules 47(1)(j) and 53, which provide that the
annulment decision should contain "any decision of the [Committee] regarding the cost
of the proceeding". Therefore, the Committee has the power to award costs as it deems
appropriate in these proceedings and is not bound to follow any general rules or the

practices of previous annulment committees.*””

728. In consideration of the previous, SCB HK asks the Committee to exercise its discretion
to award SCB HK its costs in any event, and in particular to order that TANESCO: (i)
bear the full costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in this Annulment Proceeding,
including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee; and (ii) reimburse
SCB HK for the legal costs and expenses it has incurred in defending this Annulment

Proceeding.*’*

729. The following sections address in more detail the elements of the Committee's discretion

as stated by SCB HK.

730. SCB HK states that, whilst there is no default rule for costs allocation in the ICSID
Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules, two main approaches may be identified in the
case law: (i) each party should bear its own costs and (ii) costs follow the event. SCB HK
notes that the conduct of the parties and the nature of their cases are relevant

considerations as stated by the tribunal in Caratube v. Kazakhstan.’”

731. SCB HK explains that, in international arbitration generally, it is common practice for
the losing party to bear the costs of the arbitration and to compensate the successful party
for its fees and expenses reasonably incurred. According to SCB HK, it is increasingly
becoming the norm in investment arbitration for the successful party to be awarded costs,
and a substantial number of ICSID tribunals have adopted the rule when exercising their

discretion in allocating costs.**°

Also, SCB HK explains that in ICSID annulment proceedings, there are further
compelling reasons why the starting point of the Committee's costs analysis should be
that costs follow the event, in relation to both the costs of the arbitration (i.e. ICSID costs

and the costs of the Committee) and the parties’ legal costs.

Annulment Proceeding cos

 

Regarding the costs of the Annulment Proceeding, SCB HK explains that Regulation
14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations requires an applicant for
annulment alone to make advance payments to cover the expenses of the annulment
proceedings following the constitution of the Committee. Whilst this is expressed to be
"without prejudice to the right of the Committee ... to decide how and by whom expenses
incurred in connection with the annulment proceeding shall be paid", a number of ad hoc
Committees have adjudged that it establishes a default position that the applicant bears
the costs of the annulment proceedings in the event of an unsuccessful application for

annulment.**!

Thus, SCB HK states that in one of the more detailed analyses of the allocation of costs
in annulment proceedings, the committee in Azurix v. Argentina stated that: "... as a
matter of discretion, the normal course should be for a wholly unsuccessful applicant for
annulment carry the burden of the whole of the costs of the Centre advanced by it
associated with the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the members of the
ad hoc committee. Of course, the Committee does not exclude the possibility that
circumstances might justify a departure from this normal rule, but the Committee finds

no such exceptional circumstances in the present case”.**?

SCB HK submits that, in the event the Application for Annulment is rejected, the
Committee should follow the "normal rule" outlined by the committee in Azurix v.

Argentina, as there are no circumstances which justify a departure from this principle.***

Legal costs

SCB HK states that an unsuccessful applicant should bear the risk of its application
failing and, as well as paying for the annulment proceeding itself, should reimburse the
respondent for its expenses incurred in protecting the award. SCB HK supports this
approach with the decision issued by the committee in Adem Dogan v. Turkmenistan,
which ordered that the unsuccessful applicant bear the costs of the annulment
proceedings and the respondent's legal costs in full, stating that: "[i]n deciding how to
allocate the costs of this proceeding, the [c]ommittee has been guided by the principle
that 'costs follow the event’, unless a different approach is called for. The Committee has
found no such indication in this case. The Claimant has prevailed in totality and should
not be burdened by having to pay for his defence in this annulment proceeding". Further,
SCB HK, also states that a similar conclusion was reached by several other

committees, 84

To sum up, SCB HK states that TANESCO paid the advance payment requested by the
Secretary-General in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e). If the Application for
Annulment fails, there is no reason for the Committee to depart from the "normal rule"
in annulment proceedings that the applicant should bear this cost. Having been successful
in the Arbitration Proceeding, SCB HK was forced to defend these proceedings and
should not be required to pay for them if it does so successfully. SCB HK states that the
same reasoning applies to the costs of SCB HK's legal representation. If the Application

for Annulment fails, the Committee should follow the approach of the committees in

738. In the case that the Application for Annulment succeeds, SCB HK states that the
Committee should make a costs order against TANESCO in any event for the following

reasons.

739. SCB HK states that it is common practice for international tribunals to take into account
the conduct of the parties when allocating costs. This may be a reason to depart from the
general rule that costs follow the event. SCB HK further explains that procedural
misconduct is often cited by tribunals and ad hoc committees as a reason for ordering
that costs be borne by a particular party. For example, in LETCO v. Liberia the tribunal
awarded LETCO the full costs incurred in the arbitration (including costs of legal
representation) because of Liberia's "procedural bad faith" in the proceedings. In Telenor
v. Hungary, one of the reasons the tribunal ordered Telenor to pay Hungary its full costs
was that Telenor's claims had "been put differently at different stages of the arbitral

proceedings".**°

740. According to SCB HK, exceptional circumstances exist that justify the Committee
making a costs award against TANESCO. SCB HK notes that it was TANESCO's
misleading conduct that led the Tribunal to reconsider its Decision. If the Application for
Annulment succeeds on the narrow ground that the Tribunal's original incorrect Decision
not to order payment was res judicata and should not have been reconsidered, then this
incorrect Decision will have to be reinstated. In such a scenario TANESCO will have

profited from its own wrong in misleading the Tribunal. In turn, SCB HK argues that as

a result of TANESCO's misleading conduct, it will be penalised by not receiving the
order for payment of the sums due under the PPA to which the Tribunal concluded it
should legally be entitled. In such a scenario it would be wrong for SCB HK to be further

penalised by having to bear the cost of these annulment proceedings.**”

SCB HK explains that only two of TANESCO's grounds of annulment (that there was no
qualifying investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention, and/or that the Tribunal
failed to give reasons for concluding there was a qualifying investment) would, if
accepted, result in the annulment of the entire Award. The acceptance of any other ground
could, at most, result in only a partial annulment of the Award. Therefore, SCB HK
explains that even if the Application for Annulment is successful on the narrow basis that
the Decision should not have been reconsidered, and the Award is partially annulled, this
does not affect TANESCO's liability under the PPA. In such circumstances, the
Tribunal's finding in its Decision that TANESCO is liable under the PPA will still stand
and therefore it should pay for these proceedings and SCB HK's costs in defending

them.®88

SCB HK notes that TANESCO raised a number of other grounds for annulment that it
considers were simply unarguable and should not have been raised, substantially
increasing the cost of the annulment proceedings. SCB HK states that TANESCO raised
new objections to jurisdiction which were not argued before the Tribunal and objections
which it had previously conceded before the Tribunal. In addition, it considers that
TANESCO has attempted to re-open issues of fact from the Arbitration Proceeding and
has made new allegations of fact that were not argued before the Tribunal. In responding
to these arguments, SCB HK indicates that it has been forced to incur considerable legal

fees.5%

SCB HK further notes that many of TANESCO's factual allegations have been
inappropriate, often inaccurate and at times misleading. For example, TANESCO has

repeatedly attempted to mischaracterise SCB HK's knowledge of the 2013 Settlement

  

217

744.

745.

746.

747.

Agreement, despite the Tribunal finding, as a matter of fact, that SCB HK did not have
knowledge of the terms of the 2013 Settlement Agreement and that there was "no

evidence that [SCB HK] knew that the Escrow Account had in fact been emptied".

In sum, SCB HK, states that TANESCO's conduct in the Arbitration Proceeding (where
it misled the Tribunal) and in these proceedings (where it has tried to avoid the
consequences of its misleading conduct) falls far short of the conduct expected of a party
bringing an application for annulment in good faith. Therefore, exceptional
circumstances exist which justify the Committee making a costs award against

TANESCO in any event.**!

SCB HK does not agree with TANESCO's proposed allocation of costs, whereby in the
event the Committee determines that the Award ought to be annulled on the basis of the
Tribunal's reconsideration of its Decision, SCB HK should be ordered to pay the full
costs that TANESCO has incurred.*°

In response to TANESCO's Costs Submissions, SCB HK states that: (i) TANESCO had
requested the Tribunal to issue a Decision rather than an Award; (ii) TANESCO's
suggestion that SCB HK "induced" or adversely influenced the Tribunal is extraordinary
and unwarranted; (iii) TANESCO's claim that SCB HK showed a "blatant disregard" for
the effect that its request for reconsideration would have on the integrity of the ICSID
rule-based system is unwarranted; (iv) TANESCO attempts to mischaracterise SCB HK's
knowledge of the 2013 Settlement Agreement and its motivation for bringing the
application for reconsideration; and (v) TANESCO is incorrect to allege that the Tribunal
was improperly influenced by allegations of corruption, or that such allegations are

"baseless".5°

SCB HK asserts that it was, and still is, entitled to protect its rights pursuant to ICSID

arbitration, including by bringing an application for reconsideration of the Tribunal's

Decision. There is no settled rule that decisions of ICSID tribunals should not be open to
reconsideration, and SCB HK should not be penalised for raising the argument,
particularly where the need to reconsider the Decision in the current case was caused by

misleading conduct by TANESCO, disclosed after the Decision.**

SCB HK asserts that it is TANESCO's case which, if accepted by the Committee, would
adversely impact the integrity of the ICSID rule-based system. Its effect would be to
render impotent any tribunal which was confronted with evidence of fraudulent
misrepresentations. It would force a tribunal to find in favour of a party on the basis of
information that it knows to be untrue, in the knowledge that on the basis of the true facts
it should find in favour of the other party. At the heart of this case is TANESCO's blatant
disregard for the integrity of the ICSID system, as evidenced by the Tribunal's finding
that TANESCO had deliberately misled it on crucial matters.*°

SCB HK explains that the delay in bringing the application for reconsideration can be
explained by developments in Tanzania in 2014. Between April and September 2014,
SCB HK was subject to a broad interim ex parte injunction obtained by PAP-controlled
IPTL and PAP against TANESCO and SCB HK in the High Court of Tanzania which
restrained the Parties from doing anything towards enforcing, complying with or
operationalising the Decision. Following an inter partes hearing in September 2014, SCB
HK was no longer restrained from operationalising the Decision. This, in SCB HK's view,

explains the delay in bringing the Application for Reconsideration.*°°

SCB HK states that the articles from the Citizen newspaper dated March 9 and 17, 2014,
on which TANESCO relied to argue that SCB HK knew of the emptying of the funds in
escrow, were published after the Decision, and weeks before the imposition of the ex

parte injunction.®*”

SCB HK further states that SCB HK has always been careful to draw a distinction

between the findings of fraud and corruption in the CAG and PAC reports, on the one

hand, and the factual evidence unearthed by those investigations — in particular of
TANESCO's actions with respect to the 2013 Settlement Agreement — on the other. In its
Tariff Submission (i.e. its application for reconsideration) SCB HK made clear to the
Tribunal that it relied upon the evidence unearthed by the CAG and PAC Reports about
how the Tariff Dispute was settled and the Escrow Account emptied, rather than their
conclusions about corruption. Moreover, in its Award, the Tribunal did not base its
reconsideration on corruption. The reconsideration was based on the fact that it had been

misled by TANESCO about the settlement of the Tariff Dispute.***

SCB HK notes that it did not rely on allegations of corruption before the Tribunal, or
during the substantive phase of the Annulment Proceeding. Therefore, SCB HK has not
"withdrawn" these allegations. They are not, SCB HK explains, allegations made in the
first instance by SCB HK - they are allegations made in the CAG and PAC Reports. SCB
HK does not believe that the conclusions of corruption in those reports are "baseless". In
this regard, SCB HK notes that this also appears to be the view of the Tanzanian
prosecutors which brought corruption charges against Mr Rugemalira (of VIP) and Mr

Sethi (of PAP) in June 2017.8”

iii) Analysis and Decision of the Committee

The starting point for this Committee to decide on the allocation of costs is Article 61(2)
of the Convention, which grants ICSID tribunals broad discretion as to how to allocate
the costs of the arbitration between the Parties: "[i]n the case of arbitration proceedings
the [t]ribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by
the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those
expenses, the fees of the members of the [t]ribunal and the charges for the use of the
facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award". Article
52(4) of the Convention provides that this provision applies mutatis mutandis to
proceedings before an ad hoc Committee. The ICSID Arbitration Rules do not limit this

discretion.

88 SCB HK's Reply Costs Submissions, {20, footnote 32, referring to SCB HK's Counter-Memorial on
Annulment, (91204-26.
8 SCB HK's Reply Costs Submissions, 19-23.

220

754.

755.

756.

757.

Additionally, ICSID Arbitration Rules 47(1)(j) and 53 provide that the decision of the
Committee should contain "any decision of the [Committee] regarding the cost of the
proceeding". Therefore, the Committee has the power to award costs as it deems
appropriate in these proceedings and is not bound to follow any general rules or the

practices of previous annulment committees.

The Committee in interpreting these provisions, considers that it is clear that they do not
provide for any default rule for costs allocation. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the

ICSID Arbitration Rules contain such a default rule.

Nonetheless, the Committee has reviewed and considered similar cases, and notes that
three main approaches may be identified: (i) each party should bear its own costs; and
(ii) costs follow the event. As stated by Caratube v. Kazakhstan: "[t}wo main approaches
may be distinguished in awarding costs in investment arbitrations. Some tribunals
apportion ICSID costs equally where they were incurred and rule that each party should
bear its own costs. Others apply the principle 'costs follow the event’, making the losing
party bear all or part of the costs of the proceedings, including those of the prevailing
party; [and (iii)] Furthermore, another criterion commonly adopted is the general conduct

of a party and the more or less serious nature of the case it has defended”.°”°

The Committee, after considering the conduct of the Parties and the nature of their cases,
determines to allocate costs as follows. Considering that TANESCO did not prevail in its
Application for Annulment and applying the principle of "costs follow the event",
TANESCO shall bear the costs of this Annulment Proceeding. Taking into consideration
that the Parties acted dutifully during the Annulment Proceeding and that TANESCO had
a reasonable case, the Committee decides that each party shall bear its own legal costs

incurred in presenting their positions.

For the reasons set forth above, the Committee decides unanimously that:

(1) The Application for Annulment of the Award rendered on September 12, 2016,
submitted by TANESCO is dismissed in its entirety;

(2) TANESCO shall bear the entire costs of the proceeding, including the fees and
expenses of the Members of the Committee; and

(3) Each party shall bear its own legal costs.
