Upon the foregoing papers and for the reasons set forth on the record (9/27/2021), the petition to
stay arbitration is denied. It is beyond dispute that the parties freely and unequivocally agreed to
arbitrate all of their disputes in New York (NYSCEF Doc. Nos. NYSCEF Doc. No. 29, 31, 33,
Art. 20). Indeed, the petitioners drafted the very agreements containing the arbitration clauses
they now seek to invalidate (NYSCEF Doc. No. 26, {f[ 3-8). The petitioners fail to establish that
the arbitration provisions are illegal under Haitian law or to otherwise invalidate the agreements
they drafted (compare NYSCEF Doc. No 45 [agreements are illegal under Article 956] with

NYSCEF Doc. Nos. 28 and 48 [explaining that Article 973, which supersedes Article 956,

NYSCEF Doc. no. 6 aSe 1:21-cv-06704-PKC Document 29-1 Filed 09/27/21 Page 2.of Byscer: 09/27/2021

provides that the prohibition on arbitration does not apply to international arbitration, which
Article 971 defines as arbitration involving “international trade’”’]; see also NYSCEF Doc. No.
49). The agreements at issue are clearly international in scope (see e.g., NYSCEF Doc. No. 49).
The petitioners offer no support for their contention that the arbitration clauses were included by
mistake. Inasmuch as the agreements contained an alternate method for service of the demand
for arbitration, service under the Hague Convention was not required. Finally, because CPLR §
7505(3) requires that an “application to stay arbitration must be made ... within twenty days of
the notice or demand,” or else be “precluded,” the petitioners are also precluded from seeking to
stay arbitration now as their petition was filed at least 32 days after notice of arbitration was
served by the respondent in accordance with the parties’ agreements. Accordingly, (i) the
petition to stay arbitration (mtn. seq. 001) is denied, (ii) the petitioners’ motion (mtn. seq. 002) to
stay arbitration is denied, (iii) the respondents’ cross-motion to compel arbitration is granted, and

(iv) the petitioners’ motion for disclosure and fees are denied as moot.

It is hereby,

ADJUDGED that the petition to stay the subject arbitration is denied in all respects, and the

petition is dismissed, with costs and disbursements to respondent; and it is further

ADJUDGED that the parties shall proceed to arbitration forthwith and respondent’s counsel shall

serve a copy of this judgment upon the arbitral tribunal; and it is further
