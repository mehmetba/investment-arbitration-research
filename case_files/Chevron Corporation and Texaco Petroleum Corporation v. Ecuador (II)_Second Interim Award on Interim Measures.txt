Second Interim Award on Interim Measures

dated 16 February 2012

 

The Arbitration Tribunal:
Dr. Horacio A. Grigera Na6n;
Professor Vaughan Lowe;
V.V. Veeder (President)

Administrative Secretary: Martin Doe

WHEREAS:

(A) The Tribunal made its First Interim Award on 25 January 2012, pending the oral
hearing on 11 February 2012 (the “Hearing”) and this Second Interim Award;

(B) The Claimants made their applications for further interim measures (in different
terms) by letters dated 4 and 12 January 2012 and at the Hearing; and by letters
dated 9, 13 and 24 January 2012 and at the Hearing, the Respondent (inter alia)
disputed the Claimants’ applications;

(C) The Hearing took place on 11 February 2012 in Washington DC, USA, attended
by the Parties’ legal representatives; and

(D)The Tribunal has considered the Parties’ several written and oral submissions
made to the Tribunal in regard to interim measures and further considered all
relevant circumstances current in this arbitration up to the date of the Hearing;

THE TRIBUNAL NOW MAKES THIS SECOND INTERIM AWARD AS
FOLLOWS:

1. The Tribunal determines that: (i) Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules (forming
part of the arbitration agreement invoked by the Claimants under the Treaty)
permits this Tribunal, at the request of a Party, to take interim measures
(established in the form of an order or award) in respect of the subject-matter of
the Parties’ dispute; (ii) Article 32(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules permits this
Tribunal to make (inter alia) an award in the form of an interim award; (iii) Article
32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that any award by this Tribunal is final
and binding on the Parties, with the Parties undertaking to carry out such award
without delay; and (iv) Articles VI.3(6) of the Treaty provides (inter alia) that an
award rendered by this Tribunal pursuant to Article VI.3(a)(iii) of the Treaty
under the UNCITRAL Rules shall be binding on the parties to the dispute (i.e. the
Claimants and the Respondent), with the Contracting Parties (i.e. here the
Respondent) undertaking to carry out without delay the provisions of any such
award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement;

2. The Tribunal determines further that the Claimants have established, for the
purpose of their said applications for interim measures, (i) a sufficient case as
regards both this Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide the merits of the Parties’ dispute
and the Claimants’ case on the merits against the Respondent; (ii) a sufficient

urgency given the risk that substantial harm may befall the Claimants before this
Tribunal can decide the Parties’ dispute by any final award; and (iii) a sufficient
likelihood that such harm to the Claimants may be irreparable in the form of
monetary compensation payable by the Respondent in the event that the
Claimants’ case on jurisdiction, admissibility and the merits should prevail before
this Tribunal;

Bearing in mind the Respondent’s several obligations under the Treaty and
international law, including the Respondent’s obligation to carry out and provide
for the enforcement of an award on the merits of the Parties’ dispute in these
arbitration proceedings and the Tribunal’s mission (required under the arbitration
agreement) efficaciously and fairly to decide the Parties’ dispute by a final award,
the Tribunal hereby orders:

(i) the Respondent (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches)
to take all measures necessary to suspend or cause to be suspended the
enforcement and recognition within and without Ecuador of the judgments
by the Provincial Court of Sucumbios, Sole Division ( Corte Provincial de
Justicia de Sucumbios, Sala Unica de la Corte Provincial de Justicia de
Sucumbios) of 3 January 2012 and of 13 January 2012 (and, to the extent
confirmed by the said judgments, of the judgment by Judge Nicolas
Zambrano Lozada of 14 February 2011) against the First Claimant in the
Ecuadorian legal proceedings known as “the Lago Agrio Case”;

(ii) in particular, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, such
measures to preclude any certification by the Respondent that would cause
the said judgments to be enforceable against the First Claimant; and

(iii) the Respondent’s Government to continue to inform this Tribunal, by the
Respondent’s legal representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all
measures which the Respondent has taken for the implementation of its
legal obligations under this Second Interim Award;

until any further order or award made by the Tribunal in these arbitration
proceedings;

. The Tribunal determines that the Claimants shall be legally responsible, jointly
and severally, to the Respondent for any costs or losses which the Respondent
may suffer in performing its legal obligations under this Second Interim Award, as
may be decided by the Tribunal within these arbitration proceedings (to the
exclusion of any other jurisdiction); and further that, as security for such
contingent responsibility the Claimants shall deposit within thirty days of the date
of this Second Interim Award the amount of US$ 50,000,000.00 (United States

Dollars Fifty Million) with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in a manner to be
designated separately, to the order of this Tribunal;

5. The Tribunal dismisses the application made by the Respondent to vacate its order
for interim measures of 9 February 2011;

6. The Tribunal’s existing orders for interim measures (as recited in the First Interim
Award) and the First Interim Award shall continue to have effect subject to the
terms of this Second Interim Award;

_

. This Second Interim Award is and shall remain subject to modification at any time
before the Tribunal’s final award in these arbitration proceedings; and, in the
meantime, any of the Parties may also apply to the Tribunal for such modification
upon seventy-two hours’ written notice for good cause shown, including any
material change in the legal or factual circumstances prevailing as at the date of
the Hearing;

8. This Second Interim Award is made strictly without prejudice to the merits of the
Parties’ sut and other p dural disputes, including the jpondent’s
objections as to jurisdiction, admissibility and merits;

9. This Second Interim Award shall take effect forthwith as an Interim Award, being
immediately final and binding upon all Parties as an award subject only to any
subsequent modification as herein provided, whether upon the Tribunal’s own
initiative or any Party’s application; and

10. This Interim Award, although separately signed by the Tribunal’s members on
three signing pages constitutes an “interim award” signed by the three arbitrators
under Article 32 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.
