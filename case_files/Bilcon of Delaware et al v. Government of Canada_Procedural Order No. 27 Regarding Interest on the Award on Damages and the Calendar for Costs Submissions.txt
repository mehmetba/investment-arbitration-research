INTRODUCTION
1. This Procedural Order reflects the Disputing Parties’ agreement with regard to the running of

interest on the amounts awarded by the Tribunal to the Investors in the Award on Damages of
January 10, 2019 as well as the procedural calendar for costs submissions.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

2. On January 10, 2019, the Tribunal issued the Award on Damages, awarding the Investors “the
amount of US$ 7 million as compensation for the Respondent’s breaches of NAFTA”. In addition,
the Respondent was ordered to pay “interest on this amount at a rate of the average one-year U.S.
Treasury bill yield for the corresponding calendar year, accruing annually on a compounded basis,
starting on 22 October 2007 and until full payment has been made”.

3. In its Award on Damages, the Tribunal also determined that “[a]ny decision on the costs of
arbitration is deferred to a final award on costs”.”

4. On February 22, 2019, following the completion of redactions of confidential information in the
Award on Damages, the Tribunal consulted the Disputing Parties with respect to the procedural
calendar for the filing of submissions on costs. On March 1, 2019, the Tribunal confirmed the
procedural calendar agreed between the Parties.

5. On April 11, 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Investors had commenced legal
proceedings at the place of arbitration, Ontario, Canada, seeking to set aside the Award on
Damages. The Respondent requested the Tribunal to suspend the enforcement of the Award on
Damages, including the running of interest on the amount granted, from April 8, 2019 onwards
and until the set-aside proceedings commenced by the Investors had been completed.

6. By letter dated April 26, 2019, the Investors notified the Tribunal that the Disputing Parties had
reached an agreement with regard to the running of interest on the Award on Damages, pending
the conclusion of set-aside proceedings in Ontario, Canada. In the same letter, the Investors
informed the Tribunal that both Disputing Parties had also agreed to suspend the procedural
calendar until the conclusion of the set-aside proceedings, and that they “jointly request[ed] an
order confirming the [Disputing] Parties’ agreement”.*

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION
7. Having regard to the Disputing Parties’ agreement, the Tribunal orders as follows:

a. The Disputing Parties’ costs submissions shall be deferred until a Canadian court has
dismissed or allowed the application for set aside and there is no further appeal; and

 

b. The Tribunal’s order in the Award on Damages requiring Canada to pay interest on
the amount awarded shall be suspended effective April 8, 2019, until a Canadian court
has dismissed or allowed the application for set-aside and there is no further appeal.
