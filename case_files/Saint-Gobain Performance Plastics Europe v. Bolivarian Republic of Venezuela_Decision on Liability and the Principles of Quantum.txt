SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY

ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND INSTITUTION OF THE PROCEEDINGS

This arbitration concerns a legal dispute between Saint-Gobain and Venezuela arising out
of Venezuela's alleged refusal to compensate Saint-Gobain for the expropriation of Saint-

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13 Page 10 of 234

Gobain's investment in its 99.99%! subsidiary Norpro Venezuela C.A. ("Norpro Vene-
zuela" or "Norpro") following a televised speech of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez
on 15 May 2010. Claimant alleges that Respondent breached the Agreement on Encour-
agement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Government of the French
Republic and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the "France-
Venezuela-BIT" or the "Treaty"), which entered into force on 15 April 2004, by refusing
to offer compensation for the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela's proppants plant in
Puerto Ordaz, Bolivar State, as well as by sanctioning or failing to intervene in the in-
crease of the price for the supply of bauxite allegedly in breach of a contract entered into
with a State-owned entity, thus failing to treat Claimant fairly and equitably and to accord
its investment full protection and security, in violation of Articles 5(1) and 3(1) and (2)
of the Treaty.

Article 5(1) of the France-Venezuela BIT provides in its authentic French and Spanish
«2
versions:~

"Les Parties contractantes ne pren- "Las Partes Contratantes no adop-
nent pas de mesures d'expropria- tardn medidas de expropriacién o
tion ou de nationalisation ou toutes de nacionalizacién ni cualquier
autres mesures dont l'effet est de otra medida cuyo efecto sea despo-
déposséder, directement ou indi- Jar, directa o indirectamente, a los
rectement, les nationaux et sociétés nacionales y sociedades de la otra

! One share is held by Mr. Luis Péez, a Venezuelan national and the President of Norpro Venezuela, who sub-
scribed a single share when Norpro Venezuela was incorporated. The planned transfer of Mr. Péez’s share to Saint-
Gobain has not yet been completed. Request, { 4, note 4.

? The free English translation of the French text published in the Official Journal of the French Republic No. 102,
30 April 2004, which has been submitted by Claimant as Exhibit C-1 and has not been challenged by Respondent,

reads:

"1. The Contracting Parties shall not take any direct or indirect measures to ex-
propriate or nationalize or any other measures with the aim of seizing investments
belonging to nationals and companies of the other Party, in their territory and in
maritime area, except in the public interest and provided that these measures are nei-
ther discriminatory, nor contrary to a particular agreement.

All measures of expropriation which could be taken must result in the payment of
prompt and adequate compensation. The sum of this compensation should be equal to
the actual value of the investments concerned, and must be assessed in relation to the
normal economic situation prevailing before any threat of expropriation was of public
knowledge.

The amount and method of payment for compensation should be specified on the
date of expropriation at the latest. This compensation is indeed realizable, payments
shall be made without delay and shall be freely transferable. The compensation will
accrue interest calculated at the appropriate market interest rate until the date of
payment."

"1. Each of the Contracting Parties will ensure fair and equitable treatment for
investments by nationals and companies of the other Party in its territory and in its
maritime area, in accordance with the rules and principles of international law, and
will ensure that the exercise of this right thus recognized shall have no impediments

12. Claimant has invoked the arbitration provisions in Article 8 of the France- Venezuela BIT
providing for arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Dis-
putes ("ICSID"). Article 8 of the Treaty provides:§

"1. Tout différend qui survient
entre un national ou une société
d'une Partie contractante et l'autre
Partie contractante, au sujet d'une
obligation de cette derniére rela-
tive a un investissement en vertu du

C1, pp. 332-353-332.354.
® The free English translation submitted by Claimant as Exhibit C-1 reads:

"1. Any dispute which arises between a national or a company of a Contracting
Party and the other Contracting Party, regarding an obligation of the latter relating
to an investment under the terms of the present Agreement, shall be settled amicably
between the two party concerned.

2. If such a dispute cannot be settled within six months from the time it was raised
by either of the parties to the dispute, at the request of the national or the company in
question it shall be submitted to either the competent court of the State in which the
investment was made or to arbitration by the International Center [sic] for the Settle-
ment of Investment Disputes (ICSID), pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, signed in Wash-
ington on March 18, 1965. This decision is the choice of the national or the company
concerned. Once the decision has been made to pursue arbitration, the decision be-
comes final.

  

3. The arbitral tribunal shall determine if the Contracting Party to the dispute has
met their obligations under the terms of the provisions of this agreement. If this is not
the case, the court [sic] will set the amount of compensation for the national or com-
pany party to the dispute.

4. The arbitral award is final and binding to the parties to the dispute."

On 29 May 2012, the Secretariat of ICSID (the "Secretariat") transmitted the Request to
Respondent.

On 15 June 2012, the Secretary-General registered Claimant’s Request in accordance
with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6 and 7 of the ICSID Institution Rules
and notified the Parties of such registration. The case was assigned the ICSID Case Num-

Puerto Ordaz, Bolivar State, Venezuela, designed to produce ceramic proppants — small
ceramic beads made from bauxite used as part of the hydraulic fracturing process to
"prop" open fissures within a well induced in reservoir rock formations, in order to speed

up and increase the recovery of hydrocarbons from each formation. '*

Claimant (through its affiliates) has been manufacturing ceramic proppants to support the
oil and gas industry for approximately 30 years.!> By the end of the 1990s, Saint-Gobain
had developed a strong market position in North America, particularly with respect to
high-grade ceramic proppants.'°

In its Memorial, Claimant described the recent evolution of the proppants business, inter
alia, as follows:

"[T]he market for proppants has developed and expanded significantly
in the last ten years and the major driver of this development and ex-
pansion has been technological advancement in the oil and gas indus-
try. Specifically, advances have allowed oil and gas producers to: (a)
drill deeper wells; (b) drill horizontally; and (c) use hydraulic fractur-
ing, or 'fracking,' to permit the extraction of hydrocarbons from uncon-
ventional sources such as shale rock formations. Fracking is a tech-
nique whereby fluids are injected at high pressure into a wellbore
drilled into non-permeable shale formations. The fluids create cracks
in the shale, which unlocks oil and gas trapped inside. The proppants
get inside the microfissures created by the high-pressure fluids injected
and hold them open, increasing production.

 

Thus, in an industry increasingly characterized by deeper, horizontal
wells and fracking, proppants allow for a more efficient extraction of
hydrocarbons.

Additionally, by stimulating a well, not only do proppants improve ex-
traction rates for oil and natural gas, but they also contribute to in-
creased well productivity and longevity.

There are four grades of proppants. In order of increasing strength,
they include: (a) sand; (b) resin-coated sand; (c) ceramic; and (d)
resin-coated ceramic. The choice of which proppant to use in a partic-
ular well derives largely from the closure stress of that well. Saint-Go-
bain makes ceramic proppants, which are suited for the deeper, higher-
closure-stress wells typical in shale formations in the United States.
Other types of proppants, particularly sand proppants, cannot with-
stand such conditions.""7

CLAIMANT'S DECISION TO EXPAND PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND SEARCH FOR AN EX-
PANSION SITE IN SOUTH AMERICA

In light of the growing proppants industry in North America, but also internationally, the
Saint-Gobain Group began in the early 2000s to research options for increasing its pro-
duction capacity.'* At that time, there were not sufficient proven bauxite reserves availa-
ble in the US either for an expansion of the Saint-Gobain proppants plant in Fort Smith,
Arkansas (the "Fort Smith Plant") or for a new North American facility. Therefore, in
2004, Saint-Gobain started to search for a site for the production of proppants in South
America, anticipating that 70 to 80% of the proppants to be produced there would be sold
in the North American market, while the remaining percentage would go to the South
American market."

The following were identified by Claimant as the main requirements for the production
of proppants:

"(a) steady supplies of bauxite [i.e., the primary raw material required

for the production or proppants], gas and electricity (at competitive

prices); (b) proximity to the U.S. market in order to access the largest

(current) market for proppants at reasonable transportation costs; (c)

access to a skilled workforce capable of dealing with the technical as-

pects of proppants production; and (d) the ability to build a plant and

produce ona short timeline to meet ever-increasing customer needs."”°

Of these requirements, access to bauxite and proximity to the target market were consid-
ered to be the key drivers of investment location.”!

Initially, Claimant considered four countries, i.e., Brazil, Guyana, Trinidad and Vene-
zuela, as potential locations for the new proppants plant. However, following several
business development explorations trips taken by employees of the Saint-Gobain Group,
the locations in Guyana, Trinidad and Brazil were rejected as either unfeasible in the near
future or not economically competitive.”

addition, electricity co:

have been required to import bauxite from Guyana, the steady supply of which could not be guaranteed, and land
at the preferred industrial location would not be available for several years. Finally, in Brazil, the domestic bauxite
was already being sold to aluminium producers and extractors and, in addition, Saint-Gobain would have had to
mine and transport bauxite itself. Memorial, {{{| 13-15; Exhibits C-063 and C-071.

Claimant considered Venezuela an interesting potential site for the construction of a prop-
pants plant given the ready availability of bauxite, electricity and natural gas,”* and, ac-
cording to Claimant, the prospect of entering into favorable contracts with State-owned
entities for the supply of those resources and logistical benefits such as the availability of
a well-established shipping route from the local port in Puerto Ordaz to Corpus Christi,
Texas — where the finished proppants would be shipped for distribution within the North
American market. In addition, Saint-Gobain had experience in Venezuela and in the
Puerto Ordaz region and was hoping for governmental support to complete the project on
time and on budget.”*

In 2004, representatives of the Saint-Gobain Group met with officials from the Ministry
of the People’s Power for Basic Industries and Mining ("MIBAM") as well as represent-
atives of the State-owned companies CVG Bauxilum, C.A. ("CVG Bauxilum"), respon-
sible for the supply of bauxite; CVG Electrificacién del Caroni, C.A. ("CVG
EDELCA”"), responsible for the supply of electricity; ard PDVSA Gas, S.A. ("PDVSA
Gas"), responsible for the supply of gas, to discuss a possible investment.”> The Parties
agree that, during these meetings, Venezuelan officials expressed general support for the
project; they are in dispute, however, as to whether Venezuelan officials further gave
specific assurances in the sense that, if Saint-Gobain agreed to invest in Venezuela, Ven-
ezuela would ensure that favorable long-term contracts could be signed for the delivery

of bauxite, gas and electricity to Saint-Gobain.”°

In September 2004, Jorgen Pedersen, Vice President and General Manager of Saint-Go-
bain NorPro, met with officials from State-owned Corporacién Venezolana de Guayana
("CVG") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CVG Bauxilum, to further investigate a po-
tential investment in Venezuela. According to Claimant, CVG further outlined on this
occasion the possibility to enter into favorable long-term contracts for the supply of baux-
ite to Claimant. The Parties are again in dispute as to what was discussed as regards the
possibility and terms of long-term contracts for the purchase of bauxite.”

On 3 February 2005, the team responsible for identifying the location for Claimant's new
investment submitted a Demande d’Autorisation Compagnie ("DAC") with respect to the
proposed greenfield investment in Venezuela with a capacity to produce 50,000 metric

tons of ceramic proppants per year to senior management at Compagnie de Saint-Go-
bain.”* The DAC, which served as an official request to the shareholders to receive ap-
proval for an investment, was approved on 7 February 2005.7?

Around the same time, Jorgen Pedersen and Guy Rolli, head of the Saint-Gobain Delega-

"30 started to meet with sen-

tion covering Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, "and others'
ior officials within the Venezuelan Government, in particular from MIBAM and the Min-
istry of Light Industry and Commerce ("MILCO"). According to Claimant, MIBAM —
the ministry which oversaw CVG's activity — was "the driving force within the Venezuelan
Government, not only to obtain approval for the project generally, but also specifically
to secure a long-term bauxite supply contract"; thus, it considered the meetings with
MIBAM to be of "critical importance and determinative with respect to [its] assessment
of the viability of its investment."*!

On 27 April 2005, Saint-Gobain representatives met with Valmore Vasquez, Vice-Min-
ister of Promotion of Investment for MIBAM, as well as representatives from PDVSA
Gas and CADAFE (Compajiia Anénima de Administracion y Fomento Eléctrico) to dis-
cuss the potential project.** According to Claimant, MIBAM acknowledged at the meet-
ing that the availability of a domestic proppants production and supply would be of value
for Venezuela.*?

According to Mr. Pedersen's recollection, on 6 May 2005, Carmen Velasquez, Investment
Promotion Coordinator of MIBAM, informally informed Claimant's representatives that
“Vice-Minister Raiza Molina would recommend to Minister Alvarez that Saint-Gobain’s
bauxite supply request be granted.”** At a meeting on 10 May 2005 attended, among
others, by MIBAM Vice-Minister Raiza Molina and CVG Bauxilum President Jestis
Imery, MIBAM once more noted its strategy for increasing exports of non-oil-based prod-
ucts and for developing future domestic production through the transfer of technology.*°
Claimant claims that Ms. Molina "confirmed the terms of the proposed long-term supply
contracts with CVG Bauxilum and PDVSA Gas for the supply of bauxite and gas, respec-

tively, for any future investment by Saint-Gobain."*°

According to Mr. Pedersen's notes of a meeting on 11 June 2005 with CVG Bauxilum
President Jestis Imery, Mr. Imery noted that he had received support for Saint-Gobain’s
proppants investment from President Chavez and MIBAM Minister Victor Alvarez.’
Subsequently, at a high-level meeting between representatives of the French and Vene-
zuelan Governments on 20 October 2005, Claimant's representative at the meeting rec-
orded in a memorandum that MIBAM Vice-Minister Vasquez confirmed that he had
tasked the president of CVG Bauxilum with finalizing the contract as soon as possible.**

On 25 October 2005, Claimant registered Saint-Gobain Proppants Venezuela, C.A., pre-
decessor in interest to Norpro Venezuela.*? Three months later, on 27 January 2006,
CVG Bauxilum, acting “under the auspices of [...] MIBAM and [...] CVG,” and Saint-
Gobain Proppants Venezuela C.A. signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Bauxite

Contract").*°

In the course of 2005, Claimant also negotiated with CVG EDELCA and PDVSA Gas
regarding long-term contracts for the supply of electricity and gas, respectively. Accord-
ing to Claimant, MIBAM agreed at a meeting on 2 March 2006 to ensure that CVG
EDELCA and PDVSA Gas would enter into long-term supply contracts with Norpro Ven-
ezuela in support of Saint-Gobain’s proppants project.*!

On 22 August 2006, MIBAM requested that CVG appoint (on behalf of the Ministry) an
interlocutor based in Puerto Ordaz as the day-to-day contact for Saint-Gobain.*? Accord-
ingly, on 29 August 2006, Saint-Gobain was notified that Manuel Henriquez had been
appointed as the interlocutor to assist Saint-Gobain with, among other things, obtaining
the necessary permits to effect its investment in Venezuela.**

After additional meetings with representatives from the two State-owned companies, on
16 August 2006, Norpro Venezuela entered into a long-term supply contract for electric-
ity with CVG EDELCA and, on 10 October 2006, into a long-term supply contract for
electricity with PDVSA Gas.“*

CLAIMANT'S DECISION TO INVEST IN VENEZUELA

On 7 February 2006, the team responsible for the investment in Venezuela submitted an
addendum to the DAC on the expanded capacity for the greenfield proppants plant in
Venezuela, providing for an increased capacity of 70,000 metric tons per year.*> This
DAC was approved on 20 February 2006;*° an update of the DAC, projecting higher costs
than anticipated in the addendum, was submitted on 23 October 2006 and approved on 9
November 2006.*7

Upon receipt of the required internal approvals, Saint-Gobain proceeded to finalize the
acquisition of land in Puerto Ordaz on which it intended to build its proppants plant.**
Claimant claims that it had chosen Puerto Ordaz for the following reasons:

"[I]t boasted good transportation options; and it was a terminus for the

necessary supplies of gas and electricity; it offered a population of

skilled workers. Of particular importance, Saint-Gobain’s supplier of

bauxite, CVG Bauxilum, was located in Puerto Ordaz. EDELCA—the

electricity supplier—was also headquartered there."*”

Following the purchase of land in Puerto Ordaz, Saint-Gobain employees with experience
in Venezuela helped determine staffing needs and costs of the new investment.” Jack
Larry, General Manager of Saint-Gobain Proppants (responsible for managing the prop-
pants business worldwide), was involved in developing the business case as well as in
considering the technical issues of how to develop a plant in Venezuela.*!

Also in 2006, Saint-Gobain appointed Dominique Objois, the former General Manager
of a Saint-Gobain plant in Korea, to spearhead the construction effort with his team. Mr.
Objois was supported on site by a number of experienced employees seconded from the
Fort Smith Plant.*

Claimant then started focusing on the technical requirements for the proppants, in partic-
ular on the characteristics of the bauxite, i.e., of the primary raw material that was going
to be supplied by CVG Bauxilum.**

To that end, on 28 February 2006 and again a year later, at the end of March 2007, repre-
sentatives of Saint-Gobain visited the CVG Bauxilum facility at Puerto Ordaz in order to

develop the technical requirements for the bauxite to be provided under the Bauxite Con-
tract and to learn more about CVG Bauxilum’s business and production.** While noting
that CVG Bauxilum was "at present not receptive to providing customer specific Alu-
mina/iron levels," Claimant’s representatives assessed that CVG Bauxilum’s operation

was “very well run.”

In early April 2007, Saint-Gobain made an additional presentation to CVG Bauxilum and
met with its President "to discuss about possibilities to supply other grades of Bauxite
and potential developments for the future."*® Shortly thereafter, in May 2007, Saint-Go-
bain submitted its request for bauxite supplies under the Bauxite Contract to CVG Baux-
ilum.>* In June 2007, Norpro Venezuela reported internally that CVG Bauxilum had con-

firmed that it would "supply up to 30% high Alumina content Bauxite," which assured
Claimant that CVG Bauxilum would provide the type of bauxite required to produce ce-

ramic proppants in Venezuela.**

VAT CREDITS

Venezuelan law requires Venezuelan companies to pay VAT for goods and services they
acquire and to collect VAT from Venezuelan, but not from foreign, purchasers of their
goods and services, thus exempting exporters of goods manufactured in Venezuela from
collecting VAT. When a company makes VAT payments on its purchases of goods and
services, it accumulates VAT credits, and when it collects VAT from the buyer, it accu-
mulates VAT debits, which are offset against the credits on a monthly basis. If the com-
pany has paid more VAT than it has collected, it carries the net balance forward to the
next month.”

Norpro Venezuela was to a large extent an exporter of goods manufactured in Venezuela
and thus did not collect VAT from its foreign customers, but it nonetheless incurred VAT
on most of its purchases because most of the equipment for the plant acquired during the
construction phase as well as the raw materials (such as bauxite) used in the production
of proppants and the labor services of the outsourcing companies were acquired in Ven-
ezuela and thus subject to VAT. As a result of this imbalance between its VAT payments
and its VAT collections, as of 31 December 2009, Norpro Venezuela had accumulated
VAT credits of VEF 11.7 million on its balance sheet.

While imported goods, such as equipment for a manufacturing facility, are generally sub-
ject to VAT, on 19 October 2006, Respondent issued Decree 4,908, which established a
procedure that could result in the exoneration from import taxes and VAT on certain im-
ported equipment.°! If a company wanted to obtain such an exoneration, it had to apply
for an exoneration certificate from the Ministry of Light Industry and Commerce
(MILCO).

In late March 2005, Jorgen Pedersen met with William Cafias, Director General of Capital
Goods of MILCO, to discuss the proposed proppants plant and, more specifically, the
exoneration from VAT and import tax to make the project economically sustainable.
By e-mail of 1 June 2006, Mr. Pedersen informed Mr. Patrick Millot, Vice President of
Corporate Planning, Strategy and Finance for Saint-Gobain's High Performance Materi-
als, that at a meeting on 26 May 2006, MIBAM had agreed to support Saint-Gobain’s
efforts to obtain import duty and import tax exemptions.

In its 23 October 2006 DAC update, Claimant reported internally that President Chavez
had just announced during a press conference the enactment of a Presidential Decree
whereby a broad exoneration covering both VAT and import duties, applicable to im-
ported capital goods not currently produced in Venezuela, such as equipment, machinery
and spare parts, would be granted to promote the development of the industrial sector. In
the same document, Claimant noted that “the Ministry of Basic Industries and Mining
(MIBAM) has supported us to get an exemption.”® In an e-mail to Mr. Rolli and Mr.
Millot dated 2 November 2006, Mr. Pedersen wrote that "the new exoneration decree will
probably make it more likely we get exoneration and simplify the process."©

Claimant applied for, and was granted on 25 October 2007, an Exemption for Capital
Goods, covering VAT and import duties for machinery and other materials, in total 29
specific types of equipment, which Claimant required for the installation and operation
of the plant;°” thus, when that equipment was imported, no import tax or VAT was col-
lected. For the rest of its purchases, Claimant had to pay regular import taxes and VAT,
thus leading to the net credit balance of VEF 11.7 million.

VAT credits do not create in themselves a payment liability of the State, but there is a
process set out in the Venezuelan VAT law by which exporters of goods can obtain a

financial benefit by filing a request on a monthly basis for the recovery of the VAT credits
based on the amount of export sales during the month. If the tax authorities grant the
request, a special tax recovery certificate is issued, which may be used by the taxpayer to
pay its Venezuelan taxes or it may be sold to a third party, who likewise can use the

certificate to pay its taxes.

As of 15 May 2010, Norpro Venezuela had, according to the recollection of Mr. Rondén:

"notified the authorities of its intention to start the process to recover
VAT credits by applying for a special tax recovery certificate based
upon export sales, in accordance with the relevant legislation, [but] was
still in the process of compiling the relevant documentation necessary
to support its application."”°

CONSTRUCTION OF THE PLANT

In 2007, Claimant began to construct the proppants plant in Puerto Ordaz, with the ma-
jority of the necessary equipment arriving on site in September 2007.’! In order to allow
future increases of production capacity, construction was designed to be phased, with one
production line to be built at first, and the addition of a second production line to be
revisited in the future, "once the facilities were working properly and delivering a profit-
able return."”? Claimant anticipated that the planned second production line would es-
sentially be "copied and pasted" from the first production line and would therefore take
less time to go from initiation to full ramp-up, doubling the plant's capacity.”

The first production line was designed to begin with two mixers, with a total capacity of
approximately 4,500 tons per month, but including designated space for a third mixer,
which would raise total capacity to approximately 6,000 tons per month.” After the con-
struction of the first production line with two mixers was completed, production of prop-
pants began in September 2008. Despite beginning plans in early 2010, the third mixer,
scheduled to come online in the beginning of 2013, was never installed.”°

BAUXITE PRICE INCREASES

First Price Increase in September 2008

On 15 July 2008, then President of CVG Bauxilum, Mr. Carlos Acosta Pérez, invited
representatives of Claimant and Norpro Venezuela to a meeting for an "[o]pen analysis
of the contractual relation, in regards of the bauxite price.""° It is in dispute between the
Parties whether the meeting, which took place on 29 July 2008, was held to "discuss the

77

situation"’’ or simply to inform Claimant about the upcoming price increase as a fait

accompli.”

In an e-mail to Mr. Pedersen dated 30 July 2008, the General Manager of Norpro Vene-
zuela, Mr. Oscar Cid, reported that CVG Bauxilum had presented the following reasons
for an increase of the bauxite price: (i) increase in the Orinoco River Toll by 600%; (ii)
adjustment of the extraction and production cost to a break even point; (iii) increase in
the freight costs from Jobal Mine to the ACBL port due to an increase of the labor contract
with the unionized ACBL workers; and (iv) an international market analysis comparing
bauxite prices of various suppliers, according to which the price agreed under the Bauxite
Contract was lower than the international market.” Mr. Cid further noted in his e-mail
that, "to [his] understanding, the [bauxite price] increase is a fact and in a very short
time, maybe I month," and that CVG Bauxilum "offer[ed] the right for a written reply,
maximum by the end of this week, with any allegations, complaints and any other com-

ment related to the impact of the increase in [Norpro Venezuela]."*°

On 31 July 2008, Decree No. 6,220 with Rank, Value and Force of Law of Canalization
and Maintenance of Navigation Routes was published in the Official Gazette, legally en-

acting the anticipated price increase for the Orinoco River Toll by 600%.*!

By letter of 1 August 2008, the President of Norpro Venezuela, Luis Paez, wrote to Mr.
Pérez:

Proppants Project and, consequently, for the plans of substitution of
imports of Petréleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the policies of pro-
motion of investment of MPPIBAM and the cooperation agreement be-
tween Venezuela and France."**

177. In the same letter, Mr. Paez also requested a meeting with CVG Bauxilum to discuss the
potential effects of the price increase on Claimant's investment.** According to Claimant,
CVG Bauxilum informed Norpro Venezuela at the meeting, which took place on 21 Au-
gust 2008, that the bauxite price would be increased from USD 25.50 to USD 33.80 per
metric ton, effective immediately.**

178. In a letter to Mr. Cid under the combined letterhead of MIBAM, CVG and CVG Bauxi-
lum, dated 2 September 2008, Mr. Pérez undisputedly confirmed that USD 33.80 per
metric ton would be the new price for the rest of the year 2008; he invoked the price
revision clause in Clause 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract, based on the new tariffs for navi-
gation on the Orinoco River and "the significant variation experienced by extraction,
transportation, and unloading costs of the bauxite at our Matanzas plant."*®° Mr. Pérez
concluded by noting that the new price remained favorable because it "correspond{ed] to
the selling free on board price for the year 2007, and, on the other hand, to a gradual
adjustment [of the price beyond that] applicable to the present fiscal period."*®

179. In his letter dated 4 September 2008, addressed to the Vice Minister of MIBAM, Ms.
Isabel Cristina Delgado, Norpro Venezuela's President Mr. Paez stated that Norpro Ven-
ezuela and MIBAM had "agreed that the different contracts for the supply required for
the Project, including the [Bauxite] Contract, would be structured as long-term agree-
ments." Mr. Paez stated that Norpro Venezuela wished to discuss the negative impact of
the price increase on the plant and, as a consequence, on PDVSA's plan to substitute im-
ported by locally produced products, MIBAM's investment policies and the France-Ven-
ezuela BIT.*”

181. Claimant claims that it received no response to its request that the new price be maintained
at least until 31 December 2009;°! Respondent merely submits that the price indeed re-
mained fixed at USD 33.80 per metric ton through 2009.”

Bauxilum.** According to Claimant, they protested against the price increase as being
ultra vires, but — in the interest of maintaining stable commercial conditions — requested
that the new price be maintained through, at least, 31 December 2009.* In his letter to
CVG Bauxilum dated 17 September 2008, Mr. Cid wrote:

"Even though [Norpro Venezuela] does not share Bauxilum's opinion
expressed in the Official Writ with regards to the interpretation and
application of item 10.2 of Clause Ten of the Contract in order to justify
the Price Increase referred to in the Official Writ, [Norpro Venezuela]
reaffirms its willingness to discuss with Bauxilum alternatives to guar-
antee, in the long term, the effective performance of the obligations of
both parties under the Contract.

Taking into account that the main interest of [Norpro Venezuela] is to
maintain clear and stable conditions regulating the long-term supply of
bauxite under the Contract, in accordance with what was discussed
with Mr. Carlos Acosta Pérez and his advisors during our meeting [on
9 September 2008], [Norpro Venezuela] formally requests Bauxilum to
consider the possibility of guaranteeing that the [...] US$ 33.80 per ton
of bauxite set forth in the Letter be maintained without any change until
December 31, 2009.

L..]

In any event, while the relevant discussions regarding the revision of
this request take place, [Norpro Venezuela] wishes to clarify that the
issuance of any purchase order of bauxite under the Contract, the pay-
ment of any amount owed by [Norpro Venezuela] to Bauxilum for such
purposes, or the il of any correspond or ¢ ication
to Bauxilum, as of the Official Writ's date, shall not be deemed as an
express or tacit acceptance of the Price Increase mentioned in the Of-
ficial Writ by [Norpro Venezuela], or of any fact, assertion, declaration,
circumstance or argument exposed by Bauxilum in the Official Writ."°°

In order to receive the required bauxite shipments for the remainder of 2008 and the whole
of 2009, Norpro Venezuela had to submit its purchase order to CVG Bauxilum by 17

October 2008.”* Norpro Venezuela did so and scheduled the deliveries at the increased
price in order to secure a continuing supply of bauxite for its plant; however, according
to Mr. Pedersen, it reserved its rights.* In a PowerPoint presentation on 11 October 2008,
Claimant also informed MIBAM about the price increase of 2 September 2008, claiming

it to be "unjustified."

183. In an e-mail dated 21 November 2008, Mr. Pedersen informed Mr. Rolli and Mr. Larry
that he had met with the new President of CVG Bauxilum, Mr. Jestis Calvo, the day before
and, in particular, discussed the price increase. Mr. Pedersen wrote:

"Explained to him the current issue we have with pricing proposals out
of the contract coming from the prior president and how that was im-
pacting our business.

Asked him to reconsider his proposal and return to the contractual ob-
ligation that we have together.

They started up with explaining the increase of the river toll which they
have had and how their costs have gone up. I then explained that natu-
rally we will pay the increase in transportation costs which is according
to the contract that we are not looking at no increase but an increase
according to the inflation clause in the contract. He understood the po-
sition and his reaction was that we should make a proposal in writing
to him and that he would consider it."*°

184. On8 June 2009, in an update to the DAC of 23 October 2006, Norpro Venezuela reported:

"The cost of bauxite from our primary supplier Bauxilum was raised in
mid 2008 by 34%. This increase was done outside of the terms and con-
ditions of our existing contract. Bauxilum cited increases in barge
transportation costs (River Toll) combined with the increased mining
cost account form [sic] most if [sic] the price increases. A meeting was
held on January 15, 2009 with the president of Bauxilum to seek a re-
duction of the increase that was imposed. In spite of continuous at-
tempts to further discuss to date we are still awaiting their reply."*"

185. Norpro Venezuela never invoked the dispute resolution mechanism provided in Article
16 of the Bauxite Contract, i.e., arbitration before the Center for Conciliation and Arbi-
tration of the Chamber of Commerce of Caracas in relation to the bauxite price increase.”*

Second Price Increase in March 2010

Ata meeting held on 10 March 2010, CVG Bauxilum informed Norpro Venezuela that it
sought to increase the price for bauxite supplied in 2010 to USD 51.28 per metric ton.”
By letter to Mr. Cid, dated 12 April 2010 and under the letterhead of MIBAM, CVG and
CVG Bauxilum, Mr. Calvo confirmed the price increase, again invoking Clause 10 of the
Bauxite Contract. '°° Claimant claims that it protested against this price increase, both at
the meeting on 10 March 2010 and in subsequent communications with CVG Bauxi-
lum.!°! A further meeting between Claimant and CVG Bauxilum scheduled for 18 March
2010 was cancelled due to a visit of President Chavez to the area.!°? The parties to the
Bauxite Contract never met to discuss this proposed price increase further and Norpro
Venezuela never paid this price for any bauxite purchased from CVG Bauxilum.!

PRODUCTION AND SALE OF PROPPANTS PRIOR TO THE TAKE-OVER OF THE PLANT

Once construction had been completed and the necessary permits had been obtained, the
proppants plant entered the production ramp-up phase. On 26 September 2008, the plant
produced its first saleable proppants, and on 13 December 2008, the first shipment of
1,500 tons of Venezuelan-produced proppants arrived in the US.!%*

During the early part of 2009, Claimant focused on securing a long-term customer base
for its Venezuelan proppants production. In the North American market, even though the
oil and gas field operators are involved in selecting the type, quantity, etc. of the prop-
pants, the oil service companies are the ones who buy the proppants from the supplier and
then pump them into the drilled well.!°° Claimant thus intended to secure a long-term
supply contract with its biggest client — Halliburton, a large oil services provider — as well
as to diversify its customer base in North and South America. !°°

On | April 2009, Norpro Venezuela, along with two other Saint-Gobain proppants facil-
ities, entered into a Master Purchase Agreement with Halliburton (the "Halliburton
MPA").'°’ Pursuant to this agreement, Halliburton agreed to a "take or pay" arrangement,

starting with 40 million pounds of proppants for the second quarter of 2009 rising steadily
to a peak of 100 million for every quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012.!°

190. The proppants that Norpro Venezuela produced at Puerto Ordaz were stored at the plant
or in an external warehouse near the Venezuelan port. Apart from the proppants that were
sold on the South American market (generally 60 to 100 tons per month), the proppants
were shipped from Venezuela to Corpus Christi, Texas. Once the Halliburton MPA was
in place, the vast majority of the shipped proppants was sold to Halliburton under this

contract.!”

191. Prior to the start of production, Claimant brought a group of manufacturing employees
from Venezuela to its Fort Smith, Arkansas proppants plant and trained them in the plant's
processes. Norpro Venezuela's managers were sent to Fort Smith for supplemental train-
ing and also received training on site in Puerto Ordaz.''° In addition, Claimant sent oper-
ators, maintenance and quality control personnel from Fort Smith to Puerto Ordaz to assist
during the ramp-up phase, which according to Claimant, continued until August 2009!!!

192. Norpro Venezuela operated using the "overall equipment effectiveness" (OEE) produc-
tion method. This method computes the effectiveness of the plant vis-a-vis its overall
capacity. According to Claimant, a plant operating at 85% OEE is considered world-class,
and its proppants plants routinely operate at approximately 80 to 87%.!!2

193. As regards the Venezuelan plant during the ramp-up phase, Mr. Larry stated in his first
witness statement:

"[A]djustments are always necessary during the ramp-up phase, and
there is always a learning process for employees and management at a
new plant. As expected, therefore, the quality and quantity of the prop-
pants produced at Norpro Venezuela improved throughout ramp-up as
the plant perfected production processes relating to time and termper-
ature. Specifically, by July 2009, the plant was running quite efficiently
on a continuous basis — based on my recollection of OEE numbers, it is
clear that production had improved. And by September 2009 [...], all
of the technical issues normally associated with the start-up of a new
plant had been addressed. Likewise, Norpro Venezuela had developed

108 Article 6, Table 1 of the Halliburton MPA provides that Halliburton had to take those quantities "or 45% of
Buyer's total purchases of ceramic proppants from all its suppliers, whichever is less." Exhibit C-106. According
to Claimant, Halliburton thus had the option to buy 45% of its total purchases of ceramic proppants from all of its
suppliers upon giving adequate notice pursuant to Article 6(b) of the Halliburton MPA. Memorial, { 59, note 126.

the skills of a critical mass of workers in order to be able to effectively
run the plant."!3

In the 8 June 2009 update to the DAC, it was noted that "[t]he project has encountered
delay both in the initial start up of the project and during commissioning and start-up
phase in achieving planned production levels."!'4

In November 2009, the plant was temporarily shut down, the reason for which is disputed
between the Parties.'!> As a proppants plant is required to run continuously for six months

in order to reach a "steady state," i.e., 85% OEE or in the case of the Venezuelan plant a
production of approximately 53,000 tons per year, the plant never reached its full produc-
tion capacity with two mixers. By May 2010, the plant was producing approximately
3,400 tons of proppants per month, which would have resulted in an annual production

of approximately 42,000 tons.!!°

In a presentation on the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan, dated 18 March 2010, Claimant laid
out a "Venezuela Action Plan," noting that a "Specialist 'SURGE' [was] underway to ad-
dress critical VZ issues": (i) “Process Stability"; (ii) "Additives"; (iii) "Maintenance pm
focus"; and (iv) "Operator training" and that the "Key focus of team" was to "Audit all
processes to insure consistency and adherence to control systems" and "Stabilize, stabi-
lize, stabilize."""7

In a further presentation on the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan, dated 4 May 2010, Claimant
noted that "Venezuela plant output has declined since mid-March. Problems linked to
several key issues": (i) "Elimination of refire addition to maintain production levels"; (ii)
"Significant degradation of systems and controls within plant," caused, inter alia, by "La-
bor issues leading to low worker cooperation and productivity"; (iii) "Batch stability im-
pacted by critical changes"; and (iv) "High level of electrical failures during April due to
maintenance by EDELCA in Puerto Ordaz."!'*

LABOR UNREST

As of the operational start-up of the plant, the majority of the workers at the plant was not
directly employed by Norpro Venezuela (or any other of Claimant's subsidiaries), but
rather by outsourcing companies. Already in the 3 February 2005 DAC, Claimant pro-

posed the establishment of a new subsidiary in Venezuela rather than using SGMC Ven-
ezuela (one of Claimant's existing Venezuelan subsidiaries), naming as one of the reasons
"to avoid the creation of a labor union."'' The DAC stated:

"In Venezuela, employees of a company have right to establish a labor
union if the total number of employees of the company is more than 25.
With a Proppants projects, the number of employees of SGMC Vene-
zuela would be more than 25 and a labor union would become inevita-
ble. With a new company, we would keep the number of permanent em-
ployees limited to 24, using third parties to supply temporary labor for
the balance of our employment, a practice typically used in Venezuela.
We therefore propose to establish a new company."'”°

199. The labor outsourcing model referred to in the DAC was indeed being used in Venezuela

at that time and was known as "tercerizaci6n." |?!

200. When Norpro Venezuela's operations and maintenance workforce returned from training
at Fort Smith, Arkansas in 2008, they were informed that they would have to resign their
positions with Norpro Venezuela and they would then be re-hired by RH Consultores, a
third-party labor outsourcing company. '?? Regarding the terms of the new contracts, Re-
spondent's witness Mr. Eduardo Rondon stated in his witness statement:

"One of the most significant changes was with respect to job security.
RH Consultores was offering contracts of only six months' duration.
These contracts could be renewed for a further six months, and then for
a third period of six months. After this, there was a prospect of being
hired as an employee under a contract of unlimited duration. Thus, it
was as if the workers had a series of trial periods during which they
were to be employed by the outsourcing company without the same job
security and benefits. Although the basic salary was the same, there
were some important differences in terms of benefits. I recall that the
workers employed through RH Consultores only received an annual bo-
nus of 15 days' salary (the minimum required by law). They received no
performance-based bonus. They had their salary increased when re-
quired by law but there were no performance-based increases, and I
remember hearing complaints that these increases were not even suffi-

119 The second reason was that SGMC Venezuela owned 100% of Carburo Del Caroni, a newly acquired company,
whose former owner still had significant liabilities to some third parties, including employees, and it was consid-
ered that there was some risk that some of the former owner's creditors might sue Carburo del Caroni "potentially
implicating its mother company SGMC Venezuela" in case of failure of the former owner to pay the liabilities.

cient to keep up with inflation. Although the approximately 30-40 work-
ers to whom this new policy was applied were unhappy about it, they
accepted the new arrangement because it was made clear to them by
Oswaldo Luna [head of HR] that this was the only way that they would
keep their jobs."'*

201. In the course of 2008, Norpro Venezuela recruited further workers that were employed
through RH Consultores; according to Mr. Rond6n's recollection, by the end of 2008,
there were close to 70 workers who had contracts with this outsourcing company. !74

202. Mr. Rondon further stated in his witness statement:

"Early in 2009, rumblings began among the Plant workers about the
possibility of trying to get organized to form a union. The main com-
plaint expressed by the workers was the outsourcing contracts, and the
consequent lack of job security. [...] The proponents of the union were
employees that were very active among the operations and maintenance
personnel at the Plant."'25

 

203. Before the labor union had been formed, some of the workers who, according to Mr.
Rondén, "[p]/ant management identified as being the main union agitators," !”6 had their
contracts terminated. Norpro Venezuela also terminated its relationship with RH Consul-
tores and, on 16 June 2009, entered into an agreement with Outstaffing Corporation, a
different outsourcing company in Venezuela.!?’ As a consequence, the workers were told
that their contracts with RH Consultores would be liquidated, meaning that the remaining
time under their six-month contract would be paid out, and that they would have to sign
new contracts with Outstaffing Corporation. '”8

204. The change of outsourcing companies led to growing discontent among the workers at
the plant. Mr. Rond6n described the situation in his witness statement as follows:

"The Plant workers saw this move [i.e., that they had to sign new con-
tracts with Outstaffing Corporation] as evidence that their contracts
could be manipulated and even terminated at any time, with no justifi-
cation whatsoever. [...] some of the workers were on their third 6-
month contract with RH Consultores and, with this move, their hopes
that their next contract would be direct and of unlimited duration van-
ished because Outstaffing Corporation was offering only 6 month con-
tracts again. The workers began to realize that the prospect of a direct
contract of unlimited duration with Norpro Venezuela was not realistic.

Although eventually all of the Plant workers signed the new contracts
with Outstaffing Corporation, this move led more workers to be sympa-
thetic to the idea of forming a union."'°

205. A few months later, union organizers managed to obtain the required signatures to form
a labor union and created the Sindicato Profesional de Trabajadores de Abrasivos y
Cerdmicos, Conexos y Similares ("SINPROTRAC").!°°

206. On 15 September 2009, Norpro Venezuela terminated the contract of Mr. Luna, head of
HR, who had been employed directly by Norpro Venezuela.'*! By letter of 10 October
2009, Norpro Venezuela also terminated the contract with Outstaffing Corporation, ef-
fective 13 November 2009, resulting in the termination of the contracts of approximately
70 workers at the plant.'*? In the termination letter, Norpro Venezuela confirmed that it
“assume[d] the costs derived from the termination of the Agreement that may be billed by
OUTSTAFFING CORPORATION, C.A after November 13, 2009."!33

207. According to Respondent, the "mass dismissal of workers" was the true reason for the

shutdown of the plant in November 2009 that lasted well into January 2010, not the "se-
ries of mechanical improvements" that Mr. Larry referred to in his witness statement; '**
Respondent acknowledges, however, that "Norpro Venezuela did make use of the Novem-

ber 2009 Plant shutdown to carry out certain repairs and improvements." >

208. Following the termination of its contract with Outstaffing Corporation, Norpro Venezuela
entered into contracts with three new outsourcing companies: Gestion Industrial Bolivar,
C.A., Gerencia de Personal Guayana, C.A. and Guayana Internacional Cargo, C.A.

Through these companies, half of the plant workers were re-hired. According to Mr. Ron-
d6n, the other half joined with the SINPROTRAC union leaders, "and began staging daily
protests in front of the Norpro Venezuela Plant."'*°

The tension between Norpro Venezuela's management and the SINPROTRAC labor un-
ion was not an isolated case in the area, but rather the Ciudad Guayana industrial sector
in general was experiencing labor unrest at that time. Workers employed in the iron, steel
and aluminum industries were publicly demanding an end to unfair labor practices, one
of their main complaints being the outsourcing labor arrangements. In addition, there was
a nationwide political initiative to retain control of Venezuela's natural resources and re-
lated downstream manufacturing and refining processes in order to ensure that Venezuela
would gain from the potential economic and social benefits of those sectors. As a conse-
quence, in mid-2009, working groups were formed who developed and executed the Plan
Guayana Socialista, aimed at involving the workers in the management and administra-

tion of basic industries and, inter alia, improving the working conditions. '°”

In Claimant's 18 March 2010 presentation on the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan, one of the
issues was the "Heavy focus on safety of away team [referring to the SURGE team that
was to address operational issues]": (i) "All team members at Mara Inn"; (ii) "Restrictions
on activities outside hotel"; (iii) "Travel to/from plant controlled"; and (iv) "Guidelines

issued for worker conflicts." '8

TEMPORARY TAKEOVER OF THE PLANT ON 24 MARCH 2010

On 24 March 2010, approximately 40 individuals, a group of former workers from an
outsourcing company Norpro Venezuela had used, assembled outside the plant, then
gained access to it and occupied the operation area of the plant for approximately four
hours. '°? Among those individuals were, inter alia, Mr. Angel Marcano, a member of the
Venezuelan National Assembly, and Mr. Asdribal Lopez, a member of the Bolivar State

group is disputed between the Parties. '*!

Also present were Mr. Vicent Acosta Williams Jose, General Secretary of SINPRO-
TRAC, and other leading members of the labor union. In the Request for Judicial Inspec-
tion filed by Norpro Venezuela on the same date, Mr. Jose is also listed as the first of five
people who were identified to be in control of the takeover; Mr. Marcano and Mr. Lopez

One of the pictures taken by the judicial inspector
shows a banner which states: "The community of workers (la masa obrera) united in sup-
port of our comrades who were fired for a non-justified cause. Norpro, we demand that

they are re-hired immediately."

When the leader of the union took a megaphone and called out to the workers inside the
plant to stop their work, Norpro Venezuela's management shut down the plant's major
equipment and put the kiln into idle mode. They regained control of the plant the next
day, but the Parties are in dispute as to the time it took to get the production the plant up
and running again.'*+ According to Claimant, the group also damaged the main gate of
the plant, destroyed its lock and blocked the entrance; they further prevented employees
from carrying out normal plant activities and forcefully removed Norpro Venezuela em-
ployees from the plant production areas.'*° The National Guard that Norpro Venezuela
had engaged to provide security for the plant did not intervene. !4°

In response to the takeover, Norpro Venezuela requested a judicial inspection, during
which the judge documented the names of the individuals participating in the takeover,
identified the leaders of the takeover, and detailed the damages inflicted. 147 After the con-
frontation with the judge, the group left the plant, but several members remained outside
and continued to partially block the entrance. !#8

In its 4 May 2010 presentation on the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan, Claimant noted that
"Black Union outsource contract expires May 21": (i) "Expect unstable work situation
for 2" half of May", and (ii) "Operator and maintenance experience will again be an
issue." With regard to the "Key Issue" "Work Force (Unstable => high turnover => in-
fluenced by external forces," the Plan set out the following actions: (i) "Unionize the site
- Create 2 unions: One for SG employees, another for outsourced labor => use the unions
to reduce external pressure and promote some stability"; (ii) "Keep the strategy of out-
sourcing from more than one source"; (iii) "Lengthen the labor contract from 6 months
to 1-3 years"; (iv) "Study the introduction of an affordable benefit plan to reduce turnover
and labor tension"; and (v) "Promote stability through improved communication with

workforce."

FINAL TAKEOVER OF THE PLANT ON 15 MAy 2010

On 15 May 2010, the findings of the Plan Guayana Socialista working groups were pre-
sented to President Chavez during a public ceremony, which was also broadcast live on
television and radio. During the presentation, President Chavez read and approved certain
proposals made by the working groups, infer alia, with regard to Norpro Venezuela. The
official transcript of the radio broadcast reads in relevant part:

"Discuss with PDVSA the purchase of the Proppants produced and

commercialized by the company Norpro Venezuela, a product produced

with bauxite, Cornstarch and water, used for mud and drilling. It is

suggested here [in the document] that should it become necessary, this

company should become state-controlled and transferred to the hands

of PDVSA. Let the company Norpro Venezuela become state controlled

and transfer it to the hands of Petréleos de Venezuela."'°

On the same day, a local group arrived at the Plant, coming directly from the event at
which President Chavez had spoken.'*! The group again included Messrs. Marcano and
Lopez, 152 ag well as members of the SINPROTRAC union.'* Oscar Cid, Pierre Gramond
and Eric Dixon of Norpro Venezuela also arrived on site, removed some personal items
as well as their laptops and documents and, even though the group tried to stop them,
eventually left the plant.'** Approximately 4,000 tons of finished proppants that were
stored on site remained inside the plant; a shipment scheduled for 17 May 2010 had to be
cancelled. !°°

Norpro Venezuela again requested a judicial inspection to document the events, which
took place on 17 May 2010. The local judiciary noted that (i) when Norpro Venezuela's
employees arrived for work on Monday, 17 May 2010, they were denied access to the
plant; (ii) the judicial inspector and Norpro Venezuela officials were refused access to the
plant by Messrs. Marcano and Lépez, who stated that they were acting for the Plan
Guayana Socialista, under instructions given by President Chavez; (iii) a SINPROTRAC
banner hung from the main entrance of the plant; and (iv) the group orchestrating the

"Consultar con PDVSA sobre la compra de Propan|ts] producido y comercializado por empresa Norpro de Ve-
nezuela, producto elaborado con Bauxita, Almidén y agua utilizado para lodos y perforaciones. De ser necesario
— aqui se sugiere — la estatizacién y transferir esta empresa a manos de PDVSA. Estaticese la empresa Norpro de
Venezuela y pasese a manos de Petroleos de Venezuela." Exhibit R-15.

takeover refused to accept a memorandum from Norpro Venezuela requesting, inter alia,
the appointment of a representative with whom to negotiate. !°°

On 18 May 2010, the Oficina de Comunicacion y Relaciones Institucionales published a
summary of national and international press stories, including a story from El Nacional
reporting that:

"Contracted workers of the Norpro Venezuela company took over the

factory after the nationalization announcement of President Hugo Chd-

vez. With the National Guard and a commission presided over by the

National Assembly Representative Angel Marcano, the workers pre-

vented the legal representative of the enterprise from entering the facil-

ities." 157
By letters of 19 and 27 May 2010, Mr. Paez informed Mr. Rafael Ramirez, President of
PDVSA and Minister of Hydrocarbons (Ministry of Oil and Mining), and Mr. José Khan,
President of CVG and Minister of MIBAM, that Claimant's investment had been taken
on 15 May 2010 and offered technical assistance to ensure the proper use of the equipment
and the safety of the workers on site. He further requested that an official interlocutor be

appointed with whom Claimant could discuss the expropriation. '**

On 24 and 27 May 2010, officials from PDVSA, PDVSA Exploration and Production
East and PDVSA Industrial visited the plant.'*? According to a press report in the Prensa
Unete, these officials acted under direct instructions of Minister Ramirez. '

In May and June 2010, the following reports and presentations were prepared by PDVSA:

PRO VENEZUELA C.A.," dated May 2010 (preliminary report prepared by PDVSA

On 2 and 8 June 2010, meetings took place between Norpro Venezuela, PDVSA and
others. The meeting minutes are entitled: "PROCESO DE NACIONALIZACION
NORPRO VENEZUELA, C.A."'°

On 8 June 2010, Mr. Guy Rolli wrote to Mr. Temir Porras, Vice-Minister for Foreign
Relations for Europe, referring to press reports according to which PDVSA was involved
in the expropriation, and equipment of the plant had been damaged during the events on
and after 15 May 2010. He further reiterated Claimant's request that an official interloc-

utor be appointed and Claimant's offer to provide technical assistance. !°

By letter of 6 July 2010, addressed to Minister Ramirez, Mr. Paez reiterated Claimant's
offer of technical assistance to ensure the proper use of the equipment and the safety of
the workers on site.'°7

By letter of 3 August 2010, Mr. Patrick Dupin, Claimant's President, addressed Mr. Eu-
logio del Pino, Vice-President of Exploration and Production of PDVSA, reiterating
Claimant's concern about damage that might occur to workers at the plant and assets of
Norpro Venezuela. Mr. Dupin referred to press reports pursuant to which the plant's kiln
was out of order and PDVSA was planning to initiate repairs shortly. He further reiterated
Claimant's requests that "an authorized interlocutor be promptly appointed to determine
the next steps necessary to complete the nationalization of the Facility and its assignment
of PDVSA, as ordered by President Chavez." Apart from requesting a meeting with
PDVSA, Mr. Dupin confirmed Claimant's willingness to “analyze the possibility of
providing PDVSA with the technical assistance required to properly start and operate the
Facility."'

On 5 August 2010, Norpro Venezuela requested another judicial inspection, which doc-
umented that a red "PDVSA" flag was flying over the plant and that the gate of the plant

again denied entry into the plant on this day. !©°

Shortly after the takeover on 15 May 2010, Norpro Venezuela began notifying its con-
tractual partners in Venezuela, including INPSASEL and CVG EDELCA, that a causa
extrafia no imputable had occurred.'"° In August 2010, Norpro Venzuela published noti-
fications of force majeure in Venezuelan newspapers including in Ciudadanos Nacional
(a sub-section of El Nacional) and in Correo del Caroni.'"' Around the same time, Norpro
Venezuela officially terminated the majority of its workforce, only retaining certain indi-
viduals who would enable Claimant to provide technical assistance in case the Venezue-
lan Government would accept that offer.'7*

NEGOTIATIONS AFTER THE TAKEOVER OF THE PLANT

The 30 August 2010 Meeting

On 30 August 2010, a meeting was held between PDVSA Industrial, Compagnie de Saint-
Gobain and the French Embassy in Venezuela.'* According to the minutes of that meet-
ing, PDVSA Industrial made the following declarations and presented the following is-

sues:!74

- PDVSA Industrial had received specific instructions from President Chavez to carry
out the transfer of Norpro Venezuela to State control and would comply with such
order as promptly as possible;

- Anexpropriation decree was being prepared and, although PDVSA Industrial had no
knowledge of the precise date of its publication, it would be desirable if it was pub-
lished before 15 November 2010, the date on which the six-month term provided in
Article 8(1) of the Treaty would expire;

- Norpro Venezuela and its shareholders were free to commence legal proceedings to
safeguard their rights under the applicable law and, especially, for labor and work-
place safety purposes;

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13 Page 52 of 234

Without prejudice to the instruction that Norpro Venezuela was to become State-con-
trolled, PDVSA Industrial was "open to considering any proposal that the sharehold-
ers from Norpro may wish to present with the objective of bringing about this change
in control and the transfer of Norpro's assets to PDVSA, in an amicable and mutually
agreeable fashion," but PDVSA Industrial required a written statement of willingness
from the shareholders in order to obtain the necessary authorizations "to consider any
mechanism other than expropriation which might lead to the amicable resolution of
the dispute";

Until the publication of the expropriation decree, PDVSA Industrial could not act or
intervene in Norpro Venezuela and its presence at the plant "is in response to the
necessity to enter into possession formally, once the Decree is published."

230. Compagnie de Saint-Gobain made the following declarations and presented the following

issues at the meeting: !7°

Compagnie de Saint-Gobain thanked PDVSA Industrial's representatives for having
responded to its written request for a meeting and recalled that the project had always
been carried out "with the support and sponsorship" from MIBAM and various other
governmental Venezuelan authorities;

Compagnie de Saint-Gobain ratified what had been expressed in various communica-
tions since 15 May 2010 relating to the occupation of the plant and confirmed its
"intention to cooperate with the authorities in respect to the transfer of Norpro to
State control, for the purpose of resolving any controversy in a [sic] amicable fashion,
pursuant to the Treaty";

Compagnie de Saint-Gobain reiterated its readiness to provide technical assistance to
PDVSA Industrial regarding product quality control and standardization of process,
if PDVSA Industrial so required, and proposed to conduct a thorough technical in-
spection of the plant with the aim of restarting its production and to assemble a tech-
nical commission for the purpose of studying the form that the technical assistance
may take;

Compagnie de Saint-Gobain "expressed its interest to consider an eventual 'Take Off
Agreement' or purchase agreement for the products that PDVSA may produce in Nor-
pro's plant after its expropriation, subject to conditions that must be detailed and
agreed at a convenient time, including product specs, technical characteristics, and
quality standards. This proposal that may not exceed half of the plant's capacity due

to the loss of clients who could not be satisfied since the transfer of the company to
State control was ordered in 2010";

- Compagnie de Saint-Gobain reiterated its interest in "clarifying the legal situation of
the investment made by [Claimant] in Venezuela, through its subsidiary Norpro, over
whose plant it has no control since the date of the presidential announcement on May
15, 2010" and requested PDVSA Industrial to clarify when the expropriation decree
would be published, in light of the expiration of the six-month term under Article 8(1)
of the Treaty on 15 November 2010;

- Compagnie de Saint-Gobain was interested in reaching a framework agreement with
PDVSA Industrial over the basic issues related to the transfer of Norpro Venezuela
to State control and would "analyze with PDVSA mechanisms that would allow for
the resolution of the dispute in an amicable manner, pursuant to the terms of the
Treaty, such as, for example, the purchase of the shares in substitution for an expro-
priation proceeding."

PDVSA Industrial and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain agreed at the 30 August 2010 meet-
ing: (i) to draft and execute minutes of the meeting; (ii) to "[h]old regular meetings for
the purpose of analyzing issues of common interest related to the transfer of Norpro to
State control", (iii) to keep an open communication between the parties; and (iv) to hold

a meeting of the technical commission on 13 September 2010.!7°

The 14 October 2010 Meeting

On 14 October 2010, the joint technical commission, which was attended by representa-
tives from PDVSA Industrial and Norpro Venezuela on behalf of Compagnie de Saint-
Gobain, held its first meeting. 7

According to the draft minutes of that meeting, Norpro Venezuela made the following

declarations and presented the following issues: !78

- Norpro Venezuela asked whether PDVSA Industrial had any information on the status
of the drafting of the expropriation decree and its possible publication date (PDVSA
Industrial answered in the negative, but stated that it had received its instructions pur-
suant to the declarations of President Chavez on 15 May 2010);

- Norpro Venezuela gave an electronic presentation, described as "Virtual tour of the

Plant," described its proposal for technical assistance and explained the need for qual-
ity control of operations and the performance of an evaluation and diagnosis of the

actual plant conditions.

234. PDVSA Industrial made the following declarations and presented the following issues at

the meeting:!”

- PDVSA Industrial clarified that "the scope and purpose of the meeting is of a tech-

nical nature" and "legal issues of the process of transfer to State control shall be

analyzed with the Legal Counsel of PDVSA";

- PDVSA Industrial requested additional information on the proposal for technical as-

sistance (questions were answered by Norpro Venezuela) and suggested the "explo-
ration of other structures" besides the technical assistance proposal that would allow

them to bring about the transfer, referring to other cases in which PDVSA Industrial

and the respective owners of the transferred assets had created mixed companies, in

which PDVSA Industrial maintained control and a majority shareholding;

- PDVSA Industrial asked about the environmental situation of the plant which was

explained by Norpro Venezuela as being "very clean" and in compliance with all ap-
plicable laws and the permits issued by the Ministry for the Popular Power of Envi-

ronment;

- PDVSA Industrial requested information about the production capacity of the plant,
which Norpro Venezuela provided with an explanation of the development in two

phases, the first of which "was totally executed" with 70,000 tons per year and the

second of which was intended to start shortly, in order to double the capacity.

235. PDVSA Industrial and Norpro Venezuela agreed at the 14 October 2010 meeting: (i) to
execute the minutes of the 30 August meeting; (ii) to draft and sign minutes of this meet-

ing; and (iii) to set 8 November 2010 as a tentative date for a new meeting. 180

3. Further Correspondence and Meeting on 26 October 2010

236. By e-mail of 22 October 2010, Gabriel Rojas from PDVSA Industrial's Legal Department
wrote to Luis Paez (President of Norpro Venezuela) and proposed the following agree-

ment:

"I) NORPRO shall yield to PDVSA Industrial the plant, its existing products and raw
material;

2) PDVSA Industrial shall assume the control, responsibility and operations of the
plant, its products and raw materials;

3) — PDVSA Industrial shall assume the responsibility of hiring the necessary personnel
for operating the plant;

4) NORPRO shall help and assure that PDVSA Industrial puts into full operation the
plant and complies with every safety standard;

5) — Information regarding the state and actual operability conditions of the facilities
shall be gathered, in order to determine the fair value of such infrastructure, its

products and raw materials."'*!

Mr. Rojas clarified that this proposal was made "without prejudice to the possible incor-
poration of a state company of mixed capital," and invited Norpro Venezuela to hold a

meeting to discuss the proposal. '*?

On 26 October 2010, a meeting was held between Mr. Armando Giraud, the General
Counsel of PDVSA, representatives of PDVSA Industrial, Norpro Venezuela and the
French Embassy. At that meeting, Mr. Giraud outlined the possibility that Norpro Vene-
zuela enter into a mixed company (empresa mixta) arrangement with PDVSA, whereby
the latter would retain a 60% interest in the venture.'*? The Parties are in dispute as to
whether Mr. Giraud presented a "sufficiently advanced proposal" or rather a mere sug-
gestion, which would have had to be supported by concrete documents following the
meeting in order to be given serious consideration by Claimant.!8

In his follow-up e-mail of 1 November 2010 to Mr. Giraud, Mr. Patil noted that Claimant
expected to receive the documents that PDVSA had promised to provide, including draft
bylaws and an agreement for the suggested empresa mixta.'*°

In his letter dated 18 November 2010, Mr. Paez informed Mr. Giraud that, on 2 November
2010, two PDVSA officials, escorted by armed members of the National Guard, had ap-
proached Oscar Cid and Pierre-Yves Grammond of Norpro Venezuela and had demanded
that they turn over their company vehicles because the PDVSA officials claimed to have
instructions to reunite Norpro Venezuela's assets for a judicial inspection of the company.
Mr. Paez requested that Mr. Giraud present the documents pursuant to which those
PDVSA officials were authorized to confiscate Norpro Venezuela's assets, considering in
particular that the parties had agreed during the meeting of 26 October 2010 to analyze
alternatives to the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela. Mr. Paez then reiterated Claimant's
offer to provide technical assistance to PDVSA. '*7

In a further e-mail to Mr. Giraud dated 19 November 2010, Mr. Patil attached Mr. Paez’
letter of 18 November 2010 as well as pictures taken of the confiscated company vehicles
and copies of the identification cards of the two PDVSA officials. He further noted that
Claimant had still not received the promised documents in relation to the suggested em-

presa mixta. '88

In his letter to Mr. Giraud dated 19 January 2011, Mr. Paez stated that Claimant remained
willing to analyze the alternatives to the expropriation that Mr. Giraud had suggested
during the meeting on 26 October 2010 and noted that Claimant had still not received the
documents that Mr. Giraud had promised to provide for Claimant's consideration of his
empresa mixta proposal. He emphasized that Claimant was disposed to meet with

PDVSA in order to discuss the mentioned alternatives. '*

In his letter to Mr. Giraud dated 3 March 2011, Mr. Paez stated that he had not received
any response to the letters that he had sent following the meeting on 26 October 2010 and
reiterated that Claimant had still not received the documents in relation to the suggested
empresa mixta. Mr. Paez concluded by requesting a meeting to discuss the alternatives
that Mr. Giraud had proposed during the 26 October 2010 meeting. !°°

In his letter to Mr. del Pino dated 21 March 2011, Mr. Paez stated that there had been no
communication with PDVSA after the 26 October 2010 meeting as he had not received
any response to his follow-up letters. Mr. Paez noted that almost one year had passed
since the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela had been announced and, to his surprise, the
negotiations that started in August 2010 had stalled. Finally, he reiterated his request for
a meeting to solve the dispute in an amicable manner.!?!

On 14 April 2011, Mr. Paez wrote to Minister Ramirez and made reference to the expro-
priation of Norpro Venezuela's assets ordered by the Expropriation Decree, "confirm[ing]
President Chavez's decision, publicly announced on 15 May 2010, to transfer Norpro to
the State's control." He further stated that it had regrettably been impossible "to move
forward in a process leading to the effective expropriation of Norpro," and expressed his
hope that the publication of the Expropriation Decree would allow the parties to
“promptly advance in the definition of the terms of an amicable resolution of this contro-
versy, which will guarantee the payment of a compensation determined on the basis of
the just value of the investment made in Norpro" by Claimant. Mr. Paez reiterated Claim-
ant's offer of technical assistance and requested that PDVSA Industrial as the expropriat-
ing entity pursuant to the Expropriation Decree "appoint an authorized speaker to ana-
lyze, together with Norpro's representaives, matters related to the future steps of the ex-
propriation process."'>

According to press reports in Correo del Caroni on 13 and 15 April 2011 and in Nueva
Prensa de Guayana on 15 April 2011, 25,000 tons of bauxite were removed from the
plant to cover an emergency of CVG Bauxilum.'* On 25 April 2011, Norpro Venezuela
wrote to the President of PDVSA Industrial noting that "Norpro, in its role as legitimate
proprietor of all the goods that are located inside the facilities, has not authorized or
ratified these actions." !°

THE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPROPRIATION PROCEDURE AND CLAIMANT'S NOTICE OF DIs-
PUTE

On 24 June 2011, PDVSA Industrial published the following notifications in Ultimas
Noticias and Nueva Prensa de Guayana:

"1)[...]; 2) To declare as existent the precautionary order of temporary
occupation and operation of the personal property, real estate and
other assets including the intangible assets that are the property of or
in possession of the company NORPRO VENEZUELA, C.A., and of any
other related companies or people, pursuant to the provisions of sub-
section I of article 112 of the People's Defense in the Access to Property

and Services Law; (3) to give notice to the aforementioned people
through the publishing of this newspaper notice, simultaneously and for
one time, in the newspapers "Ultima Noticias’ and ‘Nueva Prensa de
Guayana' in order for them to appear at the headquarters of this Com-
pany, located in [...], within the terms of thirty (30) continuous days
following the publishing of this notifications in business days and in the
time schedule between [...] 8:30 am and [...] 4:30 pm, proving evi-
dence, in each case, of their rights upon the aforementioned affected
assets.

Also, the interested parties are given notice that 1) [...]; 2) that they
can exercise the remedy which is prescribed in article 113 of the Peo-
ple's Defense in the Access to Property and Services Law against the
precautionary order; and (3) that in the event that no party appears on
their own behalf or through a legal representative in the corresponding
authority, this proceeding will be declared as exhausted and the expro-
priation of the affected assets will be judicially requested.

This notice is given pursuant to article 22 of the Law on Expropriation
for Reasons of Public or Social Purposes." °°

On 4 July 2011, Claimant notified Respondent of a dispute under the Treaty and requested
that "adequate compensation equal to the fair value of its investment in Norpro prior to
May 15, 2010, be promptly paid by Venezuela pursuant to Article 5." Claimant referred
to the meetings held on 30 August, 14 October and 26 October 2010 and stated that "Saint-
Gobain has made its best efforts to meet and discuss with Venezuelan authorities the
terms of an amicable resolution of the current controversy, in accordance with the
France-Venezuela Treaty. However, no response has been provided to Saint-Gobain by
PDVSA, PDVSAI{ndustrial] or any other competent Venezuelan authority." Claimant re-
iterated its willingness to resolve the dispute amicably in accordance with the provisions
of the Treaty and stated that it was "prepared to meet immediately with an authorized
representative of Venezuela with the objective of reaching a fair and adequate resolution
for both parties." Claimant concluded the letter by emphasizing that "in the event that this
dispute is not settled amicably within the term of six (6) months starting from the date

hereof, Saint-Gobain may refer this matter to arbitration."'""

On 26 July 2011, PDVSA Industrial published a notice declaring the amicable settlement
proceeding terminated, "[c]onsidering that on June 24, 2011 the press notifications pro-
vided for by article 22 of the Law on Expropriation for Reasons of Public or Social Pur-
poses were published, and taking into consideration that the corresponding term expires
as of this day, without the appearance of any party or third party, on their own or through

a legal representative," and instructed the Legal Department to commence the judicial

proceedings under the Expropriation Law for Reasons of Public or Social Purposes (the

"Expropriation Law")!

XIV. FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES

251. On 26 October 2011, Mr. Carmelo Ursaneta, General Counsel to the Oil and Energy Min-
istry, wrote to Claimant, seeking to schedule a meeting for 3 November 2011 to discuss
the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela. !*? Claimant responded to Mr. Urdaneta by letter
dated 3 November 2011.7” On the same day, a meeting was held during which the Min-
istry again proposed to form a mixed company to run the plant in Venezuela; Claimant
agreed to consider this proposal.?”!

252. As acknowledged by Mr. Paez in his follow-up letter of 20 December 2011, Claimant
was further requested to prepare a communication including a brief presentation of
Norpro Venezuela and the business objectives that had led to its establishment in Vene-
zuela and a summary of the terms of a possible agreement pursuant to which the parties

 

would pursue a joint investment project resulting in an empresa mixta in which PDVSA
would hold a majority share. In his 20 December 2011 letter, Mr. Paez explained that the
group was still in the process of analyzing the general conditions and specification of the
proposed joint investment project, as well as the modalities and the scope of the technical
assistance and training of personnel that the group may be able to provide; they would
send the requested communication once this analysis was concluded, which he expected
to occur in the first weeks of January 2012. According to Respondent, Claimant never
provided the requested information to the Ministry.?”

253. By letter to Respondent dated 17 January 2012, Claimant reiterated the existence of a
dispute under the Treaty, stating that "[d]espite several meeting and communications be-
tween representatives of Saint-Gobain and PDVSA to review the status of Norpro's ex-
propriation and future actions to be undertaken by the Government of Venezuela (includ-
ing the payment of an appropriate compensation in accordance with the Treaty's provi-
sions) during the six-month 'cooling-off' period as required by the Treaty, no friendly
agreement in relation to this dispute with Venezuela has been reached." Claimant con-
firmed its acceptance of Respondent's offer provided in Article 8(2) of the Treaty to settle
the dispute by arbitration before ICSID and, although it expressed its hope to "reach an

amicable agreement with the Government of Venezuela," it announced that, if such agree-
ment failed, it would, "very promptly," initiate arbitration proceedings before ICSID.?™

On 24 January 2012, Respondent denounced the ICSID Convention.”° The denunciation
became effective on 25 July 2012.

THE JUDICIAL EXPROPRIATION PROCEDURE AND PARALLEL NEGOTIATIONS

On 18 April 2012, PDVSA Industrial initiated the judicial expropriation procedure pur-
suant to Articles 22-24 of the Expropriation Law (the "Expropriation Procedure") by
submitting a claim against Norpro Venezuela before the First Court of First Instance in
Civil, Corporate and Agrarian Matter of the Second Circuit of the Judicial Circumscrip-
tion of the State of Bolivar (the "Court").”°° PDVSA Industrial requested that the Court
"decree the expropriation" of Norpro Venezuela's assets and that the interim measure,
i.e., the temporary occupation of the plant based on Article 112(1) of the People's Defense
in the Access to Property and Services Law (see PDVSA's notification of 24 June 2011
above), be upheld. In addition, it requested that Norpro Venezuela, in the person of its
legal representative Dr. Jorge Patil, be summoned.?°”

On 25 May 2012, Claimant initiated the present arbitration proceedings by filing its Re-
quest for Arbitration under the France-Venezuela Treaty with ICSID.

On 20 June 2012, the Court issued a public notice ordering "to summon [...] the alleged
owners, holders, tenants, creditors and, in general, any other person who might have any
right over the assets owned by NORPRO VENEZUELA, C.A." The Court stated that the
public notice would be published three times in the newspapers Primicia and Correo del
Orinoco, in an interval of ten calendars between the publications, in order for the inter-
ested parties to appear within ten business days following the date of the last publication
or, in case no person appeared within the specified term, the Court would appoint a public
defendant in Norpro Venezuela's favor.”°° On 10 July 2012, the notice of summons was
personally served to the secretary at the office of Dr. Patil.?”

By e-mail of 17 July 2012, Mr. Carmelo Urdaneta (General Director of PDVSA Indus-
trial's Legal Department Office) sought to schedule a meeting with Dr. Patil, who replied
by e-mail of 20 July 2012; the meeting took place on 15 August 2012.7!°

On 23 August 2012, Mr. Urdaneta sent a draft confidentiality agreement to Dr. Patil as it
had been discussed during the meeting.”!! The agreement was to be concluded with Re-
spondent, "by means of its Ministry for the Popular Power of Petroleum and Mining,"
and included the following passage: "the PARTIES and their respective affiliates have
maintained and shall continue to maintain negotiations in order to reach an agreement
in connection with the provisions of the DECREE, including without limitation any com-

pensation to which xxxxxx or its affiliates may be entitled."*'*

By letter of 4 September 2012, Dr. Patil inquired whether the Ministry had begun the
selection of the experts who would undertake the valuation of Claimant's investment in
Venezuela, as Mr. Urdaneta had stated during the 15 August 2012 meeting, and attached

a revised version of the confidentiality agreement.”

On 26 September 2012, the Court issued a second public notice again summoning the
interested parties on the part of Norpro Venezuela under the same terms as in the 20 June
2012 notice; the notice was published on 2, 12 and 22 November 2012 in the newspapers

Primicia and Vea.>"*

Approximately one year later, on 11 October 2013, the judicial inspection pursuant to
Article 57 of the Expropriation Law was carried out,?!° and on 13 November 2013, the
Court issued a public notice ordering, pursuant to Articles 19, 56 and 57 of the Expropri-
ation Law and "taking notice that the relevant proceedings for summoning the defendant
have been duly taken," that the appointment of the Valuators forming the Valuation Com-
mittee shall take place five business days later.?!°

On the same day, PDVSA Industrial requested that the Court appoint a public defender
in accordance with Article 27 of the Expropriation Law to represent Norpro Venezuela in
the Expropriation Procedure.*!” Two days later, on 15 November 2013, the Court issued
a public notice appointing Mr. José Neptali Blanco as Judicial Defender for Norpro Ven-
ezuela in the Expropriation Procedure and ordering him to appear before the Court on the
third business day following his notification to accept or refuse his appointment.?'* On
22 November 2013, the Court noted that the Expropriation Procedure was "currently at a
stage of notification to the appointed Judicial Defender" and thus decided that the order

of 13 November 2013 was "left without effect" until Mr. Neptali had been duly notified

and his summon had been incorporated into the record.?!?

On 3 February 2014, Mr. Neptali formally accepted his appointment as judicial defender
for Norpro Venezuela.””° On the next day, 4 February 2014, Norpro Venezuela, repre-
sented by its Venezuelan counsel Dr. Patil, appeared for the first time before the Court,
requesting the Stay, Suspension and Extinction of the Judicial Expropriation Proceeding
and challenging the Court's jurisdiction based on the fact that Claimant had begun the
present ICSID arbitration proceedings.””! On 12 March 2014, the Court dismissed Norpro
Venezuela's request.?7*

PARTIES' POSITIONS

In the following, the positions of the Parties as argued in their written submissions and
during the Hearing will be briefly summarized.

SUMMARY OF CLAIMANT'S POSITION AND RELIEF SOUGHT

Claimant submits that Respondent committed several breaches of the Treaty and therefore
claims compensation in the amount of the higher of the Fair Market Value of Norpro
Venezuela as of the date of the award (calculated at USD 90.3 million as of 31 August
2015), or the Fair Market Value of Norpro Venezuela as of the date of the expropriation
(calculated at USD 99.5 million) plus pre-award interest, as well as post-award interest.

1. Admissibility

Claimant submits that Respondent's admissibility objections regarding (i) the claims re-
lated to the bauxite price increase; and (ii) the claim for breach of Article 5(1) subpara-
graph 1 of the Treaty, should be dismissed.

With regard to the claims related to the bauxite price increase, Claimant emphasizes that
its claims are not based on the Bauxite Contract as such, but they are rather based on the
fact that Respondent sanctioned or could have prevented CVG Bauxilum's conduct and

thereby breached the Treaty.?

272.

As to its claim for breach of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty that it raised for
the first time during the Hearing, Claimant submits that this claim was informed by Re-
spondent's statement in its Rejoinder "that what happened between May of 2010 and
March of 2011 was not the expropriation, and that the expropriation only occurred in
[March] of 20/1."2*4 Claimant further claims that its claim is "neither new nor untimely"
because the argument that the expropriation was not carried out in a fair and equitable
manner and failed to accord Claimant due process was raised from the outset of the pro-
ceedings.”>

2. Breach of the Treaty
Claimant submits that Respondent committed breaches of

- Article 5(1) of the Treaty with respect to its obligations regarding expropria-
tion (a));

- Article 3(1) of the Treaty with respect to its obligation to accord fair and equitable
treatment (b)); and

- Article 3(2) of the Treaty with respect to its obligation to grant full protection and
security (c)).

a) Expropriation (Article 5(1) of the Treaty)

Claimant submits that Respondent was in breach of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the
Treaty (aa)) as well as subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the same provision (bb)).

aa) Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraph 1 of the Treaty

Claimant contends that Respondent's conduct prior to the publication of the Expropriation
Decree in March 2011 amounted to an "expropriation" within the meaning of Article 5(1)
of the Treaty. During the Hearing,””° Claimant raised the argument that this conduct was
in conflict with Respondent's obligations under Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.
In particular, Claimant contends, first, that the expropriation was not carried out with a
formal expropriation instrument and hence not pursuant to a "measure" ("mesures"/"me-
didas").?27 Second, Claimant argues that the physical taking of the plant prior to March
2011 was not conducted following due process and granting full protection to Claimant's
investment, contrary to Respondent's obligations under Article 3(1) and Article 3(2) of

the Treaty, and therefore violated a "particular undertaking" ("engagement par-
ticulier"/"compromiso especial") within the meaning of Article 5(1) subparagraph | of
the Treaty.?78

bb) Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty

In addition, Claimant contends that Respondent is in breach of its obligation to provide
prompt and adequate compensation and to specify the amount of compensation on the
date of the expropriation pursuant to Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty.

It is Claimant's position that Respondent expropriated Claimant's investment with respect
to the plant on 15 May 2010 or shortly thereafter.7?? Claimant submits that, in view of the
law, the takeover by the SINPROTRAC union following President Chavez' announce-
ment and the subsequent active management of the plant by the state-owned PDVSA
amounted to an "expropriation" within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty.?*?
Claimant emphasizes that it constantly asserted its rights with regard to the plant, i.e., that

it attempted to re-enter it but was denied access.”*!

With regard to the specification requirement pursuant to Article 5(1) subparagraph 3 of
the Treaty, Claimant submits that, despite the clear wording of the Treaty, Respondent
was far from having determined compensation at the time of the expropriation, given that
Respondent has never communicated the amount or method of payment to be made to
Claimant and has yet to offer any compensation for the expropriation, despite numerous
attempts by Claimant to negotiate.” In particular, Claimant contends that the specifica-
tion requirement is not met by the mere existence of, or reference to, a procedure in do-
mestic law.?*

With respect to the promptness requirement pursuant to Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 of
the Treaty, Claimant similarly contends that the Treaty is very specific about the require-
ment that an expropriation be accompanied by "prompt" compensation and that the Con-
tracting Parties left no room for doubt as to the interpretation of the prompt compensation
requirement: The Treaty provides that "the amount and method of payment of compensa-
tion should be specified on the date of expropriation at the latest" and "payments shall be
made without delay."*** Claimant argues that, over four years after the expropriation, such

compensation is long overdue and can in no way be considered "prompt" in accordance
with the Treaty language.”

Assuming arguendo that Article 5(1) of the Treaty did not require Respondent to make
an offer of compensation on the date of the expropriation, Claimant submits that for two
separate reasons, Respondent may not invoke, with recourse to its domestic law, that it
“acknowledge[d] its compensation obligation" and provided a mechanism for the deter-
mination of compensation in the Expropriation Decree.?*°

First, Claimant argues that Respondent cannot rely on municipal law to excuse its obli-
gations under international law;?*7 in any event, Claimant considers the domestic rules on
expropriation followed by Respondent "a State-instigated generic procedure" which Re-

spondent "takes no steps to effectuate."”**

Second, Claimant contends that Respondent's conduct was not in line with the provisions
of its own domestic laws on expropriation. In particular, Claimant argues that neither the
administrative occupation of the plant by PDVSA on 4 April 2011 nor the judicial occu-
pation issued on 20 June 2012 was conducted in accordance with Article 56 of the Ex-
propriation Law. This provision allows for "anticipatory occupation" only in cases in-
volving urgent circumstances and only after the (probable) amount of the compensation,
as determined by an evaluation commission, has been deposited with the expropriation
court. Moreover, Claimant submits that the measures taken by Respondent could not
properly be based on Articles 6 and 112(1) of the Law on the Defense of Access to Goods
and Services (the "Law on Access").”°°

In the event that, due to the provisions of its domestic expropriation law, Respondent was
not required under Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty to make a prompt
compensation offer on the date of the expropriation, Claimant contends that Respondent
is nevertheless in breach of the Treaty because it failed to make any attempt to negotiate
compensation for the expropriation with Claimant in good faith.” In particular, Claimant
submits that (i) it received "no direct word from Venezuela concerning the expropriation
during the entire period between the President’s announcement on 15 May 2010 and the
issuance of the Expropriation Decree on 29 March 2011"; (ii) Respondent never

acknowledged an obligation to pay compensation; and (iii) Respondent refused to engage

in good faith negotiations even after the publication of the Expropriation Decree.”*!

Claimant submits that Respondent's failure to meet the specification and/or promptness
requirements pursuant to Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty renders its
expropriation unlawful, and claims that the belated issuance of the Expropriation Decree
did not rectify the violation of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty.?*? In
support of this submission, Claimant cites several commentators as well as a number of
arbitral decisions as authorities (see in more detail below).

In its Reply, Claimant also submitted that there was an expropriation with regard to the
Bauxite Contract and the VAT credits it had accrued, and claimed that this expropriation
also has to be compensated.”7 During the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submission,
however, Claimant no longer dealt with this issue as a matter of expropriation, but rather
focused on the argument that Respondent's conduct with respect to the Bauxite Contract
and the VAT credits was in conflict with its obligations to ensure fair and equitable treat-
ment ("FET") and to grant full protection and security ("FPS") under Article 3(1) and (2)

of the Treaty.?4+

b) Fair and Equitable Treatment (Article 3(1) of the Treaty)

Claimant submits that the FET standard provided for in Article 3(1) of the Treaty refers
to the prevailing concepts of FET in international law — and not only to the minimum
standard of treatment —, including "contemporary notions of due process, good faith, and
legitimate expectations," and that Respondent breached its obligations thereunder with
respect to both the takeover of the plant and the Bauxite Contract, in light of any reading
of Article 3(1) of the Treaty.745

With regard to the union takeover of the plant following President Chavez’ statement on
15 May 2010 and Respondent's conduct thereafter, Claimant asserts that Respondent
failed to follow due process in the expropriation and thereby violated its FET obliga-
tion.?4° Claimant contends that the expropriation was effectively carried out "overnight,"
with a "public and sudden announcement" on TY, and that despite Claimant's attempts to
negotiate in good faith on the terms of the expropriation, Respondent "gave Saint-Gobain

dure."247

During the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submission, Claimant included this FET
claim in the expropriation claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.74*
The Tribunal notes, however, that Claimant thereby did not intend to abandon its separate
FET claim relating to the taking of the plant, given that it maintains in its relief sought
the request for a separate declaration that Respondent has breached Article 3(1) of the
Treaty.?4?

With respect to the Bauxite Contract between Norpro Venezuela and CVG Bauxilum,
Claimant submits, on the one hand, that CVG Bauxilum was acting as a State organ within
the meaning of the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of
States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ("ILC Draft Articles") and, on the other hand,
that Respondent, through MIBAM and other organs, made "specific promises" and "com-
mitments" and thereby "created specific expectations," which Claimant relied on in mak-
ing its investments.?°° It is Claimant's position that Respondent (through CVG Bauxilum)
breached the Bauxite Contract and "repudiated these expectations, failing to address [...]
CVG Bauxilum’s actions in raising the bauxite price."*>!

c) Full Protection and Security (Article 3(2) of the Treaty)

Claimant further submits that Respondent failed to protect and secure Claimant's invest-
ment and hence violated Article 3(2) of the Treaty with regard to the takeover of the plant
and the bauxite price increase.

As an alternative argument with regard to its expropriation claim, Claimant submits that
if Respondent's conduct prior to 29 March 2011 did not amount to an "expropriation"
within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty, PD VSA’s control of the plant and failure
to return it to Claimant before that date must be considered a breach of the obligation to
provide Claimant with full protection and security pursuant to Article 3(2) of the

Treaty.>?

As to the bauxite price increase, Claimant submits that, after Respondent was notified of
breaches of the Bauxite Contract, it failed to act and accord Claimant’s investment legal
security. In this context, Claimant asserts that the FPS standard requires the State to take
all reasonable measures "fo ensure a secure investment environment," including not only
physical but also commercial and legal security.”** Claimant contends that, contrary to
this standard, Respondent made no attempt to investigate or take action to protect Claim-

ant's rights under the Bauxite Contract, despite Claimant's repeated calls for action.?**

3. Quantum

Compensation standard and valuation date

It is Claimant's submission that the appropriate remedy for an unlawful expropriation is
the customary international law standard of restitution, i.e., the higher compensation as
between that valued at the date of expropriation and the date of the award.°°

In support of its approach, Claimant emphasizes that Article 5(1) of the Treaty provides
for the appropriate standard of compensation only in case all of the conditions for a lawful
expropriation are met. As this is not the case here, the appropriate standard of compensa-
tion, including the appropriate date at which the value is to be assessed, is set by custom-

ary international law.?°°

In support of its argumentation, Claimant refers to the Chorzéw Factory judgment ren-
dered by the Permanent Court of International Justice ("PCIJ") as well as several arbitral
awards (see in more detail below).

b) Calculation of damages
aa) Valuation Method

Claimant submits that Respondent must pay full compensation for the expropriated plant
and refers to the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment
of 1992757 and the commentary on the ILC Draft Articles.?°*

Claimant refers to its expert on quantum, Prof. Spiller, who suggests that a third-party
buyer would pay the lower of (i) the net present value of the cash flows that a willing

buyer could obtain from acquiring a 100% stake in Norpro Venezuela; and (ii) the oppor-
tunity cost that a willing buyer would incur if it constructed a similar plant outside Ven-
ezuela, which consists of the sum of contruction costs plus the foregone cash flows during

the construction period.?°°

295. According to the calculation of Prof. Spiller as of 15 May 2010, the opportunity cost for
the construction of a similar plant in the US would be lower than the net present value of
Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows (USD 99.5 million compared to USD 115.1 mil-
lion). Consequently, Claimant is of the view that the Tribunal should determine the fair
market value of the expropriated plant based on the construction cost approach.?® In any
event, Claimant made the following submissions with regard to the DCF calculation.

bb) Discount Rate

296. Claimant submits that Respondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied "an
absurdly high discount rate of 26%," which results in a value that implies that "no rea-
sonable investor would invest in a new proppant plant, or add capacity to an existing
proppant plant."?°!

297. In particular, Claimant argues that the "exorbitant" country risk premium of 13.92% that
Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied for Venezuela is a "desperate way for a State to
try to evade responsibility for its actions." According to Claimant, this spike reflects Pres-
ident Chavez's threats to expropriate all foreign investments in Venezuela without com-

pensation.” Claimant argues, however, that a State "may not use its own propensity to
violate the law to reduce the value of compensation for the expropriation."?® It therefore
takes the position that the "generalized threat of confiscation" has to be eliminated from
the calculation of the fair market value because Respondent would otherwise be rewarded
for the unlawful conduct that this arbitration is meant to remedy.

298. Claimant claims that Prof. Spiller has excluded only the confiscation risk in his calcula-
tion but appropriately took into account "other risks of investing in Venezuela, such as
the risks of a volatile economy, civil disorder, less developed infrastructure, and other
issues." Claimant submits that Prof. Spiller took the average spread of sovereign bonds

of countries with a B1 rating such as Venezuela, which includes many developing coun-
tries with "significant country risk, including political risks.""®
299. Claimant further contends that it also took Venezuela's "heightened country risk" into
account when it assigned a discount rate of 15% to the project in 2006 and undertook
significant efforts to secure meaningful support of the Venezuelan Government, in reli-
ance on the fact that the France-Venezuela Treaty had entered into force in 2004.76°
Claimant emphasizes that the "high risk" discount rate of 12%, which included a country
risk premium of 4%, was not assigned by the members of the project team (they even
added a further 3% "to be conservative"), but rather served as a "company-wide objective
measure to consider the potential risks and rewards of proposed ventures in various lo-

cations."""

cc) Future Cash Flows

300. With regard to the calculation of the future cash flows, Claimant considers it "baseless"
to split the profits that a willing buyer would generate from Norpro Venezuela's exports
to account for internal cost allocation. In Claimant's view, the fair market valuation is
"not dependent on idiosyncratic qualities of the buyer or seller"; therefore, it must be
assumed that the highest-bidding willing buyer would most likely be a strategic investor
that already has a distribution and marketing network similar to that of Saint-Gobain and

is thus in a position to accrue 100% of the profits.7°

301. Claimant further notes that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores assumed in their calculation
that CVG Bauxilum would supply bauxite at the increased price that it unilaterally im-
posed on Norpro Venezuela in September 2008. According to Claimant, this price in-
crease was unlawful and therefore must not be taken into account based on the principle
that "a party may not reduce its liability for one wrongful act (here, the expropriation) on

the basis of another (the price increase)."*

Claimant argues that one way to "check" this is to look at the CDS spreads outstanding on countries’ sovereign
debts and notes that on Prof. Damodaran's list of 63 countries as of January 2014, Prof. Spiller's proposed premium
of 4.5% would rank as the fourth-highest after Argentina (14.73%), Venezuela (10.8%) and Tunisia (4.57%) and
thus "far above the typical country risk premium in a developing country." Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Sub-

302. As to the transportation costs, Claimant claims that (i) Prof. Spiller's estimate of the trans-
portation costs is based on an actual shipment in March 2010 and confirmed by Saint-
Gobain's contemporaneous transportation contracts; and (ii) the average price applied by
Prof. Spiller for shipping costs within the US accurately accounts for the various locations
and contractual arrangements with Claimant's ultimate customers.?”°

303. Claimant further asserts that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores fail to distinguish between
the concepts of (i) maintenance capex aimed at "maintain[ing] the plant in the condition
to continue functioning at its current levels"; and (ii) investment capex aimed at "in-
creas{ing] plant production through efficiency and technological improvements."?"' Ac-
cording to Claimant, only the maintenance capex should be included in the calculation of
capital expenditures.?””

304. In respect of the working capital required to operate the plant, Claimant refers to Prof.
Spiller's assumptions that (i) the outstanding balance of VAT credits as of 2009 would
have been paid in 2010; and (ii) going forward, it would have taken 60 days to monetize
the VAT certificates and Norpro Venezuela would have recovered 80% of their value. As
to the administrative delays invoked by Respondent, Claimant notes that such delays have
been found to be in breach of the FET standard and claims that it had a legitimate expec-
tation that Respondent would follow its own VAT credit procedure, given that this issue
was specifically discussed with the Venezuelan Government before Claimant invested in

Venezuela.?”

SUMMARY OF RESPONDENT'S POSITION AND RELIEF SOUGHT

It is Respondent's position that it fully complied with its Treaty obligations, in particular

with respect to the expropriation of the plant, and that Claimant is merely entitled to com-
pensation based on Article 5(1) of the Treaty in the amount of USD 9.5 million, the fair

market value of the plant as of 15 May 2010, plus pre-award simple interest at a rate equal

to the rate of a three-month US Treasury Bill plus 1.1 percentage points.” To the extent
that Claimant's claim exceeds this amount, Respondent submits that it should be dis-

missed.

Admissibility Objections

Respondent contends that (i) the claims relating to the Bauxite Contract; and (ii) the
claims relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1| of the Treaty are inadmissible.

With respect to the Bauxite Contract, Respondent argues that, even if Claimant could
establish that the bauxite prices were increased in breach of the Bauxite Contract, this
could not, in itself, give rise to a responsibility of Respondent under international law
because CVG Bauxilum, an entity legally distinct from Respondent, is party to the Baux-
ite Contract.?”° Respondent maintains that Claimant is unable to identify any legal instru-
ment entered into with the State, or any relevant act on the part of the State, on which it
can base its claims regarding bauxite pricing.?””

As regards the alleged breach of the Article 5(1) subparagraph | of the Treaty, Respond-
ent submits that this claim should be dismissed as Claimant never raised its "new theory"
with regard to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty prior to the Hearing. Respondent
further contends that Claimant's change of position is in conflict with Rule 31(3) of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules.?”8

2. No Breach of the Treaty

With respect to the merits of the claims, Respondent submits that it did not breach any of
its obligations under the Treaty.

a) Expropriation (Article 5(1) of the Treaty)

It is Respondent's position that it acted in full conformity with the requirements of both
Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty (aa)) and of subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the same
provision (bb)).

aa) No Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraph 1 of the Treaty

Respondent submits that the claim relating to the Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the
Treaty is without legal merit as (i) the term "measure" has a "far broader meaning than
that suggested by Claimant"; and (ii) the reference to a "particular agreement" ("“engage-
ment particulier"/"compromiso especial") is "not intended to mean the Treaty itself, but
rather an agreement external to the Treaty," as evidenced by the use of the same term in
Article 10 of the Treaty.”

bb) No Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty

Respondent further contends that its conduct was in conformity with the requirements of
Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 and 3 of the Treaty.

Respondent submits that the "date of expropriation" within the meaning of Article 5(1)
subparagraph 3 of the Treaty was 29 March 2011, i.e., the date of the issuance of the
Expropriation Decree, which triggered the procedures under the Venezuelan Expropria-
tion Law.”® With regard to the takeover of the plant on 15 May 2010 and the events
thereafter, Respondent contends, first, that it was the labor union SINPROTRAC, not the
State, which occupied the plant, and, second, that PDVSA's presence at the plant thereaf-
ter was a "responsible and necessary action pending the expropriation decree to assure
the safety and security of the plant" after Norpro Venezuela’s management had effectively

abandoned it.78!

With regard to the first point, Respondent denies the existence of an intrinsic causal link
between President Chavez's "announcement" and the takeover of the plant, because the
President "did not order the takeover of the Plant."**?

With respect to the second aspect, Respondent maintains that PDVSA's presence prior to
the publication of the expropriation decree was arranged for the purpose of ensuring plant
safety and stability, as a "caretaker." Respondent asserts that, with the plant under the
control of the union, and in the absence of supervision by Norpro Venezuela’s manage-
ment staff, there were legitimate grounds for concern regarding worker safety and the
proper operation of the plant’s equipment.?**

In this context, Respondent alleges that Claimant neither challenged the legal foundation
of PDVSA's presence nor demanded return of the plant nor requested access to it after 15
May 2010.784

At the same time, Respondent does not contest that, in the aftermath of 15 May 2010,
"there was a ‘process of nationalization' to the extent that, as everyone recognized, the
Plant had not been expropriated but that it would be transferred to State control in the
future." Respondent submits that the Parties also recognized (i) that a formal expropria-
tion decree was being drafted at that time; (ii) that the decree was supposed to mark the
starting point of the expropriation procedure under Venezuelan law; and (iii) that the Par-

ties would consider, in the meantime, alternatives to expropriation, including the for-
mation of a mixed company ("empresa mixta"), with PDVSA as a majority shareholder
and the Claimant holding a minority stake.

As regards the precise content of the specification requirement in Article 5(1) subpara-
graph 3 of the Treaty, Respondent rejects Claimant's interpretation pursuant to which the
provision requires not only an acknowledgment that an amount equivalent to that speci-
fied in the second paragraph of Article 5(1) will be paid, but also that the precise figure
constituting that "amount" be determined on the date an intention to expropriate is an-
nounced. In particular, Respondent submits that, on the basis of a good faith interpretation
of Article 5(1) of the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties ("Vienna Convention"), asking for a specified figure on the date of ex-
propriation is "not a good faith interpretation and cannot be correct, as it would establish
an obligation that the Contracting States could not satisfy except by pure chance."**6

Respondent points out that the Treaty does not require that the State "must, before it an-
nounces an expropriation, engage in discussions with the expropriated entity to obtain
the facts necessary to determine the precise figure" of compensation, and that "without
such information, it would be impossible [...] to determine that figure in good faith." For
this reason, Respondent suggests a, in its view, more reasonable interpretation of the word
"amount" that does not refer to a "precise dollar or Euro figure, but rather to the required

concept (i.e., a ‘sum [...] equal to the actual value of the investments’)."?87

With respect to the promptness requirement, Respondent submits that Article 5(1) of the
Treaty does not require the State to pay compensation to the investor on the date of the
expropriation: While subparagraph 2 provides that "/ajll measures of expropriation
which could be taken must result in payment of a prompt and adequate compensation," it
is only subparagraph 3, which requires that, after compensation has been determined,

"payments shall be made without delay."?**

It is Respondent's position that it fully complied with these requirements. First, Respond-
ent submits that Decree No. 8.133 and the Venezuelan Expropriation Law indeed pro-
vided the mechanism for the determination and payment of compensation in the event of
an expropriation, consistent with Respondent’s obligations under Article 5(1) of the

Treaty and international law.?°°

Moreover, contrary to Claimant's contentions, Respondent asserts that it has been duly
following the mandatory procedures required by the national laws on expropriation to
determine compensation, namely Article 56 of the Expropriation Law and the provision
of the Law on Access. Respondent contends that the fact that those procedures are yet to
come to a close and Claimant is yet to receive payment of compensation is largely due to
Claimant’s own failure to participate in those procedures and Claimant’s attempts to have
them discontinued.?””

Finally, Respondent also rejects Claimant's good faith argument and submits that, apart
from its continued efforts to determine compensation in accordance with the Expropria-
tion law, it met regularly with Claimant to negotiate compensation, including the option
of forming an "empresa mixta."”?!

In any event, it is Respondent's submission that the mere fact that compensation is yet to
be paid does not render the expropriation unlawful, taking into account that Respondent
acknowledged its obligation to pay compensation and commenced the expropriation pro-
cedure in consistency with its domestic law.”°? Respondent refers to several commenta-
tors and decisions rendered by arbitral tribunals in order to substantiate its submission
(see in more detail below).

b) Fair and Equitable Treatment (Article 3(1) of the Treaty)

Respondent submits that Article 3(1) of the Treaty calls only for the minimum standard
of treatment under customary international law. In any event, Respondent contends that
even under more expansive formulations, there would be no FET violation.

With regard to the Bauxite Contract, Respondent submits that it did not give any "guar-
antee" or "commitments" to Saint-Gobain regarding bauxite supply or price and claims
that Claimant is "unable to identify a single legal instrument or document containing any
so-called State guarantees and commitments regarding bauxite supply or price."”°? In
Respondent's view, Claimant refers to CVG Bauxilum’s commercial decision to accom-
plish an increase in the bauxite price under the Bauxite Contract, even though CVG Baux-
ilum's conduct is not attributable to Respondent under international law.?°*

In response to Claimant's contention that Respondent did not accord Saint Gobain due
process in the expropriation, Respondent emphasizes that PDVSA established a presence
on the plant after 15 May 2010 only in a caretaker capacity and pending the publication

of the formal Expropriation Decree, which was in full accordance with Venezuelan law.
Respondent further points out that, after the takeover of the plant, PDVSA met with
Claimant for negotiations as soon as possible.”

Finally, Respondent argues that due process does not require discussions with the expro-
priated party prior to the expropriation announcement and that due process is fully satis-
fied if there is access to the judiciary to be heard — which is the case in Venezuela. Again,
Respondent contends that Claimant could have challenged the occupation of the plant by
the union or PDVSA prior to the issuance of the Expropriation Decree before Venezuelan
courts. It is Respondent's position that "the fact that Claimant chose not to avail itself of

remedies in the Venezuelan courts does not equate with a denial of due process."”*°

c) Full Protection and Security (Article 3(2) of the Treaty)

It is Respondent's position that an analysis of a breach of the FPS standard requires con-
sideration of whether the investment has been physically interfered with or harmed and
whether the State complied with its due diligence obligation, and that the FPS standard
does not entail the concept of "Jegal security."?°" In any event, Respondent rejects Claim-

 

ant's FPS claims with regard to both the Bauxite Contract and the plant takeover.

Respondent emphasizes that it was not responsible for CVG Bauxilum's price increases
under the Bauxite Contract. Moreover, Respondent contends that an investor, "by com-
municating its discontent with the behavior of a commercial partner to a government
representative," cannot create an obligation of the State under international law "fo inves-
tigate the merits of its commercial complaint and make the government responsible for
any damages" if the investor's commercial partner continues its unpleasant behavior.?°*
With respect to the plant takeover, Respondent submits that it fully complied with its FPS
obligations prior to the issuance of the Expropriation Decree. Respondent emphasizes
that, had it "not established a presence through PDVSA Industrial pending the issuance
of Decree No. 8.133, and had the assets been destroyed or stolen or had people been
injured, Venezuela very well may have been subject to a claim for non-compliance with
its FPS obligations."*°

Compensation Standard and Valuation Date

Respondent submits that, irrespective of whether or not Venezuela complied with the
requirements of Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 and 3 of the Treaty, the proper valuation date
is the "date prior to the threat of expropriation," as required by Article 5(1) subparagraph
2 of the Treaty.*”

Respondent refers to the wording of Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 of the Treaty, according
to which the value of the expropriated asset is to "be assessed in relation to the normal
economic situation prevailing before any threat of expropriation was of public
knowledge." It is Respondent's position that this standard relates to both lawful and un-
lawful expropriations and is not limited to expropriations that comply with the require-

ments set out in Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.°”!

Moreover, Respondent contends that, in case of a mere failure of the State to promptly
specify and pay compensation, even the compensation standard under customary interna-
tional law does not allow for calculating damages by way of "constructing a ‘but-for'
world in which the possibility of expropriation is excluded until the date of the award."*°

b) Calculation of Damages

aa) Valuation Method

Respondent agrees that the amount of compensation to be paid should reflect the fair
market value of the plant, i.e., "the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing

seller.

Respondent sees no need to consider Prof. Spiller's approach to compare the DCF-based
valuation with the opportunity costs of constructing a similar plant in any detail because
according to its experts on quantum, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, those costs would
exceed the price that a willing buyer would pay for Claimant's plant (USD 43.7 million
plus foregone cash flows of USD 1.3 million as of 15 May 2010 compared to USD 9.5
million).*°*

In any event, Respondent emphasizes that the asset to be evaluated in the present case is
a stand-alone plant in Venezuela, not in the United States, and therefore argues that the

only appropriate way of assessing the compensation to be paid to Claimant is to apply a
DCF analysis, including a discount rate that accounts for the fact that the plant is located
in Venezuela.*°>

With regard to the DCF calculation, Respondent made the following submissions.

bb) Discount Rate

Respondent submits that the discount rate calculated by Prof. Spiller would be "/ow even
for a company such as Norpro Venezuela operating in a mature economy." Respondent
argues that (i) Prof. Spiller deviated from the risk-free-rate suggested by Ibbotson/Morn-
ingstar for long-term projects, i.e., the 20-year US Treasury bond yield as of the valuation
date; (ii) he deviated from the general market risk premium (MRP) calculated by Ibbot-
son/Morningstar; and (iii) he "ignore[d] the empirical evidence establishing that the
CAPM tends to underestimate the cost of equity for financial assets," which is corrected

by the alpha coefficient.*”°

According to Respondent, the biggest difference between the experts’ estimates concerns
the applicable country risk premium. Respondent claims that this premium is "far higher"
than the 4.5% applied by Prof. Spiller, which in fact does not reflect Venezuelan country
risk but rather the default risk on US corporate bonds.*”” Respondent refers to the calcu-
lations of its experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores who primarily relied on the Country
Risk Rating Model (CRRM) compiled by Ibbotson/Morningstar and cross-checked their
results by using the so-called "bludgeon method" devised by Prof. Damodaran.*°*

While acknowledging that the valuation must exclude the impact of the actual expropri-

 

ation of the Plant, Respondent argues that this "should not be confused with the expropri-
ation risk inherent in any project from its very inception," which is part of the "normal
economic situation prevailing" prior to the announcement of the expropriation of the Plant
and therefore also a risk that a willing buyer would take into account in its assessment of

the purchase price it would be willing to pay for the Plant.*°

Respondent argues that the country risk premium must be based on the buyer's perception
of risk; the elimination of the risks inherent to an investment in Venezuela would result

ona spread of about 9%. Rejoinder, | 221; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, { 169.

308 Respondent submits that its experts used the same methodology to determine the appropriate discount rate for
both valuation dates. Counter-Memorial, { 259.

in "the use of a discount rate that a willing buyer would not use and derive a value that a
willing buyer would not pay, thereby granting Claimant a windfall that it could never
achieve in an arm's-length transaction." In Respondent's view, this would further be pu-
nitive to Venezuela and thus "impermissible under any theory of compensation in inter-

national law."*'°

In any event, Respondent claims that "there is no way to isolate, and thus quantify" the
risk of uncompensated expropriation. According to Respondent, Prof. Spiller did not pro-
pose any method to do so in his expert reports but argued only at the Hearing that one
could take the difference between the EMBI spread for Venezuela and his 4.5% country

risk premium.*!!

As to Claimant's emphasis during the Hearing on the 15% discount rate reflected in its 23
October 2006 DAC, Respondent notes that the significance and purpose of this rate re-
mains unclear and further argues that at that time, Venezuela's default risk was "at one of
its all-time lowest points," with the yield of its sovereign bonds being only 2.18% higher
than US Treasury bonds. At that point, Respondent submits, the 3% country risk premium
could have been justified. More importantly, however, Respondent emphasizes that
Claimant took Venezuelan default risk into account in its assessment of the country risk,
just like a buyer would in its assessment of an appropriate discount rate for determining
the fair market value of the Plant. In Respondent's view, there is then no reason for ex-

cluding such risk when such risk increased with the passage of time.*!”

cc) Future Cash Flows

Respondent submits that it is undisputed between the Parties that prior to the expropria-
tion Norpro Venezuela received only 27% of the profits, while the remaining 73% were
allocated to Claimant's US affiliate SGCP.*!? Consequently, Respondent rejects Prof.
Spiller's assumption that Norpro Venezuela would retain 100% of the profits as of the
valuation date. It claims that a willing buyer would not pay for 100% of the profits be-
cause it would not be acquiring the capabilities of SGCP and would not be willing to

Claimant was willing to invest in Venezuela at an internal rate of return of 26.4%. Therefore, Respondent argues
that, while still being 3% higher than Prof. Spiller's discount rate, the 15% discount rate is not relevant in this case.

transfer the profits it expects to earn through its own existing marketing, logistics and
distribution network.*!4

347. Respondent therefore refers to the assumption of its experts that a buyer of the Plant
would achieve "at the very most" 75% of the profits as Claimant itself concluded in its
transfer pricing study that the 25% portion of "marketing intangibles" was contributed
100% by SGCP.3'5

348. As to the bauxite price to be paid by Norpro Venezuela to CVG Bauxilum, Respondent
submits that there is no basis for Claimant's instruction to Prof. Spiller to reduce the
agreed price of USD 33.8 per MT to the original contract price, given that Norpro Vene-
zuela agreed to the increased price as long as there would be no further increase through-

out 2009. Therefore, Respondent instructed its experts to base their calculation on the

increased price, escalated by the US PPI-Commodities.*!°

349. With regard to the transportation costs, Respondent submits that Claimant's own budgeted
cost for transportation from Venezuela to Alice, Texas amount to EUR 110 (converted to
USD 154) per MT. According to Respondent, this figure is also supported by Claimant's
transfer pricing study.*!” Respondent further rejects Prof. Spiller's estimate for the ship-
ping costs within the US and claims that Claimant's budgeted cost and the Halliburton

SPA reflect a "significantly higher" cost, which is why its experts based their estimate on

the budgeted cost.*!*

350. In relation to the capital expenditures, Respondent agrees with Prof. Spiller's assumption
up to and including 2018 but argues that annual capital expenditures would significantly
increase “as the Plant aged and equipment reached the end of its useful life."*!° While

Prof. Spiller included only maintenance expenditures, Respondent claims that expendi-

314 Counter-Memorial, {| 200-202. See also Rejoinder, | 244. Respondent emphasizes that, while such a buyer
might achieve 100% of the revenues from the ultimate sale of the proppants, it would not benefit from 100% of
the profits because "a substantial portion of the profits " would be tied to the marketing, distribution and logis-
tics functions that were not part of the transfer from Claimant in consideration for the purchase price. Respond-

tures for "health and safety, technology or improvements to reduce breakdowns and pro-
cess disruptions" are also required to assume operation in perpetuity and therefore takes
the position that all four capexes as foreseen for the claimant's Fort Smith plant should be

included in the calculation.*°

In respect of the working capital, Respondent agrees with Prof. Spiller's calculation ex-
cept for the VAT credits. Respondent contends that as of 15 May 2010 Norpro Venezuela
had not even applied for the tax recovery certificates and claims that the recovery proce-
dure is usually a "/engthy and complex" process. Respondent submits that its experts
therefore assumed that the outstanding VAT credits as of 15 May 2010 would have been
monetized in 2013 and further VAT credits accumulated thereafter would have been mon-
etized on a two-year rolling basis and thus been part of working capital that a buyer would
not separately value.*?!

4. Respondent's Relief Sought

Respondent concludes that the Tribunal should declare that the expropriation of the plant
was lawful and award Claimant compensation based on Article 5(1) of the Treaty in the
amount of USD 9.5 million, the fair market value of the plant as of May 15, 2010, plus
pre-award simple interest at a rate equal to the rate of a three-month US Treasury Bill
plus 1.1 percentage points. The claims based on the bauxite price increase should be de-
clared inadmissible, or, if they were to be entertained, dismissed on the facts and the law.
All other claims should be dismissed on the facts and the law. The costs of these proceed-
ings incurred by Respondent (including legal fees and disembursements) should be de-
ducted from the amount of compensation awarded to Claimant.*”?

subparagraph 2 of the Treaty. Cf. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 137.

"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [...] and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute
consent in writing to submit to the Centre."

354. Article 8(2) of the Treaty provides:

"If such a dispute [between a national or a company of a Contracting
Party and the other Contracting Party, regarding an obligation of the
latter relating to an investment under the terms of the present Agree-
ment] cannot be settled within six months from the time it was raised by
either of the parties to the dispute, at the request of the national or the
company in q ion it shall be submitted to either the comy court
of the State in which the investment was made or to arbitration by the
International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID),
pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, signed in Washington on
March 18, 1965. This decision is the choice of the national or the com-
pany concerned. Once the decision has been made to pursue arbitra-
tion, the decision becomes final."?3

 

355. Pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the following four requirements have
to be satisfied: (i) there must be a legal dispute between the Parties; (ii) the dispute must
arise directly out of an investment; (iii) the Parties must be a Contracting State and a
national of another Contracting State; and (iv) both Parties must have given their consent
in writing to submit the dispute to ICSID.

356. There is no dispute between the Parties that all four requirements are met in the present
case.**4 First, there is a legal dispute between the Parties because Claimant seeks repara-
tion for Respondent's alleged breaches of Articles 5(1), 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty.*?°

357. Second, this dispute arises directly out of an investment within the meaning of Article
1(1) of the Treaty, which includes "all assets, such as the property rights and interests of

 

any nature" and, in particular, "[s]hareholdings [...] in companies incorporated in the

territory of one of the Contracting Parties," "rights in rem such as mortgages" and "all

entitlements having an economic value."**° In this case, Claimant submits that (i) it holds
99.99% of the shares in Norpro Venezuela, a company organized and existing under the

laws of Venezuela; (ii) it provided debt financing to Norpro Venezuela, which was se-
cured by a mortgage on Norpro Venezuela; and (iii) it held property, contractual rights
with local suppliers and rights pursuant to the law such as licenses and permits.*?” None
of these submissions was contested by Respondent. Therefore, the dispute between the
Parties arises directly out of Claimant's investment in Norpro Venezuela.

Third, Respondent does not dispute that, even though Venezuela denounced the ICSID

Convention on 24 January 2012,378

it was a Contracting State within the meaning of Ar-
ticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention for the purposes of these proceedings. Claimant notes
that the ICSID Convention entered into force for Venezuela on 1 June 1995 and Vene-
zuela was therefore a Contracting State at the time (i) it consented to ICSID Arbitration
under the Treaty on 2 July 2001; (ii) Claimant sent its notices of dispute to Respondent
on 4 July 2011 and 17 January 2012; and (iii) Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration
on 25 April 2012, given that Venezuela's denunciation of the ICSID Convention only
took effect on 25 July 2012.°7° Further, Claimant is a national, i.e., a juridical person
within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICISD Convention, of another Contracting
State because Claimant is a corporation incorporated and organized under the laws of

France, for which the ICSID Convention entered into force on 20 September 1967.°°°

Finally, both Parties gave their consent in writing to submit this dispute to ICSID. Re-
spondent' consent is comprised in Article 8(2) of the Treaty. The requirements of this
provision have also been satisfied: (i) The dispute was raised by a national or a company
of a Contracting Party to the Treaty (company incorporated in France) against the other
Contracting Party (Venezuela); (ii) a notice of dispute (4 July 2011) was sent at least six
months before submission of the dispute to arbitration (25 April 2012) and no amicable
settlement has been reached during that time period; and (iii) the dispute under the Treaty
has not been submitted to Venezuelan courts by the national or company.?*!

Claimant gave its consent in its notice of dispute dated 4 July 2011, which was, inter alia,
addressed to the President of Venezuela, and reiterated this consent in its second letter to
the President dated 17 January 2012.***

As a result, the Tribunal concludes that the requirements of Article 25(1) ICSID Conven-
tion have been satisfied and that it has jurisdiction to decide over the dispute submitted
to it.

ADMISSIBILITY

Respondent raises objections with regard to the admissibility of the following two claims
raised by Claimant in these proceedings: (i) that, by virtue of the increase of the bauxite
price that had initially been agreed upon in the Bauxite Contract between Claimant and
CVG Bauxilum, Respondent failed to accord to Claimant fair and equitable treatment
pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Treaty and to protect and secure Claimant's investment
pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Treaty (the "Bauxite Claims");** and (ii) that Respondent
acted "contrary to a particular agreement" within the meaning of Article 5(1) subpara-
graph 1 of the Treaty.**4

Bauxite Claims

a) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent submits that the Bauxite Claims are inadmissible. Even if Claimant could
establish that the bauxite prices were increased in breach of the Bauxite Contract, this
could not, in itself, give rise to the responsibility of Respondent under international law
given that it is not party to the Bauxite Contract.**> Respondent claims that Claimant is
unable to identify any legal instrument entered into with the State, or any relevant act on
the part of the State, on which it can base its Bauxite Claims.**°

In particular, Respondent contends that the price increases invoked by CVG Bauxilum
are not attributable to Respondent under the ILC Draft Articles.*?” Respondent argues
that CVG Bauxilum, which has a legal personality distinct from that of Respondent and
does not wield any executive power under Venezuelan law, cannot be considered as a
State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles. Respondent further
submits that CVG Bauxilum did not exercise governmental authority pursuant to Article
5 of the ILC Draft Articles because, while acting as a commercial company in the mining
sector for the benefit of Respondent, it neither possesses nor exercises governmental au-
thority when carrying out its activities.***

Finally, Respondent argues that CVG Bauxilum did not act on the instructions, or under
the direction or control, of Respondent within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Draft
Articles; even though CVG Bauxilum is ultimately subject to the administrative oversight

("tela") of MIBAM, this is not sufficient for establishing direct State control within the
meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.”

b) Summary of Claimant's Position

366. Claimant submits that the arguments raised by Respondent do not affect the admissibility
of the Bauxite Claims, but are rather related to the merits of the case. Claimant contends
that admissibility merely concerns "whether the claim, as presented, can or should be
resolved by an international tribunal, which otherwise has found jurisdiction."**° Claim-
ant emphasizes that its Bauxite Claims are not based on the Bauxite Contract as such, but
rather on Respondent's breaches of the Treaty, and are therefore "analytically distinct"
from any claim that Norpro Venezuela could have brought under the Bauxite Contract.*4!

 

367. Claimant refers to its position that during the negotiation of the Bauxite Contract, Vene-
zuela made it clear that "it controlled CVG Bauxilum and that all material decisions con-
cerning the conduct of CVG Bauxilum would be made at the ministerial level." Claimant
submits that its Bauxite Claims are based on the fact that CVG Bauxilum's conduct was
either sanctioned or could have been prevented by the competent ministry; therefore, they

are claims for breach of the Treaty.*47

c) The Tribunal's Analysis

368. On the admissibility level, the Tribunal's analysis is limited to the question whether "it
cannot be ruled out, at least prima facie," that the alleged conduct of Respondent with
respect to Claimant's rights under the Bauxite Contract is, "if proven," capable of falling
within the scope of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty.*47

369. The Tribunal notes that Respondent's objections to the admissibility of the Bauxite Claims
are related, to a certain extent, to the common and important distinction between treaty
claims and contract claims. This distinction is particularly relevant in cases where the
investor enters into contractual relations directly with the State; in these cases, the in-
vestor's contractual rights may very well fall within the scope of a bilateral investment
treaty. However, the same distinction may also play a role in case such a contractual re-
lationship has been entered into with a State-owned entity, as is the case here.

Tribunals in investment treaty disputes are often called upon to clearly distinguish be-
tween mere contract violations and treaty violations. In this regard, Respondent correctly
pointed to the holding of the tribunal in Bayindir v. Pakistan:

"[Blecause a treaty breach is different from a contract violation, the

Tribunal considers that the Claimant must establish a breach different

in nature from a simple contract violation, in other words one which

the State commits in the exercise of its sovereign power."***

While Claimant does contend in the present case that, inter alia, CVG Bauxilum was
acting in breach of the Bauxite Contract and that such conduct is attributable to Respond-
ent,**> it does not claim that the alleged breach of contract as such constituted, at the same
time, a breach of the Treaty. Claimant rather argues that Respondent had a monopoly over
the production and sale of bauxite in Venezuela, which is why Norpro Venezuela did not
have a choice but to accept the newly imposed terms.*“° In addition, Claimant claims that
Respondent made "specific promises" and "commitments" and thereby "created specific
expectations," which Claimant relied on in making its investments, and further claims
that Respondent "repudiated these expectations, failing to address [...] CVG Bauxilum’s
actions in raising the bauxite price."**"

Based on these allegations, Claimant contends that Respondent breached its obligations
under Article 3(1) of the Treaty (Fair and Equitable Treatment) and Article 3(2) of the
Treaty (Full Protection and Security).***

For the purpose of deciding on the admissibility of the Bauxite Claims, the Tribunal will
“accept pro tem the facts as alleged" by Claimant "to be true,"**? i.e., that Respondent
indeed made specific promises and commitments to Claimant with regard to the Bauxite
Contract, which went beyond general incentives offered in order to promote a general
investor-friendly environment. On this basis, the Tribunal finds that, prima facie, the al-
leged conduct of Respondent does fall within the scope of its obligations to ensure fair
and equitable treatment under Article 3(1) of the Treaty and to grant full protection and
security under Article 3(2) of the Treaty. Whether or not the Respondent in fact made any
such promises or commitments will be discussed in the merits section of the present de-

cision.

2. Claim Relating to Article 5(1) Subparagraph 1 of the Treaty

During the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submissions, Claimant argues that Respond-
ent was in breach not only of the Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty, but
also of subparagraph 1. Specifically, Claimant contends, first, that the expropriation was
not pursuant to a "measure" ("mesures"/"medidas") and, second, that it violated a "par-
ticular undertaking" (“engagement particulier"/"compromiso especial").>°

Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent submits that the claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty
should be dismissed. Respondent argues that Claimant never raised its "new, untimely,

 

theory" with regard to subparagraph | prior to the Hearing — neither in its Memorial, nor
in its Reply, nor during the pre-hearing conference or in any pre-hearing request. Re-
spondent contends that Claimant's change of position is therefore in conflict with Rule
31(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.**!

In particular, Respondent contests that this claim has been triggered by a change of posi-
tion in its Rejoinder and emphasizes that, already in its Counter-Memorial, it took the
position that the expropriation took place when the Decree was issued on 29 March 2011,
as Claimant recognized in its summary of the "Facts in Dispute" in its Reply.*>

b) Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant argues that its arguments relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty
were informed by the fact that, for the first time in its Rejoinder, Respondent raised the
argument "that what happened between May of 2010 and March of 2011 was not the

expropriation, and that the expropriation only occurred in [March] of 2011."*°

Claimant further claims that its claim is "neither new nor untimely" because Claimant
never limited its expropriation claim to the argument that there was a lack of compensa-
tion. Rather, Claimant had raised the argument that the expropriation was not carried out
in fair and equitable manner and failed to accord Claimant due process from the outset of
the proceedings.**+

Finally, Claimant argues that even if it had raised a new claim during the Hearing, Re-
spondent failed to establish "why this is problematic." According to Claimant, Rule 31(3)
of the ICSID Arbitration Rules "assumes some natural evolution of argument" in the
course of the proceedings. In addition, Claimant notes that Respondent had the oppor-
tunity to present its views in its opening statement and throughout the Hearing as well in
its two Post-Hearing Briefs.*>°

c) The Tribunal's Analysis

The Tribunal is aware that the provisions relating to written submissions contained in
Rule 31 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules are closely related to a party's fundamental pro-
cedural right to be heard. Rule 31(3) provides in this regard:

"A memorial shall contain: a statement of the relevant facts; a state-

ment of law; and the submissions. A counter-memorial, reply or rejoin-

der shall contain an admission or denial of the facts stated in the last

previous pleading; any additional facts, if necessary; observations con-

cerning the statement of law in the last previous pleading; a statement

of law in answer thereto; and the submissions."

In this case, each of the Parties claims that the other Party raised, at an advanced stage of
the proceedings, a new issue which was not part of the other Party's earlier submissions,
and that it should have the opportunity to duly respond to the new issue.

In order to give full effect to the Parties' procedural rights, the Tribunal suggested, at the
end of the Hearing, that there should be two rounds of post-hearing submissions.**° This
way, both Parties had the opportunity to react to what they considered to be a new position
of the other Party, and to respond to the other Party's reaction. The Tribunal also suggested
that there should be no fixed page limits for the post-hearing submissions so that each
Party could elaborate on the issues as they saw fit, but both Parties preferred to have, and
agreed on, page limits for both submissions.*°”

For this reason, the Tribunal finds that, even though it may have been rather late for
Claimant to raise a claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty at the Hear-
ing, both Parties had sufficient opportunity to react to, and elaborate on, the positions of
the other Party as part of their post-hearing submissions. Therefore, the Tribunal does not
consider it appropriate to reject this claim without considering whether it has legal merit.

In the following, the Tribunal will consider whether or not Respondent was in breach of
the Treaty. Claimant submits that Respondent committed breaches of

- Article 5(1) of the Treaty with respect to its obligations regarding expropria-
tion (1.);

- Article 3(1) of the Treaty with respect to its obligation to fair and equitable treat-
ment (2.); and

- Article 3(2) of the Treaty with respect to its obligation to grant full protection and
security (3.).

Expropriation (Article 5(1) of the Treaty)

Claimant submits that Respondent was in breach of the Article 5(1) subparagraph | of the
Treaty (a)) as well as subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the same provision (b)).

a) Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraph 1 of the Treaty
aa) Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant's argumentation with respect to its claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph
1 of the Treaty is twofold:

First, Claimant submits that the expropriation was not pursuant to a "measure." According
to Claimant, a "measure" of expropriation or nationalization within the meaning of Arti-
cle 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty has to consist of "any type of administrative, legis-
lative or judicial act, taken by any of the powers that form the Bolivarian Republic," and
that there was no such formal act in the present case until Respondent issued the Expro-
priation Decree in March 2011. According to Claimant, a State that takes property without
any legal instrument supporting such expropriation is not expropriating pursuant to a
measure, and thus not in accordance with any notion of due process.*°*

Second, Claimant contends that the expropriation of the plant was not in line with Re-
spondent's obligation under Article 3(1) of the Treaty to treat Claimant's investment fairly
and equitably and hence violated a "particular undertaking" ("engagement par-
ticulier"/"compromiso especial") within the meaning of Article 5(1) subparagraph | of
the Treaty.**? In particular, Claimant submits that Respondent "took the Plant in direct
violation of Saint-Gobain’s due process rights" and "without a measure of any kind es-
tablishing a legal framework for the expropriation or an effort to engage in good faith

negotiations concerning compensation." Claimant contends that the expropriation was

hence unlawful.*°

bb) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent submits that the claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty
is without legal merit. With regard to Claimant's argument relating to the term "measure,"
Respondent argues that the term "has a far broader meaning than that suggested by
Claimant" and alleges that even if, contrary to Respondent's position, President Chavez’
TV announcement were to constitute the expropriation, it would constitute a "measure"
under the Treaty and international law.*°!

 

Respondent further argues that the reference to a "particular agreement" ("engagement
particulier"/"compromiso especial") is “not intended to mean the Treaty itself, but rather
an agreement external to the Treaty." In this regard, Respondent notes that Claimant did
not cite any legal precedent for its position and emphasizes that in the sole case cited by
Claimant in this regard, the tribunal had to decide on a treaty provision, which — unlike
Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty — explicitly included the requirement that the
expropriation be "carried out under due process of law" as a condition of the lawfulness

of an expropriation.°

In support of its position, Respondent further refers to: (i) the use of the term "agreement"
(“accord"/"accuerdo") where the Treaty refers to itself; (ii) the distinct use of the term
“particular agreement" (“engagement particulier"/"compromiso particuliar") for an ex-
ternal agreement in Article 10 of the Treaty; and (iii) the language of other investment
treaties, which state explicitly that the expropriation has to be carried out in accordance
with other substantive provisions of the treaty in question.

cc) The Tribunal's Analysis

In deciding on this first claim for breach of the Treaty, the Tribunal will examine Article
5(1) subparagraph | of the Treaty in light of its wording and its context within the Treaty.
In the French and Spanish original versions, the provision reads as follows:

The English translation submitted by Claimant reads:

"The Contracting Parties shall not take any direct or indirect measures
to expropriate or nationalize or any other measures with the aim of
seizing investments belonging to nationals and companies of the other
Party, in their territory and in maritime area, except in the public in-
terest and provided that these measures are neither discriminatory, nor
contrary to a particular agreement."?°°

With regard to the first argument advanced by Claimant, the Tribunal is of the view that

the term "measures" (""mesures"/"medidas") of expropriation or nationalization referred

to in Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty does not in itself constitute any require-

ment as to the lawfulness of the expropriation or nationalization, but is rather meant to

include all acts or omissions by the State that could amount to expropriatory conduct. The

Tribunal agrees with the description given by the ICJ in the Fisheries Jurisdiction Case:
"[I]n its ordinary sense the word is wide enough to cover any acts, step

or proceedings, and imposes no particular limit on their material con-
tent or on the aim pursued thereby."*°7

As a result, the Tribunal considers that a breach of Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the
Treaty cannot result from a State's failure to act in the form of a "measure," but only from
a failure to observe the three substantive requirements of that subparagraph, i.e., that the

measure must be justified by a public purpose, be non-discriminatory and not be in con-
flict with any particular undertaking or agreement.

396. With respect to the meaning of the term "particular agreement" or "particular undertak-
ing" (“engagement particulier"/"compromiso especial"),*® the Tribunal is not convinced
by Claimant's interpretation pursuant to which the term includes undertakings both exter-
nal and internal to the Treaty. Pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, which
both Parties refer to in relation to the interpretation of the Treaty provisions, Article 5(1)
of the Treaty should "be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary mean-
ing to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and
purpose.">© In the Tribunal's view, the ordinary meaning of the attributes "particulier"
and "especial" in connnection with an "engagement" or “compromiso" entails a reference
to obligations arising from agreements distinct from, or external to, the Treaty.

397. As correctly pointed out by Respondent, this understanding is confirmed by the language
used in Article 10 of the Treaty (which forms part of the context of Article 5(1), in ac-
cordance with Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention):

While the Tribunal notes that the wording of Article 5(1) subparagraph | and that of Ar-
ticle 10 of the Treaty are not entirely identical in the Spanish version because Article 10
refers to "compromiso particular" instead of "compromiso especial," the wording of the
French version is indeed identical ("engagement particulier"). In the context of Article
10, these terms clearly refer to an agreement external to the Treaty, which applies to the
investment if the agreement contains more favorable provisions than the Treaty itself, the
Treaty being referred to as "présent accord" and "presente Convenio." In the Tribunal's
view, there is no reason in this case to assume that the Contracting Parties to the Treaty
intended to assign different meanings to the same (or in the Spanish text, very similar)
term in the two provisions.

Finally, Respondent correctly pointed out that Contracting States that wish to make the
lawfulness of an expropriation subject to the satisfaction of other substantive provisions
of the BIT, in particular the requirement to carry out the expropriation in accordance with
due process, usually include an explicit requirement to this effect in the expropriation
provision. For example, in the case cited by Claimant, Kardassopoulos v. Georgia, the
tribunal's finding was based on Article 13 of the Energy Charter Treaty, which states:

"Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any

other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or sub-

ject to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationaliza-

tion or expropriation [...] except where such Expropriation is: [...] (c)

carried under due process of law."*""

In the present case, the Contracting Parties did not include such a requirement in Article
5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty (or any other subparagraph or paragraph of Article 5);
thus, there is no indication that the contracting Parties nevertheless intended to make the
lawfulness of an expropriation subject to the compliance with due process. It rather ap-
pears that any breach of an investor's right to be accorded due process, which is included
in the FET standard (see in more detail below), was to be addressed within the context of
Article 3(1) of the Treaty, but was not meant to affect the lawfulness of the expropriation.

Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the term "particular agreement" or "particular under-
taking" (“engagement particulier"/"compromiso especial") does not include a reference
to other substantive provisions of the Treaty itself, but only to agreements, which are
distinct from the Treaty. Given that Claimant does not invoke a breach of any such agree-
£373

ment, apart from the Treaty provisions itsel the Tribunal concludes that Respondent

has not breached Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.

b) Breach of Article 5(1) Subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty

The Tribunal will now turn to the second claim for breach of the Treaty. It is Claimant's
position that Respondent violated its obligations under Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and
3 of the Treaty with respect to the requirement of prompt compensation and the specifi-
cation of the amount and method of payment. In its analysis, the Tribunal will first deter-
mine the precise scope and content of Respondent's Treaty obligations (aa)); the Tribunal
will then assess whether or not Repondent complied with these requirements (bb)) and
finally determine whether its finding has any impact on the lawfulness of the expropria-
tion (ce)).

The Scope of Respondent's Obligation to Pay 'Prompt'' Compensation and to Spec-
ify the "Amount and Method of Payment'' for Compensation

(@ Summary of Claimant's Position

It is Claimant's position that the requirements of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of
the Treaty must be accorded their plain meaning.*”* Claimant contends that the Treaty is
very specific about the requirement that an expropriation be accompanied by "prompt"
compensation, given that it provides that "the amount and method of payment for com-
pensation should be specified on the date of expropriation at the latest" and "payments
shall be made without delay. "375 Tn Claimant's view, this leaves no room for doubt as to

the interpretation of the prompt compensation requirement.*”°

Claimant refers to the decisions of other international tribunals in order to demonstrate
that the promptness requirement is a well-established principle of international law. For
example, in Norwegian Shipowners, the tribunal spoke of "the right of the claimants to
receive immediate and full compensation," holding that "full compensation should have
been paid, including loss of progress payments, etc., at the latest on the day of the effective
taking [...J."377 In Goldenberg, the tribunal held that, while international law authorizes
the State to interfere with private property when the public interest so requires, "it does
so on the condition sine qua non that fair payment shall be made for the expropriated or
requisitioned property as quickly as possible."*”*

Claimant therefore submits that payment of compensation should be "contemporaneous
with a taking" or should at least "follow it as quickly as possible," and that "the passage

of several months after the taking without the furnishing by the State of any real indication
that compensation would shortly be forthcoming would raise serious doubt that the State
intended to make prompt compensation at all."*”°

In particular, Claimant contends that the specification requirement is not met by the mere
existence of, or reference to, a certain expropriation procedure in domestic law.°*° Claim-
ant further rejects the proposition that "a sovereign’s obligation to make adequate provi-
sion for just compensation in due time" can be satisfied under international law "by its
mere willingness to discuss the possibility of a compromise. To so rule is to deprive the
obligation of any meaning."**!

In relation to the discussion of an empresa mixta arrangement, Claimant contends that
this "lacked sufficient details to be considered adequate negotiation of compensation
terms." Claimant refers to Mr. Millot's testimony during the Hearing that Claimant un-
derstood this to be a "suggestion" rather than a "concrete proposal" because it was un-
supported by documentation that Claimant never received, in particular as regards any
compensation for the loss of Claimant's 100% ownership in Norpro Venezuela.**”

 

(i

Summary of Respondent's Position

With regard to the specification requirement, it is Respondent's position that the provi-
sions contained in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty have to be read in
conjunction and should be interpreted to mean that "compensation shall be assessed so
that the amount is equal to the ‘actual value’ of the investments as of the date set forth in
the second sentence of the second paragraph of Article 5(1) and that as of the ‘date of
expropriation at the latest,’ the expropriating party shall acknowledge its obligation to

make payment in such equivalent amount and establish the modalities of payment."**°

Respondent contends that clauses such as Article 5(1) of the Treaty merely require that
"the law or the expropriation decision mention the criteria and procedures that will allow

to assess compensation."***

With regard to Claimant's interpretation of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the
Treaty that the precise figure constituting the "amount" must be determined on the date
an intention to expropriate is announced, Respondent makes two arguments. First, Re-
spondent refers to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention and alleges that asking for a
specified figure on the date of expropriation is "not a good faith interpretation and cannot
be correct, as it would establish an obligation that the Contracting States could not satisfy

except by pure chance." Respondent further points out that the Treaty does not require
that the State "must, before it announces an expropriation, engage in discussions with the
expropriated entity to obtain the facts necessary to determine the precise figure that
equates to the actual value of the assets in question" and that "without such information,

it would be impossible [...] to determine that figure in good faith."**

Second, Respondent contends that an interpretation as proposed by Claimant would lead
to "manifestly absurd or unreasonable" results and hence would conflict with Article 32
lit. b) of the Vienna Convention, as neither French nor Venezuelan expropriation law
requires compensation to be determined at the time the expropriation process is initiated
— which would place each of the Contracting States in breach of their Treaty obliga-

tions.**°

Against this background, Respondent suggests what is, in its view, more reasonable in-
terpretation of the word "amount," which does not refer to a "precise dollar or Euro fig-
ure, but rather to the required concept (i.e., a ''sum [...] equal to the actual value of the
investments')."°°7

With respect to the promptness requirement, Respondent submits that neither the case law
cited by Claimant nor, by its clear terms, Article 5(1) of the Treaty require the State to
pay compensation to the investor on the date of the expropriation. While subparagraph 2
provides that "[a]// measures of expropriation which could be taken must result in pay-
ment of a prompt and adequate compensation," it is only subparagraph 3, which requires
that, after compensation has been determined, "payments shall be made without delay."**
In determining whether or not payment of "prompt and adequate compensation" is made
"without delay," "the particularities of each national legislation, the eventual delays
caused by internal remedies, and the specificity of each situation" are to be taken into
account.**? Further, Respondent argues that it should be taken into consideration whether

The Tribunal has considered all arguments made by the Parties in their submissions, in

The English translation from the French text submitted by Claimant reads as follows:

"All measures of expropriation which could be taken must result in pay-
ment of a prompt and adequate compensation. The sum of this compen-
sation should be equal to the actual value of the investments concerned,
and must be assessed in relation to the normal economic situation pre-
vailing before any threat of expropriation was of public knowledge.
The amount and method of payment for compensation should be speci-
fied on the date of expropriation at the latest. This compensation is in-
deed realizable, payments shall be made without delay and shall be
freely transferable. The compensation will accrue interest calculated at
the appropriate market interest rate until the date of payment."*?

The Tribunal notes that the Treaty requires not only the payment of "prompt" compensa-
tion, but according to the unusually strict wording of subparagraph 3, that the amount for
compensation ("[c]ette indemnité, son montant'/"[e]sa indemnizacién, su monto") be
specified — or more precisely: fixed ("fixés"/"fijados") — on the date of expropriation at
the latest. The ordinary meaning of the language used in subparagraph 3 suggests that the
expropriating State indeed has to indicate a specified figure constituting the amount of
compensation at the time of the expropriation; there is no indication that the term
"amount" ("montant"/"monto") refers only to a certain concept or method of calculation.
The sole reference to "method" (""modalités"/"modalidades") in subparagraph 3 is made
with respect to "payment" ("versement"/"pago"), implying that "payment of a prompt and

le c ion" ("pai d'une ind ité prompte et adéquate"/"pago de una

q if

 

pronta y adecuada indemnizaci6n") as referred to in subparagraph 2 does not require
payment to be made to the investor on the very date of the expropriation.

While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that subparagraph 3 has to be read in con-
junction with subparagraph 2, which indeed provides more details as to the calculation of
the compensation ("d'une indemnité prompte et adéquate dont le montant [...]"/"una
pronta y adecuada indemnizacion cuyo monto [...]"), this connection does not imply in
any way that the term "amount" ("montant"/"monto") in subparagraph 3 has to be inter-
preted restrictively in terms of requiring only an acknowledgment of the applicable con-
cept of compensation. Rather, subparagraph 3 contains a more precise specification fur-
ther to the widely used term "prompt" ("prompte"/"pronta") in subparagraph 2.

In light of the unambiguous wording and structure of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3
of the Treaty, the Tribunal finds that, prima facie, subparagraph 3 required Respondent
to specify a precise figure constituting the "amount" ("montant"/"monto") of compensa-
tion at the time of the expropriation. Subsequently, the amount of compensation as fixed

423.

(“fixés"/"fijados") on the date of expropriation had to be paid "without delay" ("sans re-
tard"/"sin retraso"). Only if both of these requirements were satisfied, the compensation
could be considered "prompt" within the specific meaning intended by the Contracting
Parties in to Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 of the Treaty.

As indicated above, Respondent raised objections to this interpretation of Article 5(1) of
the Treaty. The Tribunal considers, however, that none of these objections is compelling.
In particular, to require the State to specify a certain figure constituting the amount of
compensation on the date of the expropriation neither contravenes the principle of good
faith interpretation as set out in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, nor does it lead
to "manifestly absurd or unreasonable" results within the meaning of Article 32 lit. b) of
the Vienna Convention.

The requirement of fixing the exact amount of compensation on the date of expropriation
is not an absurd ambition, as Respondent intends to demonstrate. While the Tribunal
agrees with Respondent that the date of the expropriation (i.e., the formal expropriation
decision and/or seizure of the asset) does not (necessarily) correspond to the date on

which the expropriation procedure is initiated,***

this does not mean that the State may
de facto take the property of the investor in the meantime and thereby circumvent the
provision of the Treaty. In many jurisdictions, including France and Venezuela as Re-
spondent correctly pointed out, the formal expropriation decision and the taking of the
asset do not commence but rather occur only at the end of the expropriation procedure.
In the course of such an expropriation procedure, the State usually asserts and ensures
that the requirements of a lawful expropriation are met, including the verification of a
sufficient public purpose as well as the fixation of an adequate amount for compensation,
based on a proper valuation of the asset.

In the Tribunal's view, it is apparent that the drafters of Article 5(1) subparagraph 3 of the
Treaty indeed envisaged such a design of the expropriation procedure as it is in place in
both Contracting States. This does not mean, however, that the term "amount" refers only
to the concept to be applied in the course of such an expropriation procedure, but rather
that the expropriation procedure has to be carried out prior to the taking of the asset.

The fact that the Treaty does not provide for detailed procedural rules as to how the ex-
propriating State shall obtain the facts necessary to determine the precise figure to be
fixed on the date of the expropriation does not conflict with the proposed interpretation
of Article 5(1) of the Treaty. Subparagraphs 2 and 3 merely stipulate the fundamental
requirements, which have to be met in case of an expropriation. The Treaty is not designed
to establish a detailed expropriation procedure. Rather, it is up to the Contracting States

427.

to ensure that the expropriation proceedings are conducted in conformity with the funda-
mental Treaty requirements.

In this regard, the Tribunal is of the view that it does not have to examine whether Vene-
zuelan law actually implements a standard expropriation procedure as set out in Article
S(1) of the Treaty. First, Claimant has not raised a claim that the Expropriation Law does
not conform to the requirements of the Treaty. In addition, any agreement in bilateral
investment treaties would be redundant if the Parties were only to agree on protection
standards which are already part of their respective legal systems. Interpreting Article
S(1) of the Treaty as providing stricter expropriation standards than the Venezuelan Ex-
propriation Law (and possibly also the French equivalent) would therefore not produce
"manifestly absurd or unreasonable" results within the meaning of Article 32 lit. b) of
the Vienna Convention.

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the compensation requirements set out in Article
5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 required the Respondent to specify a precise figure constitut-
ing the amount of compensation on the date of the expropriation.

bb) Compliance with, or breach of, the Compensation Requirements

Whether or not Respondent complied with the requirements set out in Article 5(1) sub-
paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty depends, to a certain extent, on the date on which the
expropriation of the plant took place, i.e., the date of expropriation within the meaning of
subparagraph 3. This question will hence be examined first (i). On this basis, Respond-
ent's conduct will then be assessed (ii).

(@) Date of Expropriation of the Plant

The Parties’ positions differ as to the date on which the expropriation of the plant oc-
curred. In particular, it is in dispute whether the expropriation was effected only once the
Expropriation Decree was formally issued or whether the takeover of the plant on 15 May
2010 already amounted to an expropriation within the meaning of the Treaty. Although
the Parties exclusively deal with this issue as a matter of facts, it appears that it also in-
volves questions of law.

(1) Summary of Claimant's Position

It is Claimant's position that the expropriation with respect to the plant was effected on
15 May 2010. Claimant submits that the takeover following President Chavez’ announce-
ment and the subsequent active management of the plant by PDVSA amounted to an

expropriation within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty.*°°

Claimant submits that, following the one-day takeover of the plant on 24 March 2010, it
was President Chavez’ announcement that caused local workers to take over the plant on
15 May 2010, the effect of which was to force out Norpro Venezuela’s management.
Further, Claimant submits that there were politicians among those who effected the plant
takeover — National Assemblyman Angel Marcano, the President of the Sub-commission
on Basic Industries, and Representative Asdrtibal Lépez, the President of the Commission
on Social Development — acting on behalf of the State and pursuant to the instructions of
the President. Therefore it was President Chavez who practically "commanded the take-
over of the Plant by union members and sympathizers" on 15 May 2010.*°° As Claimant
never regained control of its investment after that date, the Expropriation Decree pub-
lished on 29 March 2011 simply formally notified what the Government had already ef-

fected.*””

With respect to the status of the plant after these events, Claimant contends that PDVSA.
took control over the plant in order to "coordinate the expropriation process."*** In this
context, Claimant refers to various circumstances of PDVSA's occupation of the plant,
including inter alia:

- documents authored by PDVSA reflecting that PDVSA was carrying out the ongoing
expropriation process on behalf of Respondent, in particular the minutes of meetings

between PDVSA and Norpro Venezuela dated 2 and 8 June 2010 which were entitled

- PDVSA's efforts to get the plant back into operation, e.g., its attempt to ready the

plant to produce so-called green proppants.*°!

431. Claimant therefore contests Respondent's submission that PDVSA stepped in as a "care-
taker" and adds that, if that had actually been the case, PDVSA should have returned the
plant to Claimant. In Claimant's view, the burden should not be on the foreign company
after having "witnessed the President's order and been denied access to its property, to

do more in order to preserve its rights."**

432. Finally, Claimant emphasizes that it constantly asserted its rights with regard to the plant,
i.e., that it attempted to re-enter the plant but was denied access, as evidenced by the
judicial inspections it initiated on 17 May 2010 and again on 5 August 2010 as well as
the letters that Norpro Venezuela's President sent to PDVSA's General Counsel on 18
November 2010 and to the President of PDVSA Industrial on 25 April 2011.4

(2) Summary of Respondent's Position

433. Respondent submits that the date of expropriation within the meaning of Article 5(1) of
the Treaty was 29 March 2011, i.e., the date of the issuance of the Expropriation Decree,
which triggered the procedures under the Venezuelan Expropriation Law.*™ In response
to Claimant's assertions with respect to the takeover of the plant on 15 May 2010 and the
events thereafter, Respondent contends, first, that it was the labor union SINPROTRAC,
not the State, which occupied the Claimant's plant both on 24 March and on 15 May 2010,
and, second, that PDVSA's presence at the plant thereafter was a "responsible and neces-
sary action pending the expropriation decree to assure the safety and security of the
plant" after Norpro Venezuela’s management had effectively abandoned it.*°>

434. With regard to the first point, Respondent denies that there was an intrinsic causal link

between President Chavez! "announcement" and the takeover of the plant. Respondent
emphasizes that it was union discontent, which caused Norpro Venezuela’s name to ap-
pear in the Plan Guayana Socialista 2009-2019, ultimately leading to the proposal that
Norpro Venezuela pass to State control, which President Chavez read live on television
on 15 May 2010. Moreover, Respondent contends that it was actually a phone call from
shift workers at the plant to SINPROTRAC’s leadership reporting that Plant management
was removing laptops and documents from the premises, which prompted union officials
and Norpro Venezuela’s ex-workers to act on 15 May 2010. Against this background,

438.

Respondent argues that the 15 May 2010 plant takeover cannot be considered as an act of
the State.‘

Furthermore, Respondent contests Claimant's allegations that certain individuals among
those that effected the plant takeover were actually acting on behalf or under the instruc-
tions of Respondent. Respondent argues that the mere fact that politicians sympathetic to
the plight of the workers were present does not mean that Respondent itself took over the

plant.*°”

With respect to the second point, i.e., PDVSA's presence on the plant after the events of
15 May 2010, Respondent maintains that PDVSA's presence prior to the publication of
the expropriation decree was arranged for the purpose of ensuring plant safety and stabil-
ity, as a "caretaker." Respondent contends that Norpro Venezuela effectively abandoned
the plant after 15 May 2010, and that the plant was "in the hands of the union and the
workers who took over on May 15, without supervision." Respondent asserts that these
were legitimate grounds for concern regarding worker safety and the proper operation of
the plant’s equipment.*°*

In this context, Respondent emphasizes that Claimant neither challenged the legal foun-
dation of PDVSA's presence nor did it demand return of the plant or request access to it
after 15 May 2010.*” In particular, Respondent contends that "none of the other letters
that were sent on May 17, 2010 or thereafter demanded the return of the Plant," and that
Claimant never raised such a claim during the meetings of 30 August 2010 and of 14
October 2010 between Claimant and PDVSA. It is therefore Respondent's position that
"PDVSA Industrial was at the Plant because Norpro Venezuela was not present and the

Plant posed risks to the workers and community."*'°

At the same time, Respondent does not contest that, in the aftermath of 15 May 2010,
"there was a 'process of nationalization’ to the extent that, as everyone recognized, the
Plant had not been expropriated but that it would be transferred to State control in the
future." Respondent submits that the Parties also recognized (i) that a formal expropria-
tion decree was being drafted at that time; (ii) that the decree was supposed to mark the
starting point of the expropriation procedure under Venezuelan law; and (iii) that the Par-

ties would consider, in the meantime, alternatives to expropriation, including the for-
mation of a mixed company, with PDVSA as a majority shareholder and the Claimant
holding a minority stake.*!!

It is Respondent's position that this ongoing nationalization process was not in conflict
with PDVSA's "caretaker" role. Respondent points out that PDVSA had "instructions
from the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to carry out the transfer of
Norpro to State control," but "until the publication of the Decree, it may not act or inter-
vene in Norpro. Its presence at the plant is in response to the necessity to enter into pos-
session formally, once the Decree is published."**

(3) The Tribunal's Analysis

Before addressing the individual circumstances of the case related to the events of 15 May
2010 (b) and thereafter (c), the Tribunal wishes to recall the legal standard as to whether
and when an "expropriation" within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty has oc-
curred (a).

Legal Standard as to Whether and When an "'Expropriation"' Has Occurred

As the tribunal in SD Myers v. Canada noted, the term "expropriation" has to be inter-
preted "in light of the whole body of state practice, treaties and judicial interpretations
of that term in international law cases." The tribunal went on to find that, in general,

"the term ‘expropriation’ carries with it the connotation of a ‘taking’ by
a governmental-type authority of a person’s ‘property’ with a view to
transferring ownership of that property to another person, usually the
authority that exercised its de jure or de facto power to do the 'tak-
ing’"43
These considerations are confirmed, for example, by the tribunal in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,
which described (direct) expropriation as "resulting from a deliberate formal act of tak-

ing"*'* and referred to the reasoning of the tribunal in Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine,

+11 Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, | 61. Emphasis in the original.

"PDVSA Industrial, S.A. ('PDVSA') mencioné que ha recibido instrucciones precisas del Sr. Presidente de
la Repiiblica Bolivariana de Venezuela de llevar a cabo la estatizacién de Norpro. [...] PDVSA informé
que mientras no se haya publicado el Decreto, no puede actuar o intervenir en Norpro. Su presencia en la
planta corresponde a la necesidad de prepararse para la futura toma formal de posesién, una vez que se
realice la publicacién del Decreto."

which in turn stated that a direct expropriation is characterized by a "transfer [of the in-

vestor's] proprietary rights in its investment to the State or to a third party."*">

Against this background, the term "expropriation" is clearly characterized by a number
of elements, including: (i) the act of a State; (ii) in relation to a person's property; (iii)
consisting in a de jure or de facto taking of the property; and (iv) to the benefit of the
State or of a third party.

There is no dispute between the Parties as to the applicable standard with regard to the
definition of the legal term "expropriation," as they did not deal with this issue in their
submissions. On the contrary, the Parties agree that, at some point, Claimant was expro-
priated within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty. Rather, the Parties’ disagreement
relates to the exact point in time at which the expropriation occurred.

With respect to the elements of an expropriation referred to above in paragraph 443,
Claimant contends that all those criteria were already fulfilled when the plant was taken
over on 15 May 2010 or, at least, shortly thereafter.*!® Respondent, in contrast, argues
that: (i) the takeover on 15 May 2010 was not an act of State; and (ii) the subsequent
occupation of the plant by PDVSA was not a taking of the asset to the benefit of Respond-
ent but rather a compelling necessity imposed on Respondent by Claimant's abandonment
of the plant, which required PDVSA's presence in order to restore and ensure safety on
the plant, as a "caretaker," not as the "owner" of the plant.*!7 In this context, Respondent
emphasizes that PDVSA had instructions "not [to] act or intervene in Norpro" ("no puede
actuar o intervenir en Norpro").*'* In conclusion, it is Respondent's position that the cri-
teria of an "expropriation" were not fulfilled until the expropriation decree was formally
issued on 29 March 2011.41?

In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal will now consider the evidence presented by the
Parties and determine whether or not the conduct of Respondent before 29 March 2011
amounted to an "expropriation" within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty.

Takeover on 15 May 2010 Following President Chavez' "Expropriation Directive"

With regard to President Chavez' announcement of 15 May 2010 and the subsequent take-
over of the plant carried out by members of the SINPROTRAC union, the Tribunal con-
siders that this takeover as such cannot be attributed to Respondent.

+19 Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, note 187.

448. It is uncontested by Claimant that the plant takeover was not directly carried out by organs

of the State in their official capacity but rather "by union members and sympathizers."*”°
At the same time, it is a well-established principle under international law that, in general,
the conduct of private persons or entities is not attributable to the State. This general
principle is clearly reflected, inter alia, in Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles which states
that, as an exception from that principle, the

"conduct of a person or group of persons shall [only] be considered an

act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons

is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control

of, that State in carrying out the conduct."*!

449. The Tribunal considers it plausible that there was a certain causal link between President
Chavez' TV announcement on 15 May 2010 and the plant takeover. As Mr. Eduardo Ron-
d6n testified, the "members of the SINPROTRAC union" who took over the plant on 15
May 2010 "came directly from the event at which President Chavez had spoken."*?? While
the takeover may have further been triggered by Norpro Venezuela management's re-
moval of documents and computers from the plant and the tensions between the manage-

23 the Tribunal is of the view that the union members

ment of the plant and the unions,
and sympathizers would most probably not have taken over the plant on 15 May 2010 if
President Chavez had not stated on this very day that the plant would eventually be
handed over to PDVSA. The President's announcement of this prospect therefore appears
to have been conditio sine qua non of (and therefore a causal factor in relation to) the

plant takeover.

450. Plain causality, however, does not establish State responsibility under international law.
Conduct of private persons can be attributed to the State only if there exists "a specific
factual relationship between the person or entity engaging in the conduct and the
State."*”4 The Tribunal is of the view that there was no such specific factual relationship
between President Chavez’ announcement and the takeover of the plant carried out by
union members and sympathizers.

451.

During the broadcast on 15 May 2010, President Chavez read out and approved a number
of proposals prepared by the Plan Guayana Socialista working groups, an association of

unions in the Guayana region.*?° One of these recommendations was related to Norpro
Venezuela. President Chavez read out and approved this proposal as follows:

"Discuss with PDVSA the purchase of the Proppants produced and

commercialized by the company Norpro Venezuela, a product produced

with Bauxite, Cornstarch and water, used for mud and drilling. It is

suggested here [in the document] that should it become necessary, this

company should become state-controlled and transferred to the hands

of PDVSA. Let the company Norpro Venezuela become state controlled

and transfer it to the hands of Petréleos de Venezuela."*°

Without context, the President's statement "Estaticese la empresa Norpro de Venezuela y

"427 could indeed be understood as an invita-

pdsese a manos de Petréleos de Venezuela
tion, or even a command, addressed to all listeners, including the members of the union
and sympathizers, to take over the plant. Taking into account the aforementioned circum-
stances, however, it appears that the language used by President Chavez was meant to
express and emphasize his general approval and affirmation of the working groups’ pro-
posals. President Chavez' statements, including the approval of the union proposal related
to the nationalization of Norpro Venezuela and "similar announcements regarding other

foreign-owned businesses,"8

implied a promise to the people that the State would na-
tionalize the businesses referred to in the statement in the future; the President did not,
however, actually give specific orders or instructions for an immediate physical takeover

of the plant.

Considering the foregoing, President Chavez did not empower the unions to take over the
businesses concerned with governmental authority by virtue of his announcements. More-
over, even though members of the SINPROTRAC union may have actually taken Presi-

dent Chavez "at his word, 429

the Tribunal considers that they did not act "on the instruc-
tions of, or under the direction or control of President Chavez within the meaning of

Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.

The fact that national and/or local politicians were sympathizing with the union members
and may have been participating in the takeover of 15 May 2010 is not sufficient in itself
to establish Respondent's responsibility for these actions. Assuming that the individuals
referred to by Claimant actually did participate in the takeover of 15 May 2010,*° the
Tribunal finds that there is not sufficient evidence that they were acting on behalf, or
under the instructions, of Respondent. Moreover, as to the presence of the Venezuelan
National Guard, which was, as Claimant contends, involved in the occupation of the plant
on and after 15 May 2010,**! the Tribunal cannot exclude that it was present at the plant
"in order to preserve order and public safety," as Respondent asserts.*°?

PDVSA's Conduct and Presence on the Plant after 15 May 2010

The Tribunal is convinced, however, that the subsequent conduct of PDVSA and its pres-
ence on the plant after 15 May 2010 did amount to an "expropriation" within the meaning
of Article 5(1) of the Treaty. In particular, the Tribunal finds that, first, by means of the
conduct of the State-owned PDVSA, the Respondent took effective control of the plant
on 15 May 2010 or shortly thereafter (aa). Second, the Tribunal holds that PDVSA's con-
duct constituted a taking of the plant to the benefit of Respondent as required by the term
"expropriation" within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty; the Tribunal is not con-
vinced by Respondent's argumentation that there was no taking of the plant to the benefit
of the State because PDVSA was merely acting as a "caretaker" (bb).

Respondent's Effective Control of the Plant

With regard to the first point, the Tribunal finds that, by means of its conduct after the
plant takeover of 15 May 2010 carried out by the members of the SINPROTRAC union,
PDVSA acknowledged and adopted the union's actions as its own. On the basis of the
applicable principles of customary international law on State responsibility as reflected
in Article 11 of the ILC Draft Articles, the plant takeover on 15 May 2010 therefore has
to be considered as an act of Respondent. In any event, PDVSA took effective control
over the plant and started the expropriation process shortly after 15 May 2010, as con-
firmed by its internal memoranda and reports of early June 2010.

Attribution of PDVSA's Conduct to Respondent

Before examining PDVSA's conduct relating to the plant more closely, the Tribunal notes
that, although PDVSA is a State-owned company with distinct legal personality, its con-
duct is attributable to Respondent pursuant to Article 5 of the ILC Draft Articles, which
states that the

"conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under

article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise

elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of

the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting

in that capacity in the particular instance."*°

Both in its alleged function as a "caretaker" and in its capacity as supervisor and promoter
of the nationalization of the plant, PDVSA was vested with governmental authority. This
is not contested by Respondent; on the contrary, Respondent emphasizes in the context
of the negotiations that took place in late 2010 that PDVSA "had been instructed to carry
out the transition of the Plant to a State-controlled operation."**+ This is further con-
firmed by PDVSA's contemporaneous statement during the meeting on 30 August 2010
that "it had received specific instructions from the President of the Bolivarian Republic

of Venezuela to carry out the transfer of Norpro to State control."*>

In an internal memorandum prepared by PDVSA, entitled "Situacién actual del proceso
de estatizacién empresa Norpro de Venezuela, C.A. (Norpro)" dated 2 June 2010, refer-
ence was also made to the instructions of the President:

"En fecha Martes 25 de Mayo, personal de PDVSA bajo instrucciones

de la Gerencia General EyP Divisién Oriente y en el marco del orde-

namiento emitido por el Comandante Presidente de la Reptiblica, se

presento en las instalaciénes de la empresa NORPRO Venezuela C.A.

con miras a iniciar la fase de levantamiento y verificacién de toda la

informacion asociada a dicha empresa.

NORPRO Venezuela,C.A., el equipo multidisciplinario de PDVSA In-
dustrial, S.A. por instrucciones de nuestro Ministro-Presidente. "436

The Tribunal is of the view that in light of PDVSA's undisputed mandate from the Presi-
dent of Venezuela to carry out the nationalization of Norpro Venezuela, there should and
cannot be a distinction between PDVSA's conduct aimed at carrying out its mandate and

conduct that was possibly aimed at ensuring the safety of workers and maintenance of the
equipment at the plant in the meantime. Rather, all of PDVSA's actions with regard to the
plant can and have to be attributed to Respondent.

Adoption of the Union's Actions by PDVSA as its Own

As arule of customary international law, laid down in Article 11 of the ILC Draft Articles,
"[clonduct which is not attributable to a State" at the time of its commission "shall nev-
ertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent
that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own."**" In contrast
to cases of mere State support, endorsement or general acknowledgment of a factual sit-
uation created by private individuals, attribution under this rule requires that the State

clearly and unequivocally "identifies the conduct in question and makes it its own.""*?8

In the present case, PDVSA has acknowledged and adopted the plant takeover of 15 May
2010 carried out by union members as its own. In a number of internal notes and reports,
PDVSA made clear that the union's plant takeover was not only in line with Respondent's
intentions with regard to the expropriation of the plant, but was subsequently made an
integral part of the process of nationalizing Norpro Venezuela within the framework of
the "Plan Guayana Socialista" to be implemented by the "Ejecutivo Nacional," i.e., the
national executive power.**? The above referenced internal memorandum of 2 June 2010
contains a chronology of the steps within the course of the nationalization of the Norpro
plant, including President Chavez’ "order" of 15 May 2010 and the subsequent plant take-
over:

of the Plan Guayana Socialista by Respondent can be found, in particular, in:

- a preliminary report prepared by PDVSA's "Comisién de Evaluacién" dated May

2010 on the assessment of the current situation of Norpro Venezuela ("Evaluacién

- PDVSA's "Diagnostic of the Current Situation and Restructuring Plan" dated June

- a memorandum from PDVSA to Respondent's Minister of Energy and Petroleum
dated 9 June 2010 on the current situation and the strategic plan for the administrative
and operational control of Norpro Venezuela ("Diagndéstico Situacion Actual y el Plan

464. In view of these facts, the Tribunal concludes that PDVSA built upon the situation created
by the union members in order to carry out the nationalization process as "ordered" ("or-
deno") by President Chavez on 15 May 2010. After the plant takeover of 15 May 2010,
PDVSA was able, without any disturbance, to assess the current situation of the plant and
to determine how it could be restructured and operated by PDVSA.**° Respondent further
acknowledges that, in June and July 2010, PDVSA established "a permanent presence,
as it had been assigned responsibility for ensuring Plant safety and stability pending the

determination of the precise mechanism and timing by which State control of the Plant

was to be achieved."*“7

465. According to Respondent's witness Mr. Rondon, later in October 2010, PDVSA installed
Mr. Angel Salvarrfa as Plant General Manager, and Mr. Salvarria "reorganized the su-
pervisory structure which had been in place at the Plant since the union takeover, and
began readying the Plant to re-start production"; finally, in November 2010, plant work-
ers officially became employees of PDVSA.““*

466. While Respondent may not have anticipated or intended that the plant would be taken
over by the members of the SINPROTRAC union on 15 May 2010, it is apparent that
PDVSA immediately availed itself of this situation for the purpose of carrying out the
nationalization process, thereby acknowledging and adopting the union members' con-
duct as its own. In any event, even if PDVSA's conduct were not to be considered as an
acknowledgment and adoption of the union's plant takeover as its own action, Respondent
effectively took control of the plant in June and July 2010 when it established "a perma-
nent presence" at the plant, as Respondent acknowledges.” In the Tribunal's view, the 2
June 2010 memorandum prepared by PDVSA, entitled "Situacién actual del proceso de
estatizacién empresa Norpro de Venezuela, C.A. (Norpro),"*® as well as the 4 June 2010
prepared by PDVSA's "Comisién de Evaluacion", entitled "Informe de avance ‘Restruc-
turacién empresa Norpro’,"**' confirm that the expropriation process started at least
shortly after 15 May 2010.

(bb) Nature and Purpose of Respondent's Presence at the Plant

467. With regard to the second point, the Tribunal notes that a State's de facto control of assets
does not necessarily entail expropriation. In this context, Respondent maintains that
PDVSA's presence at the plant was arranged for the purpose of ensuring plant safety and
stability, as a "caretaker," not as an owner.**? Furthermore, Respondent contends that,
although PDVSA was instructed at the same time "fo carry out the transfer of Norpro to
State control," it was not allowed to "act or intervene in Norpro" ("no puede actuar o
intervenir en Norpro") until the publication of the formal expropriation decree.*°? How-
ever, as the reasoning relating to the plant takeover above indicates, the Tribunal finds
that PDVSA actually did, in Respondent's own words, "act" and "intervene in Norpro"

and hence took control of the plant, not as a "caretaker," but to the benefit of Respondent,
thereby excluding Norpro Venezuela as the owner of the plant.

In its defense, Respondent maintains that PDVSA's presence at the plant was aimed at

"ensuring Plant safety and stability,"**

more specifically "the safety and security of the
personnel and the assets" at the plant.*°> Respondent refers in particular to the "swbstan-
tial" and "escalating tension" between Norpro Venezuela and union representatives and
to the "industrial action" that ultimately resulted in the takeover on 15 May 2010.*°° Fur-
ther, Respondent submits that the "operation of the Plant without proper supervision"
posed a substantial "risk to the safety of Plant personnel" and emphasizes that the "dan-
gers associated with the Plant" were recognized by both the Norpro management and the
French Embassy.**” Most importantly, Respondent contends that the Norpro management
"abandoned" the plant on 15 May 2010, leaving it in the hands of the union, and claims
that Claimant "never attempted to regain possession" or "be granted access to the Plant"
and also never claimed after 15 May 2010 that PDVSA's presence was "without legal
foundation."**

While the temporary occupation of an asset for reasons of public safety does not amount
to an "expropriation" within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal finds
that the taking of Norpro Venezuela's plant by Respondent was essentially carried out for
reasons connected to the impending expropriation process.

As stated above in (aa), the taking of the plant on or after 15 May 2010 was made an
integral part of the undisputed "process of nationalization"*® of Norpro Venezuela within
the framework of the "Plan Guayana Socialista" to be implemented by the national ex-
ecutive power.‘ Within this framework, it was upon PDVSA "to carry out" the nation-
alization of Norpro ("de llevar a cabo la estatizacién de Norpro").°! The Tribunal finds
that carrying out this task was the main purpose of PDVSA's presence on the plant and
outweighed any other purposes, including safety reasons.

Most importantly, the Tribunal refers to the numerous internal memoranda and reports
prepared by PDVSA on the assessment of the current economic situation of the plant and

on determining how the plant could be restructured and operated by PDVSA in the fu-
ture,“° including inter alia assessments of the plant's inventory, payment obligations and
equipment and its overall financial situation.*® In the Tribunal's view, this work was not
the conduct of a mere "caretaker."

472. The purpose of PDVSA's presence on the plant after 15 May 2010 was also reflected by
certain changes in the appearance of the plant and its personnel. By August 2010, the
PDVSA flag was flying together with the Venezuelan flag over the plant and the workers
were wearing PDVSA uniforms.“ As detailed above in (aa), later in October 2010,
PDVSA's Angel Salvarria was installed as Plant General Manager and "reorganized the
supervisory structure which had been in place at the Plant since the union takeover, and
began readying the Plant to re-start production." In November 2010, plant workers offi-

cially became employees of PDVSA. Finally, between November 2010 and March 2011,
“after operations re-started, the Plant produced and stockpiled green proppants."*°°
Again, these measures are not typical for ensuring safety and stability; they illustrate that
PDVSA was making the plant ready for operation and production under the aegis of Re-

spondent.

473. The Tribunal considers that, contrary to Respondent's submissions, it is not relevant
whether or not the formal expropriation decree was still being drafted at that time and
property rights were yet to be formally transferred, and whether or not Claimant took

legal steps in order to regain control.*© The fact that the expropriation decree was "being
drafted" at that time "by the competent governmental authorities, within the process pro-
vided for in the applicable laws" ("El Decreto que ordena la expropiacion de Norpro y
sus activos industriales esta siendo elaborado por las autoridades gubernamentales com-
petentes, dentro del proceso previsto en las leyes aplicables.")**" does not exclude a find-
ing that Claimant had already been expropriated within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the
Treaty.

The concepts and formalities of domestic law and compliance with its rules are not deci-
sive for the purpose of determining whether or not an expropriation within the meaning
of international law has occurred. Rather, it is decisive under Article 5(1) of the Treaty
that Respondent had de facto control of the plant on or shortly after 15 May 2010, with
no prospect of giving it back to its owners, and used it to prepare and restart operation
and production of proppants. While the assessment of the plant's economic situation, in-
cluding its inventory and payment obligations, was also relevant for preparing the (for-
mal) expropriation decree and determining the fair compensation as required under Arti-
cle 5(1) of the Treaty, Respondent did not collect this data within the framework of a
formal administrative procedure. Rather, it availed itself of the plant takeover carried out
by the union, established a permanent presence on the plant and started the nationalization
process without providing for any significant participation of Claimant or the Norpro
management at that time.

With respect to the second point, i.e., whether Claimant attempted to regain control of the
plant after the takeover on 15 May 2010, the Tribunal notes that Norpro Venezuela filed
two requests for judicial inspection of the plant on 17 May 2010 and on 5 August 2010.4
Moreover, Norpro Venezuela and Claimant repeatedly attempted to enter into negotia-
tions with Respondent concerning the nationalization of the plant, requested the assign-
ment of an interlocutor, offered technical assistance and reserved their right to indemni-
fication, starting with a letter from Norpro's former president Luis Paez to Rafael Rami-
rez, dated 19 May 2010:

"Considerando el interés que posee el Grupo Saint-Gobain en preser-

var la seguridad del personal de la planta y la condicién de los activos

Other letters from Claimant and Norpro Venezuela, written in the course of 2010, contain
similar statements.*”” These messages do not convey the impression that Claimant and
Norpro Venezuela, still being the rightful owners of the plant, had access to the plant at
any time, but had decided "to disclaim responsibility for anything that happened at the
Plant" and to leave the plant to the State, as alleged by Respondent.*”! It rather appears
that, in view of President Chavez' announcement of 15 May 2010 and the subsequent
takeover of the plant, Claimant accepted as a fact that the plant was de facto nationalized
and tried to make the best of the situation by cooperating with Respondent rather than
exhausting its legal remedies, such as, e.g., an "amparo" in order to preserve its constitu-
tional rights.” This cooperative attitude does not, however, preclude Claimant from as-
serting that an "expropriation" within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty occurred
already at that time.

In conclusion, the Tribunal has no doubt that on, or at least shortly after, 15 May 2010,
Respondent obtained at least de facto control of the plant, with the aim of ultimately car-
rying out the expropriation process. This conduct amounts to an "expropriation" within
the meaning of Article 5(1) of the Treaty and is therefore decisive for the expropriation
date within the meaning of subparagraph 3.

(ii) Respondent's Compliance with, or Breach of, its Treaty Obliga-
tions after the Expropriation Date

From the findings made above in aa) with regard to the requirements as to the specifica-
tion and promptness of the compensation under Article 5(1) subparagraph 2 and 3 of the
Treaty and in (i) with regard to the "date of expropriation" within the meaning of subpar-
agraph 3, it follows that Respondent did not comply with its Treaty obligations under
Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 after 15 May 2010.

479. Respondent has never communicated the amount of payment to be made to Claimant and
has yet to offer any compensation for the expropriation, despite the aforementioned at-
tempts by Claimant to negotiate the terms of the nationalization. The Tribunal is aware
that it is Respondent's position that it offered compensation in the context of its offer to
form an "empresa mixta," in which PDVSA would become the major shareholder.*”?
However, regardless of whether Respondent's offer was sufficiently concrete in order for
Claimant to be considered,*”* Respondent did in any event not specify any amount that it
would pay to Claimant in consideration for its acquisition of a majority stake in the mixed
company. Therefore Respondent failed to specify the amount of compensation within the
meaning of Article 5(1) subparagraph 3 of the Treaty and thus also failed to pay prompt
compensation as required under subparagraph 2.

c) Conclusion

480. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the expropriation of the plant was not carried out in
accordance with the compensation requirements set out in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2
and 3. As to the consequences of this finding, i.e., the question whether this breach renders
the expropriation unlawful, the Tribunal notes that the dispute between the Parties is fo-
cused on the question of which compensation standard is to be applied in this case. The
Tribunal will thus address this issue in the section on quantum (see below in III.1.).

2. Fair and Equitable Treatment (Article 3(1) of the Treaty)

481. The Tribunal now turns to the FET claims. After briefly defining the applicable FET
standard (a), the Tribunal will assess the FET claims with respect to the plant (b) and the
Bauxite Contract (c). As to the additional claims based on Respondent's failure to provide
VAT refunds that it allegedly owed to Claimant under Venezuelan law and on Respond-

ent's alleged arbitrary restriction of the proppants production through the 24 March 2010

t,475

takeover of the plant the Tribunal notes that Claimant has not continued to pursue

these arguments as independent FET claims following its Memorial. Therefore, the Tri-
bunal will also refrain from addressing these arguments in the present section.”

Applicable FET Standard

aa) Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant submits that the FET standard provided for in Article 3(1) of the Treaty refers,
in a broad sense, to the prevailing concepts of FET in international law — and not only to
the minimum standard of treatment -, including the following:*””

- The ensurance of a "stable legal and business environment," with treatment "in a
manner that is consistent, predictable, and transparent";

- The creation of an "appropriate legal, administrative, and regulatory framework, the
legal environment that modern investment theory has come to recognize as a conditio
sine qua non of the success of private enterprise";

- “due process" to the exclusion of a "lack of transparency and candor in an adminis-
trative process";

- The absence of "arbitrary or discriminatory conduct"; and
- Aconduct "in accordance with the principle of good faith."

Claimant submits that the reference in Article 3(1) of the Treaty to the "rules and princi-
ples of international law" does not constitute a cap but rather the baseline for the treatment
to be accorded to foreign investors.‘7*

bb) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent submits that, by virtue of the reference to the "rules and principles of inter-
national law," Article 3(1) of the Treaty calls only for the minimum standard of treatment
under customary international law. For the purpose of defining this restrictive FET stand-
ard, Respondent refers to an early decision of the tribunal in Neer v. Mexico (1926), which
held that, to violate this standard, the treatment of an alien

"should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or

to insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international

standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily rec-

ognize its insufficiency."*”

485. Respondent further cites several FET provisions contained in more recent investment law
frameworks such as the draft EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement ("CETA"), which spec-
ifies the FET standard as to cover, for example: "Fundamental breach of due process,
including a fundamental breach of transparency, in judicial and administrative proceed-
ings" as well as "breach of legitimate expectations", “limited to situations where the in-
vestment took place only because of a promise made by the State that was subsequently
not honoured."**°

cc) The Tribunal's Analysis

486. The FET clause contained in Article 3(1) of the Treaty reads as follows:

"Chacune des Parties contrac-
tantes s'engage a assurer, sur son
territoire et dans sa zone maritime,
un traitement juste et équitable,
conformément aux régles et prin-
cipes du droit international, aux in-
vestissements des nationaux et so-

487. The English translation submitted by Claimant reads:

"Each of the Contracting Parties will ensure fair and equitable treat-
ment for investments by nationals and companies of the other Party in
its territory and in its maritime area, in accordance with the rules and
principles of international law, and will ensure that the exercise of this
right thus recognized shall have no impediments either in law or in fact.
In particular, although not exclusively, impediments to fair and equita-
ble treatment in law or in fact are any arbitrary or discriminatory re-
strictions to the purchase and transport of raw and ancillary materials,
of energy and fuels, as well as to any means of production and exploi-
tation, or any impediment to the sale and transport of products within
the country and overseas, along with all other measures having a sim-
ilar effect

 

488. The Tribunal notes that the reference to the "rules and principles of international law"
("conformément aux régles et principes du droit international"/"conforme a las reglas y
principios del Derecho Internacional") and the non-exhaustive enumeration ("En par-
ticulier, bien que non exclusivement'/"En particular, aunque no exclusivamente") of cer-
tain aspects of FET in the second part of the provision might, in principle, raise doubts as
to the correct interpretation of the FET clause. However, the Tribunal does not have to
make a finding in this regard because, as discussed in the following paragraphs, at least
certain aspects of Respondent's involvement in the price increases under the Bauxite Con-
tract and the expropriation of the plant as alleged by Claimant could, if proven, also be in
breach of the more restrictive FET concept as described by Respondent in this case.

489. With regard to the takeover of the plant, Claimant argues that Respondent failed to follow
due process in the expropriation procedure. As Respondent's reference to the FET stand-
ard under the draft CETA illustrates, Respondent apparently accepts that a "[f]undamen-
tal breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency, in judicial
and administrative proceedings" forms part of the FET standard contained in Article 3(1)
of the Treaty.***

490. As to the price increases under the Bauxite Contract, it is Claimant's position that Re-

spondent made, through MIBAM and other State organs, "specific promises" and "com-
mitments" and thereby "created specific expectations," which Claimant relied on in mak-
ing its investments, and which were subsequently frustrated.**° Respondent advances that
the FET standard includes protection of "legitimate expectations," "limited to situations
where the investment took place only because of a promise made by the State that was
subsequently not honoured."*°°

491. In light of the Parties’ positions in this case, the Tribunal will consider "due process" and

b)

protection of "Jegitimate expectations" as being, in principle, undisputed elements of the
FET under Article 3(1) of the Treaty. If necessary, the Tribunal will further detail the
precise scope of these two elements below.

Due Process in the Expropriation

aa) Summary of Claimant's Position

492. Claimant submits that Respondent failed to treat Claimant's investment fairly and equita-

bly because its actions in relation to the expropriation were not transparent and did not
satisfy the standard of good faith under the Treaty. Claimant argues that its investment
was "effectively expropriated overnight" without any forewarning and its employees were
"kicked out the same day" as a result of the "public and sudden announcement" on tele-

vision by President Chavez on 15 May 2010.*87

493. Claimant claims that the tribunal in Middle East Cement v. Egypt confirmed that the man-

ner in which the investment was expropriated can in itself violate the FET standard and
further refers to the tribunal's finding in Tecmed v. Mexico that a failure to consult with
the claimant prior to the expropriatory action gave rise to a breach of the FET obliga-
tion.*8* In addition, Claimant relies on the tribunal's statement in OJ European Group v.
Venezuela that it is difficult to imagine an unlawful direct expropriation, which does not

at the same time imply a violation of the FET standard.**°

According to Claimant, it repeatedly approached Respondent in order to negotiate the
amount of compensation to be paid under the Treaty but its efforts were to no avail. Re-
spondent failed to make any offer and further failed to give any indication as to the pro-
cess it intended to follow in order to ensure the payment of adequate compensation.
Claimant refers to the tribunal's statement in ADC v. Hungary that the claimant's legiti-
mate expectation included to receive fair treatment and just compensation.*”° By contrast,
Claimant claims, Respondent took the plant without establishing a legal framework for
the expropriation or an effort to engage in any good faith negotiations on compensation
for a period of over ten months.*?!

Claimant argues that due process requires that the affected investor be granted "a reason-
able chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have its claims
heard." In Claimant's view, the "significant delays" and the "opaque process" together
with Respondent's insistence on continuing with its domestic expropriation proceedings
despite Claimant's choice to pursue its claims before an ICSID tribunal constitute a vio-
lation of Respondent's obligation to accord Claimant due process during the expropria-
tion.4??

Claimant maintains that Respondent did not respect "anyone's understanding of due pro-
cess" when it (i) "abruptly declared the Plant national property in a television announce-
ment"; (ii) failed to take "any legal measure, decree or procedure" for almost a year and
could not even outline a timeframe for the start of the process; (iii) failed to provide any
authority for PDVSA's "occupation and control" of the plant; (iv) refused to negotiate in
good faith despite Claimant's repeated efforts and made "only unsubstantiated 'sugges-
tions' of a mixed enterprise," which cannot be considered a good-faith offer given that the
suggestion did not include any compensation for the loss of the 60% ownership that would
be taken by PDVSA; (v) did not offer any compensation as required by both the Treaty
and its domestic Expropriation Law; and (vi) failed to act in accordance with the terms of
the Expropriation Law as confirmed by its legal expert Dr. Brewer-Carias who states that
under Venezuelan law, compensation has to be paid prior to expropriation.*”?

bb) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent rejects Claimant's claim that the expropriation was not carried out following
due process and argues that there is no requirement under international law to give prior

warning of its intention to announce an expropriation because this would effectively un-
dermine the State's sovereign right to expropriate.’°* Respondent submits that when
PDVSA had established a caretaker presence at the plant, it met with Claimant as soon as
possible to negotiate the formation of an empresa mixta and, even before the Expropria-
tion Decree was issued, PDVSA "took active steps to engage with Claimant, to collabo-
rate with Claimant, and ensure that Claimant was aware of the available legal reme-
dies."*°5

In response to Claimant's argument that Respondent failed to abide by its domestic Ex-
propriation Law, Respondent maintains that PDVSA was authorized to enter into provi-
sional possession of the plant under Venezuelan law and, in any event, not every failure
of the host State to "comply strictly with the requirements of its laws" constitutes a breach
of its FET obligation under international law.*°°

Respondent emphasizes that after the Decree was issued, PDVSA initiated the adminis-
trative amicable expropriation procedure required by the Expropriation Law, which is
aimed at determining the compensation to be paid. According to Respondent, Claimant
was well aware of the Expropriation Decree and its role in resolving the question of com-
pensation; nevertheless, it chose not to participate in the amicable settlement procedure
and to ignore the subsequent judicial procedure. In Respondent's view, the present case is
therefore not comparable to the cases cited by Claimant because it neither challenged the
expropriation nor did it participate in the determination of just compensation and there-
fore cannot complain about the resulting delays.*””

Specifically with regard to OJ European Group v. Venezuela, Respondent notes that the
applicable expropriation provision in that case included an explicit requirement to carry
out the expropriation "under due process of law" and emphasizes that the tribunal rejected
all but one of the claimant's due process arguments. In particular, Respondent emphasizes
that the tribunal found that due process does not require prior discussions with the expro-
priated party and is fully satisfied if the party is subsequently granted the right to be heard
before the judiciary.*°* Respondent maintains that this possibility would have been open
to Claimant at any time and concludes that "the fact that Claimant chose not to avail itself
of remedies in the Venezuelan courts does not equate with a denial of due process."*°

Finally, Respondent is of the view that Claimant's argument that the ongoing judicial
procedure ignores Claimant's choice to initiate ICSID arbitration is rendered moot by the
Tribunal's decision to deny Claimant's request for provisional measures that was based

on the same argument.*””

In any event, Respondent submits that Claimant did not suffer any damage during the ten-
and-a-half-month period until the Expropriation Decree was issued that is not already
included in the calculation of the compensation for the expropriation as of 15 May 2010.
According to Respondent, even a finding of an FET violation would not give rise to any
change in the manner in which compensation is to be calculated in the present case.*°!

cc) The Tribunal's Analysis

During the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submission, Claimant included this FET
claim in the expropriation claim relating to Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty.>°
The Tribunal notes, however, that Claimant thereby did not intend to abandon its separate
FET claim relating to the taking of the plant, given that it maintains in its relief sought
the request for a separate declaration that Respondent has breached Article 3(1) of the
Treaty.°°

The Tribunal notes the Parties’ positions on Claimant's claim for breach of due process
during the expropriation process. However, as correctly pointed out by Respondent,
Claimant does not allege that it suffered any damage from the alleged breach that would
not be included in the compensation for the expropriation itself. Therefore, the Tribunal
does not have to make a finding on whether the FET has indeed been breached in this
regard because it would not alter the amount of compensation to which Claimant will be
entitled pursuant to the Award.

autonomous institute under Venezuelan law and thus forms part of the "functionally de-
centralized" public entities of Respondent. Claimant adds that CVG enjoys the same priv-
ileges and prerogatives as the State, is subject to the coordination of the President of Ven-
ezuela and was "ascribed" to MIBAM. Consequently, Claimant argues that the same ap-
plies to its subsidiary CVG Bauxilum whose activities and services have been declared
of public utility and public interest under Venezuela's Mining Law.>™

Claimant therefore argues that (i) CVG Bauxilum should be considered an organ of the
State under Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles; and even if this were not the case, (ii) its
conduct would be attributable under Article 5 as it is "empowered by the law of [the] State
to exercise elements of governmental authority" and "was acting in that capacity in the
particular instance" because it contracted with Norpro Venezuela on the basis of the

State-granted monopoly.>°

To the extent that CVG Bauxilum is considered an organ of the State, Claimant argues
that its breach of the Bauxite Contract in itself amounts to an internationally wrongful act
rising to the level of a Treaty breach because Claimant is entitled to the same treatment
afforded to third-party nationals under the most-favored nation clause in the Treaty. Ac-
cording to Claimant, the scope of the MFN clause includes umbrella clauses found in
other treaties such as the UK-Venezuela BIT.*

Claimant also refers to Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles and notes that this provision
does not even require governmental activity.” In addition, Claimant claims that Re-
spondent, through MIBAM, adopted the Bauxite Contract as its own and then "sanctioned
the contractual breach by refusing to address it when approached directly by Norpro

Venezuela," which creates its responsibility under Article 11 of the ILC Draft Articles.°°*

 

Respondent's Conduct (Through MIBAM) Created Legitimate Ex-
pectations

Claimant further submits that, even if CVG Bauxilum's conduct were not attributable un-
der the ILC Draft Articles, Respondent's State officials gave "specific promises" and thus

 

created "specific expectations," which they then repudiated by failing to address CVG

Bauxilum's actions in raising the bauxite price in violations of the terms of the Bauxite

Contract.°°

In Claimant's view, Respondent "induced" its investment through "a series of promises,"
including a guarantee that its State-owned entities would enter into long-term supply con-
tracts for the required inputs (gas, electricity and bauxite). According to Claimant, the
"long-term supply of bauxite at a competitive price" was "of critical importance" to
Claimant, which is why it discussed the supply of bauxite directly with MIBAM in
2005.7"°

Claimant contends that Respondent "regularly discussed and promoted the Bauxite Con-
tract" and that MIBAM gave "express assurances [...] that it had directed CVG Bauxilum
10 fulfill Norpro Venezuela's bauxite needs on the terms agreed."*'' In this regard, Claim-
ant refers, inter alia, to a meeting on 10 May 2005 in which the Vice-Minister "[c]on-
firmed the terms that will guide the bauxite and gas supply" as well as a meeting on 20
October 2005 in which the Vice-Minister confirmed that he had asked "the president of
[CVG] Bauxilum to finalize the contract asap."*'”

According to Claimant, the Government was aware of the importance to secure bauxite
supply and therefore "directly committed to Saint-Gobain that it would secure such a
supply at the Bauxite Contract price."
the Bauxite Contract "[a]t MIBAM's direction," as confirmed by the fact that the Contract

(MIBAM) and the Corporacién Venezolana de Guayana (CVG)" and embossed with
"Ministry of Basic Mining Industries" in the header.>!? Consequently, Claimant argues
that its legitimate expectations, as "memorialized" in the Bauxite Contract with CVG
Bauxilum, were created by MIBAM prior to the signing given that it "controlled and
orchestrated" the negotiations on the supply of bauxite and confirmed the parameters of

the contract.°"4

Claimant alleges that even though the Bauxite Contract provides that the bauxite price
can be increased only (i) by an automatic annual adjustment by the US PPI for commod-

ities (Article 10.1); and (ii) in the event of increased transportation costs by a jointly re-
viewed price adjustment (Article 10.2), CVG Bauxilum unilaterally increased the price
in violation of these terms. Claimant notes that it objected to the price increase by separate
letters to both MIBAM and CVG Bauxilum, as confirmed by its witness Mr. Millot during

his oral testimony.°!>

In response to Respondent's argument that the price increase was based on the increased
transportation costs, in particular the raised tariffs for navigating the Orinoco River, and
thus justified under Article 10.2, Claimant submits that, despite "extensive efforts" from
Norpro Venezuela's management, CVG Bauxilum failed to adequately document the al-
leged reasons for the price increase, several of which were "inadequate on their face."*!®
Claimant argues that Respondent's conduct does not merely amount to a breach of con-
tract but a violation of its legitimate expectation that Respondent would ensure compli-
ance with the contract. In this regard, Claimant claims that the tribunal in Nykomb v.
Latvia "clearly established the relevance of market-dominance for attribution pur-
poses."°'” Claimant argues that, in light of Respondent's monopoly over the bauxite pro-
duction in Venezuela, MIBAM and CVG Bauxilum could impose their terms on Norpro
Venezuela, knowing that bauxite was the critical raw material for the production of
Claimant's ceramic proppants. While emphasizing that it protested against the increase,
Claimant submits that it therefore "simply had no other choice" than to pay the increased
price.*!8

Contrary to what Respondent suggests, Claimant submits that it could not change the
supplier of bauxite because the process had been calibrated to the quality of the raw baux-
ite required for the production proppants and delivery was scheduled only once a year.
According to Claimant, the availability of bauxite in sufficient quantities at prices that
made the proppants production economically feasible was the entire reason for choosing
Venezuela as its investment location. Under these circumstances, Claimant argues that
the unilateral price increase was "antithetical to the transparentand stable legal environ-

ment Saint-Gobain was promised" and thus "eviscerated" its legitimate expectations.*!?

bb) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent rejects Claimant's claim and emphasizes that neither Claimant nor Venezuela
was party to the Bauxite Contract, which was rather a "purely commercial arrangement"
between CVG Bauxilum and Norpro Venezuela and cannot give rise to any obligations
of Respondent under international law.

(@) CVG Bauxilum's Conduct Is Not Attributable to Respondent

Respondent contests that the actions of CVG Bauxilum are attributable to the State under
the ILC Draft Articles because these provisions apply only to "internationally wrongful

acts." As there is no allegation that the conclusion of the Bauxite Contract in itself was

 

an internationally wrongful act, Respondent contends that the ILC Draft Articles do not
520
apply.

Respondent submits that, even if the ILC Draft Articles were applicable, CVG Bauxilum
cannot be considered an organ of the State under Article 4 because CVG is an autonomous
institute and its subsidiary, CVG Bauxilum, is a State-owned company. According to Re-
spondent, neither of them has any executive power but they are decentralized entities of
the Public Administration and thus separate and distinct legal persons under Venezuelan
commercial law.*”! Respondent argues that if the status is as clearly defined under internal
law as is the case here, the internal law is decisive for the classification as an "organ"
under Article 4.52?

Respondent further takes the position that CVG Bauxilum's conduct is not attributable
under Article 5. In Respondent's view, the exercise of "governmental authority" means
the "authority to exercise sovereign prerogatives" and cannot be equated with "activities
of a commercial character that are routinely carried out by State companies for the ben-
efit of the State." Respondent submits that, while CVG Bauxilum is a commercial com-
pany acting for the benefit of Respondent in the mining sector, it does not possess or
exercise any governmental authority in carrying out its activities.*

While acknowledging that CVG Bauxilum indeed has a State-granted monopoly in Ven-
ezuela, Respondent notes that Claimant had identified three alternative sources in
Guayana and the Dominican Republic and was "perfectly free" to import the bauxite from
any of those countries. According to Respondent, CVG Bauxilum's monopoly is irrele-
vant because CVG Bauxilum's decision to increase the price due to the fact that its own

performance had become unviable is not a sovereign act, but rather a "quintessentially"
A 524
commercial act.

Respondent is further of the view that CVG Bauxilum's conduct cannot be attributed to
Respondent under Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles because Claimant cannot show a
particular act that was internationally wrongful and the result of the State's "instructions,
directions or control.">*> Respondent refers to the commentary to the ILC Draft Articles
in which Prof. Crawford states:

"Questions arise with respect to the conduct of companies or enter-
prises which are State-owned and controlled. If such corporations act
inconsistently with the international obligations of the State concerned
the question arises whether such conduct is attributable to the State. In
discussing this issue it is necessary to recall that international law
acknowledges the general separateness of corporate entities at the na-
tional level, except in those cases where the ‘corporate veil' is a mere
device or a vehicle for fraud or evasion. The fact that the State initially
establishes a corporate entity, whether by a special law or otherwise,
is not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent
conduct of that entity. Since corporate entities, although owned by and
in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be
separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying out their activities is not
attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of govern-
mental authority within the meaning of article 5."°°°

 

With regard to Claimant's argument that CVG (and therefore effectively also CVG Baux-
ilum) is under the administrative guardianship and oversight (tutela) of MIBAM, Re-
spondent notes that under Venezuelan law, control de tutela is a form of "general over-
sight" to ensure that the activities of decentralized entities or State-owned companies are
carried out in line with State policy, but argues that it cannot make the State responsible
for the commercial decisions of a State-owned company.>””

Finally, Respondent contends that Claimant's reference to Article 11 of the ILC Draft
Articles contradicts its previous arguments related to Article 4, 5 and 8 because Article
11 is premised on the absence of any governmental or sovereign conduct. In addition,
Respondent submits that Claimant has not identified any "clear and unequivocal" state-
ment or act of adoption on the part of Respondent and still cannot overcome the hurdle

of an internationally wrongful conduct.>78

(ii) Claimant's Claim is Factually Inaccurate

In any event, Respondent claims that Norpro Venezuela was not forced to accept any
price increase but, after initial protest, "appreciated the underlying reasons" given by
CVG Bauxilum for the increase, i.e., the new tariffs for navigation on the Orinoco River
and the significant variation of extraction, transport and unloading costs at the Matanzas
plant. According to Respondent, Norpro Venezuela made a business decision to agree to
the price increase, subject to its request that the price be maintained at that level through
2009. Respondent emphasizes that CVG Bauxilum honored that request and did not seek
a further price increase until 2010.°”? Respondent further claims that none of the docu-
ments invoked by Claimant reflect its alleged request that additional reasons or documen-

tation of such reasons be provided.**°

Respondent argues that Norpro Venezuela could have decided not to purchase any bauxite
from CVG Bauxilum and could instead have imported bauxite from any of the three al-
ternative resources it had identified in Guayana and the Dominican Republic. Alterna-
tively, Respondent notes, it could have resorted to arbitration proceedings under the

Bauxite Contract against CVG Bauxilum.**!

Respondent further rejects Claimant's submission that its investment hinged on the ex-
pectation that it would receive a stable supply of bauxite from CVG Bauxilum at the same
price. According to Respondent, Claimant "certainly never received any guarantee from
the Republic regarding supply or price" but even advised its parent company in 2005 that
there were considerable risks associated with the supply of bauxite, which they could
mitigate by securing multiple viable alternative sources. Respondent notes that Claimant
therefore stated internally that they were in need of an "alternative supply of bauxite from
Guayana if tomorrow CVG no longer supplies us with any.">*”

Respondent argues that in the absence of any specific promises or guarantees from the
State, Claimant's "expectations" are not protected and claims that even the cases relied on
by Claimant support this. According to Respondent, none of the documents referred to by
Claimant with regard to the alleged commitments of the State show any involvement "be-
yond support of a general nature for the proppant plant project," which does not suffice
to give rise to legitimate expectations, or that Respondent "sanctioned" CVG Bauxilum's
decision to increase the bauxite price.*** In Respondent's view, this is confirmed by Mr.

Pedersen's oral testimony because he could not point to any specific documents or com-
munications in which the alleged guarantees or commitments were made. In particular,
Respondent notes that Mr. Pedersen could not identify a specific meeting in which the
wording "under the auspices of [...] MIBAM" was discussed and given the meaning that

Claimant now alleges.**4

Consequently, Respondent maintains that the Government "did nothing more than to fa-
cilitate the discussions with CVG Bauxilum" and made no commitments regarding the
supply or price of bauxite to Norpro Venezuela. Therefore and apart from the fact that it
considers the price increase justified under the Bauxite Contract, Respondent is of the
view that it had no obligation to intervene and assist in the resolution of the dispute be-

tween CVG Bauxilum and Norpro Venezuela.*>

cc) The Tribunal's Analysis

In the Tribunal's view, Claimant's argument on the bauxite price increase is twofold: First,
Claimant argues that at the time it made the decision to invest in Venezuela in 2005,
Respondent (through its own State officials, in particular from MIBAM) created a legiti-
mate expectation that CVG Bauxilum would supply Norpro Venezuela with bauxite at
stable prices in the long term, but then failed to intervene when CVG Bauxilum unilater-
ally increased the price in 2008 and thus breached those expectations. Second, Claimant
argues that CVG Bauxilum's conduct in breach of the Bauxite Contract can be attributed
to Respondent in accordance with the ILC Draft Articles and, in light of its State-granted
monopoly over the supply of bauxite in Venezuela, amounts to a violation of Respond-
ent's international obligations.

As to the first argument, the Tribunal notes that there is common ground between the
Parties that, while Respondent generally supported Claimant's investment in 2005 and
2006, this alone cannot give rise to Respondent's liability under international law. Rather,
a legitimate expectation can be created only by specific promises or commitments made
by the State. The dispute between the Parties relates to whether Respondent has made
such specific promises in relation to the supply of bauxite at stable prices.

In the Tribunal's view, the evidence presented by Claimant in this regard does not estab-
lish that the State (through MIBAM) made any specific commitments in relation to the
terms of the Bauxite Contract and in particular the prices at which CVG Bauxilum would
supply the bauxite. In his written witness statement, Mr. Pedersen described that MIBAM

535.

was very involved in the negotiations with CVG Bauxilum and repeatedly voiced its sup-
port for the project.°*° Mr. Pedersen did not, however, make reference to any specific
commitment made by MIBAM in relation to the bauxite price. When he was asked about
this during the Hearing, Mr. Pedersen clarified:

"I don't think, frankly, it was—if you look at it from that way, was the

bauxite price negotiated with MIBAM. No, it was not, but the support

to get a contract with Bauxilum was discussed and agreed with MIBAM.

And then later on there are, of course, commercial negotiations be-

tween us and Bauxilum."**"

Mr. Pedersen's oral testimony confirms the Tribunal's impression from the record that
MIBAM indeed facilitated and supervised the negotiations with CVG Bauxilum and even
approved the general terms that would govern the supply of bauxite. However, Respond-
ent correctly pointed out that none of the statements made can be qualified as a commit-
ment that the State would guarantee CVG Bauxilum's compliance with the pricing terms
of the Bauxite Contract.

Claimant further argues that the term "bajo el auspicio del [...] MIBAM">*® can be
equated to an “express assurance" that CVG Bauxilum would supply Norpro Venezuela
with bauxite at the agreed terms.**? When asked about this term at the Hearing, Mr. Peder-
sen testified that it was discussed in the meetings with MIBAM that "they were basically
standing behind this contract and standing behind Bauxilum in agreeing this with us."
Mr. Pedersen could not, however, identify a concrete meeting at which, or a concrete
person by whom, such statement was made.™? The Tribunal is therefore not convinced
that the term was subject to any discussion before the Bauxite Contract was signed and,
more importantly, there is no indication that it was to be assigned such a far-reaching
meaning as to ensure compliance with the Bauxite Contract and/or to guarantee stable
prices in the long term.

In sum, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has not established that there were any promises
or commitments made by Respondent (through MIBAM) specifically in relation to the
supply of bauxite at the price agreed with CVG Bauxilum under the Bauxite Contract.
Consequently, MIBAM's conduct did not give rise to a legitimate expectation of Claimant
that it would guarantee CVG Bauxilum's compliance with the Bauxite Contract.

As to Claimant's second argument, the Tribunal does not have to decide whether CVG
Bauxilum's conduct is attributable to Respondent under the ILC Draft Articles and
whether a breach of contract could give rise to Respondent's liability under international
law in light of CVG Bauxilum's State-granted monopoly over the supply of bauxite in
Venezuela. Even if this were the case, Claimant has not established that the price increase
in September 2008 amounted to a breach of contract.

CVG Bauxilum based the increase on Article 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract, which pro-
vides:

"Las partes acuerdan revisar el precio cuando surja un incremento de

manera directa en los costos por concepto de transporte del material

desde la mina hasta Matanzas, como consecuencia de la entrada en

vigencia de Leyes, Decretos, Reglamentos, Impuestos Nacionales, Es-

tadales o Municipales, tasas y modificaciones de alguna Convencién

Colectiva de las contratistas que ejecutan el servicio de transporte de

la Bauxita, el cual sera aplicable en caso que dicho incremento sea

superior al del aumento establecido en el numeral 10.1 anterior."*4!

During the first meeting in which the price increase was discussed, CVG Bauxilum in-
voked the following reasons: (i) increase in the Orinoco River toll by 600%; (ii) impact
of the extraction and production cost that were higher than the selling price; (iii) increase
of the freight costs due to increased labor costs; (iv) international market analysis accord-

ing to which CVG Bauxilum's price was lower than in the international market.**

While the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that not all of those reasons justified a price
increase under the terms of the Bauxite Contract, the letter of 2 September 2008 by which
CVG Bauxilum informed Claimant about the price increase to USD 33.8 per MT relies
on "las nuevas tarifas del canal de Navegacion del Rio Orinoco" and "la apreciable var-
iaci6n que ha experimentado el costo de extracci6n, transporte y descarga de la bauxita
en nuestra Planta de Matanzas."** These reasons are explicitly provided for in Article
10.2 of the Bauxite Contract and would therefore, if proven, justify an increase of the
bauxite price.

Claimant does not dispute that the tariffs on the Orinoco River were indeed raised by
600% by decree of 31 July 2008.*4# Neither does it dispute that the extraction, transpor-
tation and unloading fees at the Matanza plant had increased. Claimant rather argues, as

repeatedly confirmed by Mr. Pedersen during the Hearing,*4°

that it was never provided
with documentation or a calculation for the price increase. While it claims that it repeat-
edly requested to receive such information, Claimant has not identified any occasion on
which it ever voiced such a specific request but only refers to requests for "further dis-
cussion of the proposed price increase," its emphasis on the applicability of Article 10.2
to any price increase and its protests against the increase which they considered to be
outside the terms of the Bauxite Contract.*4° When Mr. Pedersen was asked during the
Hearing whether Claimant had ever requested to receive such documentation, he stated:

"Yes. I don't know if it was in here, but I mean, yeah, I mean in the

meetings with them, we certainly asked for to let us know.

Arbitrator Brower: So, did that company refuse to provide such infor-

mation, or it just did not provide it, and you moved on?

The Witness: Yeah, I mean, we never got something, I mean, which was
unfortunate. Every now and then it's difficult to get information. This is

also back to why it took 15 months to actually sign the Contract
[...]."57

In light of this rather vague testimony, the Tribunal is not convinced that Claimant ever
expressly voiced the request to be provided with documentation for the reasons invoked
by CVG Bauxilum. From the record, in particular Claimant's letter of 17 September 2008,
it rather appears that Norpro Venezuela made the decision to accept the price increase,
albeit under protest, under the condition that it would remain at that level throughout the
following year, i.e., until 31 December 2009.*48 It is undisputed between the Parties, and
confirmed by CVG Bauxilum's invoices to Claimant in 2009,>? that CVG Bauxilum ad-
hered to this request and did not request a further price increase until early 2010. While
Claimant emphasized in its letter that this should not be considered a tacit acceptance of
the price increase, the Tribunal notes that Norpro Venezuela never took action against
CVG Bauxilum in this regard under the dispute resolution clause provided for in the
Bauxite Contract.

In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has not established that the price
increase of September 2008 was not justified under Article 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract.

of this case it can therefore be left open whether Respondent could be held liable for such
breach under international law.

3. Full Protection and Security (Article 3(2) of the Treaty)

Finally, the Tribunal will address Claimant's claim based on the full protection and secu-
rity provision contained in Article 3(2) of the Treaty. Following a brief analysis of the
applicable FPS standard ((a)), the Tribunal will turn to Claimant's FPS claims as regards
the Bauxite Contract ((b)) and the takeover of the plant ((c)).

Applicable FPS Standard

aa) Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant submits that the FPS standard imposes an obligation of "due diligence" and
"vigilance" on the host State, which requires "reasonable measures of prevention" that a
"well-administered government could be expected to exercise in similar circum-

stances.">°°

Claimant submits that, in the "modern commercial and business context," investment
treaty tribunals have not confined the FPS standard to physical security, but rather ex-
tended it to encompass legal security.*°! Claimant argues that the FPS standard has
evolved to include "more generally, the rights of investors" and applies "at least in situ-
ations ‘involving either physical violence or the discard of legal rights.""*>*

Even if Article 3(2) were to be limited to physical security, Claimant submits that it would
still benefit from the "full legal protection" that Respondent granted to third-party nation-
als in the Uruguay-Venezuela BIT on the basis of the most-favored nation clause con-

tained in Article 4 of the Treaty.*?

bb) Summary of Respondent's Position

It is Respondent's position that an analysis of a breach of the FPS standard requires con-
sideration of whether the investment has been physically interfered with or harmed and
whether the State complied with its due diligence obligation. ** According to Respond-
ent, this limitation is required in order "to maintain a meaningful distinction" between the

FPS standard and other protection standards set out in the Treaty, in particular the FET

standard.*°°

While acknowledging that it has a duty of diligence under the FPS standard, Respondent
claims that a breach of this duty requires "a degree of negligence, defective administration
or bad faith" that reflects the relationship between the FPS standard and the international

minimum standard of treatment.>°°

Respondent rejects Claimant's argument that the FPS standard entails the concept of "Je-
gal security" and claims that international case law is rather in favor of the view that the
FPS obligation "relates primarily, and perhaps exclusively, to the physical integrity of
the investment."**’ Respondent emphasizes that unlike other treaties, which expressly re-
fer to "full protection and legal security," the present Treaty does not make reference to
legal security and is therefore not designed to turn contract breaches into treaty claims.>**

cc) The Tribunal's Analysis

Article 3(2) of the Treaty provides:

des nationaux ou des sociétés de

tractantes bénéficient, sur le terri-

The Tribunal notes that while there is common ground between the Parties that Article
3(2) of the Treaty imposes a duty of due diligence on Respondent, there is a dispute as to
(i) the exact scope of such duty; and (ii) whether the FPS standard extends to legal secu-
rity. These issues can be left open if Claimant's two claims based on the FPS standard in
Article 3(2) are to be dismissed in any event, i.e., even under the broader standard ad-
vanced by Claimant. Therefore, the Tribunal will make a decision on the exact scope of
Article 3(2) only if and to the extent necessary to make a finding on Claimant's claims.

b) Claimant's Rights under the Bauxite Contract

aa) Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant submits that in light of MIBAM's involvement in the negotiations and conclu-
sion of the Bauxite Contract, it considered MIBAM as a "key interlocutor capable of
addressing any concerns they might have with the Government." For that reason, Claim-
ant contends, Norpro Venezuela first wrote to MIBAM and copied MIBAM on its corre-
spondence to CVG Bauxilum when it was faced with the price increase in 2008. However,
Claimant notes that MIBAM ignored Claimant's requests to intervene and Respondent
thus failed to protect Claimant's investment from CVG Bauxilum's actions in spite of its
FPS obligation.*?

According to Claimant, the tribunal in Nykomb v. Latvia found "in similar circumstances"
that Latvia's failure to protect the foreign investor against contractual breaches of a State-
owned entity, despite being fully aware of them, constituted a breach of the FPS obliga-
tion.*° Claimant further refers to the tribunal's emphasis in CME v. Czech Republic on
the obligation to "ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its ad-
ministrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign

investor's investment withdrawn or devalued."**

Claimant therefore argues that Respondent's failure to act upon notification of CVG
Bauxilum's breaches of the Bauxite Contract constitutes a violation of its obligation to
accord Claimant's investment legal security under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.*°

bb) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent submits that Claimant's allegation pursuant to which the price increase was
not in accordance with the Bauxite Contract, despite the fact that it was accepted by

Norpro Venezuela, "does not even come close to triggering a State's duty of due dili-

gence."55

Respondent maintains that it is not responsible for CVG Bauxilum's decision to increase
the price under the Bauxite Contract. In response to Claimant's argument that it wrote to
MIBAM to seek its intervention, Respondent argues that Claimant thereby attempts to
create an obligation of the State by "communicating its discontent with the behavior of a
commercial partner to a government representative," which Respondent considers
clearly untenable. In Respondent's view, Claimant's position would render the dispute
resolution clause in the Bauxite Contract pointless and in any event the dispute was re-
solved amicably by the parties to the Contract when CVG Bauxilum explained the reasons
for the price increase and Norpro Venezuela accepted the increase on the condition that
the price would remain at the same level until the end of 2009.*°”

cc) The Tribunal's Analysis

The Tribunal has already determined above in the context of Claimant's FET claim that
Claimant has not established that Respondent (through MIBAM) made any specific com-
mitments in relation to the supply of bauxite at the price agreed with CVG Bauxilum
under the Bauxite Contract. The Tribunal has also found that CVG Bauxilum's conduct
in relation to the price increase in September 2008 did not amount to a breach of contract.

Therefore, the Tribunal does not have to decide whether the FPS standard contained in
Article 3(2) of the Treaty extends to the concept of "/egal security," as alleged by Claim-
ant. In any event, Respondent did not have an obligation to intervene in relation to the
bauxite price increase and thus has not breached its obligation to accord Claimant's in-
vestment full protection and security in the manner invoked by Claimant.

Takeover of the Plant

aa) Summary of Claimant's Position

In the alternative that the Tribunal should follow Respondent's position that the expropri-
ation occurred only on 29 March 2011 when the Expropriation Decree was issued, Claim-
ant further claims that Respondent has breached its FPS obligation because PDVSA took
over and remained in control of the plant between the takeover on 15 May 2010 and the
issuance of the Expropriation Decree.*°*

Claimant argues that if there was no expropriation on 15 May 2010, PDVSA had no right
to occupy the plant on any date prior to 29 March 2011 and thus should have contacted
Claimant "[t]he minute it obtained control" and should have allowed it to reoccupy the
plant. Instead, Claimant contends that its personnel was barred by the National Guard
from re-entering the plant and PDVSA started production for its own benefit. According
to Claimant, this conduct amounts to a clear breach of Respondent's FPS obligation under
Article 3(2) of the Treaty.*°?

bb) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent maintains that the expropriation occurred when the Expropriation Decree was
issued on 29 March 2011. Respondent acknowledges that PDVSA was present during the
time period prior to that date but argues that this was "both appropriate and necessary
given the dangers associated with the Plant." Respondent further submits that there was
no contemporaneous evidence of any complaints about PDVSA's role and claims that not
only did Claimant never ask for the return of the plant but it even encouraged PDVSA's
presence at the plant and the appointment of an interlocutor, precisely because it was not

present and the plant was "a dangerous facility in the hand of unsupervised workers."*”°

Therefore, Respondent is of the view that it complied with its FPS obligation and adds
that, by contrast, if it had not established a presence at the plant and the equipment had
been damaged or workers had been issued, Claimant may well have had a claim for non-
compliance with Respondent's FPS obligation.*”!

cc) The Tribunal's Analysis

The Tribunal notes that Claimant has raised this claim in the alternative that the Tribunal
should find that the expropriation did not occur on or shortly after 15 May 2010, but only
on 29 March 2011 when the Expropriation Decree was issued. Given the Tribunal's find-
ing at paragraph 477 above that PDVSA's presence at the plant and its memos in early
June 2010 mark the start of the expropriation process, there is thus no need to decide on
this alternative claim.

THE PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM

The Tribunal will now turn to the principles of quantum applicable as a result of the ex-
propriation and Respondent's non-compliance with Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of
the Treaty. The Parties’ positions differ significantly as to the applicable compensation

standard, in particular with respect to the appropriate valuation date (1.), and the criteria

for the calculation of damages (2.).

Compensation Standard and Valuation Date

One of the key legal questions in dispute between the Parties is the applicable compensa-
tion standard and, in this context, particularly the applicable valuation date. As noted
above, the Tribunal finds that Respondent did not comply with the compensation require-
ments set out in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty. Whether this finding
renders the expropriation unlawful and whether this would have any impact on the com-
pensation standard to be applied in the present case is therefore going to be addressed first
in this section.

a) Summary of Claimant's Position

aa) Unlawfulness of the Expropriation

Claimant submits that Respondent's failure to meet the specification and/or promptness

requirements renders the expropriation unlawful.>””

Claimant contends that several awards rendered by the Iran-United States Claims Tribu-
nal "recognize the payment of prompt compensation to be a consideration relevant to the

lawfulness of a taking under customary international law."°"

In the investment treaty context, Claimant submits that the tribunal in Unglaube v. Costa
Rica found an expropriation to be unlawful when compensation was not paid "within a

reasonable period of time after the State declare[s] its intention to expropriate."°"*

Similarly, the tribunal in Burlington v. Ecuador confirmed that, in a case where a State
has expropriated a foreign investor’s property and "has neither paid nor offered compen-

sation [...] the Tribunal cannot but conclude that [the] expropriation was unlawful.">">

Claimant further refers to the tribunal in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, which recently
found that while "payment is not required at the precise moment of expropriation [...]
[plarties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the
standard set [...] if a payment satisfactory to the investor is not proposed at the outset."
In that case, the tribunal found that "the Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate

in good faith for compensation for its taking" and thus, that the expropriation was unlaw-
ful.°7°

573. Moreover, Claimant submits that in Siemens v. Argentina, the arbitral tribunal stated:

"[C]ompensation has never been paid on grounds that [...] the Tribunal

finds that are lacking in justification. For these reasons, the expropria-
tion did not meet the requirements of Article 4(2) [of the Argentina-
Germany BIT] and therefore was unlawful."*"

574. Similarly, in Vivendi v. Argentina IT, the tribunal reasoned:

"If we conclude that the challenged measures are expropriatory, there
will be violation of Article 5(2) of the Treaty, even if the measures might
be for a public purpos: se and non-discriminatory, because no compensa-
tion has been pa

 

575. Finally, Claimant contends that, in Gemplus v. Mexico, the tribunal concluded:

"[T]hese expropriations were unlawful under the BITs and interna-
tional law, given the facts found by the Tribunal and the further fact

that the Re dent did not meet the condition required by Antic le. Sof

bb) Compensation Standard to Be Applied

576. It is Claimant's submission that the appropriate remedy for an unlawful expropriation is
the customary international law standard of restitution, i.e., the higher compensation as
between that valued at the date of expropriation and the date of the award.>*°

577. In support of its approach, Claimant emphasizes that Article 5(1) of the Treaty provides
for the appropriate standard of compensation only in case all of the conditions for a lawful
expropriation are met. As this is not the case here, the appropriate standard of compensa-
tion, including the appropriate date at which the value is to be assessed, is set by custom-

ary international law.**!

578. Claimant initially argued that Respondent must either return the plant to Claimant — which
is impossible here — or pay the cash equivalent of such a return, both of which would

therefore have to occur as of the date of the award.**? During the Hearing and in its Post-
Hearing Submission, Claimant emphasized, however, that, in case the Tribunal were to

find that the value as of the date of the expropriation is higher than the value as of the
date of the award, the Tribunal should determine the compensation based on the value as
of the date of expropriation.***

According to Claimant's Valuation Update, Norpro Venezuela's value as of 31 August
2015 (the assessment date for the date-of-the-award valuation that the Tribunal is ulti-
mately to take into account for its decision) is lower than the value as of 15 May 2010.°*+
Therefore, Claimant now claims that it is entitled to compensation in the amount of

Norpro Venezuela's value as of 15 May 2010.>*

According to Claimant, the rationale behind the investor's right of selecting the valuation
date is the aim to award full compensation to the investor who was deprived of making
the choice whether to retain the investment and enjoy the fruits derived therefrom or
whether to sell it at the optimal moment. As a result, the investor "must be accorded the
upside since that time, but cannot be forced to shoulder the downside."**°

Claimant submits that this argumentation is consistent with the approach taken by the
Permanent Court of International Justice in the landmark Chorzéw Factory decision.>*’
In support of its argumentation, Claimant particularly refers, in its written submissions,>**
to the cases Biwater v. Tanzania,**° Siemens v. Argentina, 5 ADC v. Hungary, 591 Kar-

aa) Lawfulness of the Expropriation

Respondent submits that the mere fact that compensation is yet to be paid does not render
the expropriation unlawful, taking into account that Respondent acknowledged its obli-
gation to pay compensation and commenced the expropriation procedure in consistency
with its domestic law.%?

Respondent points out that, in his separate opinion in Sedco v. Iran, Judge Brower noted:

"Likewise I must express doubt as to whether, under customary inter-
national law, a State’s mere failure, in the end, actually to have com-
pensated in accordance with the international law standard set forth
herein necessarily renders the underlying taking ipso facto wrongful.
If, for example, contemporaneously with the taking the expropriating
State provides a means for the determination of compensation which on
its face appears calculated to result in the required compensation, but
which ultimately does not, or if compensation is immediately paid
which, though later found by a tribunal to fall short of the standard,
was not on its face unreasonable, it would appear appropriate not to
find that the taking itself was unlawful but rather only to conclude that
the independent obligation to compensate has not been satisfied."°

Moreover, in Mondev v. USA, the tribunal found:

"[Flor a taking to be lawful under Article 1110 [NAFTA], at least the
obligation to compensate must be recognised by the taking State at the
time of the taking, or a procedure must exist at that time which the
claimant may effectively and promptly invoke in order to ensure com-
pensation."°*

Further, Respondent contends that in CDSE v. Costa Rica, the fact that Costa Rica had
expropriated the property and had not paid compensation for 20 years did not render the
expropriation unlawful.© In Amoco, the tribunal held that there was no unlawful expro-
priation even though there was no payment of compensation at the time of the taking.°°°

Respondent also submits that, in American International Group v. Iran, the tribunal held
that the nationalization of shares in an Iranian insurance company was lawful where Iran

3 Counter-Memorial, J 162; Exhibit RL-099. Judge Brower further noted: "If, on the other hand, no provision
for compensation is made contemporaneously with the taking, or one is made which clearly cannot produce the
required compensation, or unreasonably insufficient compensation is paid at the time of taking, it would seem
appropriate to deem the taking itself wrongful. It is in such cases that restitutio in integrum may be appropriate
as a remedy that, in addition to that, or to a monetary award of damages, should that alternative be selected, a

tribunal might consider an award of punitive damages."

had recognized the obligation to compensate, even though no compensation had been
paid.°”

In Southern Pacific Properties v. Egypt, the tribunal did not consider the expropriation of

the claimant unlawful, although no compensation had been paid for 13 years.

Moreover, Respondent contends that in LIAMCO v. Libya, the tribunal held that even
though no compensation had been paid, the nationalization of the claimant's concession
interests was lawful because Libya had recognized its obligation to compensate.°?

Similarly, in Aminoil v. Kuwait, the tribunal held that the nationalization of Aminoil’s
concession was lawful despite the fact that compensation had not been paid.°!°

Finally, Respondent observes that, analyzing Article 5(2) of the France-Poland Treaty,
which is in material respects similar to Article 5(1) of the France-Venezuela Treaty, the
tribunal in Servier v. Poland specifically found that the question whether the expropria-
tion was legal or not did not turn on whether compensation had been paid.°!!

bb) Compensation Standard to Be Applied

Respondent submits that, regardless of whether the expropriation was lawful or unlawful,
the proper valuation date is prior to the "threat of expropriation," as set out in Article 5(1)
subparagraph 2 of the Treaty.°!” During the Hearing, Respondent emphasized that, while
it maintains its position that the expropriation occurred only on 29 March 2011, it never-
theless considers 15 May 2010 to be the correct valuation date because the expropriation

was announced by President Chavez on that date.°!

Respondent refers to the, in its view, clear and unambiguous wording of Article 5(1) sub-
paragraph 2 of the Treaty, according to which the value of the expropriated asset is to "be
assessed in relation to the normal economic situation prevailing before any threat of ex-
propriation was of public knowledge."*'* It is Respondent's submission that the reference
to "[t]outes les mesures d'expropriation qui pourraient étre prises", "[t]odas las medidas
de expropiacion que pudieran tomarse" ("[a]ll measures of expropriation which could be

taken") comprises both lawful and unlawful expropriations and is, in particular, not lim-
ited to expropriations in compliance with the requirements set out in Article 5(1) subpar-
agraph | of the Treaty.

Respondent argues that any delay in payment of compensation can be fully compensated
by an award of interest and claims that an evaluation of the asset as of the date of the
award would impose a pecuniary penalty on Respondent.°'> In particular, Respondent
contends that Claimant has not established that it suffered any damage that could not be

compensated in full by an amount determined as of 15 May 2010.°!°

Moreover, it is Respondent's position that, in case of a mere failure of the State to
promptly specify and pay compensation, even the compensation standard under custom-
ary international law does not allow for calculating damages by way of "constructing a
‘but-for' world in which the possibility of expropriation is excluded until the date of the
award," as Claimant contends. Respondent refers to the "fundamental distinction" be-
tween a situation in which the expropriation is prohibited no matter how it is carried out
and the situation in which the expropriation as such is permitted but the manner in which
it is carried out fails to comply with the conditions set out in the treaty.°!? According to
Respondent, this position is in line with the PCIJ's Chorzéw Factory decision, which also

distinguishes between those two situations.°!®

c) The Tribunal's Analysis

In determining the applicable compensation standard and the relevant valuation date, the
Tribunal will first consider whether the expropriation was unlawful and whether this has
any impact on the compensation standard to be applied in the present case (aa)). Subse-
quently, the Tribunal will assess the applicable compensation standard and in particular
the applicable valuation date (bb)).

aa) Relevance of a Finding of Unlawfulness

The Tribunal notes that the existing case law referred to by the Parties in relation to the
question whether or not a breach of the requirement to specify and/or promptly pay com-
pensation renders the expropriation unlawful, appears to be inconsistent. This indicates
that the individual circumstances of each case as well as the individual BIT standard
played a decisive role for the respective tribunal's finding.

In the present case, it could be argued, on the one hand, that Respondent's failure to carry
out the expropriation in accordance with the compensation requirements set out in Article
5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty renders the expropriation unlawful, i.e., in vio-
lation of Respondent's obligations under the Treaty. If the Tribunal were to follow this
argument, the label of "wnlawfulness" would not entail any indication that Respondent
was precluded from expropriating Norpro Venezuela per se; it would simply serve as a
synonym for an expropriation that was carried out in breach of a provision that the Con-
tracting Parties agreed on in relation to the manner in which the expropration was sup-
posed to be carried out.

On the other hand, it must be noted that Article 5(1) subparagraph 1 of the Treaty explic-
itly stipulates certain conditions under which an expropriation is permitted, i.e., the exist-
ence of a public purpose as well as the absence of discriminatory treatment and of a con-
flict with a particular agreement. This subparagraph does not, however, make any refer-
ence to compensation, which is rather addressed in two separate subparagraphs. As a re-
sult, it could be argued that there should be a difference between the conditions set out in
subparagraph 1, in the absence of which Respondent would have been precluded from
expropriating Norpro Venezuela per se, and the requirements set out in subparagraphs 2
and 3, which relate to the manner in which the expropriation has to be carried out.

At this point, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that the distinction between a lawful and
an unlawful expropriation should not be an end in itself, but the question whether an
expropriation is labelled "wnlawful" should rather be considered in light of the conse-
quences resulting from such a finding.

602.

603.

604.

Page 151 of 234

As noted above, the dispute between the Parties as to these consequences is focused on
the question of which compensation standard has to be applied: While a lawful expropri-
ation undisputedly results in an obligation to pay compensation, which is calculated pur-
suant to the standard set out in Article 5(1) of the Treaty, the Parties are in dispute as to
whether the same compensation standard also applies in case the Tribunal finds that the
expropriation was unlawful.

Considering the foregoing, the Tribunal is of the view that it is not appropriate to make a

 

finding on whether the label "unlawfulness
Norpro Venezuela, without at the same time taking into account the consequences that

should be attributed to the expropriation of

such a finding would have for the compensation standard to be applied. Moreover, this
question can be left open if, due to the recent developments on the proppants market, both
compensation standards advanced by the Parties would result in the same amount of com-
pensation to be paid to Claimant.

Therefore, the Tribunal will now turn to the question whether the compensation standard
set out therein also applies in case of a breach of the compensation requirements set out
in its subparagraphs 2 and 3.

bb) Analysis of Article 5(1) of the Treaty

Article 5(1) of the Treaty provides in its original French and Spanish versions:

"Les Parties contractantes ne pren-
nent pas de mesures d'expropria-
tion ou de nationalisation ou toutes
autres mesures dont l'effet est de
déposséder, directement ou indi-
rectement, les nationaux et sociétés

sures ne soient ni discriminatoires,

The Tribunal notes that Article 5(1) of the Treaty has a clear structure: Systematically,
subparagraph | prohibits expropriatory measures in principle. However, such measures
can be justified if: (i) they are based on a sufficient public purpose; (ii) they are not dis-
criminatory; and (iii) they are not contrary to a particular agreement. Subparagraphs 2
and 3 provide for additional requirements and/or consequences of an expropriation,
namely prompt and adequate compensation (subparagraph 2) as well as specification of
the amount and effectiveness of compensation (subparagraph 3).

Whether or not the compensation standard contained in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and
3 of the Treaty applies only to an expropriation that is in conformity with the requirements
set out in subparagraph | and/or the additional requirements set out in the very same
subparagrahs 2 and 3 depends in particular on the interpretation of the terms "[t]outes les
mesures d'expropriation qui pourraient étre prises" /"[t]odas las medidas de expropiacién
que pudieran tomarse."

On the one hand, the organization of Article 5(1) with three unnumbered subparagraphs
suggests that they must be read to be compatible with each other. While subparagraph 1
contains the requirements "in the public interest" and "neither discriminatory, nor con-
trary to a particular agreement," it does not make reference to compensation, which is

addressed in subparagraphs 2 and 3. It could be argued that "[a]// measures of expropria-
tion which could be taken" refers to all "lawful" measures, i.e., those taken within the
terms laid out in Article 5(1) as a whole. This view could further be supported by the fact
that the requirements set out in subparagraph 3 are tied, by the words "[c]ette indem-
nité"/"[e]sa indemnizaci6n," to the valuation as set out in subparagraph 2. As a result, a
failure to fix the amount and payment method of the value as calculated according to
subparagraph 2 not later than on the date of expropriation could result in the inapplicabil-
ity of the compensation standard contained in Article 5(1) because the compensation was
not "prompt" and therefore in breach of this very same provision.

On the other hand, the structure of Article 5(1) could also be interpreted to distinguish
between (substantive) requirements set out in subparagraph 1, in the absence of which the
expropriation would be precluded per se and thus be "unlawful," and (additional) com-
pensation requirements set out in subparagraphs 2 and 3, which do not relate to the law-
fulness of the expropriation. It could be argued that "[a]// measures of expropriation
which could be taken" refers to any measures, whether in compliance with Article 5(1) or
not, i.e, without adding any qualifications extraneous to the text itself. The fact that sub-
paragraphs 2 and 3 are linked by the words "[c]ette indemnité"/"[e]sa indemnizacion"
could also indicate that the absence of such an explicit link between subparagraphs | and
2 should be interpreted to mean that the compensation requirements apply to all expro-
priations.

Considering the foregoing, the Tribunal is faced with competing interpretations of Article
5(1) of the Treaty. In particular, the phrase "[a]// measures of expropriation which could
be taken" and mote specifically, the word "could," is equally susceptible to two interpre-
tations: either it includes all measures that the State is permitted to take, or it includes all
measures that the State could possibly take.

However, the question of the precise relationship between the three subparagraphs of Ar-
ticle 5(1) and the compensation standard to be applied need not be decided if, as noted
above, both compensation standards advanced by the Parties would result in the same
amount of compensation to be paid to Claimant. In this regard, it has to be emphasized
that both Parties are in agreement that, in case the date-of-expropriation valuation yields
a higher value than the date-of-the-award valuation, the Tribunal should determine the
amount of compensation to be paid to Claimant based on the value as of the date of ex-
propriation.°*

As per the Tribunal's request dated 13 August 2015, both Parties instructed their experts
to update their date-of-the-award valuations and to evaluate the plant as of 31 August

615.

2015. These Valuation Updates were simultaneously submitted on 22 October 2015,°*

and both Parties had the opportunity to simultaneously submit comments on the opposing
Party's Valuation Update. As per this date, both experts calculated a value of the plant
that was lower than the value they had calculated for the plant as of the date of expropri-
ation. Specifically, Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller calculated the value of the plant as of
31 August 2015 at USD 90.3 million (compared to USD 99.5 million as of 15 May
2010).°” According to Respondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, the plant had
anegative value of USD 27.6 million as of 31 August 2015 (compared to a positive value
of USD 9.5 million as of 15 May 2010).°8

In light of these developments, Claimant explicitly requested in its letter dated 6 Novem-
ber 2015 that it be awarded compensation in the amount of USD 99.5 million plus pre-
award interest, i.e., the value that it claims Norpro Venezuela had as of 15 May 2010.9

As a result, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding in this context as to whether the
compensation standard to be applied is the standard contained in Article 5(1) subpara-
graphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty or rather the customary international law standard of restitu-
tion. In any event, the amount of compensation to be paid to Claimant will be based on
the valuation of Norpro Venezuela as of the date of expropriation, i.e., 15 May 2010.

2. Criteria for the Calculation of Damages

The Tribunal will now turn to the criteria for the calculation of Claimant's damages. In
this context, the Tribunal will first determine the relevant valuation method (a)), then
determine the criteria for assessing the value of Norpro Venezuela based on that method
(b)) and finally deal with the alleged historical losses associated with the increase of the
bauxite price (c)).

a) Valuation Approach

aa) Summary of Claimant's Position

635 See Claimant's Valuation Update and Respondent's Valuation Update, both dated 22 October 2015.

636 See Claimant's letter and Respondent's letter, both dated 6 November 2015.

637 Given Prof. Spiller's approach to consider the lower of (i) the DCF-based value including historical but-for cash
flows (if applicable); and (ii) the construction costs for a comparable plant including lost cash flows during the
construction period, as the value to be compensated by Respondent, the figure as of 15 May 2010 reflects the
construction costs (compared to a DCF-based value of USD 116.4 million including the bauxite price increase).
By contrast, the value as of 31 August 2015 reflects the DCF-based value (compared to construction costs of USD
94.8 million). See Claimant's Valuation Update, Table 1.

638 In Dr. Flores and Mr. Brailovsky's calculation, both figures reflect the DCF-based value of the plant including
historical but-for cash flows (if applicable). Respondent's Valuation Update, Table 1 and {8 (note 18).

616. Claimant submits that Respondent must pay full compensation for the expropriated plant
and refers to the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment
of 1992 (the "World Bank Guidelines") pursuant to which compensation for expropria-
tion "will be deemed 'adequate' if it is based on the fair market value of the taken asset."**°

617. While Claimant maintains that the compensation standard in Article 5(1) of the Treaty is
not applicable in the present case, but that compensation must rather be determined in
line with the standard of full reparation standard of customary international law, Claimant
emphasizes that the Treaty itself reflects the "fair market value" principle in its standard

for calculating the compensation for a lawful expropriation.*!

618. Claimant also refers to the commentary on the ILC Draft Articles pursuant to which
"[c]ompensation reflecting the capital value of property taken or destroyed as the result
of an internationally wrongful act is generally assessed on the basis of the ‘fair market
value’ of the property lost."°

619. Claimant further refers to the definition of fair market value in Starret Housing Corp v.
Tran:

"the price that a willing buyer would buy given goods at and the price
at which a willing seller would sell it in on the condition that none of
the parties [is] under any kind of duress and that both parties have good
information about all relevant circumstances involved in the pur-
chase."

620. As the investment was a "going concern," Claimant argues that the assessment of the fair
market value must take into account the plant's future profitability and prospects. In this
regard, Claimant refers to its expert on quantum, Prof. Spiller, who suggests that a third-
party buyer would pay the lower of (i) the net present value of the cash flows that a willing
buyer could obtain from acquiring a 100% stake in Norpro Venezuela; and (ii) the oppor-
tunity cost that a willing buyer would incur if it constructed a similar plant outside Ven-
ezuela, which consists of the sum of construction costs plus the foregone cash flows dur-

ing the construction period.

621.

As to the second approach, Claimant submits that the "most accurate information avail-
able" is the actual construction costs of Claimant's ceramic proppants plant in Little Rock,

Arkansas (United States) finished in late 2013 which — like Norpro Venezuela — produces
the highest quality bauxite-based ceramic proppants by means of a dry-process technol-
ogy. Claimant argues that apart from the fact that there is no comparable plant in Ven-
ezuela, the costs are the same regardless of whether the similar plant is built in the US or
in Venezuela because "the plants have similar risk-adjusted cost structures" and "the cost
advantages and disadvantages associated with a particular location can offset one an-

other."

According to the calculation of Prof. Spiller as of 15 May 2010, the opportunity cost for
the construction of a similar plant in the US would be lower than the net present value of
Norpro Venezuela s future cash flows (USD 99.5 million compared to USD 115.1 mil-
lion). Consequently, Claimant is of the view that the Tribunal should determine the fair

market value of the expropriated plant based on the construction cost approach.™7

bb) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent agrees that the amount of compensation to be paid should reflect the fair
market value of the plant as a going concern, i.e., "the amount that a willing buyer would
pay to a willing seller." Respondent further agrees that this figure can be determined by
assessing the "projected cash flows [...] based on reasonable assumptions as of May 15,
2010 and discounted to their net present value as of that date using an appropriate dis-

count rate."

In response to Claimant's reliance on the full reparation standard of customary interna-
tional law, Respondent claims that the standard set out in Article 5(1) of the Treaty is
"consistent with both traditional and contemporary notions of ‘full’ or 'adequate' compen-

sation."

Respondent sees no need to consider Prof. Spiller's approach to compare the DCF-based
valuation with the opportunity costs of constructing a similar plant in any detail because
according to its experts on quantum, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, those costs would
exceed the price that a willing buyer would pay for Claimant's plant (USD 43.7 million
plus foregone cash flows of USD 1.3 million as of 15 May 2010 compared to USD 9.5
million).°°

626. In any event, Respondent emphasizes that the asset to be evaluated in the present case is
a stand-alone plant in Venezuela, not in the United States, and therefore argues that the
only appropriate way of assessing the compensation to be paid to Claimant is to apply a
DCF analysis, including a discount rate that accounts for the fact that the plant is located

651

in Venezuela.””’ If one were to assess the construction costs, Respondent argues that one

would have to assess the costs in Venezuela (not in the US) and based on assumptions

"consistent with the DCF analysis that is being used for comparative purposes."°>

cc) The Tribunal's Analysis

627. At the outset, the Tribunal notes the Parties' agreement that the compensation to be paid
by Respondent for the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela should reflect the fair market
value of the plant as a going concern as of 15 May 2010.°% First, this value reflects the
compensation standard contained in Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty,
which provides that compensation must be equal to the "actual value" ("valeur réelle" /
"valor real") of the going concern Norpro Venezuela. Second, the fair market value also
reflects the compensation standard under customary international law as reflected in the
ILC Draft Articles and the World Bank Guidelines. While Article 35 of the ILC Draft
Articles provides that, primarily, the State has to make restitution for the damage caused,
Article 36 states that, subsidiarily ("insofar as such damage is not made good by restitu-
tion"), the State has to pay compensation, which "shall cover any financially assessable
damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established."°* As correctly pointed out
by Claimant, the ILC states in the Commentary to Article 36 that "[c]ompensation re-
flecting the capital value of property taken or destroyed as the result of an internationally
wrongful act is generally assessed on the basis of the 'fair market value' of the property
lost."° The World Bank Guidelines similarly provide with regard to expropriations that
"[c]ompensation will be deemed ‘adequate’ if it is based on the fair market value of the
taken asset."*°° Consequently, the Tribunal again does not have to decide on the applica-
ble compensation standard in the present case because both standards require the deter-
mination of Norpro Venezuela's fair market value as of 15 May 2010.

3 The Tribunal notes that both Parties repeatedly refer to "the Plant" as the expropriated asset. As Respondent
correctly stated in its Counter-Memorial ({ 188), however, the asset to be valued in the present case is "the Plant
being operated as a going concern." The Tribunal will thus refer to the expropriated asset as "Norpro Venezuela"
or "the going concern."

The Parties further agree that the fair market value is equal to the amount that a willing
buyer would pay to a willing seller, provided that the buyer is informed about all relevant
circumstances and none of the parties is under any kind of duress to sell or to acquire the
asset.°°” This is confirmed by the World Bank Guidelines, which also refer to the "amount
that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller" taking into account all rele-
vant circumstances. °*

Finally, the Parties are in agreement that, as the plant was a going concern prior to its
expropriation, its fair market value can be assessed by calculating the net present value
of Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows. Consequently, both Parties' experts have calcu-
lated the future cash flows of the going concern and then applied a discount rate to those
cash flows in order to obtain their net present value.

However, Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller has advanced a further approach to calculate the
value, i.e., by assessing the opportunity cost of constructing a comparable plant in the US
(consisting of the construction cost plus lost cash flows during the construction period).
According to Prof. Spiller, a willing buyer would pay only the lower of the amounts ob-
tained by applying the DCF-method on the one hand and the construction cost approach
on the other hand. Therefore, he has compared the two values and concluded that the
construction cost value as of 15 May 2010 (USD 99.5 million) is lower than the DCF
value as of that date (USD 115.1 million) and thus reflects the value to be compensated

by Respondent.°?

It appears to the Tribunal that Respondent does not contest Prof. Spiller's approach to
compare the two values as such but rather (i) claims that the comparison would have to
be made to a plant located in Venezuela and consistent with the assumptions applied in
the DCF calculation; and (ii) in any event considers the construction cost approach irrel-
evant in light of its experts’ conclusion that the DCF value of Norpro Venezuela (USD
9.5 million) is lower than the opportunity costs of a similar plant in the US (USD 43.7
million plus foregone cash flows of USD 1.3 million as of 15 May 2010).°°

At this point, the Tribunal wishes to express its doubts as to the general applicability of
the approach to determine the fair market value of a particular asset, such as the going
concern in this case, by assessing the opportunity cost of constructing a different plant.
In particular, the Tribunal is not convinced that, even if the opportunity costs were to be

lower than the DCF-based value of Norpro Venezuela, this would result in a lower fair
market value of Claimant's investment under any of the compensation standards advanced
in this case.

However, the Tribunal does not have to form a definite opinion on the general suitability
of this approach because, in any event, the Tribunal considers that the calculations of the
opportunity cost performed by the Parties' experts are inconclusive under the present cir-
cumstances. Specifically, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that a plant located in Lit-
tle Rock, Arkansas, cannot be compared to the going concern to be evaluated in this ar-
bitration. The same must apply to the comparison made by Respondent's experts to an
average of other plants located in the US.

Claimant itself acknowledges that there are "cost advantages and disadvantages associ-
ated with a particular location" but argues that these "can offset one another."©! The
Tribunal is aware that Prof. Spiller explained during the Hearing that he applied an ad-
justment factor to account for "Economies of Scale and Scope Differences," which in his
view offset one another. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that this adjustment
factor accounts for all differences to be taken into account when looking at highly spe-
cialized production facilities in two markets, which are as different as the mature US
market and the emerging Venezuelan market.

As neither Party alleges that there exists a comparable plant in Venezuela, the Tribunal
will therefore disregard the construction cost approach and determine the criteria for as-
sessing the fair market value of Norpro Venezuela on a going concern basis, i.e., based
on the DCF calculation performed by the experts of both Parties for the valuation date of
15 May 2010.

b) DCF-Based Fair Market Value of Norpro Venezuela

While the Parties agree that the discounted cash flow analysis is in principle an appropri-
ate method to determine the value of Norpro Venezuela, their experts arrive at signifi-
cantly differing results for such value as of 15 May 2010, i.e., between USD 115.1 million
as calculated by Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller and USD 9.5 million as calculated by
Respondent's experts Dr. Flores and Mr. Brailovsky. The biggest point of disagreement
between the experts relates to the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows;
therefore, the Tribunal will address this issue first (aa)). In a second step, the Tribunal
will address the additional points of disagreement regarding the calculation of Norpro
Venezuela's future cash flows (bb)). As determined above, the Tribunal will assess both

the applicable discount rate and the future cash flows from the perspective of a willing
buyer as of 15 May 2010.

aa) Discount Rate

(@ Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant submits that Respondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied "an
absurdly high discount rate of 26%," which results in a value that implies that "no rea-
sonable investor would invest in a new proppant plant, or add capacity to an existing

proppant plant."°©

Claimant claims that the 26% discount rate is unprecedented and more than double the
discount rate that tribunals typically adopt in ICSID arbitrations. According to Claimant,
the US cost of equity they propose is "entirely afield of any other estimate found in the
record" and further inconsistent with Claimant's own calculation for the project in 2006,
considering that interest rates have fallen since then.

In particular, Claimant rejects Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' use of a 2.66% "size pre-
mium" because (i) literature is "inconclusive" as regards the applicability to foreign in-
vestments; (ii) Prof. Damodaran has rejected it as duplicative; and (iii) its application
would double count the country risk in Venezuela where Norpro Venezuela cannot be
classified as a small company.°® Claimant further rejects the use of a risk-free rate based
on the spot yield to maturity of 20-year US Treasury bonds on the valuation date and
notes that the 10-year bond used by Prof. Spiller is recommended by Prof. Damodaran
and reflects the fact that majority of cash flows in the experts' models are received in ten
years or less.

With regard to the market risk premium (MRP), Claimant alleges that the average histor-
ical premium used by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores is not appropriate in light of the
proximity of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, which "distorts the MRP from historical re-
turns." According to Claimant, this development led Prof. Damodaran to replace this

method by a recommendation that is based on "an extensive study of methods," which still

includes the historical average as the highest premium.”

641. Claimant further argues that the "exorbitant" country risk premium of 13.92% that Mr.
Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied for Venezuela is a "desperate way for a State to try to
evade responsibility for its actions." According to Claimant, this spike reflects President
Chavez's threats to expropriate all foreign investments in Venezuela without compensa-
tion. Claimant argues, however, that a State "may not use its own propensity to violate
the law to reduce the value of compensation for the expropriation." It therefore takes
the position that the "generalized threat of confiscation" has to be eliminated from the
calculation of the fair market value because Respondent would otherwise be rewarded for

the unlawful conduct that this arbitration is meant to remedy.°”

642. Claimant emphasizes that this logic should apply for both lawful and unlawful expropri-
ations because both the Treaty standard and the customary international law standard re-
quire that "any valuation of the asset taken eliminate the State's threats to confiscate the
asset taken." While acknowledging that the tribunals in Tidewater v. Venezuela, Mobil v.
Venezuela and Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela have chosen not to follow this approach
in case of a lawful expropriation, Claimant claims that no tribunal has done the same in

economy, civil disorder, less developed infrastructure, and other issues." Claimant sub-

mits that Prof. Spiller took the average spread of sovereign bonds of countries with a B1

rating such as Venezuela, which includes many developing countries with "significant

country risk, including political risks."°7

644. Claimant alleges that Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' approach based on the Country
Risk Rating Model (CRRM), on the other hand, "by definition incorporates [institutional]
investors’ perception of the risk of investing in Venezuela under the current politico-eco-
nomic conditions, including that of uncompensated expropriations." Similarly, Claimant
contends that the "extremely high" Venezuelan sovereign bond spread pursuant to the
EMBI Index does not reflect Venezuela's lack of capacity to pay (as reflected in its B1
rating) but rather its lack of willingness to pay.°”*

645. In relation to the CRRM, Claimant submits that it is not only "inherently unreliable" but
particularly inapt in the present "complex politico-economic situation" in Venezuela. In
response to the argument that the CRRM has produced "constant" rates over the last
twenty years, Claimant argues that this is inconsistent with Respondent's argument that
the country risk has increased since 2005 when Claimant invested in Venezuela and the
EMBI was around 2%.°”° Claimant also rejects Respondent's argument that the EMBI has
been at an average of 10% over the same time period because this time horizon includes
anumber of "outliers" in the country's history, which had "extreme effect" on the govern-
ment but not on private investors, and therefore renders the EMBI an "artificial rate that
reflects political expectations rather than economic assessments."°"°

Claimant argues that one way to "check" this is to look at the CDS spreads outstanding on countries’ sovereign

of 4.5% would rank as the fourth-highest after Argentina (14.73%), Venezuela (10.8%) and Tunisia (4.57%) and

Therefore, Claimant concludes that the difference between the country risk premia calcu-
lated by Prof. Spiller and Mr. Brailovsky, respectively, is "largely attributable to Vene-
zuela's confiscation threats."°" It emphasizes that in OJ European v. Venezuela, Vene-
zuela's own experts calculated a 2010 country risk premium of 6%.°7®

Claimant further contends that it also took Venezuela's "heightened country risk" into
account when it assigned a discount rate of 15% to the project in 2006 and undertook
significant efforts to secure meaningful support of the Venezuelan Government, in reli-
ance on the fact that the France-Venezuela Treaty had entered into force in 2004.9”
Claimant emphasizes that the "high risk" discount rate of 12%, which included a country
risk premium of 4%, was not assigned by the members of the project team (they even
added a further 3% "to be conservative"), but rather served as a "company-wide objective
measure to consider the potential risks and rewards of proposed ventures in various lo-
cations."°°°

In Claimant's view, an investor like Saint-Gobain is "immune from the vast majority of
risk factors" that are included in Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores' country risk premium.
Claimant contends that (i) the proppants produced by Norpro Venezuela's activity were
to be exported under a long-term take-or-pay contract; (ii) Norpro Venezuela had con-
cluded long-term supply contracts for bauxite and energy; and (iii) Venezuela's sovereign
credit risk, which forms the basis for Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' calculation, is in-
fluenced by its risk of entering into default and therefore does not accurately reflect the
country risk of Claimant's long-term, non-speculative investment in Venezuela.**!

In Claimant's view, particularly the fact that Norpro Venezuela derived more than 80%
of its revenues from exports made it subject to a lower country risk than the average
Venezuelan company, which has to face the stagnant consumer demand. Claimant refers
to a statement made by Prof. Damodaran that "[t]he most obvious determinant of a com-

  

pany's risk exposure to country risk is how much of the revenues it derives from the coun-
try."°°2 Claimant further emphasizes that Norpro Venezuela was not a natural resources
company but a manufacturing company "twice removed from the oil industry" and thus
was not affected by the "typical reasons for political risk" affecting oil companies. As
to the further risks invoked by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, Claimant claims that they

Summary of Respondent's Position

for a company such as Norpro Venezuela operating in a mature economy." Respondent
argues that (i) Prof. Spiller deviated from the risk-free-rate suggested by Ibbotson/Morn-
ingstar for long-term projects, i.e., the 20-year US Treasury bond yield as of the valuation
date; (ii) he deviated from the general market risk premium (MRP) calculated by Ibbot-
son/Morningstar; and (iii) he "ignore[d] the empirical evidence establishing that the
CAPM tends to underestimate the cost of equity for financial assets," which is corrected

by the alpha coefficient.°5

651.

First, Respondent argues that it is appropriate to use the 20-year US Treasury bond as the

 

risk-free rate in this case, given the "perpetuity" nature of the cash flows that are being
valued.°*° Second, Respondent claims that the view of Prof. Damodaran as to the appro-
priate MRP that Prof. Spiller relies on "fluctuates from year to year and sometimes even
within the same year, is not based on an analysis of the underlying empirical data, and
cannot be replicated."**" Respondent further refers to the tribunal in Tidewater v. Vene-
zuela, which determined that an equity risk premium of 6.5% was reasonable in a valua-
tion as of May 2009.%** Third, Respondent rejects Claimant's argument that the alpha
coefficient is a size premium and notes that this coefficient, while "more pronounced in
small companies (which is why it attracts the ‘size premium’ label)," applies to companies
of all sizes. In any event, Respondent claims that Norpro Venezuela would indeed qualify

 

as a small company in the US, which is why the alpha coefficient should be added to the
US cost of equity.°*?

652. Respondent contends that these differences cause Prof. Spiller's estimate of the cost of
equity in the US to be considerably lower than "a range of independent results for SIC
Code 1381, using the basic CAPM and varations thereon," which are very similar to the
cost of equity estimated by Respondent's experts and in fact almost equal to the total
discount rate applied by Prof. Spiller.°°

653. According to Respondent, the biggest difference between the experts' estimates, however,
concerns the applicable country risk premium. Respondent claims that this premium is
"far higher" than the 4.5% applied by Prof. Spiller, which in fact does not reflect Vene-
zuelan country risk but rather the default risk on US corporate bonds.°?! Respondent re-
fers to the calculations of its experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores who primarily relied
on the Country Risk Rating Model (CRRM) compiled by Ibbotson/Morningstar and
cross-checked their results by using the so-called "bludgeon method" devised by Prof.
Damodaran.°”

654. In response to Claimant's criticism on the CRRM, Respondent refers to Prof. Ibbotson
who stated that the CRRM has the following advantages over other cost of equity models:
"1. Breadth of coverage; 2. Reasonable results; 3. Stability of results." Respondent
further refers to its experts who demonstrate that the results the CRRM has produced over

the last 20 years for Venezuela are stable and in line with Prof. Damodaran's methodol-

ogy.°

655. With regard to Claimant's criticism on the EMBI spread that Respondent's experts used
to derive the yield on Venezuela's sovereign debt over the US treasury bond yield, Re-
spondent acknowledges that the spread is indeed "very high" but argues that it is in no
way comparable to an actual default situation as Argentina experienced in 2001 through
2003 when the EMBI increased to 50% and more.°>

656. By contrast, Respondent claims that the 4.5% premium applied by Prof. Spiller does not
reflect Prof. Damodaran's methodology because Prof. Damodaran's interactive spread-
sheet demonstrates that his "best estimate" is actually based on the "bludgeon method,"
including the application of the 1.5 multiplier, and is thus in line with the estimate of
Respondent's experts.®° According to Respondent, Prof. Damodaran establishes in his

QW 32-35. As to the numbers presented by Prof. Spiller during the Hearing, Respondent contends that the source
he relies on are "irrelevant to the determination of the discount rate in this case," as Claimant's internal estimate
dates of 2005 and the round figures derived from two analyst reports indicate that they were not the result of
detailed calculations but simply part of a "buy" recommendation and further relate to the market for financial
instruments, which is "entirely different" from the market for physical assets. Respondent's Post-Hearing Reply

writings "a hierarchy of methods to derive a country default spread" and states that if a
country has USD-denominated bonds, the default spread should be derived by looking at
the yield of those bonds over the risk-free bond in the same currency or the spread in the
CDS market. Respondent further claims that Prof. Damodaran suggests the alternative
approach based on comparably rated US corporate bonds ("synthetic spread") only "as a
last resort," in case the country in question — unlike Venezuela — does not have USD-

denominated bonds.”

Respondent claims that Prof. Damodaran's preferred method is an "obvious first choice"
because "specific data for the country in question is undoubtedly a better indicator of [the
market's perception of] risk than a synthetic indicator." According to Respondent, both
Venezuela's EMBI spread and its spread in the CDS market would have yielded a default
spread of about 10%, to be converted into an equity risk premium of about 15%. Accord-
ing to Respondent, the same applies to the second method advanced by Prof. Damodaran,
ie., the "Average (Normalized) spread on bond," as the average spread on Venezuela's
sovereign bonds over the entire life of the EMBI since 1993 was 10%.°8

Respondent further rejects Claimant's allegation that Norpro Venezuela was immune
from the majority of risk factors reflected in the country risk premium and claims that
none of the arguments advanced by Claimant materially influences Norpro Venezuela's
risk exposure. As to the exporter argument, Respondent refers to its experts’ statement
that "[clountry risk is amuch larger concept than exposure to domestic demand, involving
taxation, regulation and other government actions in the economy, especially in the hy-
drocarbon sector" and adds "the disproportionate effect of natural phenomena such as
storms, floods and droughts."© Respondent further notes that the invoked long-term con-
tracts expire in 2016 (gas and electricity) and 2018 (bauxite) without any automatic right
of renewal or a guaranteed price under a renewal and, in any event, they would not protect
Norpro Venezuela from a disruptions in supply. Finally, Respondent alleges that the ex-
istence of the France-Venezuela BIT has "no discernible impact on the country risk as-
sessment" as confirmed by political risk insurers.””

In Respondent's view, there are therefore no factors specific to Norpro Venezuela that
would reduce its country risk exposure compared to the average Venezuelan company
but, "ifanything, the factors relating to Norpro Venezuela would increase it." Respondent

refers to the possibility of exchange controls on the export of raw materials and further to
Prof. Damodaran's statement that "[a] company can be exposed to country risk, even if it
derives no revenues from that country, if its production facilities are in that country."7!
Respondent quotes from the oral testimony of Mr. Brailovsky, who stated that "natural
resource projects, particularly oil or oil-related, bear more Country Risk than the aver-
age company" and cited as an example the suspension of bauxite supply combined with
import restrictions.”

660. While acknowledging that the valuation must exclude the impact of the actual expropri-
ation of the plant, Respondent argues that this "should not be confused with the expropri-
ation risk inherent in any project from its very inception," which is part of the "normal
economic situation prevailing" prior to the announcement of the expropriation of the plant
and therefore also a risk that a willing buyer would take into account in its assessment of

the purchase price it would be willing to pay for the plant.7°°

661.

Respondent emphasizes that Article 5(1) of the Treaty requires compensation to be equal
to the "actual value," i.e., the fair market value, of the plant, which takes into account "all
of the generalized risks associated with an investment in Venezuela," including "the risk
that after the acquisition is completed, Venezuela might expropriate and either not com-
pensate at all or compensate only in an amount and in a manner that the buyer might
deem unfair.""*

662. Contrary to what Claimant appeared to suggest during the Hearing, Respondent is of the
view that the determination of fair market value does not change depending on whether
the expropriation is lawful or unlawful. According to Respondent, the willing buyer
would be indifferent to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the expropriation because the
particular expropriation is to be excluded from the buyer's consideration. Respondent
adds that the buyer would, however, take into account the underlying risks, including the
risk of expropriation without compensation that the buyer deems adequate.”

663. Respondent refers to the tribunal's finding in Tidewater v. Venezuela that the claimant's

expert, who had advanced the same argument as in the present case, "conflates two sepa-

rate elements in a legal claim of this kind," i.e., the question of liability and the economic

be limited to cases in which the State refuses to acknowledge its compensation obligation and to participate in the

question as to the value that the market would attribute to the investment in question; the
tribunal then referred to the World Bank Guidelines, which "specifically invite a consid-
eration of ‘the risk associated with such cash flow under realistic circumstances'."”"° Re-
spondent further quotes the tribunal's following statement:

"This is not a matter of permitting a respondent State to profit from its

own wrong. On the contrary, the damages that the Tribunal is empow-

ered by virtue of the Treaty to award are designed to ensure that the

private investor is compensated for the loss of its investment. But, in

determining the amount of that compensation by reference to a dis-

counted cash flow analysis, the Tribunal should consider the value that

a willing buyer would have placed on the investment. In determining

this value, one element that a buyer would consider is the risk associ-

ated with investing in a particular country. Such a factor is not specific

to the particular State measure that gives rise to the claim. [...] Rather

the country risk premium quantifies the general risks, including politi-

cal risks, of doing business in the particular country, as they applied on

that date and as they might then reasonably have been expected to affect

the prospects, and thus the value to be ascribed to the likely cash flow

of the business going forward."""

Respondent argues that the country risk premium must be based on the buyer's perception
of risk; the elimination of the risks inherent to an investment in Venezuela would result
in "the use of a discount rate that a willing buyer would not use and derive a value that a
willing buyer would not pay, thereby granting Claimant a windfall that it could never
achieve in an arm's-length transaction." In Respondent's view, this would further be pu-
nitive to Venezuela and thus "impermissible under any theory of compensation in inter-

national law."

As to Claimant's emphasis during the Hearing on the 15% discount rate reflected in its 23
October 2006 DAC, Respondent notes that the significance and purpose of this rate re-
mains unclear and further argues that at that time, Venezuela's default risk was "at one of
its all-time lowest points," with the yield of its sovereign bonds being only 2.18% higher
than US Treasury bonds. At that point, Respondent submits, the 3% country risk premium
could have been justified. More importantly, however, Respondent emphasizes that
Claimant took Venezuelan default risk into account in its assessment of the country risk,

Respondent notes that the tribunal found in that case that the failure to pay compensation did not render the expro-
priation unlawful.

approach by Dr. Flores and Mr. Brailovsky who also acted as Venezuela's experts in that case and used the same
approach as in this case, i.e., the CRRM benchmarked against Prof. Damodaran's bludgeon method, and thus
concludes that a country risk premium of 14.75% was a "reasonable, indeed conservative, premium." Respondent's

just like a buyer would in its assessment of an appropriate discount rate for determining
the fair market value of the plant. In Respondent's view, there is then no reason for ex-
cluding such risk when the risk increased with the passage of time.””

Respondent further claims that "there is no way to isolate, and thus quantify" the risk of
uncompensated expropriation. According to Respondent, Prof. Spiller did not propose
any method to do so in his expert reports but argued only at the Hearing that one could
take the difference between the EMBI spread for Venezuela and his 4.5% country risk
premium. Respondent takes the position that Prof. Spiller's argument is based on his
flawed understanding of Prof. Damodaran's hierarchy of methods and argues that "coun-
try risk is composed of elements that are mutually interrelated and influence one another,

and therefore are not separable."""°

In response to Claimant's allegation that Venezuela's sovereign spread was too wide be-
cause it openly declared that it would not comply with its international obligations, Re-
spondent notes that Claimant cannot cite any evidence for those "incredible propositions"
and claims that "Venezuela has not defaulted on any of its sovereign debt obligations, and
Venezuela has paid compensation in its expropriation cases.""!

Respondent further rejects Claimant's argument that Prof. Spiller took into account coun-
try-specific risks except for the risk of uncompensated expropriation and claims that he
just applied an assumption that every country with a B1 rating could be assigned a 4.5%
yield spread, without doing any analysis whether this actually reflected the average sov-
ereign bond spread of other countries with the same rating.”'? In particular, Respondent
emphasizes that Prof. Spiller did not assess the yield on developing countries with the
same rating that Claimant refers to but simply accepted Prof. Damodaran's 4.5% spread
applied to all B1-rated countries on the assumption that their sovereign ratings are com-
parable to US corporate ratings. According to Respondent, however, the yields for those
15 countries according to the CRRM were actually around 15%, just like the yield for

Venezuela. ”43

79 Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, {J 158-162. Respondent further notes that the same document reflects that
Claimant was willing to invest in Venezuela at an internal rate of return of 26.4%. Therefore, Respondent argues
that, while still being 3% higher than Prof. Spiller's discount rate, the 15% discount rate is not relevant in this case.

(iii) The Tribunal's Analysis

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that there is common ground between the Parties and
their experts that the discount rate is derived by (i) determining the cost of equity for a
proppants plant in the US using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), consisting of
the risk-free rate plus a market risk premium; (ii) adding a country risk premium for Ven-
ezuela; and (iii) taking into account the debt-to-equity ratio of the cost of capital.”!4

The Tribunal will therefore follow this structure in the present analysis and determine in
a first step the cost of equity for a company in the same business as Norpro Venezuela in
the US by assessing the risk-free rate in the US ((1)); and the market risk premium in the
US, consisting of a general market risk premium, a beta coefficient and, possibly, an
alpha coefficient ((2)). In a second step, the Tribunal will determine the applicable coun-
try risk premium to account for the fact that the plant is not located in the US but rather
in Venezuela ((3)). Finally, the Tribunal will convert the so derived equity risk premium
into the discount rate for the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on the basis of
Norpro Venezuela's debt-to-equity ratio ((4)).

(1) Risk-Free Rate in the US

The first element of the cost of equity for a company operating in the US is the risk-free
rate. Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller used the average yield on the 10-year US Treasury
bond rate during the 12 months preceding the valuation date, which amounted to 3.6% as
of 15 May 2010.7!5 Respondent's experts Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores relied on the 20-
year US Treasury bond rate prevailing on the valuation date, i.e., on 15 May 2010, which
amounted to 4.1%.’!° The experts thus agree on the use of the US Treasury bond but
differ as to the appropriate maturity and the point in time or term over which the yield is
to be taken into account.

Prof. Spiller explained his choice by stating that the 10-year bond is more liquid and less
sensitive to unexpected changes in inflation than bonds with a longer maturity and thus
avoids "a non-risk-based upward bias" to the cost of capital. He added that the use of the
10-year bond is recommended by academics and practitioners for long-term valuation
purposes "fundamentally, but not exclusively, because of duration matching." Prof.
Spiller further stated that he used the 12-month average yield because it smoothes out

volatilities resulting from short-term fluctuations and is thus more stable and reliable than

the spot yield on the valuation date.”!7

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores stated that the 20-year bond on the valuation date is rec-
ommended by Ibbotson/Morningstar for long-term projects and is thus appropriate for a
DCF valuation of cash flows that continue in perpetuity. As to their choice of the yield
on the valuation date, they stated that it gives credit to the notion of fair market value,
which requires a valuation "immediately before the time at which the taking occurred,"

and the fact that an actual transaction cannot be based on a 365-day average.’!®

The Tribunal notes that in their second report, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores did not
respond to Prof. Spiller's statement that the 10-year bond is the more commonly recom-
mended measure of the risk-free rate, which is particularly due to duration matching.
While the Tribunal is aware of Respondent's argument that the 20-year bond reflects the
duration because the present valuation assumes that cash flows will be generated in per-
petuity,””° it must be noted that this is usually the case in DCF valuations and therefore
does not justify a deviation from a commonly recommended measure. In addition, Claim-
ant correctly points out that the majority of Norpro Venezuela's expected future cash
flows would have been generated in the next ten years and thus within the duration of the
10-year bond.7”°

The Tribunal further agrees with Prof. Spiller that the use of a spot yield on a certain date
is less reliable than a 12-month average because it may reflect short-term or even daily
fluctuations. The Tribunal is not convinced by the argument that the recommendation
contained in the World Bank Guidelines to determine fair market value "immediately"
prior to the expropriation makes it necessary to consider only the spot yield on the valu-
ation date. While it is of course the purpose of this valuation to determine the purchase
price that a willing buyer would have paid on that date, the Tribunal considers it doubtful
that a willing buyer would have based its assessment of the risk-free rate exclusively on
data from that day, given that the buyer would be interested to obtain a reliable result for
its long-term investment.

Consequently, the Tribunal follows Prof. Spiller's approach to determine the risk-free rate
based on the 12-year average yield of the 10-year US Treasury bond rate, which results
in a risk-free rate of 3.6% as of 15 May 2010.

(2) Market Risk Premium in the US

677. The second element to be determined for the US cost of equity is the market risk premium,
which consists of a general market risk premium multiplied by an industry-specific beta
coefficient. It is in dispute between the Parties and their experts whether this premium
should then be increased by a further alpha coefficient.

General Market Risk Premium

678. As for the general market risk premium, Prof. Spiller relied on the recommendation of a
prominent scholar in the field, Prof. Damodaran, to apply a premium of 4.5% for the year
2010.7"! Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores relied on Ibbotson/Morningstar's use of the arith-
metic mean over historical market risk premia as from 1926, which resulted in a general
market risk premium of 6.7% as of 15 May 2010.77?

679. While acknowledging that the market risk premium is "commonly estimated from histor-
ical data using the largest historical period available," Prof. Spiller explained that the
financial crisis in 2008-2009 tends to distort the results of this method in light of the large
negative returns suffered during this period, which made the historical average fall, which
is why Prof. Damodaran suspended his practice of using historical returns and replaced it
with the above recommendation.’” Prof. Spiller further referred to various scholars tak-
ing the position that the discount factor for long-term projects should be determined by
using the geometric mean rather than the arithmetic mean applied by Respondent's ex-
perts.’*4 Finally, he noted that the market risk premium derived by Respondent's experts
is not supported by any recent research, which yielded much lower results, e.g., a 2011
study conducted by Dimson er al. that resulted in a world-wide market risk premium of
3-3.5% on a geometric mean basis and 4-4.5% on an arithmetic mean basis. ”°

680. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores stated that they used the historic average to "reduce as
much as possible the variability of the mean estimate," while Prof. Spiller simply relied
on the opinion of Prof. Damodaran. They further noted that, for the US, Dimson et al.
actually estimated an arithmetic market risk premium of 6.4-7.2% for 2011, which is in
line with their estimate for 2010.76 Finally, they stated that the scholars referred to by

Prof. Spiller do not generally favor the geometric mean over the arithmetic mean and
referred to further scholars who prefer the arithmetic mean.’””

The Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller in principle acknowledged the approach used by Mr.
Brailovsky and Dr. Flores as a recognized and commonly used method to determine the
market risk premium. While the Tribunal is of course aware that the financial crisis in
2008-2009 had a serious impact on the US stock market, it is not convinced by Prof.
Spiller's argument that falling returns in the stock market have necessarily rendered the
historic average unreliable. In particular, the Tribunal notes that, while falling returns may
indeed have led to a suggestion that investors were willing to invest at lower returns and
thus lower risk premia, this does not explain why the risk premium derived by Respond-
ent's experts from the historical average is higher than the recommendation provided by
Prof. Damodaran.

In addition, the Tribunal considers the data from proven market developments over a time
period of more than 80 years more reliable than the recommendation of one scholar.
While it is undisputed that Prof. Damodaran is a highly accomplished authority in this
regard, this does not elevate his recommendation above the necessity for an evidentiary
basis supporting Prof. Spiller's choice. In the document that Prof. Spiller relied on, Prof.
Damodaran simply states that "[a]s risk premiums came down in 2009, I moved back to
using a 4.5% equity risk premium for mature markets in 2010."7"* In the Tribunal's view,
this statement cannot be considered sufficient to justify a deviation from an established
method.

While Prof. Spiller did refer to additional sources in his second report, there is only one
document, the study of Dimson ef al. dating from 2011, which can provide relevant in-
formation for the valuation date of 15 May 2010. In this regard, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr.
Flores correctly pointed out, however, that the figures presented by Prof. Spiller (3-3.5%
geometric mean; 4-4.5% arithmetic mean) do not relate to the US market but rather to a
world-wide analysis of different markets.’ They further pointed to a different document
authored by the same scholars dating from the same year, which reports higher figures
for the US market (4.4-5.3% geometric mean; 6.4-7.2% arithmetic mean).”*° Therefore,
the Tribunal does not have any evidence before it that would support Prof. Damodaran's
estimate for 2010.

As to the dispute between the Parties relating to the question whether it is appropriate to
use the geometric mean or rather the arithmetic mean of a certain method, it appears to

the Tribunal that this is a disputed issue among scholars. The Tribunal notes that it has
not been provided with the geometric mean of the historical premia for the valuation date
of 15 May 2010. However, the Ibbotson/Morningstar report on which Respondent's ex-
perts relied as a source for their 6.7% premium provides for different premia for short-
term, mid-term and long-term horizons, with 6.7% being the premium for the long-term
horizon. In light of the fact that both Parties's experts rely on data from Ibbotson/Morn-
ingstar in relation to various aspects of their calculation, the Tribunal has no reason to
consider Ibbotson/Morningstar's choice to derive the equity risk premium on the basis of
the arithmetic mean unwarranted.

Consequently, the Tribunal follows Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' approach to derive
the general market risk premium for the US from the arithmetic mean of the historical
premia since 1926, which results in a premium of 6.7% for the valuation as of 15 May
2010.

Industry-specific Beta Coefficient

There is common ground between the Parties and their experts that the general market
risk premium has to be multiplied by an industry-specific component, i.e., the beta coef-
ficient. They further agree that the appropriate raw beta for Norpro Venezuela is to be
derived from SIC Code 1381 Drilling Oil and Gas Wells, as calculated by Ibbotson/Morn-
ingstar.’3! The Parties' experts also use the same method for adjusting and levering the
raw beta in order to arrive at the final beta to be used for the present purposes. 7**

The Tribunal notes that there is a difference between the Parties’ experts with regard to
the particular raw beta they chose from the Ibbotson/Morningstar data. While Prof. Spiller
used the 5-year average of the composite company, ’*? Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores re-
lied on the median raw beta.’*4 However, the Tribunal does not have to express an opinion
on this issue because both the composite and the median raw beta as reported by Ibbot-
son/Morningstar for March 2010 amount to 1.3, which results in an adjusted levered beta
of 1.2.7°

For its valuation of Norpro Venezuela as of 15 May 2010, the Tribunal will thus multiply
the general market risk premium by an industry-specific factor of 1.2.

Alpha Coefficient

Finally, the Tribunal has to deal with the question whether the industry-specific market
risk premium has to be increased by a further alpha coefficient, as alleged by Respondent.

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores explain that the CAPM tends to underestimate the cost of
capital for financial assets and therefore has to be adjusted to capture the actual perfor-
mance of the stocks of publicly traded companies, i.e., the alpha coefficient. Despite their
view that Norpro Venezuela qualifies as a small company within the industry captured in
SIC Code 1381, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores emphasized that they used the alpha for
the median company, as reported by Ibbotson/Morningstar for March 2010, i.e., 1.3%.7°°
They explained that the alpha accounts for "systemic volatilities of companies both large
and small" and noted that, even though "many practitioners, including Prof. Spiller, for-
get this finding," the alpha is routinely reported by financial data services providers such
as Bloomberg.”*” While acknowledging that the alpha is greater in smaller companies,
which is why it is also labelled "size premium", e.g., by Ibbotson/Morningstar, they stated
that large companies may also have a significant alpha, which is why it should be added
to the market risk premium.’**

Prof. Spiller considered it inappropriate to add a "size premium" to the market risk pre-
mium and noted that it is contested among financial practitioners and academics, includ-
ing Prof. Damodaran. With reference to various scholars, he further stated that the alpha
has been found to be "empirically unreliable across regions and time periods" and is
understood to reflect underlying market risk factors rather than the inherent effect of
size.”° In addition, Prof. Spiller took the view that the addition of

  

ize premium" would
potentially be duplicative of the country risk premium because Venezuelan firms are
smaller than firms in the US and Norpro Venezuela cannot be qualified as a small or even
medium company within Venezuela.”“°

The Tribunal notes that there are two issues to be distinguished with regard to the alpha
coefficient: (i) whether it reflects in general an established phenomenon to be accounted
for the cost of equity; and (ii) whether it would in this particular case be duplicative of
country risk to be determined in the next section.

As to the second argument, the Tribunal is not convinced that the alpha coefficient
amounts to a size premium for smaller companies, which would be double-counting the

fact that companies in Venezuela are in general smaller than US companies. While it is
apparent from the Ibbotson/Morningstar data and also acknowledged by Respondent's
experts that the alpha is greater for smaller companies than for larger companies, Prof.
Spiller also recognized that the alpha does not capture an inherent size effect but rather
underlying market risk factors. These factors may be more pronounced for smaller com-
panies but they do exist for larger companies as well. Contrary to what Claimant appears
to suggest, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores did not apply the alpha for the small composite
but rather chose the median. In the Tribunal's view, Claimant thus has failed to establish
that the application of the median alpha would be duplicative of the country risk for
Norpro Venezuela.

However, the Tribunal is aware of Prof. Spiller's general criticism of the alpha, which is
supported by various references to scholars and practitioners. The Tribunal also notes that
Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores even acknowledged that "many practitioners [...] forget"
to apply the alpha coefficient to the market risk premium. It therefore appears to be un-
disputed that the alpha cannot be considered a well-established element of determining
the market risk premium. On the balance of the evidence, the Tribunal is thus not con-
vinced that the alpha coefficient should be added to the US cost of equity rate.

Conclusion on Cost of Equity for a Company in the US

In sum, the Tribunal's findings result in the following cost of equity for a company in the
US as of 15 May 2010: (i) a risk-free rate of 3.6%; plus (ii) a market risk premium of 8%,
consisting of the general market risk premium of 6.7%, to be multiplied by the industry-
specific beta coefficient of 1.2. For the reasons laid out above, the Tribunal does not make
any further addition in relation to an alpha coefficient.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the US cost of equity to be used to determine the
applicable discount rate in this case amounts to 11.6%.

(3) Country Risk Premium for Venezuela

The Parties agree that the cost of equity as determined above for a company in the US
operating in the same business as Norpro Venezuela has to be increased by a country risk
premium to account for the fact that the plant is located in Venezuela. However, the Par-
ties' experts have applied different methods to determine this country risk premium,
which lead to significantly differing results.

Prof. Spiller relied on a method devised by Prof. Damodaran, which is based on the local
currency sovereign rating assigned to Venezuela by Moody's (B1 as of 15 May 2010),
converted into a default spread pursuant to Prof. Damodaran's estimate for the B1 rating

700.

701.

class (4.5% in 2010). Prof. Spiller applied this default spread as the country risk premium
without making any further adjustments for equity risk.”"!

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores primarily relied on the Country Risk Rating Model
(CRRM) compiled by Ibbotson/Morningstar, which is based on an ongoing survey of 75-
100 bankers conducted every six months by the publication /nstitutional Investor. In this
survey, the bankers are asked to rate 170 countries on a scale of 0 to 100 and the editors
of Institutional Investor weigh the responses based on their perception of the banks' level
of global performance and sophistication of their credit research methods. These country
risk ratings are then converted into equity discount rates based on a study conducted by
Erb, Harvey and Viskanta, which is updated on a regular basis. For Venezuela, the CRRM

resulted in a country equity risk premium of 14.3% as of 15 May 2010.”

For cross-checking purposes, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further used the so-called
"bludgeon method" devised by Prof. Damodaran, which is based on the spread on Vene-
zuela's sovereign bond denominated in US Dollars. They chose JP Morgan's Emerging
Market Bond Index (EMBI), which measures the difference between the USD-nominated
sovereign bond yields of Venezuela and those of the US and amounted to 10.26% as of
15 May 2010. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores then applied the global multiplier (1.5) sug-
gested by Prof. Damodaran to account for the fact that investment in equity is riskier than
investment in bonds and arrived at a country risk premium of 15.4% as of 15 May 2010.77

While acknowledging that experts may disagree on data and methodology, Prof. Spiller
stated that Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' choice does not reflect Norpro Venezuela's
country risk exposure because they failed to take into account three factors specific for
its business: (i) Norpro Venezuela exported its products and was therefore not subject to
domestic demand conditions and risks; (ii) it had secured the supply of its key production
inputs through long-term contracts with State-owned companies; and (iii) it was protected
by a bilateral investment treaty, which requires that risks related to expropriation and
"crisis conditions" be excluded from the present valuation.”** According to Prof. Spiller,
Venezuela's current "very high" EMBI spreads reflect the possibility of it entering into
default due to its lack of willingness to pay its obligations, but not the company-specific
risks faced by a private long-term investor that is not subject to the Government's will-
ingness or ability to pay. He added that Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' choice to use the
EMBI spread of only one day amplifies the contrast between their short-term measure of

risk and Norpro Venezuela's long-investment.’* Prof. Spiller took the view that, by con-
trast, his own assessment of the country risk captures the "Jong-term impact of country
risk on Norpro Venezuela's operations" consistent with Prof. Damodaran's assessment.”
Prof. Spiller further took the position that it is "neither necessary under the CAPM nor
advisable" to calculate a separate country risk for equity because the equity risk converges
to debt risk in the long term, which is why Prof. Damodaran recommends the application
of a mutiplier only for the short term.”4” As to the CRRM, Prof. Spiller raised several
points of criticism, including (i) a lack of transparency; (ii) the subjective and qualitative
nature of the ratings; (iii) claims that the surveys are biased towards specific regions of
the world; (iv) a lack of statistical or economic explanations; and (v) unreliability for

small or illiquid stock exchanges with unreliable stock market data, such as Venezuela.”*

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores pointed out that Prof. Spiller's country risk premium is in
fact equal to a 10-year B-rated generic US bond over the corresponding US Treasury bond
and therefore reflects US corporation debt risk but not Venezuelan country risk.” They
further stated that, contrary to what he suggested, Prof. Spiller did not apply Prof. Dam-
odaran's method because Prof. Damodaran has a hierarchy of methods: his first choice is
to use the spread on sovereign bonds denominated in "strong currencies" such as the US
Dollar or Euro (i.e., the "bludgeon method") and only for those countries that do not issue
such bonds, he suggests an alternative approach of assuming that sovereign ratings are
comparable to corporate ratings.”? In any event, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores consid-
ered it necessary to scale the default spread by a multiplier because their analysis of both
the US and Venezuelan market over a period of 20 years did not support a convergence
of the risk but rather yielded volatilities of 2.05 and 2.74, respectively, as of 15 May
2010.75! Finally, they took the view that Norpro Venezuela is not less exposed to country
risk than other companies operating in Venezuela because (i) country risk is a much larger
concept than exposure to domestic demand, involving taxation, regulations and other gov-
ernment actions such as currency controls; (ii) the invoked long-term contracts expire in
2016 and 2018, respectively, and do not contain any renewal option; and (iii) the risk of
expropriation forms part of fair market value and would be taken into account by any
willing buyer; in any event, bilateral treaties do not have a discernible impact on country

risk according to political risk insurers.”* As to Prof. Spiller's criticism on the CRRM,
Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores acknowledged that the criteria are subjective (albeit based
on economic fundamentals) but stated that their consequences are objective, given that
they form the basis for banks’ lending practices. In addition, they pointed out that the
model has produced stable results over the last 25 years.”°> They further took the position
that the EMBI spread on 15 May 2010 was not out of the ordinary but rather "almost
exactly in the middle of the distribution of the daily data since 1993 — a total of 5,336

observations.""**4

The Tribunal notes that there are several points of disagreement between the Parties’ ex-
perts in relation to the determination of an appropriate country risk premium for Norpro
Venezuela as of 15 May 2010. However, it appears that a large portion of them depends
on a fundamental issue that the Tribunal will therefore address at the outset, i.e., whether
the risk of being expropriated without the payment of (sufficient) compensation as re-
quired by the Treaty should be excluded from the country risk premium applicable to
Venezuela.

At the outset, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that, in principle, it agrees with Respond-
ent that the country risk premium to be applied in the present case should be a realistic
estimate of the premium that a willing buyer would have applied in May 2010. At the
same time, the Tribunal understands Claimant's position that the risk of being expropri-
ated with no or insufficient compensation should be excluded from the valuation of
Norpro Venezuela in the context of this arbitration.

In this context, Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller stated in his second expert report that pro-
tections from the France-Venezuela BIT served as "an additional mitigation of country
risk";’°> however, he neither quantified the impact of such mitigation nor did he present
any evidence in support of this statement. By contrast, Respondent's experts presented a
study conducted by Lauge N. Skovgaard Poulson, who has examined whether political
risk insurers placed any weight on the possiblity whether bilateral investment treaties re-
duce risk and concluded that "[bilateral investment] treaties have very little impact on
political risk insurance (PRI) providers' coverage and pricing policies.""*° While the Tri-
bunal would not go as far as to consider that Respondent has thereby established that
protection of investments by bilateral investment treaties has "no discernible impact on

by Respondent's experts, nor has it, or its expert Prof. Spiller, presented any evidence to
the contrary of its own. Against this background, the majority of the Tribunal cannot
conclude that the existence of the France- Venezuela BIT would have had a quantifiable
impact on the risk assessment of a willing buyer — from a strictly economical point of

view.

Nevertheless, it could be argued that if the Tribunal were not to make any adjustment as
regards the risk of expropriation with no or insufficient compensation, this would allow
Respondent to benefit from its own internationally wrongful conduct, i.e., not only the
breach of Article 5(1) of the Treaty, but its alleged general policy to expropriate invest-
ments without paying adequate compensation. As compensation is a crucial aspect of
Respondent's obligations in connection with an expropriation and Respondent would be
responsible for its alleged failure to comply with this obligation, the risk of expropriation
without (sufficient) compensation should be eliminated from the country risk. The Tribu-
nal notes that this argument is no longer based on a strictly economic perspective, but
includes a normative element reflecting the ambition that treaty protection should be re-
spected and enforced. According to this argument, the notion of fair market value under
the Treaty would thus have to be interpreted in the context of its own protection standards.

In the Tribunal's view, this rationale would apply not only to expropriation-related risks,
but also to risks related to other provisions of the Treaty, such as the risk of unfair regu-
lation, adoption of arbitrary measures, serious due process violations, etc. According to
Claimant's rationale, all of these risks should be excluded from the country risk because
they emerge from Respondent's alleged tendency not to live up to its international obli-
gations.

This position is supported in particular by the tribunal in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela,
which held that the country risk premium should not reflect "the market's perception that
a State might have the propensity to expropriate in breach of BIT obligations.""** While
the tribunal found in that case that no expropriation had occurred, it nevertheless consid-
ered that risks related to expropriation should be excluded from the country risk for the
purposes of determining the compensation to be paid to the claimant. At the same time,
the tribunal emphasized that political risks other than the expropriation risk must be re-
flected in the country risk premium. As it considered that these risks were not reflected
in the 1.5% country risk premium applied by the claimant's expert, it relied on the 4%
premium used in an analyst report instead, without however giving any further reasons
for its choice.”

On the other hand, the Tribunal notes that there are also arguments in favor of Respond-
ent's position that the country risk premium should include all political risk associated
with investing in Venezuela, including the alleged general risk of expropriation with no
or insufficient compensation.

First, the Tribunal recalls that both Parties agree that, regardless of the compensation
standard to be applied, the Tribunal has to determine Norpro Venezuela's fair market
value, i.e., the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller. Taking into
account this definition, it could be in accordance with the economic notion of fair market
value to maintain the risk of expropriation without (sufficient) compensation as one of
the risks that a willing buyer would realistically take into account.

In addition, as noted by the ILC in the commentary to Article 36 of its Draft Articles, "the
function of compensation is to address the actual losses incurred as a result of the inter-
nationally wrongful act" and is thus "purely compensatory"; "[i]t is not concerned to pun-
ish the responsible State, nor does compensation have an expressive or exemplary char-
acter."™ Tt could be argued that if one were to exclude the risk of uncompensated expro-
priation from the present valuation, Claimant would be granted a windfall because it
would receive compensation in an amount that it would not have been able to obtain as a
purchase price if it had actually sold Norpro Venezuela to a willing buyer in 2010, and
thus more than "the actual losses incurred" as a result of Respondent's breach of Article
5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty.

As correctly pointed out by Respondent, this position is supported in particular by the
tribunal in Tidewater v. Venezuela, which concluded based on these arguments that, while
the particular State measure giving rise to the claim must of course be excluded from the
valuation, the country risk premium reflects "the general risks, including political risks,
of doing business in the particular country, as they applied on that date.""*! The tribunal
concluded that a country risk premium of 14.75% was appropriate under the circum-
stances. 7°

In the Tribunal's view, the fundamental issue to be resolved in this regard is thus whether
in its determination of the compensation to be paid to Claimant, the Tribunal should dis-
regard only the impact of the particular breach of Article 5(1) that it has found under the
present Treaty, or whether it should also eliminate the risk of further potential breaches

of international law that generally reduce the value of all investments in Venezuela be-
cause Respondent would otherwise be allowed to take advantage of its alleged policy not
to respect its international obligations.

This question cannot be answered without taking into account the circumstances prevail-
ing when Claimant made its decision to invest in Venezuela. Specifically, the Tribunal
considers it relevant whether the risk, which Claimant now seeks to be excluded from the
country risk premium, already existed in 2006 or whether there was an apparent change
of policy since the investment was made, i.e., from an investor-friendly environment to-
wards establishing a tendency to expropriate foreigners without adequate compensation
as alleged by Claimant.

In this context, it is undisputed that when the team surrounding Patrick Millot sought
approval of the project from Claimant's mother company Compagnie de Saint-Gobain in
2006, a discount rate of 15% was used, consisting of the 12% rate usually assigned within
Claimant's group to "high risk" countries plus a 3% premium to account for "additional
risks by conservatism.""°> While this rate cannot simply be equated to an objective as-
sessment that a willing buyer might have conducted, it serves as an indication that Claim-
ant already considered Venezuela a "high risk" country and even added 3% for additional
risk when it made its investment decision in 2006. In its own words, Claimant invested
“during the height of the Bolivarian Revolution.""™ In the Tribunal's view, this demon-
strates that, already in 2006, Claimant factored in certain risks that are not covered by the
usual risk of investing in "high risk" countries and most probably relate to a risk of being
expropriated with no or insufficient compensation.

It must further be noted that it is undisputed between the Parties that the country risk has
increased since 2006.’° The question is whether such increased risk must, or rather must
not, be taken into account in the present valuation of Norpro Venezuela because the in-
crease is due to Respondent's alleged practice to expropriate investments without (suffi-
cient) compensation and would thus allow it to benefit from its own wrongful conduct.

In this regard, the majority of the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in Tidewater v. Vene-
zuela that Claimant's argument "conflates two separate elements in a legal claim of this
kind," i.e., (i) the question of liability where the Tribunal has found that Respondent failed
to carry out the expropriation in accordance with the compensation requirements of the
Treaty; and (ii) the quantum stage where the Tribunal must determine the fair market

value of Claimant's investment. As the Tidewater tribunal has found, "the second element
in the claim is in essence an economic question. It depends upon the value that the market
would attribute to the investment in question.""® The tribunal further held:

"This is not a matter of permitting a respondent State to profit from its

own wrong. On the contrary, the damages that the Tribunal is empow-

ered by virtue of the Treaty to award are designed to ensure that the

private investor is compensated for the loss of its investment. But, in

determining the amount of that compensation by reference to a dis-

counted cash flow analysis, the Tribunal should consider the value that

a willing buyer would have placed on the investment. In determining

this value, one element that a buyer would consider is the risk associ-

ated with investing in a particular country. Such a factor is not specific

to the particular State measure that gives rise to the claim. [...] Rather

the country risk premium quantifies the general risks, including politi-

cal risks, of doing business in the particular country, as they applied on

that date and as they might then reasonably have been expected to affect

the prospects, and thus the value to be ascribed to the likely cash flow

of the business going forward."""

The majority of the Tribunal agrees with this finding and therefore cannot follow Claim-
ant's argument that a failure to exclude the risk of expropriation with no or insufficient
expropriation would allow Respondent to benefit from its own wrongful conduct. In the
Tribunal's view, Claimant's own risk assessment in 2006 shows that, from an economic
perspective, any "additional risks" associated with investing in Venezuela would be taken
into account by an investor or a willing buyer — irrespective of the existence of the present
Treaty.

The notion of fair market value, which the Tribunal has identified above as the applicable
compensation standard,”°* requires the elimination of the specific measure that was sub-
ject of the Tribunal's finding on liability, i.e., in this case Respondent's failure to comply
with its obligation to pay prompt and adequate compensation to Claimant. However, it
does not require, and in fact does not allow for, a correction of the economic willing-
buyer perspective on the basis of normative considerations. In particular, the majority of
the Tribunal is of the view that the Treaty and this arbitration do not serve the purpose of
insuring Claimant against the general risks of investing in Venezuela that a willing buyer
would take into account in its assessment of the purchase price it would pay for Norpro
Venezuela.

In any event, the Tribunal notes that, while acknowledging the increased country risk,
Respondent strongly contests Claimant's allegation that it is making generalized threats
to expropriate all foreign investments in Venezuela and/or public statements that it does
not intend to honor its obligations under international law. Respondent emphasizes that
Claimant has not presented any evidence with regard to these allegations and claims that
"Venezuela has not defaulted on any of its sovereign obligations, and Venezuela has paid
compensation in its expropriation cases.""® In its letter of 6 November 2015, Respondent
again contested that there is any divergence between Venezuela's willingness to pay and
its ability to pay and referred to the director of the Venezuelan economic consulting firm
Ecoanalitica who stated on 28 October 2015 that PDVSA's debt payments in the total
amount of USD S billion over the last 15 days confirmed "Venezuela's strong willingness
to pay.""”°

Consequently, it is very much in dispute between the Parties whether there is a general
risk of uncompensated expropriation in Venezuela. While Respondent correctly pointed
out that Claimant has not presented any specific evidence in support of its allegation, in
the Tribunal's view the high country risk in Venezuela may be due, at least in part, to the
uncertain situation surrounding certain of Respondent's expropriation measures. Re-
spondent does not contest that it is involved in several disputes with investors that relate
to the payment of adequate compensation.

However, in light of its finding above that the determination of fair market value has to
be made in accordance with economic principles and thus factor in all risks that a willing
buyer would take into account, the Tribunal does not have to make a decision on Re-
spondent's expropriation measures in general (assuming it had jurisdiction to adopt such
a finding).

Consequently, the majority of the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the country risk
premium must reflect all political risks associated with investing in Venezuela, including
the alleged general risk of being expropriated without payment of (sufficient) compensa-
tion.

Accordingly, the Tribunal does not have to decide the further question whether it is pos-
sible to quantify and thus eliminate the expropriation risk from the country risk, without
at the same time excluding other country-specific risks that undisputedly have to be ac-
counted for in the country risk premium. Instead, the Tribunal must assess from the per-

spective of the willing buyer, which of the various methods presented by the Parties' ex-
perts adequately reflects the country risk to which Norpro Venezuela was in fact exposed
as of 15 May 2010.

At this point, the Tribunal notes that it is in dispute between the Parties whether the dif-
ference between the approach applied by Prof. Spiller and the two approaches applied by
Respondent's experts is due (exclusively) to the risk of uncompensated expropriation.
While Respondent claims that it is not possible to isolate and thus quantify the risk of
uncompensated expropriation,””! Claimant contends that Prof. Spiller's method based on
Venezuela's local currency rating excludes the risk of uncompensated expropriation but
includes "other risks of investing in Venezuela, such as the risks of a volatile economy,
civil disorder, less developed infrastructure, and other issues.""" Claimant explicitly
states that, as Venezuela's "extremely high" USD-denominated bond spread reflects its
lack of willingness to pay, the difference between the country risk premia computed by
the Parties' experts is "largely attributable to Venezuela's confiscation threats.""” It is
thus apparently Claimant's position that the approach selected by Prof. Spiller does not
include the alleged general risk of uncompensated expropriation and thus does not capture
the actual country risk that a willing buyer would take into account in its valuation of
Norpro Venezuela.

The Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller did not state at the Hearing that Prof. Damodaran's
local currency rating method is in fact designed to eliminate the risk of uncompensated
expropriation from the country risk premium. However, he gave the following explana-
tion for the fact that the alternative approach selected by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores
based on Venezual's EMBI spread renders much higher results than the rating-based
method:

"The investors in Venezuelan bonds all the way up to December 2013

were assessing that although the fundamental economics of Venezuela

were comparable to BI credit-rating countries, they were fearing that

Venezuela may not be willing to uphold its international obligations,

not dissimilar to, what for example, Ecuador did when it defaulted re-

cently on its debt, which was based on willingness to pay to uphold the

international obligations rather than economic fundamentals, as may

be the case now with Greece, which cannot repay the debt."""*

Prof. Spiller thus confirms Claimant's position that the divergence between the results
yielded by the two methods is due to Venezuela's alleged unwillingness to live up to its

international obligations. Prof. Spiller further argues that in the case of Venezuela, there
is a significant discrepancy between the country's ability to pay (reflected in its local cur-
rency rating) and its willingness to pay (reflected in its USD-denominated bond spreads).

Prof. Damodaran's spreadsheet as of 1 July 201377

indeed shows that the divergence
between the two methods amounted to 7.62% for Venezuela, but less than 1% for most
other countries. The only other countries with a divergence of more than 2% are Tunisia

(2.22%) and Argentina (31.72%).7”°

In the Tribunal's view, the unusual divergence between the results yielded by the two
methods supports Prof. Spiller's explanation that the CDS spreads (just like the EMBI
spread) might reflect a risk that is not usually associated with countries that are assigned
a BI rating. While this additional risk could indeed be the risk associated with Venezue-
la's alleged policy not to live up to its international obligations, the Tribunal has already
found above that it is beyond the scope of this arbitration to make a finding on Venezuela's
general policy towards foreign investors and to make any corresponding adjustment to
the country risk premium in this regard.

Respondent further pointed out in its Post-Hearing Reply Brief that Prof. Spiller did not
analyze the spreads on USD-denominated bonds of countries with the same rating as
Venezuela but rather took the 4.5% spread that Prof. Damodaran applied to all B1-rated
countries on the assumption that sovereign ratings are comparable to US corporate rat-
ings, without making any analysis on market data relating to these countries.””” Already
in its Rejoinder, Respondent raised the argument that, instead of relying on the spreads
of US corporate bonds, Prof. Spiller should at least have analyzed corporate bonds from
emerging countries and referred to the analysis of Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, which
yielded an average debt spread of 9%.77

Even though Respondent's argument was again raised by Mr. Brailovsky during the Hear-
ing,””? Claimant did not respond to it in its Post-Hearing Submission, but argued for the
first time in its Second Post-Hearing Submission that the accuracy of Prof. Spiller's meas-
ure of country risk could be checked by looking at the CDS spreads outstanding on other
countries’ sovereign debts. Claimant noted that pursuant to Prof. Damodaran's list as of

75 While Prof. Damodaran's excel sheet for 2010 is on file as App. BF-62, it does not contain a calculation of the
country risk premium based on the CDS spreads. For comparison purposes, the Tribunal therefore refers to the
excel sheet as of July 2013.

January 2014, the 4.5% premium applied by Prof. Spiller would rank as the fourth-high-

est, "far above the typical country risk premium in a developing country.""*°

Respondent replied to this argument by a separate letter pointing out that (i) Prof. Spiller
had never referred to CDS spreads in the context of the method he applied; (ii) more than
half of the countries with CDS spreads in Prof. Damodaran's list could not be classified
as "developing countries"; and (iii) "typicality" was not a valid concept for the valuation
of a project in particular country for which country-specific data was readily available,

i.e., in the case of Venezuela, a CDS spread of 10.8%.78!

In the Tribunal's view, it would indeed have been helpful to have a comprehensive anal-
ysis of market data from other countries with the same B1 rating that Venezuela was
assigned as of 15 May 2010. In particular, Claimant should have raised the argument
relating to CDS spreads of other countries at an earlier stage of the proceedings, which
would have allowed Respondent and its experts an adequate opportunity to respond to
this argument. In addition, the Tribunal could have consulted the Parties' experts on this
issue during the Hearing. In the absence of a proper discussion on this issue, the Tribunal
does not consider it fair to rely on the data that Claimant pointed to, which in any event
relates to 2014 and not to the valuation date in 2010.

In addition, the Tribunal recalls Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' analysis of corporate
bond spreads in emerging markets based on data from Merrill Lynch, which they con-
verted into a generic emerging market corporate bond yield of 9.11% as of May 2014.78
While they did not provide a figure for the valuation date of 15 May 2010, this undisputed
calculation raises doubts as to whether the 4.5% premium calculated by Prof. Spiller re-
flects even the country risks typically associated with a B-1 rated country that should
undisputedly be taken into account in the present valuation — apart from the issue of the
expropriation risk.

The Tribunal will therefore now turn to the two alternative approaches that Respondent's
experts relied on, i.e., the CRRM and the "bludgeon method," which both undisputedly
include any risk of uncompensated expropriation and yielded a country risk premium of
14.3% and 15.4% respectively.

As to the "bludgeon method," which is based on USD-denominated sovereign spreads,
Respondent's experts have chosen to rely on data from the EMBI. While Prof. Spiller
criticized in his second report that it is not appropriate to rely on the EMBI in the present

case because Venezuela's sovereign credit risk does not reflect Norpro Venezuela's coun-
try risk exposure, he did not contest the choice of this particular index as such. Prof.
Spiller did challenge the use of the spot index on the valuation date rather than a long-
term average; however, he did not provide the Tribunal with an alternative figure that

would reflect any such average. ”*°

The Tribunal is of course aware that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores have applied Prof.
Damodaran's "bludgeon method" only to cross-check their primary calculation, which is
based on the CRRM. The Tribunal is also aware that Prof. Spiller has raised various points
of criticism in relation to this method, in particular as regards a lack of transparency of
the method and a lack of reliability in the results it yields,’** and that Mr. Brailovsky and
Dr. Flores have addressed these points of criticism in detail in their second expert re-
port.’®> The Tribunal is of the view that there is no need to express an opinion as to the
reliability of the CRRM as both Parties’ positions are reflected in one of the methods
devised by Prof. Damodaran, who appears to be recognized as a leading authority by both
Parties’ experts. The Tribunal will therefore focus on the methods that he recommends.

Respondent and its experts have taken the position that Prof. Spiller has ignored Prof.
Damodaran's hierarchy of methods and that Prof. Damodaran's best estimate is the result
yielded by the "bludgeon method.""*° While neither Claimant nor its expert has explicitly
addressed this argument, the Tribunal notes that the record does not clearly establish that
Prof. Damodaran indeed provides for a ranking of his methods. Contrary to what Re-
spondent and its experts suggest, Prof. Damodaran does not state in his writing on equity
risk premiums that the rating-based synthetic approach should be applied only for coun-
tries that do not have USD-denominated sovereign bonds. By contrast, he states that the
default spread "can be estimated in three ways," one of which is the synthetic spread.7°’
While noting that the other two ways are available only for countries with USD-denomi-
nated bonds, he does not state that those ways should be preferred over the synthetic
spread. He refers to the assumption that sovereign ratings are comparable to corporate
ratings as an "alternative approach" and, after laying out the three possible approaches,
concludes that one "could choose one of these approaches and stay consistent over time

or average across them."78

In his spreadsheet that formed the basis for Prof. Spiller's choice of the 4.5% premium for
2013, Prof. Damodaran also states that to "[e]stimate the default spread for the country

in question," he "offer[s] two choices, one based upon the local currency sovereign rating
for the country from Moody's and the other is the CDS spread for the country (if one
exists).""®° Again, he does not state that one should prefer the CDS spread approach over
the rating approach. Finally, the Tribunal notes that in his spreadsheet for 2010, Prof.
Damodaran does not even provide for the CDS spread approach but simply states that
"[t]o estimate the long term country risk premium, I start with the country rating (from
Moody's:
rate and country bonds) over the treasury rate. This becomes a measure of the added
country risk premium for that country."7°°

In light of these statements, the Tribunal is not convinced that there is a hierarchy of
methods that Prof. Spiller failed to observe in his choice to rely on the local currency
rating model instead of the USD-denominated bond spreads. However, the Tribunal re-
calls that (i) according to Claimant's own submissions, Prof. Spiller's approach aims to
exclude the risk of uncompensated expropriation and therefore does not reflect the actual
country risk that a willing buyer would take into account; and (ii) it remains unclear
whether it includes even the country risks that are typically associated with a B-1 rated
country, as demonstrated by Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores’ analysis of corporate bond
spreads in emerging markets.

By contrast, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that Prof. Damodaran's "bludgeon
method" includes both the risk of uncompensated expropriation and the typical country
risks that should undisputedly form part of the present valuation. While the Tribunal is
not necessarily convinced that the difference between the results yielded by the two meth-
ods is attributable in its entirety to the risk of uncompensated expropriation, Claimant has
not presented any evidence that the "bludgeon method" includes any risk that would not
be taken into account by a willing buyer in its valuation of Norpro Venezuela. Therefore,
the Tribunal follows Respondent's experts in this regard and finds that the country risk
premium should be determined on the basis of Venezuela's USD-denominated bond
spreads as reflected in the EMBI.

However, there remains one question to be assessed in this regard, i.e., whether the Tri-
bunal should apply Prof. Damodaran's generic multiplier of 1.5 for its determination of
the country equity risk premium on the assumption that investment in equity is riskier

791

than investment in bonds, as stated by Respondent's experts,'”’ or whether it should re-

frain from applying any multiplier on the assumption that equity and debt risk converge

for a long-term investment, as stated by Claimant's expert.””? The Tribunal notes that both
sides relied in particular on Prof. Damodaran's statements in this regard. Dr. Flores and
Mr. Brailovsky pointed to the fact that Prof. Damodaran states in his spreadsheet:

"You can estimate an adjusted country risk premium by multiplying the

default spread by the relative equity market volatility for that market

(Std dev in country equity market/Std dev in country bond). In this

spreadsheet, I have used the global average of equity to bond market

volatility of 1.5 to estimate the country equity risk premium.""

The Tribunal notes, however, that this statement is preceded by the sentence: "Jn the short
term especially, the equity country risk premium is likely to be greater than the country's
default spread.""* Prof. Spiller also relies on the following statement from Prof. Damo-
daran:

"[T]he differences between standard deviations in equity and bond

prices narrow over longer periods and the resulting relative volatility

will generally be smaller”. Thus, the equity risk premium will con-

verge to the country bond default spread as we look at longer term ex-
pected returns.""°

In response, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores presented the results of their own analysis on
the relative volatilities of the bond and equity markets in the US and in Venezuela over a
20-year/5-year period’”” preceding 15 May 2010, which yielded a ratio of 2.05 and 2.74,
respectively.’°* The Tribunal notes that, in their first expert report, they stated in a foot-
note that Prof. Damodaran had calculated a volatility ratio of 0.69 for Venezuela over two
years through February 2012, but then a volatility ratio of 1.77 for two years through
March 2013.7” Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores criticized Prof. Damodaran for not having
converted the Venezuelan Stock Market Index, which is denominated in bolivars, into US
Dollars, which is the currency of the Venezuelan bond index. In addition, as they quoted
in the same footnote, Prof. Damodaran notes that "the relative standard deviation of eq-

“

and 0.69 for Venezuela) and across time (Brazil's relative volatility numbers have ranged

from close to one to well above 2."°

However, it appears to the Tribunal that the two calculations cannot be compared directly,
as Prof. Damodaran has calculated the relative volatility to the US market (with the US
market being assigned a volatility of 1.00), whereas Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores have
calculated the relative volatility to the bond market for both the US and Venezuela.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to what Respondent and its experts suggest, it
does not appear from Prof. Damodaran's writings that he actually recommends the use of
the equity multiplier. Rather, the following statement can be found in one his writings
dating from 2010: "Some analysts believe that the equity risk premiums of markets should
reflect the differences in equity risk, as measured by the volatilities of equities in these
markets."*°! Similar statements can be found in other writings.*°? From his spreadsheet,
it also appears that he leaves it to the user to decide whether to apply a multiplier, given
that he offers two choices: "Choice 1: Use the default spread as the measure of the addi-
tional country risk premium. To make this choice, go into the ERP worksheet and set cell
ES to 1.00"; and "Choice 2: Scale the default spread up to reflect the higher risk of equity
in the market, relative to the default spread. You can see the relative ratios for individual
countries in the worksheet "Equity vs. Govt Bond' in this spreadsheet. Set cell E5 in the
ERP worksheet to that number."® For June 2013 and January 2014, Prof. Damodaran
presented a relative standard deviation (to the US market) of 0.69 for Venezuela; for May
2010, the Tribunal has not been provided with the relevant data.8°*

In the absence of sufficient clarity on the appropriate multiplier to be applied for Vene-
zuela, the Tribunal is not convinced that the generic 1.5 multiplier would adequately re-
flect the risk of an equity investment in Venezuela. Given the undisputed long-term nature
of the investment to be valued in the present case, it further remains in dispute whether
any multiplier should be applied at all or whether it can be assumed that debt and equity
risk will converge. While Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores took the position that this theory
is dispelled by their analysis on the relative volatilities of the equity and bond markets in
the US and in Venezuela, the Tribunal notes that the ratio they calculated indeed appears
to depend to a large extent on the maturity of the bonds selected in comparison to the
stock market. While Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores did not present figures for different

bond maturities for the Venezuelan market, the ratio for the US market differs between
1.55 for 20-year bonds and 2.81 for 5-year bonds as of May 2010.°°

Andrew Smithers and Stephen Wright on whom Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores relied in
support of their argument that equity is riskier than debt, confirm that the volatility of
bond returns is "distinctly lower" than that of stocks, but also state that long-term bonds
are riskier than short-term bonds.*°° Jeremy Siegel, however, who has also been cited by
Respondent's experts, makes the following statement:

"As was noted previously, stocks are riskier than fixed-income invest-

ments over short-term holding periods. But once the holding period in-

creases to between 15 and 20 years, the standard deviation of average

annual returns, which is the measure of the dispersions of returns used

in portfolio theory, become lower than the standard deviation of aver-

age bond or bill returns. Over 30-year periods, equity risk falls to only

two-thirds that of bonds or bills. As the holding period increases, the

standard deviation of average stock returns falls nearly twice as fast as

that of fixed-income assets."*°"

In light of this evidence, the Tribunal considers it plausible that the risk of investment in
equity and the risk of investment in bonds converge in the long term. As the subject of
this valuation, i.e., Claimant's investment in Norpro Venezuela, was undisputedly made
as a long-term investment according to the standards applied by Prof. Damodaran,
Messrs. Smithers and Wright, and Mr. Siegel, Respondent and its experts have not estab-
lished that a multiplier should be applied to the default spread for the computation of the
equity risk premium. Consequently, the Tribunal will apply the country risk premium
calculated by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores on the basis of Prof. Damodaran's "bludgeon
method", excluding the 1.5 multiplier. As of 15 May 2010, they determined a sovereign
bond spread of 10.26% based on data from the EMBI, which in the absence of a multiplier
to be applied in the present case is equal to the country equity risk premium.

The Parties and their experts have further debated certain factors specific to Norpro Ven-
ezuela as a result of which its country risk exposure might deviate from the average Ven-
ezuelan company.*”* Apart from the factor of protection under a bilateral investment
treaty, which has been discussed in detail above, the debate focused on two further issues:
(i) the fact that Norpro Venezuela exported more than 80% of the produced proppants,

most of it to North America, i.e., a mature market, and (ii) the fact that it had concluded

long-term supply contracts for its key inputs such as energy and bauxite.°”

As to the second issue, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores correctly pointed out that the long-
term contracts were set to expire in 2016 and 2018, respectively, and did not provide for
a renewal term, let alone a renewal at the same or similar prices.*!? Therefore, the Tribu-
nal is not convinced that this factor would cause a willing buyer to lower his assessment
of Norpro Venezuela's country risk exposure.

With regard to the first issue, Claimant relied on Prof. Damodaran's statement that "[t]he
most obvious determinant of a company's risk exposure to country risk is how much of
the revenues it derives from the country."*'! However, Respondent pointed out that Prof.
Damodaran further stated in the same writing that "[a] company can be exposed to country
risk, even if it derives no revenues from that country, if its production facilities are in that

country."*'

In this context, Respondent and its experts argue that country risk is a much
larger concept than exposure to domestic demand.*'3 Mr. Brailovsky further stated at the
Hearing that "[t]here is a substantial amount of literature showing that natural resource
projects, particularly oil or oil-related, bear more Country Risk than the average com-
pany."*\4

The Tribunal notes that Claimant never argued that Norpro Venezuela is not subject to
Venezuelan country risk at all but only that it is less exposed to Venezuelan country risk
than the average Venezuelan company.*!> In response to Mr. Brailovsky's comment at the
Hearing, Claimant submits that Norpro Venezuela was not a natural resource company
and claims that, in any event, resource-based companies are typically assigned a better

rating than companies in other industries.*!°

While the Tribunal considers it plausible that Norpro Venezuela's country risk exposure
may indeed be different from that of the average Venezuelan company, Mr. Brailovsky
and Dr. Flores correctly pointed out that Prof. Spiller never quantified the impact of the
factors invoked by Claimant on the country risk to which Norpro Venezuela was in fact
exposed.*!” As explained by Prof. Damodaran, the fact that Norpro Venezuela exports
most of its products could have been factored in as part of a lambda approach pursuant to

which the country risk premium as derived for the average Venezuelan company could
have been multiplied by a certain lambda coefficient.*!® However, given that none of the
Parties' experts have included such a coefficient in their calculations, the Tribunal will
not give any further consideration to this approach. In the absence of any quantification
of Norpro Venezuela's specific country risk exposure, the Tribunal will thus apply the
country risk premium of 10.26% as yielded by the "bludgeon method" devised by Prof.
Damodaran (excluding any equity risk multiplier).

(4) Conclusion on Equity Risk Premium and Conversion Into
Discount Rate

In conclusion, the Tribunal, by majority, finds that the equity risk premium to be applied
to an investment in Norpro Venezuela as of 15 May 2010 consists of the following ele-
ments: (i) the cost of equity for a company operating in the US in the amount of 11.6%,
ie., a risk-free rate of 3.6% plus a market risk premium of 8%, consisting of the general
market risk premium of 6.7%, to be multiplied by the industry-specific beta coefficient
of 1.2; and a country risk premium for Venezuela in the amount of 10.26%. This results
in a total equity risk premium of 21.86%.

As a final step, the Tribunal must determine the applicable debt-to-equity ratio in order
to calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and thus the nominal discount
rate to be applied to Claimant's investment. The Parties’ experts used similar but not iden-
tical debt-to-equity ratios in their calculations as of 15 May 2010. Prof. Spiller applied a
ratio of 18.0% debt to 82.0% equity, representing a 5-year average of the ratio reported
by Ibbotson/Morningstar for the composite company of SIC Code 1381;°!? Mr. Brailov-
sky and Dr. Flores applied a ratio of 15.7% debt to 84.3% equity, representing a 1-year
average as reported by Ibbotson/Morningstar for the median company of SIC Code
1381.8

While Prof. Spiller states that a single-year average is biased because it may be affected
by particular events that occurred during that year,*?! the Tribunal notes that this issue
has not been subject to any further debate between the Parties or their experts. As Ibbot-
son/Morningstar reports both the "/atest" figures and the 5-year average, the Tribunal
does not consider it established that it should prefer one over the other. The same applies
to the choice of the composite company or the median company. Therefore, the Tribunal

will not give preference to the choices of either expert, but will rather apply the average

between the ratios in its assessment of the nominal discount rate, i.e., a ratio of 16.85%
debt to 83.15% equity.

For the determination of the cost of debt (after tax), the Tribunal refers to Table 8 of Mr.
Brailovsky and Dr. Flores' second expert report, pursuant to which the cost of debt (after
tax) is equal to the US risk-free rate (3.6%) plus the country debt risk premium (10.26%)
plus an industry risk premium (set by both Parties’ experts at 1.5% for 2010)*?? multiplied
by one minus the applicable tax rate (34%). According to the majority of the Tribunal,
this results in the following calculation:

(3.6% + 10.26% + 1.5%) * (1 — 34%) = 10.14%.

On the basis of the above determined average debt-to-equity ratio of 16.85/83.15, the

majority of the Tribunal arrives at a nominal discount rate of 19.88%.°”

bb) Future Cash Flows

In the following section, the Tribunal will turn to the discrepancies between the Parties
and their experts in the determination of Norpro Venezuela's future cash flows.

(@ Summary of Claimant's Position

With regard to the calculation of the future cash flows, Claimant considers it "baseless"
to split the profits that a willing buyer would generate from Norpro Venezuela's exports
to account for internal cost allocation. In Claimant's view, the fair market valuation is
"not dependent on idiosyncratic qualities of the buyer or seller"; therefore, it must be
assumed that the highest-bidding willing buyer would most likely be a strategic investor
that already has a distribution and marketing network similar to that of Saint-Gobain and
is thus in a position to accrue 100% of the profits.**4 Claimant argues that the marketing
costs is a fixed cost of the buyer that does not change through the acquisition, but the
buyer can rather leverage its existing resources to take full advantage of the incremental
value of the acquired asset just like Saint-Gobain internalized 100% of the profits. Finally,
Claimant notes that both experts’ estimates already include marketing and distribution

costs in the amount of 7%.°°

Claimant further notes that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores assumed in their calculation
that CVG Bauxilum would supply bauxite at the increased price that it unilaterally im-
posed on Norpro Venezuela in September 2008. According to Claimant, this price in-
crease was unlawful and therefore must not be taken into account based on the principle
that "a party may not reduce its liability for one wrongful act (here, the expropriation) on
the basis of another (the price increase)."**° According to Claimant, the bauxite price
should reflect the agreement under the Bauxite Contract and thus amount to USD 25.5
per MT.®?7

As to the transportation costs, Claimant refers to its witness Jack Larry who testified that,
contrary to Mr. Brailovsky's and Dr. Flores' assumption, proppants were not usually
shipped from Corpus Christi to Alice (both in Texas) for storage, but the majority was
rather shipped directly from the port in Corpus Christi to the customer, which is why the
budgeted cost to Alice in the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan was "merely for illustrative pur-
poses."**8 Claimant claims that (i) Prof. Spiller's estimate of the transportation costs is
based on an actual shipment in March 2010 and confirmed by Saint-Gobain's contempo-
raneous transportation contracts; and (ii) the average price applied by Prof. Spiller for
shipping costs within the US accurately accounts for the various locations and contractual
arrangements with Claimant's ultimate customers.*”?

Claimant further asserts that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores fail to distinguish between
the concepts of (i) maintenance capex aimed at "maintain[ing] the plant in the condition
to continue functioning at its current levels"; and (ii) investment capex aimed at "in-
creas{ing] plant production through efficiency and technological improvements."**° Ac-
cording to Claimant, only the maintenance capex should be included in the calculation of
capital expenditures. **!

In respect of the working capital required to operate the plant, Claimant refers to Prof.
Spiller's assumptions that (i) the outstanding balance of VAT credits as of 2009 would
have been paid in 2010; and (ii) going forward, it would have taken 60 days to monetize
the VAT certificates and Norpro Venezuela would have recovered 80% of their value. As

to the administrative delays invoked by Respondent, Claimant notes that such delays have
been found to be in breach of the FET standard and claims that it had a legitimate expec-
tation that Respondent would follow its own VAT credit procedure, given that this issue
was specifically discussed with the Venezuelan Government before Claimant invested in

Venezuela.**

In addition, Claimant claims that the invoked two-year delay is "purely
speculative" as all documents invoked by Respondent date from several years prior to
2010 and are further "without legal basis" as the Venezuelan law provides that the tax

authority must issue its decision within 30 days.*3

Summary of Respondent's Position

tion Norpro Venezuela received only 27% of the profits, while the remaining 73% were
allocated to Claimant's US affiliate SGCP. Respondent notes that this is based on Claim-
ant's transfer pricing study, which distinguished between four equally weighted cate-
goried: functions, risks, manufacturing intangibles and marketing intangibles. According
to Respondent, the contribution of the plant and SGCP to the first three categories were
split; the fourth category "marketing intangibles," however, was assigned 100% to SGCP.
Respondent argues that 25% of the plant's profits were directly tied to the marketing,
logistics and distribution capabilities of SGCP, which were not expropriated together with
the plant.**+

766. In response to Claimant's argument that the study was only an internal accounting mech-
anism, Respondent notes that under Venezuelan law, taxpayers conducting transactions
with related parties must "determine their income, costs and deductions resulting from
those transactions considering the prices and amounts that would have been used with or
between independent parties in comparable transactions." Therefore, Respondent main-
tains its presumption that the agreement between Norpro Venezuela and SGCP reflected
an arm's-length transaction.**

767. Consequently, Respondent rejects Prof. Spiller's assumption that Norpro Venezuela
would retain 100% of the profits as of the valuation date. It claims that a willing buyer
would not pay for 100% of the profits because it would not be acquiring the capabilities
of SGCP and would not be willing to transfer the profits it expects to earn through its own
existing marketing, logistics and distribution network. If the buyer were not to have such
network itself, Respondent notes that it would even have to pay for acquiring these capa-
bilities or for the services of a third party. In short, Respondent claims, "no buyer would

pay for something that it was not getting in the transaction."**°

768. According to Respondent, the willing buyer would "value the Plant, not the assets in the
full value chain, and would only take into account the profits that could be realized by
the Plant itself."°°"

769. Respondent therefore refers to the assumption of its experts that a buyer of the plant would
achieve "at the very most" 75% of the profits, as Claimant itself concluded in its transfer
pricing study that the 25% portion of "marketing intangibles" was contributed 100% by
sccp.*8

770. As to the bauxite price to be paid by Norpro Venezuela to CVG Bauxilum, Respondent
submits that there is no basis for Claimant's instruction to Prof. Spiller to reduce the
agreed price of USD 33.8 per MT to the original contract price, given that Norpro Vene-
zuela agreed to the increased price as long as there would be no further increase through-
out 2009. Therefore, Respondent instructed its experts to base their calculation on the
increased price, escalated by the US PPI-Commodities.**°

771.

With regard to the transportation costs, Respondent submits that Prof. Spiller's estimate
of the shipping costs to the US is apparently based on a single shipment in March 2010
and notes that the same document on which Prof. Spiller relies includes Claimant's own
budgeted cost for transportation from Venezuela to Alice, Texas of EUR 110 (converted
to USD 154) per MT. According to Respondent, this figure is also supported by Claim-
ant's transfer pricing study.** As to the contemporaneous transportation documents relied

functions that were not part of the transfer from Claimant in consideration for the purchase price. Respondent's

on by Prof. Spiller in his second report, Respondent submits that these documents do not
reflect actual costs incurred in connection with transportation, which is why its experts

maintained their original estimate.**!

Respondent further rejects Prof. Spiller's estimate for the shipping costs within the US
and claims that Claimant's budgeted cost and the Halliburton SPA reflect a "significantly
higher" cost, which is why its experts based their estimate on the budgeted cost.*” Re-
spondent notes that, even though Claimant did not provide any data in support of Prof.
Spiller's assumption that 30% of the proppants would be sold ex works and the remaining
70% would be sold in equal volumes to each of the three distribution areas, Respondent's
experts have applied that assumption together with the price provided for in the Hallibur-

ton SPA, which results in costs that are even higher than the costs they estimated.*

In relation to the capital expenditures, Respondent agrees with Prof. Spiller's assumption
up to and including 2018 but argues that annual capital expenditures would significantly
increase “as the Plant aged and equipment reached the end of its useful life."*“4 While
Prof. Spiller included only maintenance expenditures, Respondent claims that expendi-
tures for "health and safety, technology or improvements to reduce breakdowns and pro-
cess disruptions" are also required to assume operation in perpetuity and therefore takes
the position that all four capexes as foreseen for Claimant's Fort Smith Plant should be

included in the calculation.*4>

In respect of the working capital, Respondent agrees with Prof. Spiller's calculation ex-
cept for the VAT credits. Respondent contends that as of 15 May 2010 Norpro Venezuela
had not even applied for the tax recovery certificates and claims that the recovery proce-
dure is usually a "/engthy and complex" process. Respondent submits that its experts
therefore assumed that the outstanding VAT credits as of 15 May 2010 would have been
monetized in 2013 and further VAT credits accumulated thereafter would have been mon-
etized on a two-year rolling basis and thus been part of working capital that a buyer would
not separately value.*4°

(iii) The Tribunal's Analysis

776. The Tribunal will now address the various points of disagreement regarding Norpro Ven-

ezuela's future cash flows in turn.

(1) Proppants Prices

777. Asto the projections for proppants prices to be applied, the Tribunal notes that the dispute
between the Parties has focused primarily on the impact of recent developments on the
oil market on price projections in a date-of-the-award valuation. It is undisputed between
the Parties that this development could not have been foreseen as of 15 May 2010 and
therefore does not have be taken into account in the present valuation. However, the Par-
ties' experts also applied different assumptions with regard to the proppants prices in their
15 May 2010 valuations.

778. Prof. Spiller stated in his Updated Valuation Model, submitted together with his second
expert report, that he based the prices for exports to the US: (i) for 2010, on historical
sales in Venezuela for 2010; (ii) for 2011-2012, on historical sales in the US; (iii) for
2013, on the growth rate of Norpro Venezuela's average prices between 2012 and 2013;
(iv) for 2014-2015, on the average growth rate of analyst reports and Claimant's forecasts;
and (v) for 2016-2018, on the increase of the US PPI. Prof. Spiller's prices for exports to
South America and local sales within Venezuela are based: (i) for 2010, on Claimant's
April 2010 Business Plan; (ii) for 2011, on the growth rate of Versaprop and Interprop
sales in the US between 2010 and 2011; and (iii) for 2012-2017, on the same assumptions
as exports to the US.*8

779. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores based the prices for sales to North America, South America
and Venezuela (i) for 2010-2015, on the projections contained in Claimant's April 2010
Business Plan; and (ii) for the time period thereafter, on long-term inflation forecasts as
of 2010.8

The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores that it is inaccurate for a valua-
tion as of 15 May 2010 to use actual sales prices beyond April 2010 because those could
not be known at the valuation date. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further pointed out that
Prof. Spiller's price projections are higher than Claimant's own projections for Norpro
Venezuela as of April 2010.*°° The Tribunal is of the view that, while a willing buyer
may have decided not to rely exclusively on the seller's projections but to take into ac-
count further data, e.g., based on analyst reports, it would certainly have given consider-
able weight to the projections in the April 2010 Business Plan. If Prof. Spiller considered
that there was a reason to deviate from the Business Plan, he could have explained his
choice, but he did not even address the discrepancy between the Business Plan and his

own projections for the May 2010 valuation in his expert report.

Consequently, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt the reasonableness of Claimant's own
price projections as of April 2010 and thus follows the approach of Respondent's experts

in this regard.

(2) Profit Split for Marketing Part

As to the question of whether there should be a profit split for the export sales, there is
common ground between the Parties that, prior to the expropriation, Norpro Venezuela
in fact retained 27% of the profits from the sales of proppants; the remaining 73% were
allocated to Claimant's US affiliate Saint-Gobain Ceramics & Plastics (SGCP) that was
responsible, inter alia, for the marketing and distribution of the proppants.**! There is a
dispute as to whether a willing buyer would have assumed a profit split in its calculation
of the purchase price to account for the fact that Norpro Venezuela itself did not have the
marketing and distribution network required to sell the proppants to the customer.

Prof. Spiller assumed that a willing buyer would have included 100% of the profits in its
calculation of the purchase price on the assumption that the highest bidder would have
been a company with marketing and distribution capabilities similar to those of SGCP.
According to Prof. Spiller, this assumption is compatible with fair market value because
it is not based on "unique synergies" that could be realized only by a specific buyer, but
rather on the reasonable consideration that there are several potential buyers with these
capabilities in the market; therefore, Claimant would have sold to a buyer that could re-
alize 100% of the profits and would be willing to factor this synergy into its offer for
Norpro Venezuela. Prof. Spiller emphasized that he did not value any revenues or costs
associated with a network outside the plant, but simply valued the additional profits that

hibit CLEX-35).

785.

a buyer with access to such a network could obtain from adding Norpro Venezuela's ca-
pacity to its own capacity.

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores took the position that Prof. Spiller incorrectly made spe-
cific assumptions regarding the characteristics of the willing buyer and ignored the fact
that the marketing and distribution network was not expropriated. Even if the buyer in-
deed had such a network, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores argued, it would not have been
willing to pay for, and give away the profits associated with, such network, precisely
because it already had the network and did not acquire one in the transaction.*°? Accord-
ing to Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, the asset to be valued is only the going concern
Norpro Venezuela and not the marketing and distribution network of SGCP. Therefore,
they referred to Claimant's transfer pricing study that both Parties relied on for the histor-
ical profits and noted that 25% of the profits were allocated to "Market Intangibles." As
Norpro Venezuela could not provide any of the services under this heading, they assumed

that it could have retained "at most" 75% of the entire profits.°™*

As correctly pointed out by Claimant, both Parties’ experts further included a cost item of
7% labelled "Selling/R&D/Admin." in their calculations.** Claimant and Prof. Spiller re-
fer to this cost item as marketing and distribution costs and argue that a further deduction
would double count the marketing part.**° Respondent takes the position, however, that
this cost covered only the local marketing costs in Venezuela and notes that it existed
already under the transfer pricing document, which also made a further deduction of 25%
for marketing in the US.**” In response to the question whether the 7% should not at least
be deducted from the 25%, Dr. Flores explained the correlation between the two items at
the Hearing as follows:

"7 percent is an operating cost, so it goes in the cost line. 25 percent is

not a cost. It comes from the profit line. You calculate the entire profit,

which means all the revenue coming from final consumers paying for

proppants, minus all the costs at any level—like cost in Venezuela, cost

of transportation, cost inside the U.S. And then that 7 percent is one of

the costs. Then you do the deduction, and you get a total profit. That is

100 percent of the profit. [...] So as of that, [Norpro Venezuela] cap-

tured at most, and we think that's a generous assumption, at most, 75

percent of the entire profit. So, you cannot compare the 25 and 7; they
are different concepts."*°*

The Tribunal considers Dr. Flores' explanation convincing and will therefore analyze the
question of whether any profit split should be made independently of the fact that Norpro
Venezuela already incurred 7% in "Selling/R&D/Admin." expenses. In the view of the
majority of the Tribunal, Dr. Flores' explanation is further confirmed by the transfer pric-
ing study that allocated 25% of the profits to "Marketing Intangibles" because the same
document in fact includes the 7% cost item in its preliminary price calculation.*°° The
fact that pursuant to the transfer pricing study all of the services under the heading "Mar-
keting Intangibles" are performed by SGCP demonstrates that these services had to be
performed in addition to any services for which Norpro Venezuela incurred costs under
the 7% cost item.*°

As to the question whether any deduction should be made, the Tribunal considers it plau-
sible that the highest bidder would indeed have been a company with access to a market-
ing and distribution network that could have internalized 100% of the profits from the
sale of proppants. However, this does not answer the question whether the buyer would
have factored in 100% of these profits in its calculation of the purchase price for Norpro
Venezuela. While the plant would produce the finished proppants, this alone did not en-
able the buyer to realize 100% of the profits, but this would be possible only by contrib-
uting its own marketing and distribution capabilities.

It is indeed plausible to assume that the buyer would be able to realize cost synergies by
adding Norpro Venezuela's capacities to its own capacities and factor those synergies into
its calculation of the purchase price for the plant. However, the majority of the Tribunal
is not convinced by the assumption that the buyer would have been willing to pay the
same amount as if Norpro Venezuela had been able to market and distribute the proppants
on its own. The buyer would have at least deducted the additional costs it would incur by
marketing and distributing the additional capacities it acquired.

While the amount of these additional costs factored in by the buyer is of course not
known, the Tribunal recalls that Prof. Spiller assumed that the buyer would have a net-
work similar to that of SGCP. Therefore, it appears reasonable to refer to Claimant's
transfer pricing study in this regard. While the Tribunal is aware that the buyer's addi-
tional costs may not be equal to the portion of profits that Claimant allocated to "Market-
ing Intangibles," it also has to be noted that Norpro Venezuela undisputedly retained only
27% of the profits prior to the expropriation. Against this background, to the majority of

the Tribunal it appears to be a rather conservative assumption that the buyer would have
factored in additional costs for the marketing and distribution of the proppants in an
amount that is at least equal to 25% of the profits.

Consequently, the majority of the Tribunal follows the approach of Mr. Brailovsky and
Dr. Flores to deduct 25% of the profits on export sales from Norpro Venezuela's future
cash flows.

(3) Foreign Exchange Rate and Inflation

As to the applicable foreign exchange rate at which Norpro Venezuela could have con-
verted US Dollars into bolivars and vice versa, the Tribunal notes that in their 15 May
2010 valuations, both Parties’ experts used the forecasts for the official CADIVI exchange
rate throughout the entire valuation period.**! As neither Party argues that the introduc-
tion of the more favorable SICAD II exchange rate in early 2014 was foreseeable in May
2010, the Tribunal thus does not have to express an opinion on the applicability of this
exchange rate from 2014 onwards.

 

However, there appears to be a difference with regard to the devaluation assumptions
after 15 May 2010 caused by the fact that the Parties' experts relied on exchange rate
forecasts from different sources. While Prof. Spiller relied on the forecast of Ecoanalitica,
a private, Venezuela-based macroeconomic consulting firm,*°? Mr. Brailovsky and Dr.
Flores projected the evolution of the exchange rate based on forecasts of the International
Monetary Fund.*® As pointed out by Prof. Spiller during the Hearing, the IMF does not
directly project the development of the USD-bolivar exchange rate but rather inflation
rates in the US and in Venezuela.** Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores stated in response that
the IMF projects the gross domestic product for Venezuela in US Dollars and in bolivars
and explained that they derived the exchange rate from the ratio of the two figures.**

While the Parties’ experts further debated whether the IMF makes any separate assump-
tions about devaluation or simply assumes that the exchange rate will develop in line with
inflation,®® the Tribunal considers that it does not have to make a decision in this regard.
There is no dispute between the Parties' experts that Econalitica directly projects the de-
velopment of the USD-bolivars exchange rate. Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further did
not question the reliability of Ecoanalitica's forecasts; to the contrary, they cite

Ecoanalitica's director, Mr. Asdrtbal Oliveros, as authority for their assumption regarding
a unified exchange rate that does not play a role in the 15 May 2010 valuation.5””

As Ecoanalitica is a Venezuela-based economic consulting firm, the Tribunal has no rea-
son to doubt that it is familiar with the particularities of the Venezuelan foreign exchange
market and thus in a position to provide reliable forecasts for the exchange rate. There-
fore, the Tribunal will follow Prof. Spiller's approach to rely on the contemporaneous
projections of Ecoanalitica with regard to the evolution of the foreign exchange rate after
15 May 2010. In any event, the Tribunal notes that Respondent referred to a "slight dif-
ference" with regard to devaluation assumptions and did not even quantify such differ-
ence.*® Consequently, the Tribunal considers it safe to assume that the difference is in
any event negligible.

(4) Bauxite Costs

As to the applicable bauxite price that Norpro Venezuela would have had to pay to CVG
Bauxilum under the Bauxite Contract after 15 May 2010, the Parties' experts were pro-
vided with differing instructions from the Parties. Consistent with Claimant's position that
the bauxite price increase of September 2008 amounts to a violation of the FET standard,
Prof. Spiller was instructed to eliminate the price increase from his calculation and to
apply the original contract price instead, increased by the US PPI as provided for in
Clause 10. 1 of the Bauxite Contract.* Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores on the other hand
were instructed by Respondent to apply the increased price that Norpro Venezuela actu-
ally paid as of September 2008 and throughout 2009, increased as of 2010 by the US
Ppr.§7

The Tribunal notes that apart from the dispute about the justification of the September
2008 price increase, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores also stated that Prof. Spiller had failed
to take into account two former, undisputed, price increases for transportation in August
2007 and January 2008.*”! Prof. Spiller did not address the two price increases, but noted
that pursuant to his adjustment of the price for inflation, his price for 2008 was identical
to the price referred to in the document relied on by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, i.e.,
USD 25.5 per MT.*” While it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal why the prices are

Contract, and in January 2008, the price was increased to USD 25.5/MT, consisting of an adjustment for inflation
based on Clause 10.1 (USD 0.23/MT) and an increase based on Clause 10.2 (USD 0.27/MT).

indeed the same for 2008 even though Prof. Spiller made adjustments only for inflation
but not for the increased transportation costs, the Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller's argu-
ment is not valid for 2007 (he applied a price of USD 23.8/MT despite the increase to
USD 25.0/MT in August 2007).873 In the present context, however, the Tribunal needs to
assess the applicable prices for the time period following 15 May 2010 so that an incorrect
price for 2007 is irrelevant as long as the price as of 2008 is correct.

As to the main dispute between the Parties, i.e., whether the calculation should include
the price increase of September 2008, Prof. Spiller correctly identified the dispute about
the legality of the price increase as a legal matter on which he did not express a profes-
sional opinion.*” Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores noted that it was in any event unreason-
able to assume that a willing buyer would not have taken into account the actual price
Norpro Venezuela was paying as of 2008.8” The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Brailovsky
and Dr. Flores that the starting point must be the perspective of the willing buyer in May
2010. Even if the price increase constituted a breach of contract, the buyer would have
taken into account that Norpro Venezuela was paying the increased price and had not
undertaken any legal action for breach of contract before the dispute resolution forum
provided for in the Bauxite Contract. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the alleged
illegality of the price increase would not be sufficient justification to eliminate the price
increase from the present valuation.

Tf, on the other hand, the Tribunal were convinced that the price increase was indeed
illegal and Respondent was responsible for the increase under the FET standard or the
FPS standard (either because CVG Bauxilum's conduct is attributable to the State or be-
cause MIBAM was obliged to intervene), this internationally wrongful conduct would
indeed have to be eliminated from the valuation. However, the Tribunal refers to its find-
ing above that Claimant has not established that the price increase of September 2008
amounted to a breach of contract on the part of CVG Bauxilum. Therefore: (i) it can be
left open whether Respondent could be held liable for such contractual breach — even if
it had been established — under the FET standard; and (ii) Respondent did not have an
obligation to intervene in relation to the bauxite price increase under the FPS standard.”

In the absence of any internationally wrongful conduct in connection with the bauxite
price increase, Claimant is not entitled to any compensation in this regard. Consequently,
there is no reason to eliminate the price increase from the present valuation. As to the

additional issue raised by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores regarding the exchange rate ap-
plied by Prof. Spiller who assumed that Norpro Venezuela would have paid the USD
price in bolivars,*”’ the Tribunal recalls that both Parties' experts used the CADIVI ex-
change rate in their May 2010 valuations.*”* Therefore, no decision is required in this
regard.

(5) Transportation Costs

800. The next issue concerns the transportation costs that Norpro Venezuela would have in-
curred for shipping the finished proppants to the customers. Both Parties' experts distin-
guished between three categories of transportation costs: (i) for all proppants, local ship-
ping costs within Venezuela to transport the proppants from the plant to the port of Puerto
Ordaz; (ii) for North and South American exports, shipping costs from the port of Puerto
Ordaz to the port of Corpus Christi, Texas (and possibly on to the warehouse in Alice,
Texas); and (iii) for North American exports, shipping costs from Texas to the ultimate
customer.

Local Shipping Costs in Venezuela

801. As for the local shipping costs within Venezuela for all proppants, Mr. Brailovsky and
Dr. Flores adopted Prof. Spiller's projection that these costs amounted to VEF 50.5 per
MT, increased in accordance with the (projected) Venezuelan PPI. While the Parties' ex-
perts disagree as to the applicable exchange rate in their date-of-the-award valuations,
they both apply the official CADIVI exchange rate in their May 2010 valuations, which
results in costs of USD 11.9 per MT as of 2010.5”

Shipping Costs from Venezuela to the US

802. As to the shipping costs from Venezuela to the US for all proppants to be exported, Prof.
Spiller relied on an actual shipment in March 2010 from Puerto Ordaz to Corpus Christi,
Texas at a cost of USD 99.0 per MT.**° He cross-checked that figure on the basis of
several contractual documents provided to him by Claimant, which yielded a charge of
USD 91.43 per MT.**! Based on the information from Claimant's witness Mr. Larry that
some of the proppants were shipped directly from the port of Corpus Christi to the cus-
tomer while others were first shipped on to Claimant's warehouse in Alice, Texas, Prof.
Spiller also calculated the shipping costs from Corpus Christi to Alice at USD 17.6 per

MT and concluded that the average between the total costs to Alice (USD 109.03 per MT)
and the costs to Corpus Christi (USD 91.43 per MT) were in line with his estimate of
USD 99.0 per MT.8°?

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores relied on Claimant's budgeted transportation costs for
2010, which amounted to EUR 110 per MT (converted to USD 154 per MT). They as-
sumed that this cost included the local shipping costs of USD 11.9 per MT, thus resulting
in a cost of USD 142.1 per MT for the second category of shipping costs.**? Mr. Brailov-
sky and Dr. Flores further noted that Norpro Venezuela's transfer pricing study showed a
cost for freight to the US in 2009 of USD 0.072 per pound, which translates into USD
158.7 per MT.8* Finally, they adopted Prof. Spiller's assumption that only half of the
finished proppants were shipped to Alice and his estimate of the shipping costs between
Corpus Christi and Alice (USD 17.6 per MT). Consequently, they estimated average
transportation costs of USD 133.3 per MT.8°5

The Tribunal notes that both Parties' experts relied on Claimant's 2011-2015 Strategic
Plan as the primary source for their respective estimates. While Prof. Spiller applied the
costs for one actual shipment in March 2010, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores referred to
the budgeted costs for 2010.** In principle, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to rely
on Claimant's own estimate for its 2010 budgeted costs. Claimant's witness Mr. Larry,

887

who was involved in the creation of this slide,”’’ confirmed during the Hearing that this

estimate included the shipping costs to Alice, Texas.*** With regard to the divergence
between the numbers relied on by the Parties, Mr. Larry further explained:

"So, if we look, we have an actual cost per shipment in March, dollars
per metric tonne, and then we were constantly trying to optimize the
shipment to the customer. So, if we're placing material in the Permian
Basin, we wouldn't send it to Alice, Texas. We would take it from the
warehouse, ship it, with as much efficiency as possible, directly to the
Permian Basin. And you can see that actual number for March, which
was a number of—which was a month of strong sales in the Permian
Basin, was actually $37 per pound.’

In the Tribunal's view, Mr. Larry's testimony not only supports the assumption adopted
by both Parties’ experts that half of the proppants were shipped to Alice and the other half

was shipped directly from Corpus Christi to the customer.**° More importantly, Mr. Larry
explained that the divergence between the costs for the actual shipment in March 2010
and the budgeted costs for 2010 resulted, at least in part, from the fact that the shipment
in March did not go to Alice but directly from Corpus Christi to the customer in the Per-
mian Basin.

Mr. Larry further testified that "the overall cost for freight, including the delivery of the
customer, was in this €110-per-metric-tonne range."**! Prof. Spiller also stated that "[his]
understanding is that the 110 euros includes all the expenses from Puerto Ordaz to the
customer."*°? However, the Tribunal notes that the slide from the 2011-2015 Strategic
Plan states "Supply to Alice, Texas." Therefore, the Tribunal is not entirely convinced by
Mr. Larry and Prof. Spiller's statements and will therefore also look at the subsidiary
sources that the Parties' experts presented in support of their respective estimates.

As to the costs for "Freight to U.S." set out in the transfer pricing study that Mr. Brailov-
sky and Dr. Flores translated into USD 158.7 per MT, the Tribunal notes that there is no
separate cost item for local freight costs within Venezuela so that it can again be assumed
that the costs of USD 11.9 per MT are included in that amount. However, there is a sep-
arate costs item for "U.S. Inland freight+handling" so that it can also be assumed that the
shipping costs to the customer are not included in that amount.**? As the amount of USD
146.8 per MT (excluding local shipping costs) is even higher than Mr. Brailovsky and Dr.
Flores’ estimate, the study supports the accuracy of the 2010 budgeted costs.

As to Prof. Spiller's cross-check of the costs to Corpus Christi on various contractual
documents provided to him by Claimant, which resulted in an amount that is even lower
than the costs of the actual shipment in March 2010 (USD 91.43 per MT to Corpus
Christi), the Tribunal notes that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores questioned this cross-
check in various aspects. In particular, they pointed out that the documents included an
undated memorandum of understanding and an offer transmitted by e-mail in 2008; (ii)
the service contract dating from 2008 was set to expire in August 2010 and would have
been in the process of re-negotiation in May 2010; and (iii) Prof. Spiller made various
assumptions pursuant to which the shipping costs in 2010 were lower than in 2008 when
the documents were signed or transmitted.***

While the Tribunal considers that these points of criticism do not render the documents
and Prof. Spiller's cross-check entirely unreliable, they also do not provide conclusive

evidence on the transportation costs. The resulting costs of USD 91.43 per MT are even
lower than the costs of the actual shipment in March 2010, which according to Mr. Larry
also did not include any costs to Alice.

On the balance of the evidence, the Tribunal therefore considers it appropriate to base its
conclusion on the average of all four figures presented by the Parties’ experts, i.e., USD
99.0 per MT, USD 124.5 per MT,*? USD 129.2 per MT,**° and USD 91.43 per MT (all
excluding the undisputed shipping costs of USD 17.6 per MT from Corpus Christi to
Alice). This results in an average of USD 111.03 per MT to Corpus Christi and an average
of USD 128.63 to Alice. As the Parties' experts agreed to take the average between the
costs to the two possible locations in Texas, this results in an overall average of USD
119.83 per MT.

Shipping Costs from Texas to Customers

Finally, the Parties' experts apply differing assumptions to estimate the shipping costs
from Corpus Christi or Alice to the ultimate customer. Prof. Spiller again relied on the
costs of an actual shipment in March 2010, which amounted to USD 37.0 per MT. He
assumed that 30% of the proppants were sold ex works and the remaining 70% were
evenly distributed between Claimant's geographic sales areas in the US and thus consid-

ered the costs of a shipment to a location in Texas a reasonable proxy.*””

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores again relied on Claimant's budgeted costs for 2010; how-
ever, as there was no budget for costs from Corpus Christi or Alice to the customer, they
referred to the costs for transportation from Claimant's Fort Smith Plant, Arkansas, to
Alice, which amounted to EUR 31.0 per MT (converted to USD 43.4 per MT). Mr.
Brailovsky and Dr. Flores assumed that the distance between Fort Smith and Alice rep-
resented a good estimate of average transportation costs to locations throughout the entire
US.*°8 While noting that Claimant delivers not only within the US but also to Canada,
Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores stated that, even on the assumption that Prof. Spiller's es-
timate of the sales distribution were correct, this would result in an average cost of USD
51 per MT if applied to the prices per pound set out in the Halliburton Master Agree-
ment.*” By including the sales to Canada, they calculated average costs of USD 54 per
MT.

85 USD 154.0 USD 111.9 (local shipping costs) - USD 17.6 (shipping costs to Alice) = USD 124.5 per MT.

86 USD 158.7 — USD 11.9 (local shipping co

817.

The Tribunal is of the view that neither approach is sufficiently substantiated. The ap-
proach of Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores based on the transportation costs from Fort Smith
to Alice appear rather speculative because those costs relate to a different plant and a
different route. As to Prof. Spiller's approach, the Tribunal notes that he was not provided
with any actual sales data but rather stated that he understood that approximately 30% of
proppants were sold ex works and assumed that the rest would be evenly distributed be-
tween Claimant's three US geographic sales regions. However, apart from the fact that
Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores pointed out that Claimant also sells proppants to locations
in Canada, there is no evidence in the record that Prof. Spiller made a realistic assumption.
The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that it would have been for Claimant to disclose the
actual ratio of Norpro Venezuela's sales in North America.

In addition, the Tribunal is not convinced by Prof. Spiller's assumption that the costs of
an actual shipment to a location within Texas is a good proxy for the sales throughout the
US. In particular, the fact that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores applied Prof. Spiller's sales
assumption to the prices under the Halliburton Master Agreement and arrived at a
weighted average of USD 51 per MT, creates doubt as to the reliability of Prof. Spiller's
costs estimate of USD 37 per MT.

In light of the fact that Claimant failed to disclose conclusive evidence in this regard and
further taking into account that Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores' estimate of USD 43.4 per
MT is still considerably lower than the cost they calculated under the Halliburton Master
Agreement, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to adopt their estimate for shipping costs
within North America.

Conclusion on Transportation Costs

In sum, the Tribunal finds that the present valuation should include (i) USD 11.9 per MT
of local shipping costs within Venezuela for all sales; (ii) USD 119.83 per MT of shipping
costs from Venezuela to Corpus Christi or Alice, Texas for all export sales; and (iii) USD
43.4 per MT of shipping costs within North America for all North American export sales.

(6) Capital Expenditures

As to the capital expenditures, the Tribunal notes that there is agreement between the
Parties with regard to the time horizon 2010-2018. For this time period, Mr. Brailovsky
and Dr. Flores adopted Prof. Spiller's approach to rely on the figures estimated in Claim-
ant's April 2010 Business Plan for 2010-2015 (USD 1.4 million in 2010; USD 1.0 million
in 2011; USD 1.5 million in 2012; USD 5.0 million in 2013; and USD 0.5 million per

annum in 2014-2015) and to assume that the amount of USD 0.5 million per annum (in-
flated in accordance with the US PPI) would also be required in 2016-2018.°"!

However, the Parties’ experts have applied differing figures for the time period after 2018.
Prof. Spiller assumed that the long-term capex would amount to USD 0.6 million in per-
petuity and noted that this was in line with the estimate of the maintenance capex of
Claimant's 30-year old Fort Smith Plant for 2010-2018.°

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores considered that it was unreasonable to assume that Norpro
Venezuela would have the same capex over its entire life cycle and ultimately relied on
the four capexes of the Fort Smith Plant: (i) Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE); (ii)
Maintenance of Business (MOB); (iii) Technology (TECH); and (iv) World Class Man-
ufacturing (WCM). They calculated that adjusted to the size of Norpro Venezuela, this
resulted in a capex of USD 1.6 million in perpetuity.°°

Prof. Spiller argued that apart from the MOB capex, the other three capexes were not
related to maintenance, but rather to efficiency and technological improvements, which
could be included in the valuation only if one were to account for increased production
or efficiency gains as well. However, both Parties' experts assumed that Norpro Venezue-
la's efficiency factors would remain constant in the long term.?™*

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores noted that the three "non-maintenance" capexes included
items such as roof repairs and improvements to prevent slide, trips and falls (HSE), re-
placements of old technology (TECH) and improvements to reduce breakdowns and pro-
cess disrutpions (WCM). They concluded that all of these components were necessary to
keep the plant running in perpetuity and remain competitive.*°>

In principle, the Tribunal agrees with Prof. Spiller that the inclusion of expenditures that
are not related to maintenance but improvements of technology or efficiency would make
it necessary to account for the corresponding added value as well. However, as the first
example cited by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores under the "Health, Safety and Environ-
mental" capex shows, maintenance cannot necessarily be reduced to capex labelled
"Maintenance of Business." Maintenance in terms of keeping the plant running at the
same techonological and efficiency level also includes expenditures for, e.g., adapting to
new regulatory requirements or safety improvements.

826.

Therefore, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores that Prof Spiller's dis-
tinction between one "maintenance" capex and three "non-maintenance" capexes is not
quite accurate. In particular, the Tribunal's understanding of maintenance includes several
of the items that form part of the "Health, Safety and Environmental" capex. As for the
"Technology" and "World Class Manufacturing" capexes, however, the Tribunal consid-
ers that they primarily relate to technology and efficiency improvements, which cannot
be taken into account without at the same time accounting for the resulting efficiency
gains (which Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores did not do). Consequently, the Tribunal finds
that the long-term capex for Norpro Venezuela should reflect the expenditures foreseen
for the Fort Smith Plant under the MOB and the HSE capexes, but not the TECH and
WCM capexes.

(7) Working Capital - VAT Credits

As to the working capital required to operate the plant, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores
agreed with Prof. Spiller's modelling in his second expert report, except for his approach
to the VAT credits.°” Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further did not question Prof. Spill-
er's calculation pursuant to which as of April 2010 Norpro Venezuela had a balance of
outstanding VAT credits in the amount of VEF 12.3 million (converted to USD 2.9 mil-
lion).°”” The approaches of the Parties' experts differ, however, as regards the time period
it would have taken to monetize those VAT credits.

As per instruction from counsel, Prof. Spiller relied on Venezuelan administrative law
pursuant to which claims for tax credits must be decided within 30 days and therefore
assumed that the balance of VEF 12.3 million would have been collected in the course of
2010. He modeled a working capital requirement on the assumption that (i) it would have
taken 60 days from the date of filing the request for reimbursement to monetize the VAT
certificates; and (ii) Norpro Venezuela would have recovered 80% of the VAT receiva-
bles.°°8

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores noted that Norpro Venezuela had not obtained its export
license and had not started the VAT recovery process as of May 2010 and assumed that
it would submit its first VAT recovery requests in late 2010 or 2011. According to Mr.
Brailovsky and Dr. Flores, Norpro Venezuela would therefore have received its first re-
covery certificates only approximately two years later, i.e., in 2013 due to the well-known
long delays in the recovery procedure. They further assumed that until then, Norpro Ven-
ezuela would have acquired additional inputs and supplies, which would have resulted in

new VAT credits and thus a continuous outstanding balance of VAT credits. Conse-

quently, they did not include VAT-related cash flows in their model.?”

The Tribunal considers that there are two issues to be discussed in this regard: (i) whether
Respondent may rely on delays in its own administrative procedure for the purposes of
the present valuation; and (ii) whether Respondent has established that exporters were in
fact facing delays of approximately two years in the recovery procedure.

As to the first issue, the Tribunal notes that from the strictly economic perspective of a
willing buyer, administrative delays resulting in delayed cash flows would certainly have
to be taken into account — provided that the delays actually exist. However, Claimant
argues that if Venezuela had acted in good faith, it would have followed its own admin-
istrative law to decide on the VAT credits within 30 days. While it initially raised a sep-
arate FET claim in this regard,°!° Claimant no longer pursued this argument in its subse-
quent pleadings or at the Hearing but referred to the VAT credits only in its discussion
on quantum and noted that "lengthy administrative delays have, in themselves, been found
to violate the FET standard."*'' According to Claimant, it would be "inequitable for the
State to use its own time lag in processing legal obligations as a way to avoid the obliga-

tion altogether."°'*

While the Tribunal is not inclined to allow Respondent to invoke its own administrative
deficiencies to lower the amount of Claimant's compensation, Claimant's argument could
be successful only if it were established that the delays either did not exist when Claimant
made the decision to invest in Venezuela or if Claimant was assured that it would not be
subject to such delays. The evidence shows that administrative delays in the VAT recov-
ery procedure have been a rather well-known issue in Venezuela already back in the early
2000s when Claimant considered investing in Venezuela. A news article dating from
2000 reports that VAT refunds in the amount of VEF 100 billion were due since 1993.°!?
A further news article dating from 2003 reported that since 2001, VEF 170 billion were
owed in VAT refunds." Finally, a news article dating from 2007 reported the issuance
of recovery certificates in the amount of up to VEF 3.1 billion following delays of several

months.?!5

Claimant does not contest that exporters were facing considerable delays in obtaining
VAT recovery when it made the decision to invest in Venezuela, but claims that it was

assured that Venezuela would follow its own VAT credit procedure.?!© Claimant relies in
particular on Article 43 of the VAT Law, which provides that the tax administration shall
render its decision on the recovery request within thirty business days "counted from the
date in which the request is definitely received, so long as all of the requirements set forth
to that end in the Rules, have been met."°'” According to this language, the 30-day period
starts only once the tax administration has received all of the supporting documentation
required under the VAT Law, which is not necessarily equal to the date on which it has
received the request because it is not unusual that the administration requests further doc-
umentation or information on certain issues, as Mr. Rondon explained in his written wit-

ness statement.°!®

In any event, the Tribunal does not consider it established that Claimant indeed received
specific assurances that Venezuela would comply with this provision. In particular,
Claimant could not point to any statement from a Government official that it would not
be subject to the same delays that exporters were generally facing in Venezuela at the
time. Mr. Pedersen testified in his written statement that based on meetings with CVG in
2005 they anticipated that they would receive "beneficial VAT and import tax treatment,"
without stating, however, that any specific assurances were made with regard to the VAT
recovery procedure.°!?

The contemporaneous documents that Claimant relies on in this regard explicitly refer to
exemptions from VAT and import duties pursuant to a Presidential Decree granted in
2006, but not to the VAT recovery procedure for materials that were not exempted from
VAT duty.*”° As explained by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores in their first expert report,
the VAT exemptions and the VAT recovery procedure concerned different materials, as
under an exemption, Norpro Venezuela did not have to pay any VAT in the first place
and could thus not be entitled to any refunds.°*! As Norpro Venezuela was in fact granted
an Exemption for Capital Goods Certificate by MILCO on 25 October 2007 that covered
29 specific types of equipment, it appears that the company actually received the "bene-
ficial VAT treatment" that it had been promised. As there is no specific reference to the
VAT recovery procedure for materials that were not covered by this certificate, the Tri-
bunal finds that there is no legal basis under international law to exclude delays in the
recovery procedure, provided that they are established, from the present valuation.

“

The Tribunal therefore has to assess whether Respondent has established that there were
indeed delays of approximately two years in the VAT recovery procedure in 2010. As to
the three news articles referred to above, Claimant correctly pointed out that they all date
from three to ten years earlier.°?* While they thus serve as evidence that delays were an
issue when Claimant invested in Venezuela, they do not establish that the same delays
still existed in 2010.

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores further pointed to a statement in Claimant's 8 June 2009
update to the DAC:

"Partially linked to the export issues, recovering the VAT from the tax

treasury has become a very lengthy and complex process. [...] The main

causes for the delay are related to the legal requirements that have to

be fulfilled before being granted an export license. Every single re-

quirement has been identified and assigned a plan."
While the DAC update confirms that the VAT recovery still took a considerable amount
of time, the main reasons for the delays were seen in obtaining the export license, which
had not been obtained as of June 2009. Apart from the fact that it was reported that every
legal requirement was being tackled, Respondent's witness Mr. Rondon stated in his writ-
ten witness statement that by the time of the expropriation "Norpro Venezuela had noti-
fied the tax authorities of its intention to start the process to recover VAT credits by ap-
plying for a special tax recovery certificate based upon export sales."°*+ During the Hear-
ing, Mr. Rondé6n clarified that Norpro Venezuela had actually submitted its application
for a special tax recovery certificate and thus started the recovery process.°”° As explained
by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores in their first expert report, the company first had to
obtain the export license before it could submit a tax recovery request.””° As Mr. Rondén's
testimony confirms that Norpro Venezuela had initiated the second step by May 2010, it
must have completed the first step by that time, which had been described as the main
cause for delays in the DAC update.

At the same time, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Rond6n stated in his written witness state-
ment:

"We were conscious that, even after a request for a special tax recovery
certificate was initially submitted, the process would be lengthy and te-
dious and would involve verification of all related transactions. We also
knew that it would be typical as part of the process for the tax authori-
ties to seek additional documentation. I understand that this procedure

840.

to recover VAT in Venezuela lasts at least two years from the initial
filing of the request."°""

As correctly pointed out by Respondent, Mr. Rond6n was not cross-examined on his
statement on the VAT recovery procedure.°”* The Tribunal also noted above that the 30-
day period in Article 43 of the VAT Law starts only once the tax authority has received
all documentation that it deems necessary for its decision on the recovery request. Apart
from this provision, Claimant has not presented any indication that the statement made
by Mr. Rondon was inaccurate or that the situation had changed since the news articles
dating from 2000, 2003 and 2007.

Consequently, the Tribunal follows the approach of Respondent's experts that the recov-
ery procedure took considerable time during which new VAT credits were accumulating,
thus creating a continuous balance of outstanding VAT credits. As Norpro Venezuela
could not operate without continuously accumulating new VAT credits while waiting for
the recovery of the initial balance, the Tribunal considers it plausible to assume that they
form part of Norpro Venezuela's working capital as a going concern. As both Parties’
experts assumed that production would have increased until 2014,°?? — and with it the
annual amount of newly accumulated VAT credits — the Tribunal further follows Re-
spondent's experts in that Norpro Venezuela would have had a continuing outstanding
balance of VAT credits equal to at least the amount outstanding in April 2010. As such
amount would have continuously been locked in the operating business, it does not pre-
sent any separate value that a willing buyer would pay for in addition to Norpro Vene-
zuela's value as a going concern.

(8) New Taxes Introduced after the Expropriation

Finally, there has been a debate between the Parties and their experts as to the point in
time from which Norpro Venezuela would have been subject to a contribution of 1% of
the annual income to be made by companies with more than 50 employees under the
Organic Law on Drugs. However, as explicitly noted by Respondent, Mr. Brailovsky and
Dr. Flores did not include this contribution in their 15 May 2010 valuation because it was

not applicable to Norpro Venezuela as of 2010 due to the use of its outsourcing model.?°°

There is further common ground that a second contribution of 1% of the annual income
under the Organic Law on Sports, Physical Activity and Physical Education is not to be

included in the 15 May 2010 valuation because this law was enacted only in 2011 and
thus not known to a willing buyer in 2010.°*!

As there is agreement between the Parties that neither contribution could be foreseen as
of 15 May 2010, the Tribunal finds that the two contributions cannot be included in the
DCF calculation evaluating Norpro Venezuela as of that date.

c) Historical Losses Associated with the Increase of the Bauxite Price

aa) Summary of Claimant's Position

In addition to the fair market value of the plant, Claimant claims that it is entitled to
compensation for the losses it has incurred for the supply of bauxite under the Bauxite
Contract due to the price increase in violation of Article 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty. In
Claimant's view, Respondent is liable for the overpayment of USD 1.3 million as of 15
May 2010.9?

Claimant argues that its "legal right to bauxite at the designated contractual price" of
USD 25.5 per MT in 2008, inflated to USD 24.3 per MT in 2009, was part of the rights
that were expropriated by Respondent. According to Claimant, Norpro Venezuela could
otherwise have pursued its legal claims under the Bauxite Contract against CVG Bauxi-

lum; thus, Claimant must be compensated for the taking of this intangible right.?>

bb) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent submits that Claimant's claim for damages is meritless because (i) Norpro
Venezuela agreed to the bauxite price increase as long as there would be no further price
increase throughout 2009; and (ii) the claim is inadmissible, as Norpro Venezuela should
have pursued this claim for an alleged breach of the Bauxite Contract in an arbitration

proceeding in Caracas, as provided for in the Contract.°*+

In response to Claimant's argument that it expropriated Norpro Venezuela's legal right to
vindicate its alleged claim against CVG Bauxilum, Respondent argues that Norpro Ven-
ezuela's contractual claims against CVG Bauxilum, even if it had any, were not expropri-
ated.°*

cc) The Tribunal's Analysis

The Tribunal notes that this claim again relates to Claimant's FET and FPS claims regard-
ing the bauxite price increase in September 2008. Similar to the Tribunal's finding above
that there is no basis to exclude the price increase from the valuation of Norpro Venezue-
Ja's future cash flows as of 15 May 2010, it also finds that there is no basis for Claimant's
separate claim to be compensated for the payment of the increased price prior to 15 May
2010.

This finding is independent of the question whether any contractual claims of Norpro
Venezuela against CVG Bauxilum would have formed part of the expropriated rights for
which Claimant is to be compensated. In any event, the Tribunal found that Claimant has
not established that the price increase was not justified under the Bauxite Contract and is
therefore not convinced that Norpro Venezuela had any claims for breach of contract
against CVG Bauxilum that could have been expropriated.

Consequently, Claimant is not entitled to compensation for the fact that it paid the in-
creased price of USD 33.8 per MT between September 2008 and May 2010 that was
quantified by Prof. Spiller at USD 1.3 million as of May 2010.°°

d) Conclusion on the Calculation of Damages

In conclusion, the Tribunal has found that the calculation of the compensation to be paid
by Respondent has to be based on the net present value of Norpro Venezuela's future cash
flows as of 15 May 2010. The net present value is to be determined by applying a nominal
discount rate of 19.88%.

As to the future cash flows of Norpro Venezuela, the Tribunal has found that (i) the as-
sumptions on proppants prices should be based on the projections in Claimant's April
2010 Business Plan; (ii) a deduction of 25% should be made on the profits on export sales
to account for the fact that Norpro Venezuela did not have its own marketing and distri-
bution network; (iii) as to the foreign exchange rate to be applied, the devaluation as-
sumptions after 15 May 2010 should be based on the exchange rate forecasts made by
Ecoanalitica; (iv) the bauxite costs should be calculated on the basis of the increased price
of USD 33.8 per MT that Norpro Venezuela in fact paid as of September 2008; (v) the
transportation costs should include USD 11.9 per MT of local shipping costs within Ven-
ezuela for all sales, plus USD 119.83 per MT of shipping costs from Venezuela to Corpus
Christi or Alice, Texas for all export sales, plus USD 43.4 per MT of shipping costs within
North America for all North American export sales; (vi) the long-term capex for Norpro

Venezuela should reflect the expenditures foreseen for the Fort Smith Plant under the
MOB and the HSE capexes, but not the TECH and WCM capexes; and (vii) it should be
assumed that the VAT credits form part of the working capital required for the continuous
operation of Norpro Venezuela and thus do not present any separate value in addition to
Norpro Venezuela's value as a going concern.

Finally, the Tribunal has found that Claimant is not entitled to any compensation for his-
toric losses associated with the increase of the bauxite price in September 2008 because
the price increase was justified under Article 10.2 of the Bauxite Contract.

3. Interest

As a final step, the Tribunal has to decide on Claimant's claim for pre-award interest as
of 15 May 2010 and its claim for post-award interest until the date of payment by Vene-
zuela.

a) Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant claims that it is entitled to both pre-award interest and post-award interest. Ac-
cording to Claimant, it must be brought in the position it would have been in if the expro-
priation had not occurred; thus, the interest rate should be equal to the return it expected

to earn from its investment in Venezuela, i.e., its opportunity cost.?*”

Claimant relies on the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina, which ordered interest at the
claimant's cost of capital, finding that the interest rate should be "a reasonable proxy for
the return the Claimants could otherwise have earned on the amounts invested and lost
in the [...] concession."**® Claimant further refers to the tribunal in France Telecom v.
Lebanon, which awarded interest at a rate of 10% as the reasonable profitability of capital
of which the claimant had been deprived by the State's unlawful actions.”*? Claimant also
relies on the tribunal in Alpha Projektholding v. Ukraine, which awarded pre-award in-
terest at the risk-free rate plus the market risk premium on the assumption that "this rate
better reflects the opportunity costs associated with Claimant's losses, adjusted for the
risks of investing in the Ukraine."**° In addition, Claimant refers to the ICC tribunal in

ConocoPhillips v. PDVSA, which granted interest at a rate corresponding to an investor's
oat

cost of equity in Venezuela.

855. Claimant argues that if they had re-invested the cash flows generated by Norpro Vene-
zuela, they would have earned returns at its cost of equity. Therefore, Claimant claims
that it should also be awarded both pre-award interest and post-award interest at a rate
equivalent to Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity. Claimant takes the position that there
is no reason to distinguish between the pre-award interest rate and the post-award interest
rate except that the post-award interest rate should capture the present-day cost of equity
figure (14.53% as of 31 August 2015).°4

856. In addition, Claimant is of the view that any other interest rate would lead to an unjust
enrichment of Respondent because it had free access to the expropriated funds. Claimant
contends that the reasonable cost that PDVSA would have incurred if it had to borrow the
amount in question is equal to the yields on its bullet bonds, which was close to 9% in
2013.°"4 According to Claimant, this would also be the minimum "appropriate" market

interest rate under Article 5(1) of the Treaty, but maintains that under the standard of

customary international law, it is entitled to Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity.°*>

857. In Claimant's view, the interest rate cannot be based on the risk-free rate in the present
case because Venezuela has trouble paying its debts and has to pay the Award in US
dollars, i.e., a currency other than its own so that it cannot print money to satisfy the
Award. Claimant argues that for more than five years it was forced to lend money to

Venezuela despite the risk that it might not pay, which is why the market interest rate

must reflect the costs of a mid- to long-term loan to Venezuela.*4°

858. In particular with regard to the post-award interest rate, Claimant argues that otherwise
Respondent would have no interest in paying the Award before it has paid all of its other

debts to its creditors. In Claimant's view, this would not serve the purpose of post-award

interest to serve as an effective incentive to comply with the terms of the Award.”

In any event, Claimant asserts that the interest rate advanced by Respondent is not a mar-
ket interest rate but rather equivalent to an inter-bank rate and refers to the tribunal in
Tidewater v. Venezuela, which rejected Venezuela's suggestion on that basis. In addition,
Claimant submits that none of the tribunals relied on by Respondent has applied a 3-
month treasury bond but considers it "well settled" that the pre-award interest rate should

reflect a mid- to long-term interest rate.°*

In Claimant's view, the Tribunal should award interest on an annual compounding basis
in order to fully reflect the time value of its losses and thus give effect to the standard of
full reparation under customary international law.” Claimant argues that "nearly all
real-life transactions and financial operations" involve compound interest and notes that
the tribunals in the five most recent ICSID decisions involving Venezuelan expropriations

have awarded compound interest.**°

b) Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent rejects Claimant's claim that it should be awarded interest in the amount of
Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity and argues that this does not qualify as an "appropriate
market interest rate" under Article 5(1) of the Trreaty. In addition, Respondent considers
it "absurd" to update past cash flows at a higher rate than the discount rate that Prof.
Spiller calculated for the purposes of discounting future cash flows, even though the risks
and uncertainties of the future do not apply.?°!

In Respondent's view, Claimant's alternative argument of applying the rate applicable to
PDVSA's debt is equally inappropriate because interest as a form of compensation should
focus on Claimant's loss caused by the fact that it did not receive payment on a fixed date.
As Claimant no longer bore any risk associated with its investment as of 15 May 2010,

Respondent claims that the appropriate interest rate is the risk-free-rate.°™

According to Respondent, market interest rates in the commercial context are "almost
always" based on a base rate, such as the LIBOR or the short term US Treasury bill rate,
to be increased by a certain spread depending on the creditworthiness of the borrower,
i.e., in this case Claimant's ultimate parent company Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. In light

of the integrity issue raised with regard to the LIBOR, Respondent takes the view that the

interest rate should be based on the US Treasury bills; it selects the 3-month bills to com-

pensate Claimant for any "short-term borrowing" it may have required pending the issu-
ance of the present Award.??

864. Respondent refers to the tribunal in Siemens v. Argentina, which awarded pre-award in-
terest based on the average 6-month US Treasury bills (2.66%).°°+ Respondent further
relies on the cases of LG&E and BG Group in which the tribunals applied short-term US
Treasury bill rates.°°> Respondent also refers to the tribunal in Occidental v. Ecuador,
which applied the monthly rate on US Treasury bills stating that it "reflect[ed] a prudent,
risk-free and conservative re-investment practice."*° Finally, Respondent relies on the
tribunal in Yukos v. Russia, which awarded pre-award interest based on the average yield
of the 10-year US Treasury bond.” According to Respondent, various tribunals explic-
itly refused to apply the claimant's cost of capital as the basis for the pre-award interest

rate.°°*

865. Respondent submits that the average yield on debt with a 3-month maturity carrying the
same rating as that of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (BBB) was 1.09%, while the yield on
short-term US Treasury bills was 0.08%. Respondent concludes that the applicable mar-
ket interest rate to be applied to the net present value of the cash flows as of 15 May 2010
should thus be the 3-month US Treasury bill rate plus 1.01%.°°°

866. Finally, Respondent submits that interest should be calculated on a simple basis because
compound interest is prohibited under Venezuelan law.°” In this regard, Respondent re-
lies in particular on the tribunal in Yukos v. Russia, which held that simple interest was
"just and reasonable."**! Respondent further contests Claimant's suggestion that award-

ing compound interest is the norm in international arbitration and refers to various deci-

sions in which simple interest was applied.

c) The Tribunal's Analysis

The Tribunal will first determine the applicable pre-award interest rate (aa)) and then
assess whether there is any reason to apply a differing rate for post-award interest (bb)).
Finally, the Tribunal will address the issue of simple versus compound interest (ce)).

aa) Pre-Award Interest Rate

As the value of Norpro Venezuela and thus the amount of compensation to be paid to
Claimant is to be assessed as of 15 May 2010, it is undisputed between the Parties that
Claimant is further entitled to payment of pre-award interest as from this date.

The Tribunal notes that Prof. Spiller did not discuss pre-award interest (or the update of
historical cash flows to be made in the alternative date-of-the-award valuation) but simply
applied Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity based on an instruction from Claimant's coun-
sel.° In his 15 May 2010 valuation, he calculated pre-award interest on the basis of
Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity (estimated at 13.04% as of 2014) and in the alternative
based on PDVSA's cost of debt as the average yield of seven USD bullet bonds during
2013 (estimated at 9.08%), but again he did not discuss either alternative.°™

Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores took the position that "from a strict economic point of
view" the pre-award interest rate should be the risk-free rate. However, they recognized
that it is common in arbitration to apply "some sort of ‘normal’ commercial rate." There-
fore, they adopted two criteria: (i) a short-term maturity of three months as the date of the
award is not known and the loan required as a result of the delay in payment must thus be
renewed constantly; and (ii) Claimant's risk measured as the yield of debt with a BBB
rating, i.e., the rating that Compagnie de Saint-Gobain carries. According to Mr. Brailov-
sky and Dr. Flores, the yield on BBB bonds with a 3-month maturity issued by industrial
companies in the US was on average 1.09%, i.e., a spread of 1.01% over the US 3-month
US Treasury bills.°°

As to the approach applied by Prof. Spiller, Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores considered it
incorrect to use 2013 and 2014 interest rates for a period starting on 15 March 2010 in-
stead of a certain average over the time period in question. In addition, they note that only

also note that, while the LIBOR rate has often been used as a benchmark in the past, it might be inappropriate to
use it in the present case given that its integrity as suitable interest rate benchmark has recently been challenged.

two of the PDVSA bonds used by Prof. Spiller had a short-term maturity — they yielded

an average of 3.6% three months before maturity.

The Tribunal recalls that Article 5(1) subparagraph 3 of the Treaty provides that interest

shall accrue at an "appropriate market interest rate" ("taux d'intérét de marché appro-
1,987

prié" / “adecuada tasa de interés del mercado’ As to the standard under customary
international law, Article 38 of the ILC Draft Articles provides that "[t]he interest rate
and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve [the] result [of ensuring full repara-
tion]."°° While the Tribunal is aware that an appropriate market interest rate is not nec-
essarily the same as an interest rate that ensures full reparation of the damage Claimant
incurred, it appears possible under the present circumstances to settle on a rate that satis-
fies both standards.

Claimant takes the position that under the standard of full reparation it would be entitled
to interest at the rate of Norpro Venezuela's cost of equity as being equal to the return
Claimant expected to earn from its investment.° However, the Tribunal notes that, re-
gardless of whether the expropriation would be labelled as "Jawful" or "unlawful," this is
not a case in which Respondent was not permitted to expropriate Norpro Venezuela per
se. The Tribunal rather found that Respondent failed to comply with the requirements
concerning the payment of compensation that should have accompanied the expropria-
tion. Consequently, Claimant is not to be brought in the position it would have been in if
it were still the owner of Norpro Venezuela, but rather in the position it would have been
in if Respondent had paid compensation on or shortly after 15 May 2010.

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that it would not be ac-
curate to award Claimant interest at a rate that accounts for the risks of investing in a
company located in Venezuela even though Claimant was no longer bearing these risks
and, more importantly, would also not have been bearing these risks if it had been com-
pensated on 15 May 2010. Therefore, the Tribunal will not award interest at Norpro Ven-
ezuela's cost of equity.

Alternatively, Claimant claims that the appropriate market interest rate would be PDVSA'
cost of debt, arguing that it was forced to grant a loan to Respondent in the amount of the
compensation owed to it as of 15 May 2010.9”

There is no indication that the determination of an appropriate market interest rate should
account for the State's cost of debt. Claimant has not cited any decision from an interna-
tional tribunal in support of its submission but refers to a paper from Fisher and Romaine
on pre-judgment interest in US litigation and a statement from Prof. Damodaran. How-
ever, as Respondent correctly pointed out in its letter of 2 June 2015, Fisher and Romaine
considered that the risks associated with the particular defendant resulted from litigation
rather than the violation itself and thus ultimately did not justify a deviation from the
application of the risk-free rate.°”! As to the statement made by Prof. Damodaran, the
Tribunal notes that this statement did not concern the determination of an appropriate
interest rate but was rather made as part of the requirements for an investment to be risk-
free.?”? Therefore, the Tribunal considers that none of the authorities cited by Claimant
supports its position that the "appropriate market interest rate" should reflect Respond-
ent's cost of debt.

In principle, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent and its experts (reyling on Fisher and
Romaine) that the loss to be compensated by awarding interest on the principal amount
is the time value of money, without factoring in any risks that Claimant did not bear.°”?
However, this does not render it completely irrelevant that, if Claimant had received the
compensation on or shortly after 15 May 2010, it would have had the opportunity to re-
invest this amount and earn a return considerably above the return of the risk-free rate.
Therefore, the Tribunal considers that, in the circumstances of this case, both the custom-
ary international law standard of full reparation and the standard in Article 5(1) of the
Treaty require the application of what Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores described as "some
sort of ‘normal’ commercial rate" that is commonly applied in arbitrations.°”*

While Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores therefore added Claimant's cost of debt for short-
term loans to the risk-free rate, the Tribunal is not convinced that this appropriately cap-
tures Claimant's loss of investment opportunity in the present case. The Tribunal wishes
to re-emphasize that it does not intend to award interest at a rate equal to the opportunity
cost of Claimant's investment in Norpro Venezuela (nor in any hypotethical alternative
investment), primarily because Claimant in fact did not bear the risk associated with such
arate of return. At the same time, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant's own cost of
debt does not adequately reflect the fact that, over a period of several years, Claimant was
deprived of the opportunity to dispose of the money it should have received in connection
with the expropriation of its investment in Venezuela.

883.

Under these circumstances, the interest rate to be applied in the present case should there-
fore achieve a balance between, on the one hand, avoiding the granting of a rate of return
that would not have been achievable without considerable risk, and on the other hand,
acknowledging that Claimant would have been in a position to use its funds for more than
just a risk-free investment if it had been paid on or shortly after 15 May 2010. In the
Tribunal's view, this applies in particular in times where the risk-free interest rates are
close to zero as they were for almost the entire time period between the date of the expro-
priation and the date of the Award.

Consequently, the Tribunal exercises the discretion it has under either Article 5(1) of the
Treaty and under customary international law and awards an interest rate that qualifies as
both an "appropriate market interest rate" and a rate that "ensure[s] full reparation" in
terms of a reasonable opportunity to invest the principal amount in the market. Taking up
the concerns raised by Respondent and its experts regarding the integrity of the LIBOR
rate as a reliable benchmark for interest rates, the Tribunal will instead refer to the US
Treasury bill rate, which both Parties' experts have relied on in various aspects of their
valuations. As to the appropriate maturity, the Tribunal notes that, while Mr. Brailovsky
and Dr. Flores applied the 3-month rate, this choice is not supported by any of the cases
relied on by Respondent in the context of its submissions on interest. It rather appears

that the 6-month rate is a rate that is commonly applied by investment treaty tribunals.°”°

The Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from this practice and therefore finds that the pre-
award interest rate should be based on the 6-month US Treasury bill rate. In order to
reflect the above mentioned considerations relating to the balance between risk and re-
investment opportunity, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to add a spread of 2% to this
risk-free rate.

In sum, the Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to pre-award interest at a rate equal to
2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate.

bb) Post-Award Interest Rate

The Tribunal notes that Claimant explicitly takes the position that there is no reason to
distinguish between pre-award interest and post-award interest.°”° However, the Tribunal
is aware that Claimant makes this statement in the context of its argument that it should

Ml 841-842. Tribunals that applied the LIBOR rate also commonly referred to the 6-month rate, see, e.g., Lemire
v. Ukraine (RL-122), 4 353; PSEG Global Inc. et al. v. Turkey (RL-86), { 348.

be awarded pre-award interest at a rate at least equal to Respondent's cost of debt. Spe-
cifically with regard to post-award interest, Claimant argues that if the interest rate were
lower than Respondent's cost of debt, Venezuela would have no incentive to comply with
the Award — contrary to the very purpose of awarding post-award interest.°””

Neither Respondent nor its expert makes any explicit statement as to what they consider
to be the applicable post-award interest rate in the present case. They also do not address
Claimant's argument that post-award interest should serve as an incentive to comply with
the Award.

The Tribunal notes that both Article 5(1) of the Treaty and Article 38(2) of the ILC Draft
Articles provide that interest shall continue to accrue until the date on which the actual
payment is made.°”* Therefore, the Tribunal will award post-award interest on the amount
to be paid pursuant to the Award.

As to the applicable rate, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that, in principle, there is no
reason to apply differing rates for pre-award interest and post-award interest. The Tribu-
nal further sees no reason to deviate from this general rule because it has found above
that the applicable pre-award interest rate might be lower than Respondent's (alleged) cost
of debt. In the Tribunal's view, post-award interest serves the same purpose as pre-award
interest, i.e., to compensate Claimant for the time value of money and the fact that it
cannot dispose of the amount until the date of actual payment; however, it is not meant
to ensure compliance with the Award. Therefore, the Tribunal again considers that Re-
spondent's cost of debt is not the appropriate benchmark to determine the applicable in-
terest rate; rather, interest shall accrue at the same rate both prior to and following the
Award.

cc) Simple / Compound Interest

Finally, the Tribunal has to determine whether interest shall be calculated on a simple
basis, as advanced by Respondent, or compounded annually, as claimed by Claimant.

The Tribunal is aware of Respondent's argument that compound interest is prohibited
pursuant to Article 530 of the Venezuelan Commercial Code and its reliance on the case
of Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v. Venezuela, in which the tribunal did not

Damages in International Investment Law, 2009, (RL-97), ff 6.245-6.246.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13 Page 229 of 234

award compound interest based on the combined fact that this was not allowed by Vene-
zuelan law and not required by international law.°”

889. However, the Tribunal notes that this decision, which is the only one cited by Respondent
in this regard, dates from 2003. As correctly pointed out by Claimant, several more recent
decisions involving Venezuela included an award of compound interest, in particular
Tidewater, OI European and Venezuela Holdings dating from 2015 and 2014 respec-
tively.°8°

890. In the Tribunal's view, the fact that compound interest is not allowed under Venezuelan
law does not prevent this Tribunal from awarding compound interest because the legal
basis for Claimant's claim for interest is either Article 5(1) of the Treaty or customary
international law. This finding is not in contradiction with the tribunal's finding in Auto-
pista v. Venezuela because the tribunal in that case did not hold that Article 530 of the
Venezuelan Commercial Code prevented it from awarding compound interest per se but
rather noted this fact in addition to its finding that compound interest was not an estab-
lished principle under, and therefore not required by, international law.

891.

As more than a decade has passed since the Autopista award was rendered, the Tribunal
considers it appropriate to re-assess the finding whether compound interest can be con-
sidered a well-established principle under international law. Upon review of the cases
cited by the Parties in connection with interest, the Tribunal notes that a majority of them
awarded compound interest.°*! While Respondent did cite several cases in which interest
was awarded on a simple basis, it appears that this was either due to the particular cir-
cumstances prevailing in the respective case or not supported by any reasoning for the
tribunal's decision.

892. In particular, the tribunal in Yukos v. Russia on which Respondent relies explicitly recog-
nized that "the awarding of compound interest under international law now represents a
form of'jurisprudence constante' in investor-state expropriation cases" but deviated from

this practice in light of the "significant amount of damages" owed by Russia.°*? In RosIn-
vest v. Russia, the tribunal recognized that "recent investment treaty arbitration have
awarded compound interest" but also noted that "this practice is by no means unanimous"
and held that "in light of the speculative nature of the investment" it would be unjust to
award compound interest.°*? The tribunal in Desert Line v. Yemen did not give any rea-
sons for its decision to award simple interest rather than compound interest as requested
by the claimants in that case.°*

In CME v. Czech Republic, the tribunal again recognized that "in recent years interna-
tional arbitral tribunals, particularly those acting under bilateral investment treaties,

have increasingly have [sic] ded

1 interest essentially in re ition of the
prevalent contemporary commercial reality that companies that borrow pay compound
interest." The tribunal found, however, that the claimant had not established that it actu-
ally had paid compound interest on loans it had borrowed from banks and therefore did
not find "particular circumstances" that would justify to award compound interest.°*° The
Tribunal notes that, while the CME tribunal apparently considered it necessary to find
“particular circumstances" that justified compound interest, this decision again dates
from 2003 and might therefore not be representative of recent developments in both mar-
ket lending and international investment arbitration.

Finally, the tribunal in SPP v. Egypt again decided that interest was not to be compounded
without giving any specific reasons for its decision.**° As the decision dates from 1992,
the Tribunal in any event considers that it does not provide useful guidance as to recent
developments in international investment arbitration.

In sum, the majority of investment tribunals have in recent years decided to award com-
pound interest and even most of those tribunals that decided to award simple interest for
a particular reason, recognized that compound interest represents what the CME tribunal
described as the "prevalent contemporary commercial reality." The Tribunal would not
go as far as saying that it would thus be for Respondent to establish particular circum-
stances that would justify not awarding compound interest. However, since the Tribunal
has decided to award an appropriate market rate, it does not see any reason in the present
case not to follow the majority of tribunals, which have decided to award compound in-
terest on the principal amount.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that both pre-award interest and post-award interest
shall be subject to compounding. As to the periodicity, the Tribunal follows Claimant's
argument that interest should be compounded annually.

4. Taxation Liabilities

Finally, Claimant requests in its two post-hearing submissions a declaration that (i) the
award of damages and interest be made net of applicable Venezuelan taxes; and (ii) Ven-
ezuela may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and in-
terest. In addition, Claimant requests that Respondent be ordered to indemnify Claimant
in respect of any double taxation liabilities that would arise in France or elsewhere that
would not have arisen but for Venezuela's adverse measures. °°”

Respondent did not comment on this request in its Post-Hearing Reply Brief.

The Tribunal notes that Claimant has raised its claim regarding taxation liabilities only
after the hearing, i.e., in its relief sought as set out in its Post-Hearing Submission and its

 

Second Post-Hearing Submission. In addition, besides failing to provide any justification
for its decision to raise this claim only at such a late point in time, Claimant has not made
any submissions on the claim outside its relief sought.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that it needs to distinguish between the first two
claims relating to taxation of the awarded compensation within Venezuela on the one
hand and the additional claim relating to potential double taxation liabilities that might
arise outside of Venezuela on the other.

As to the first two claims, the Tribunal notes that the Parties' experts have both taken an
income tax rate of 34% into account as part of their respective valuation of the compen-
sation to which Claimant is entitled.°** The Tribunal further notes that, while the experts
initially disagreed on a specific aspect of Claimant's expert Prof. Spiller's determination
of the taxable income, i.e., the aspect of depreciation as modeled by Prof. Spiller in his
first report,°*? Prof. Spiller adopted the method of Respondents’ experts Dr. Brailovsky
and Dr. Flores in his second report.” This was acknowledged by Respondents’ experts
in their second report.®”! It therefore appears to the Tribunal that the Parties' experts are
in agreement as to the treatment of income taxes and depreciation in their calculations.

In light of the above, the Tribunal considers it justified to assume that the valuation
method agreed on by the Parties adequately accounts for income taxes that would have
had to be paid by Norpro Venezuela in the future in the but-for scenario.” Any further
taxation by Venezuela of the compensation to be paid to Claimant would therefore
amount to a double-taxation of this amount. Consequently, the Tribunal holds that Claim-
ant's request that (i) the award of damages and interest be made net of applicable Vene-
zuelan taxes; and (ii) Venezuela may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the
award of damages and interest, is justified. In fact, it logically results from the valuation
method selected by the Parties' experts and in particular their agreement on how to deal
with income taxes in their calculations. In the Tribunal's view, no further elaboration on
Claimant's part was necessary to grant this declaratory request and, moreover, it is un-
problematic that Claimant included this request in its relief sought only as of its Post-
Hearing Submission.

Consequently, Claimant's request relating to the taxation of the awarded compensation
with Venezuela is granted.

As to the additional claim for an indemnification in respect of any hypothetical future
double taxation liabilities that might arise in any third country, the Tribunal considers that
such claim would have required at least some elaboration by Claimant in order to be con-
sidered substantiated. Claimant has specified neither the legal basis for eventual taxation,
nor the tax rate nor the grounds based on which Respondent should compensate it for
incurring such liability. In addition, there is no indication that any such liability towards
third-party States was included in the calculations of the Parties' experts and, thus, that a
failure to grant Claimant's request in this regard would lead to a double-taxation of the
awarded amount. Finally, the relief Claimant is seeking would have required at least a
certain degree of probability that a third-party State will indeed impose taxes on the
awarded compensation, which has not been alleged by Claimant.

In the absence of any submissions on this request outside Claimant's relief sought, the
Tribunal considers that such request is speculative and unfounded;®” the Tribunal there-
fore sees no basis for ordering an indemnification against foreign taxation liabilities as
requested by Claimant. Consequently, Claimant's claim that Respondent be ordered to
indemnify Claimant in respect of any double taxation liabilities that would arise in France
or elsewhere that would not have arisen but for Venezuela's adverse measures is denied.

G. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION

907. The present decision reflects the Tribunal's findings on liability and the principles of

quantum as set out above. Subsequent to the notification of this decision to the Parties,
the Tribunal will, by separate order, invite the Parties to attempt to seek agreement on the

final amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the

expropriation of Norpro Venezuela — based on the findings contained in the present deci-
sion. Failing agreement reached between the Parties within two months from the notifi-

cation of this decision, the Tribunal will, following consultation with the Parties, fix a

calendar for submissions of the Parties on the remaining quantum issues to be decided.

908. Based on the above, the Tribunal renders the following

Ba

DECISION ON LIABILITY AND THE PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM

Respondent has breached Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty
by failing to specify the amount of compensation and to pay prompt compen-
sation for the expropriation of Claimant's investment in Venezuela.

Respondent shall pay to Claimant the amount of compensation to be calcu-
lated on the basis of the Tribunal's findings summarized at paragraphs 849
through 851 above, plus pre-award interest as of 15 May 2010 until the date
of the Award at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury
bill rate, compounded annually.

Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest on the amount of
compensation under 2 as of the date of the Award until the date of payment
at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, com-
pounded annually. Post-award interest is to be paid only on the principal
amount of compensation, and not on the pre-award interest awarded.

The award of damages and interest is made net of applicable Venezuelan
taxes, and Respondent may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of
the award of damages and interest.

The decision on costs is reserved for the Award.

All other claims and requests are dismissed.

CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE CHARLES N. BROWER

1. I agree with the Tribunal’s finding (paragraph 908(1)) that Respondent is responsible
for a breach of Article 5(1), subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Agreement between the Government
of the French Republic and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on
Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments (hereinafter “the BIT”) in
expropriating Claimant’s 99.99%-owned Venezuelan subsidiary Norpro Venezuela C.A.
(hereinafter “Norpro”), as well as with most of the Tribunal’s detailed analysis of the correct
elements to guide the discounted cashflow calculation of the compensation to be awarded to
Claimant. I must dissent, however, from two aspects of that analysis that, both as an economic
matter as well as a matter of the applicable law, deprive the Claimant of much of that to which
it is entitled, whether under the BIT or under international law generally. See Case
Concerning the Factory at Chorzéw (Claim for Indemnity) (Germany v. Poland), P.C.LJ.
Series A No. 17 (1928). Specifically, the Tribunal has failed to enforce the BIT and

international law generally in that it:

(a) Has included in the country risk portion of the percentage by which the
projected cash flow of Norpro is to be discounted (i.e., 10.26% as per
paragraph 753) precisely the risk of uncompensated expropriation, as well as
other violations of the BIT (paragraphs 713-714), from which this Tribunal has
been constituted to rescue Claimant, and which in the instant Decision on
Liability and the Principles of Quantum (hereinafter “the Decision”) the
Tribunal professes to accomplish, resulting in a country risk factor that is 5.76
points above, hence 228% of, 4.5%, the only country risk factor number either
Party has placed before the Tribunal as excluding the risk of BIT violations;

and

(b) Has excluded 25% of Norpro’s export sales profits on the ground that the
Claimant, Norpro’s 99.99% owner, has by tax-related intercompany transfer
pricing or other bookkeeping choices charged Norpro approximately that

amount of its profits for Claimant’s contributions to Norpro’s marketing.

The vices of these two reductions of Claimant’s entitlement under the BIT and general

international law should be obvious.

2. The first problem, under 1(a) just above, arises from the misunderstanding by the
Tribunal of Article 5(1), paragraph 2, which specifies that compensation for an expropriation
must be “equal to the actual value of the investment[] concerned,” and of general international
law, which as per Chorzdw (page 47 of the Judgment), requires “that reparation must, as far
as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.” The Decision has
morphed the applicable law into applying a compensation standard of “fair market value,”

which, as applied by the Decision, unfortunately has led to injustice to the Claimant.

3. By increasing the country risk factor to include precisely the risk against which the
Decision undertakes to insulate the Claimant, whom the Tribunal has found to have been
injured by the expropriatory breach of the BIT by the Respondent, the Tribunal does an
injustice to the Claimant. It takes away with one hand what it has purported to give the
Claimant with the other. To reduce the recovery to the injured Claimant by applying a “fair
market value” that incorporates the very risk of which the Claimant purportedly is being
relieved by the Tribunal is to deny the Claimant the full compensation to which it is entitled.
It is like undertaking to restore to the owner of a severely damaged automobile a perfectly
repaired and restored vehicle but then leaving parts of it missing because it just might be
damaged again in the future. The obvious logic of this was recognized by a very distinguished
tribunal in Gold Reserve, Inc. v. Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award (22 Sept.
2014) { 841, which should have persuaded my colleagues not to follow the misguided
precedent of Tidewater Investment SRL v. Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Award (13
Mar. 2015). Significantly, the necessity of excluding from the country risk factor the very
treaty risk of which a claimant is found to have been a victim was underscored already 27
years ago, in 1989, by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in Phillips Petroleum Company
Tran v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, et al., Award No. 425-39-2 (29 June 1989) Jf 111, 152,
reprinted in 21 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 79, and ten years later, in 1999 by the UNCITRAL Rules
Tribunal in Himpurna California Energy Ltd. v. PT. (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara,
Final Award (4 May 1999) 357, in YEARBOOK COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION, VOL. XXV (A.
Jan van den Berg ed., Kluwer 2000).

4. Apart from the fact that the majority’s position deprives the Claimant of the
compensation to which it is entitled, it fails to adhere to the Parties’ agreement as to what
constitutes “fair market value.” In paragraph 628 of the Decision the Tribunal points out that
“Tt]he Parties agree that the fair market value is equal to the amount that a willing buyer would
pay to a willing seller, provided that the buyer is informed about all relevant circumstances
and none of the parties is under any kind of duress to sell or to acquire the asset.” (Emphasis
added.) If a willing buyer is, for example, a national of France (Party to the BIT here), or of
another State that has equivalent treaty protection as did and should the Claimant here, is that
not a part of the buyer being “informed about all relevant circumstances”? Might not such
status possibly lead the purchaser to pay more for the expropriated asset than would a potential
buyer that lacks such protection? “Fair market value” cannot as, the Parties to this case have

agreed, be determined devoid of “all the relevant circumstances.”

5. As to paragraph 1(b) above, awarding the 99.99%-owner of the expropriated concern,
namely the Claimant, which is entitled to 99.99% of the profits of Norpro, only the lesser
compensation derived from 99.99% minus 25% of Norpro’s export sales profits means that
to that extent the Claimant is deprived of the compensation to which it is entitled. The
intercompany bookkeeping practiced by the parent and the subsidiary has no effect
whatsoever on the actual profit created for the parent by the subsidiary. Assuming, as an
example, that 25% of Norpro’s export sales profits adds up to 10% of Norpro’s total profits,
then the parent Claimant, which in fact has lost 99.99% of Norpro’s profits, receives as
compensation, not that 99.99% of which it was deprived, but instead only 89.99%. How can

that be considered to lead to “fair market value” by whatever standard?

For the reasons, and to the extent, stated above I respectfully dissent from the

Decision.
