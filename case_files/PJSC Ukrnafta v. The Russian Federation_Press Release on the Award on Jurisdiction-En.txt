PCA PRESS RELEASE

 

ARBITRATION BETWEEN PJSC UKRNAFTA AS CLAIMANT AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION—

ARBITRATION BETWEEN STABIL LLC AND TEN OTHERS AS CLAIMANTS.
AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION

THE HAGUE, 4 JULY 2017
The Tribunal Issues Its Awards on Jurisdiction

On 26 June 2017, having deliberated, the Tribunal issued its unanimous Awards on Jurisdiction in the
two above-referenced matters.

The Tribunal will further shortly issue procedural directions for the next phase of the proceedings.

Background: The two above-referenced arbitrations were commenced by the Claimants against the
Russian Federation pursuant to the Ukraine-Russia BIT and in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules 1976 on 3 June 2015. The Claimants submit that, as of April 2014, the Russian
Federation breached its obligations under the Ukraine-Russia BIT by interfering with and ultimately
expropriating their investments in petrol stations located in Crimea.

The Tribunal constituted in each of the two arbitrations is comprised of Professor Gabrielle
Kaufmann-Kohler (Presiding Arbitrator), Mr. Daniel M. Price (appointed by the Claimants), and
Professor Brigitte Stern (appointed by the appointing authority, Mr. Michael Hwang, on behalf of the
Russian Federation).

Under the instructions of the Tribunal, the PCA will from time to time issue press releases containing
information on the procedural steps taken by the Tribunal. Basic information about the proceedings is

available on the PCA Case Repository http://www.pcacases.com.
