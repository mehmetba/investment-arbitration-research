THE DISPUTE

The dispute between the Parties arises out of an offshore wind electricity generation project in the
Wolfe Island Shoals area in Ontario, Canada (the “Project” or the “WWIS Project”). The Project
was undertaken following Ontario’s enactment of the Green Energy and Green Economy Act of
2009 (“GEGEA”) and the subsequent promulgation of additional rules and regulations, creating
a Feed-in-Tariff (“FIT”) program (the “FIT Program”) for the development of renewable energy
projects, including onshore and offshore wind. According to the Claimant, following the award
of a Feed-in-Tariff Contract (the “FIT Contract”) to the Claimant, the Government of Ontario
(also referred to as the “Government” or “Ontario”) delayed the approval of the required permits
and authorizations, including those allowing access to Crown land, and eventually, on 11
February 2011, imposed a moratorium on the development of offshore wind that frustrated the

Claimant’s attempts to develop the Project.

The Claimant argues that the conduct of the Government, including the Ontario Power Authority
(the “OPA”), is attributable to the Respondent and contends that the measures taken by Ontario
authorities are inconsistent with the Respondent’s obligations under Chapter 11 of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), specifically Articles 1110 (Expropriation and
Compensation), 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), 1102 (National Treatment), 1103
(Most-Favored-Nation Treatment) and, to the extent that the OPA is a state enterprise as defined
in NAFTA Article 1505, Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises).

The Respondent disputes that it is in breach of any of its obligations under NAFTA. According
to the Respondent, the Claimant was always aware of the regulatory risks related to the
development of the regulatory processes and the significant scientific uncertainty regarding the
effects of offshore wind projects on human health, safety and the environment. The Respondent
contends that Ontario’s decision to defer the development of offshore wind was taken to allow
the necessary scientific research to be completed and applied to all such projects and thus was not
discriminatory, and fell within the legitimate policy-making power of the Government of Ontario

to regulate in the public interest.

THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

The Claimant requests the following relief:

“a) a declaration that Canada has unlawfully expropriated Windstream’s investments in
WWIS, the Project and the FIT Contract, contrary to Article 1110 of NAFTA;

b) a declaration that Canada has failed to accord Windstream’s investments fair and
equitable treatment in accordance with international law, contrary to Article 1105 of
NAFTA;

c) a declaration that Canada has failed to accord Windstream’s investments treatment no
less favorable than that accorded, in like circumstances, to its own investors contrary to
Article 1102 of NAFTA;

d) a declaration that Canada has failed to accord Windstream’s investments treatment no
less favorable than that accorded, in like circumstances, to investors of any Party or non-
Party, contrary to Article 1103 of NAFTA;

e) alternatively, a declaration that Canada has breached Article 1503 of NAFTA;
f) alternatively, a declaration that Canada has failed to ensure through regulatory control,

administrative supervision or the application of other measures, that its state enterprise, the
OPA, acts in a manner consistent with Canada’s obligations under Chapter 11 of NAFTA;

g) damages in the range of between CAD 357.5 and CAD 486.6 million, to be updated as
at the time of the hearing, or alternatively between CAD 427.9 and CAD 568.5, to be
updated as at the time of the hearing;

h) pre-and post-award interest at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal;
i) all legal fees and costs associated with this arbitration; and

vl

j) such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.

9. The Respondent requests:

“that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant’s claims in their entirety and with prejudice, order
that the Claimant bear the costs of this arbitration, including Canada’s costs for legal
representation and assistance, and grant any further relief it deems just and proper.””

WRITTEN PROCEEDINGS

In accordance with the procedural timetable, between 16 October 2013 and 2 December 2013, the

Parties exchanged document production requests in the form of Redfern Schedules.

On 20 December 2013, the Claimant submitted its completed Redfern Schedule, setting out three
document production requests to which the Respondent had objected and requesting a ruling from
the Tribunal regarding the disputed requests. On the same day, the Respondent confirmed that
there were no disputes relating to its document production requests left to be resolved by the

Tribunal.

On 12 January 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, approving one request made by

the Claimant and denying the other two requests.
On 14 April 2014, the Parties exchanged documents.

On 25 April 2014, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to amend the existing
schedule of the proceedings. The Tribunal acknowledged and approved the Parties’ agreement

the following day.
On 19 August 2014, the Claimant submitted its Memorial with accompanying evidence.

On 30 September 2014, the Claimant submitted a corrected version of its Memorial fixing various
typographical errors in the original version. The Claimant also submitted a revised Procedural
Order No. | and a revised Confidentiality Order. On 1 October 2014, the Respondent confirmed
its agreement with the proposed changes to Procedural Order No. | and the Confidentiality Order.
On 2 October 2014, the Tribunal issued the revised Procedural Order No. | and the revised

Confidentiality Order incorporating the amendments agreed by the Parties.

On 7 November 2014, the Claimant requested the Tribunal’s “assistance in connection with
certain issues that have arisen among the parties during the document production process.”
According to the Claimant, the issues related to (a) a lack of documents produced by the
Respondent from the Premier’s Office of the Government of Ontario, and (b) discrepancies
between the amount of documents produced by the Respondent from the Government of Ontario’s
Ministry of Natural Resources (“MNR”), Ministry of the Environment (“MOE”) and Ministry of

Energy and Infrastructure (“MEI”),> when compared to the volume of documents obtained by the

5 As the Claimant notes, “[bJetween 2007 and 2010, the Ministry was known as the Ministry of Energy and
Infrastructure. It is now known as the Ministry of Energy.” Memorial, para. 67 (n. 67).

Claimant from these Ministries through access to information requests. The Claimant requested

the Tribunal to issue various procedural orders to address these issues.

Regarding the first issue, the Claimant requested that, “in lieu of documentary discovery, the
Premier’s Office staff member who was the most closely involved with the decision to implement
the moratorium be compelled to attend an examination for discovery in Toronto to answer
questions about that decision, and the decision to apply the moratorium to Windstream.” In this

respect, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order as follows:

“1) Canada shall disclose the identity of the individual from the Premier’s Office who was
most directly involved with the decision to implement the moratorium on offshore wind
development (whether it is Mr Mullin, Mr Steeve, Mr Morley or another individual);”

2) “The individual identified by Canada shall appear before a certified court reporter in
Toronto, Ontario to be examined for discovery by counsel for Windstream to answer
questions relating to the decision to implement the moratorium on offshore wind
development;” and

3) “If that individual will not appear voluntarily to be examined for discovery, the Tribunal
grants Windstream its approval to seek an order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice
for assistance in compelling the attendance of the individual.”

4) Alternatively to the above requests, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order that

“the Premier’s Office [shall] restore the available back-up tapes and search the resulting

restored documents for documents responsive to Claimant’s document request #25.”°
Regarding the second issue, the Claimant contended that the fact that it had received through two
requests made under Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act a number
of documents from the MNR that “(1) [were] responsive to Windstream’s document requests, and
(2) were not included in Canada’s productions ... calls into question the comprehensiveness of
Canada’s searches for documents.” In this respect, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order

the Respondent to:

“1) Disclose to Windstream and to the Tribunal the search processes it used to identify
documents responsive to document requests #22, 27, 28, 29 and 56;”

2) “Identify, and disclose to Windstream and to the Tribunal, the lacunae in its search
processes that led to the above documents not being produced in response to document
requests #22, 27, 28, 29 and 56;” and

3) “Conduct any further and better searches for documents responsive to requests #22, 27,
28, 29 and 56 as may be agreed with Windstream, or ordered by the Tribunal failing such
agreement.”

On 18 November 2014, the Respondent provided comments on the Claimant’s requests.

On 24 November 2014, the Claimant submitted a reply to the Respondent’s comments.

On 28 November 2014, the Respondent submitted a rejoinder to the Claimant’s reply.

On 15 December 2014, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to clarify whether it was in a
position to identify the individual in the former Premier’s Office who was most directly involved

in the decision on the moratorium on offshore wind development.

On 18 December 2014, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that at this time it was not in a
position to do so and that it would update the Tribunal on its progress in this regard by

7 January 2015.

On 22 December 2014, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that “new information” relevant to its
requests had been disclosed as a result of a legal proceeding in Ontario, requesting an opportunity
to submit it to the Tribunal. On 23 December 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to
provide its comments on the Claimant’s communication of 22 December 2014 by
30 December 2014. At the Respondent’s request, the Tribunal extended this deadline until
7 January 2015.

On 7 January 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was “not able to identify an
individual in the former [Premier’s Office] who was directly involved in making the
deferral/moratorium decision.” In the same communication to the Tribunal, the Respondent

objected to the Claimant’s request to submit the “new information.”

On 8 January 2015, the Tribunal decided to allow the Claimant to submit the “new information”
referred to in the Claimant’s communication of 22 December 2014 and to give an opportunity to

the Respondent to respond to the Claimant’s submission.

On 9 January 2015, the Claimant submitted a search warrant issued by an Ontario judicial officer
authorizing the search of the premises of the Ontario Provincial Government Cyber Security
Branch, including the email accounts of, among others, Mr David Livingston, the former Chief
of Staff to Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty as the “new information” previously referred to.
The Claimant also requested that, should the Tribunal decide to make the order requested by the
Claimant in its letter of 7 November 2014, such order should name Mr Sean Mullin — who acted
as Deputy Director of Policy responsible for the energy portfolio at the former Premier’s Office
—as the appropriate witness to appear for discovery voluntarily or, if necessary, by being

compelled to do so.

On 14 January 2015, the Respondent submitted further observations on the Claimant’s requests

and requested the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimant’s motion in its entirety.

On 20 January 2015, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial with accompanying

evidence.

On the same day, the Respondent requested that, given the pending dispute between the Parties
as to what is confidential in the Claimant’s submissions, the timelines in paragraph 2 of the
Confidentiality Order be suspended and that the Tribunal order the Respondent to designate
confidential information in its written submissions within ten days from the date on which the
disagreements between the Parties regarding the confidentiality designations in the Claimant’s

submissions had been resolved.

The Respondent also asserted parliamentary privilege with respect to certain information relied
on by the Claimant in its written submissions and informed the Tribunal that it would be bringing

a motion for an order to strike this material from the record.

On 21 January 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide its comments regarding the
Respondent’s request relating to the suspension of timelines in paragraph 2 of the Revised

Confidentiality Order and the designation of confidential information by 26 January 2015.

On the same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, deciding the Claimant’s requests

of 7 November 2014. On the basis of the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal decided as follows:

“a) The Claimant’s request that the Respondent be ordered to disclose the identity of the
individual from the Premier’s Office who was most directly involved with the decision to
implement the moratorium on offshore wind development is dismissed as moot.

b) The Claimant’s request that the individual identified by the Claimant shall appear before
a certified court reporter in Toronto, Ontario, to be examined for discovery by counsel for
the Claimant to answer questions relating to the decision to implement the moratorium on
offshore wind development is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

c) The Claimant’s request that if the individual identified by the Claimant will not appear
voluntarily to be examined for discovery, the Tribunal grants the Claimant its approval to
seek an order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for assistance in compelling the
attendance of the individual, is granted.

d) The Claimant’s alternative request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to restore the
available back-up tapes and search the restored documents for documents responsive to the
Claimant’s document request #25 is denied...

e) The Claimant’s request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to disclose to the
Claimant and to the Tribunal the search processes it used to identify the documents
responsive to documents requests #22, 27, 28, 29, and 56 is denied.

f) The Claimant’s request that the Respondent identify and disclose to the Claimant and to
the Tribunal the lacunae in its search processes that led to the documents not being
produced in response to document requests #22, 27, 28, 29, and 56 is denied; and

g) The Claimant’s request that the Respondent conduct further and better searches for
documents responsive to requests #22, 27, 28, 29, and 56, as may be agreed with the
Claimant, or ordered by the Tribunal failing such agreement, is denied.”

On 26 January 2015, the Claimant indicated that it had no objection to the Respondent’s requests
regarding the suspension of timelines in paragraph 2 of the Revised Confidentiality Order and the

designation of confidential information.

On 27 January 2015, the Tribunal suspended the timelines in paragraph 2 of the Confidentiality
Order for the filing of the Respondent’s confidentiality designations, and ordered that the
Respondent designate confidential information in its written submissions within ten days from
the date upon which the disagreements over designations in the Claimant’s submissions have been

resolved.

On 6 February 2015, the Respondent submitted a motion to the Tribunal, requesting that certain
information and exhibits listed in an annex attached to the motion be disregarded and excluded
from the record. On 9 February 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide its comments

on the Respondent’s motion by 13 February 2015. On 13 February 2015, the Claimant submitted

 

a response to the Respondent’s motion, ing that it be dismissed.

On 12 February 2015, the Parties agreed on certain modifications regarding the time frame for

the further proceedings. The Tribunal subsequently confirmed the revised procedural calendar.

On 23 February 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, denying the Respondent’s
request of 6 February 2015 that certain information and exhibits be disregarded and excluded

from the evidence on the grounds of parliamentary privilege or political sensitivity.

On 5 March 2015, the Claimant submitted a redacted version of its Memorial.

On 30 March 2015, the Claimant wrote to Mr Bishop to request some clarification concerning a
disclosure made by the Respondent’s expert, Mr Christopher Goncalves, in his report regarding
his engagement in other matters in which Mr Bishop has acted as counsel or arbitrator. On 23
April 2015, Mr Bishop confirmed that Mr Goncalves was acting as an expert for a party
represented by Mr Bishop.

On 28 April 2015, the Claimant submitted a Supplementary Request to Produce (the
“Supplementary Request”), requesting the Tribunal to “order the Respondent to produce the
documents set out in the [Supplementary Request] ... as soon as possible and in any event no later
than within 30 days of the Tribunal’s decision on any disputed document request.” On
29 April 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it would respond to the Supplementary

Request within five business days pursuant to Section 12.1 of Procedural Order No. 1.

On 5 May 2015, the Respondent submitted a response to the Supplementary Request.

On 6 May 2015, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal requesting a conference call “to address some
of the issues raised in Canada’s letter and other issues related to document productions by Canada

and Ontario.” The Respondent objected to the Claimant’s request by email of the same date.
On 8 May 2015, the Respondent produced certain additional documents to the Claimant.*
On 13 May 2015, the Respondent submitted a redacted version of its Counter-Memorial.

On 14 May 2015, the Parties jointly requested that certain amendments be made to the procedural
calendar. On 15 May 2015, the Tribunal noted and confirmed the amendments to the procedural

calendar requested by the Parties.

On 15 May 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, denying the Supplementary
Request and noting that its decision was “without prejudice to [the Tribunal’s] authority to order
further production of documents on its own motion if so required, in accordance with Section 7.6
of Procedural Order No. 1.” On 25 May 2015, following a request by the Claimant and in the
absence of any objections from the Respondent, the Tribunal issued a revised version of

Procedural Order No. 5.

On 22 June 2015, the Claimant submitted its Reply Memorial with accompanying evidence. On
8 July 2015, the Claimant submitted an Addendum to the second expert report of Messrs
Richard Taylor and Robert Low of Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”) (submitted with its Reply Memorial)

to correct “three errors in the Economic Losses model.”
On 30 September 2015, the Claimant submitted a redacted version of its Reply Memorial.

On 6 November 2015, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder Memorial with accompanying

evidence.

On 17 December 2015, Mr Bishop notified the Parties that he had appeared as counsel in cases in
which he or his firm had used the same experts as the Parties. He noted that he did not believe
this to fall within any of the grounds for disclosure in the 2014 International Bar Association
Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration and indicated that he was only
raising it “as a matter of caution.” He further noted that this would not affect his impartiality or

independence.

On 13 January 2016, the United States and Mexico, in their capacities as State parties to NAFTA,
each filed a submission pursuant to Article 1128 of NAFTA. According to Article 1128, “[o]n

written notice to the disputing parties, a Party may make submissions to a Tribunal on a question

of interpretation of this Agreement.”

On 18 January 2016, the Respondent submitted a redacted version of its Rejoinder Memorial.

On 28 January 2016, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal requesting an opportunity to make
submissions as to whether the Respondent should be required to disclose documents and
information relied on by its experts (Green Giraffe and Berkeley Research Group (“BRG”)) that
were not submitted as exhibits with its Rejoinder. On 29 January 2016, the Tribunal confirmed
that the Claimant could make the requested submissions by 2 February 2016, and set 5 February
2016 as the deadline for any reply by the Respondent.

On 29 January 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent each submitted a Reply to the Article 1128

Submissions of the United States and Mexico.

On 2 February 2016, the Claimant filed its submissions, requesting that the Tribunal order the
Respondent to produce, subject to the Confidentiality Order, the documents and information
relied on by its experts, Green Giraffe and BRG, to support certain statements that they made in
their respective expert reports. The Claimant also requested that, if the Respondent did not
produce the requested documents and information, the Tribunal exclude the relevant portions of
the expert reports from the record or alternatively afford them no weight. On 5 February 2016,

the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimant’s submissions.

On 8 February 2016, the Tribunal declined to grant the Claimant’s request that the Respondent
be ordered to produce the documents and information relied on by Green Giraffe and BRG. The
Tribunal noted that it would “take into account, when assessing the weight to be given to the
expert evidence in question in accordance with Article 27(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the fact

that some of the underlying evidence and information has not been made available.”

On 14 February 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent submitted the Parties’ Joint Chronology.

On 11 April 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent each submitted their respective Costs

Submissions.

On 26 April 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent each submitted their respective Reply Costs

Submissions.

On 18 May 2016, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal stating that the Parties had agreed to certain
corrections to the Claimant’s Reply Memorial and requesting that the Tribunal grant it permission

to produce a letter from Mr Ian Irvine of SgurrEnergy correcting a typographical error in the

Second Expert Report submitted by SgurrEnergy. The Claimant indicated that the Respondent

had not consented to the request.

On 20 May 2016, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant’s request.

On 23 May 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to allow the Claimant to
produce the letter from Mr Irvine, and invited the Respondent to comment on the letter within
five business days of its production. The Tribunal indicated that its decision was without
prejudice to its determination as to whether the correction related to a typographical error, and

whether any further procedural steps might be required.

On the same day, the Claimant produced the letter from Mr Irvine.

On 27 May 2016, the Respondent submitted its comments on Mr Irvine’s letter.

On 28 May 2016, the Claimant requested an opportunity to file a brief response to the
Respondent’s letter. Upon the Tribunal’s approval, the Claimant filed its response on 31 May
2016.

On 2 June 2016, the Respondent commented on the Claimant’s letter of 31 May 2016.

On 3 June 2016, the Tribunal decided to admit Mr Irvine’s letter into evidence, without prejudice
to its ultimate determination as to the evidentiary value of the letter. The Tribunal indicated that

it did not consider it necessary to re-open the hearings at this stage.

On 15 June 2016, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal requesting directions with respect to an oral
request it had received from the Ontario Provincial Police (“OPP”) for documents produced, or
produced and filed as exhibits, in this arbitration. The Claimant stated that it had been unable to

resolve the issue with the Respondent.

On 21 June 2016, the Respondent commented on the Claimant’s request, stating that the request
was premature because the OPP had not yet put its oral request in writing and also unnecessary

because the Claimant had not requested the Respondent’s consent to disclose any information.

On 3 July 2016, the Tribunal noted that there had been no formal, written request from the OPP,
and that accordingly it was unclear whether the OPP’s request covered information that could be
considered confidential under the Tribunal’s Confidentiality Order. Noting the Respondent’s
offer to cooperate with the Claimant in an effort to resolve any issues that might arise, the Tribunal
considered that it was neither necessary nor appropriate for it to issue any directions as there was,

as yet, no concrete issue to be resolved by the Tribunal.

ORAL PROCEEDINGS

On 22 January 2016, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing teleconference with the Parties. Prior to the
teleconference, the Parties had notified the Tribunal of certain procedural and organizational
issues on which they had reached agreement and provided a list of issues on which they were
unable to agree. The two outstanding issues related to the introduction of new documents during
the examination or cross-examination of witnesses at the hearing, and the use of PowerPoint
presentations by experts at the hearing. On 25 January 2016, the Tribunal issued its decision on

the two outstanding issues and provided a schedule for the hearing.

An oral hearing was held on 15-19 and 21-26 February 2016 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK GOVERNING RENEWABLE ENERGY IN ONTARIO

In 2003, the Government of Ontario determined that without increasing electricity supply in the
Province of Ontario, it would run a risk of electricity shortages. 10 At the same time, the
Government felt that the Province’s dependence on coal-fired power plants as an energy source

gave rise to health and environmental concerns.'!

Consequently, Ontario started exploring the
use of alternative and renewable sources of electricity generation’* and adopting policies to
promote renewable energy development.'* In the same year, Ontario’s Premier announced a plan

to close Ontario’s coal-fired power plants.’

In 2004, Ontario enacted the Electricity Restructuring Act that amended the Electricity Act of
1998, establishing inter alia the OPA as “an independent non-share capital corporation
responsible for medium and long-term system planning, conservation, demand management and
procurement of new generation through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).”'*> The
OPA had separate legal personality and could enter into electricity procurement contracts.'° The
Minister of Energy could direct the OPA to undertake specific actions regarding its electricity
procurement programs, but the Electricity Act specified that the OPA was “not an agent of the

Crown.”!7

Between 2003 and 2008, Ontario and the OPA ran a number of procurement programs to
encourage the desired use of alternative and renewable energy sources. However, all these
initiatives failed to produce the required level of new investment.'* On 1 January 2015, the OPA
was merged with the Independent Electricity System Operator (“IESO”) and the new entity kept

working under the IESO name."”

In Ontario, all lakebeds (with one exception that is not relevant) are Crown land.” The MNR,
among other things, exercises regulatory authority on behalf of Ontario for granting access to

Crown land for offshore wind development.”! In March 2003, the MNR released for public

comment a draft policy on the disposition of Crown land (including the beds of the Great Lakes)
for wind energy development.” In March 2004, the draft policy was finalized, and the MNR
subsequently issued it as Policy Number 4.10.04, Wind Power Development on Crown Land
(“Wind Policy 4.10.04”). Wind Policy 4.10.04 established for the first time a set of standardized
rules for wind developers to apply for the use of Crown land.”* Between 2004 and 2006, the MNR
engaged in research regarding the potential environmental effects of offshore wind energy

projects.>

90. In November 2006, the MNR decided to defer its consideration of applications for access to
Crown land to develop offshore wind power.” In light of the “relatively little experience with
understanding the positive and negative social and economic effects associated” with wind power,
this deferral was meant to allow the further study of the effects of offshore wind as a source of

energy generation.””

91. In January 2008, following “considerable activity on the policy and resource analysis front,” the
MNR determined that the existing policy and Environmental Assessment processes “[were]
sufficient to address site-specific issues and concerns related to offshore wind.””* On 16 January
2008, the Premier of Ontario, Mr Dalton McGuinty, informed the local media that “offshore wind
could play an important role in the development of renewable energy resources in Ontario.””? He
also stated that offshore wind power could be harnessed “in a way that does not compromise
ecosystems.”*” On 17 January 2008, the MNR announced the lifting of the deferral decision of
November 2006.*!

92. The lifting of the deferral meant that new applications for access to offshore Crown land would

be reviewed by the MNR.* On 28 January 2008, Wind Policy 4.10.04 was updated and reissued

to include offshore wind, and guidelines were published regarding the application of the Policy.*?
On 23 April 2008, Ms Donna Cansfield, the Minister of Natural Resources, stated at an energy

conference:

“For the past two years we’ve been assessing potential benefits and impacts of this
technology. Our research made it clear that developing offshore wind potential would be
practical and environmentally sound once the appropriate infrastructure is in place. As a
result, we were able to lift the deferral last January and began accepting applications for
exploration proposals.”*

93. On 30 June 2008, Minister Cansfield was quoted in the Toronto Star newspaper to the effect “that
Ontario was ‘open for business’ when it comes to offshore wind.”> On 29 October 2008, at the
annual Ontario Waterpower Conference, Minister Cansfield gave a speech in which she

confirmed that “timely approval of applications to use Crown land for offshore wind energy

development could be expected by those submitting applications.”**

94. On 20 February 2009, the Ontario Government announced a proposal to enact the GEGEA.*” The
Government described the proposal as “sweeping new legislation to attract new investment, create
new green economy jobs and better protect the climate.”** On the same date, the Deputy Premier,
Minister George Smitherman, explained before the Toronto Board of Trade that the GEGEA

meant that Ontario would “offer an attractive price for renewable power, including wind — onshore

and offshore ... and we’ll guarantee the price for decades.””?

95. On 21 February 2009, the Toronto Star newspaper published an interview with Minister
Smitherman in which he stated that there were “wonderful opportunities for offshore wind” and
the Government had been “making sure we’ll move those proposals along.” On 23 February
2009, Minister Smitherman gave a speech at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in which he
stated that the GEGEA “would make Ontario the ‘destination of choice’ for green power

developers, would ‘incent proponents large and small to develop projects by offering an attractive

climate.””"' He also stated that the GEGEA “would coordinate approvals from the Ministries of

the Environment and Natural Resources into a streamlined process with a service guarantee,”

adding that “so long as all necessary documentation is successfully completed, permits would be

issued within a six-month service window.”

96. On 14 May 2009, the GEGEA was approved." The GEGEA introduced the FIT Program and
consolidated many of the provincial environmental approvals for renewable energy projects into
a streamlined approval process, the Renewable Energy Approval (“REA”) process, making the

MOE the primary regulator in the renewable energy sector.*°

97. The GEGEA authorized the MEI to direct the OPA to develop the FIT Program. On 24 September
2009, the MEI exercised its authority and the OPA began taking applications for the FIT Program
on 1 October 2009.“° The launch of the FIT Program and the GEGEA was accompanied by a
press release, published on 24 September 2009, which stated that “Ontario’s new regulations
provide a stable investment environment where companies know what the rules are — giving them
confidence to invest in Ontario, hire workers, and produce and sell renewable energy.”*’ On the
same date, the OPA issued a press release announcing the adoption of the Renewable Energy
Approval Regulation (“REA Regulation”) and stating that the REA “[i]s coordinated with other

provincial approvals to ensure a streamlined approach, providing a six-month service guarantee

per project."

98. The OPA developed the FIT Rules, Standard Definitions and a standard FIT Contract, together

setting out the terms and conditions for participating in the FIT Program.”

The FIT Contract was a standard long-term fixed-price contract that provided standard terms and
conditions applicable to all FIT projects, as well as terms and conditions specific to different types
of renewable energy fuels under the FIT Program.®” The FIT Program established a 20-year fixed
premium price to be paid by the OPA for energy from renewable sources, including onshore and
offshore wind, hydroelectric, solar, biogas, biomass and landfill gas.*! The goal of the FIT
Program was to ensure that project “proponents could use their FIT contracts to secure long term
limited recourse debt financing to fund the planning and construction of their projects.”

FIT Contract holders (known as “Suppliers””) were required to bring their project into commercial
operation by what the standard FIT Contract referred to as the “Milestone Date for Commercial
Operation” (“MCOD”).*> The standard FIT Contract for offshore wind facilities provided for a
MCOD four years after the contract date, and subjected a project to termination if commercial
operation did not occur within eighteen months of the MCOD.** At the moment of signing a FIT
Contract, a Supplier would have to provide security, which would in principle be forfeited if the
Supplier could not bring its project into commercial operation within the time frames specified in

its FIT Contract.°*

Commercial operation under the standard FIT Contract was defined to be occurring when the

following principal conditions were met:

“‘a) the Contract Facility has been completed in all material respects;

b) the Connection Point of the Contract Facility is that set out in the FIT Contract Cover
page ...; and

c) the Contract Facility has been constructed, connected, commissioned and synchronized
to the IESO-Controlled Grid such that 90% of the contract capacity is available to deliver
electricity to the grid.”**
The standard FIT Contract allowed Suppliers who were encountering difficulties in meeting their
obligations under the Contract, including achieving its MCOD, due to factors outside their
control, to invoke force majeure.*’ In the event of force majeure, a Supplier would be excused
and relieved from its obligation to achieve commercial operation by the MCOD for the duration

of the force majeure status.** Pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Contract, if one or more events of

force majeure delayed commercial operation for an aggregate of more than 24 months after the
original MCOD, both the OPA and the Supplier would be entitled to unilaterally terminate a FIT
Contract. Similarly, both parties could unilaterally terminate a FIT Contract if one or more
events of force majeure prevented the Supplier from complying with its obligations for more than
an aggregate of 36 months in any 60-month period during the term of the FIT Contract. In both
situations, when either party exercised its force majeure termination rights, the Supplier was

entitled to the return of the security deposited at the moment of signing the FIT Contract.*!

103. Two key regulatory documents related to the FIT Program were the REA Regulation™ and the
Approval and Permitting Requirements Document for Renewable Energy Projects (“APRD”).°
The REA Regulation established the environmental approval requirements for wind, solar,
thermal and anaerobic digestion energy facilities, setting out specific requirements for all types
of wind facilities, including offshore wind projects, which it defined as “Class 5” wind facilities.“
The REA Regulation specified that proponents of offshore wind projects would be required to
submit an Offshore Wind Facility Report, identifying potential negative environmental impacts
which would result from proposed projects and mitigation measures.® Between June 2009 and
June 2010, the MOE posted four Environmental Bill of Rights (“EBR”) notices regarding the

REA Regulation and the regulatory framework that was to be developed for offshore wind.

104. The APRD described the requirements and approval process for matters falling under the
responsibility of the MNR, specifying the requirements for completing the Offshore Wind Facility
Report needed under the REA Regulation.*’ The APRD requirements related primarily to the

natural heritage component of the REA Regulation.

105. The FIT application process was identical for onshore and offshore wind projects.® The initial
FIT application period was opened by the OPA from 1 October 2009 to 30 November 2009.” It
generated significant interest from renewable energy investors around the world, receiving 454
applications in total.”! Offshore wind projects accounted for only a few applications: in addition
to the Claimant’s application, only one other proponent filed a complete and eligible FIT
application for an offshore wind project.”” In response to this first round of applications, the OPA

offered 186 FIT Contracts.”

106. According to the GEGEA, an offshore wind project proponent had to meet four requirements: (i)
obtain a FIT Contract; (ii) obtain access to Crown land; (iii) obtain an REA; and (iv) obtain a
grid-connection approval from the IESO (an entity that monitors the operation of Ontario’s power

system and ensures its reliability).”

107. In particular, project proponents building on Crown land had to apply for the “release” of the
applicable sections of Crown land for wind testing and project construction and operation.”> The
process of applying for permission to test or build on Crown land was called the Site Release
process, and a project proponent obtaining Site Release was referred to as an Applicant of Record
(“AOR”).”° When the FIT Program was launched, the MNR had a three-stage process for
establishing a wind project on Crown land under Wind Policy 4.10.04: (i) wind power testing
application and review; (ii) wind power development review; and (iii) issuing permits and tenure
for development of a wind farm on Crown land.” The first two stages represented the Site
Release process, through which the applicants for Crown land sought to obtain an AOR status in
respect of specific “grid cells” or groupings of grid cells of Crown land. Obtaining an AOR status

allowed an applicant to proceed to the third stage, at which it could request the permits and

78

approvals necessary for the development of the wind projec! AOR status gave sole right to

79

apply for permits and approvals with respect to particular grid cells of Crown land,” but was “not

a disposition” and still required completion of “all [e]nvironmental [a]ssessment requirements for

the proposal prior to any authorizations or approvals being issued.”*”

in Coastal North America and the Great Lakes, stating:

“In 2006, my ministry placed a deferral on proposals for Great Lakes offshore
development. We needed to get a better understanding of how offshore wind turbines might
affect the surrounding environment. We also needed to assess the potential benefits and
impacts of this technology. Our research made it clear that developing offshore wind
potential would be practical and environmentally sound once the appropriate infrastructure
is in place. As a result, the deferral was lifted in January [2008] and the province began
accepting applications for project proposals.*!

[W]e know that when it comes to new investment, one of the most important factors for
investors is certainty. When companies know exactly what the rules are it instills greater
confidence to invest in Ontario, hire workers and produce self-renewable energy.*?

Offshore windpower is included in the Feed-in-Tariff program at 19 cents per kilowatt
hour. Ontario is the first jurisdiction in North America to set a price for offshore
windpower, reflecting our strong support for exploring offshore potential.”**

In a letter addressed to the Canadian Wind Energy Association dated 24 November 2009, the
Assistant Deputy Minister from the MNR, Ms Rosalyn Lawrence, stated:

“Existing Crown land applicants who apply to FIT during the launch period, and who are
awarded contracts by the OPA, will be given the highest priority to the Crown land sites
applied for. This means that these applications will take precedence over all others for this
site, and will receive priority attention from MNR.”™

The letter also specified that “an application for Crown land does not create a legal entitlement or

confer rights” and that “the Minister of Natural Resources has the sole authority to approve or

t** as well as a water

consultation report, *’ and conducting a natural heritage assessment
assessment.*’ The proponent then had to submit its application with the necessary accompanying
materials to the MOE.” If the application was found to be complete, it was reviewed by a team
of inter-ministerial experts led by the MOE’s Environmental Approvals Branch to determine if
the application met the regulatory requirements and “whether or not there [was] adequate
information to allow the [MOE] Director to make a decision in the public interest to issue or not
issue a REA.””! Once the technical review had been completed, the Director of the MOE was to
make “an independent and discretionary determination of whether or not it [was] in the public
interest to issue a REA.” Subsequently, the applicant and any resident of Ontario might appeal

that decision to the Environmental Review Tribunal.”*

Renewable energy proponents of projects larger than ten megawatts (“MW”) were also required
to obtain a connection assessment, which included an IESO System Impact Assessment (“SIA”)
and a Customer Impact Assessment (“CIA”) from the relevant transmitter.°* The purpose of the
SIA was to assess the impact of a project on Ontario’s integrated power system,”® while the
purpose of the CIA was to assess the impact of the connection of a new project to the power grid

on existing customers.°®

A project could only start after issuance of a Notice to Proceed (“NTP”) by the OPA pursuant to
Section 2.4 of the standard FIT Contract once the following requirements had been met: (i) receipt
of the REA; (ii) submission of a financing plan including signed commitment letters from sources
of financing representing at least 50% of the expected development costs; and (iii) submission of
a domestic content plan explaining that the Project would meet a 50% Ontario content

requirement.”

On | March 2010, the MOE posted one of the aforementioned EBR notices entitled “Renewable
Energy Approval Technical Guidance Bulletins” with six attached technical bulletins including

“Technical Bulletin Six: Required Setbacks for Wind Turbines.””*

115. During the spring and summer of 2010, the MOE held technical workshops on topics concerning
offshore wind such as noise, water quality and sediment management, and technical and safety
standards.” In particular, on 29 April 2010 and 23 August 2010, the MOE held workshops on
the propagation of noise for offshore wind projects in Ontario.'°? The workshops were not able

to recommend an appropriate noise propagation model, instead recommending that research be

conducted and empirical data be collected through measurements.'°!

116. Similarly, on 16 July 2010 the MOE held a water quality and sediment management workshop,
which indicated that several communities were potentially affected by offshore wind development
in Ontario and might claim aboriginal title over the lakebed.'”? The workshop concluded that “no
development should be allowed within one kilometer of an intake protection zone | ... and ...
water quality modelling would need to be conducted within intake protection zones 2 and 3,”
and also that “it was necessary to conduct research to obtain baseline data for modelling.”""* On
13 September 2010, the MOE held a workshop on technical specifications and safety issues which
indicated that modifications of international design standards for offshore wind turbines “were

necessary for the Great Lake context,” and that “standards specific to all other offshore wind

B. THE WOLFE ISLAND SHOALS PROJECT

117. Starting in 2008, Windstream began to invest in resource evaluation, engineering and technical

reviews relating to the WWIS Project.'°°

118. On 8 February 2008, Windstream submitted to the MNR Crown land applications to develop an

107

offshore wind facility."”’ Windstream proposed to construct approximately 100 wind turbines,

capable of generating 300 MW of electricity, in Lake Ontario near Wolfe Island, south of the City

108

of Kingston.'"* Windstream applied for AOR status and submitted SIA applications to the IESO,

together with other preparatory work regarding the Project.'”

119. In April 2008, the OPA received a document addressing the future of offshore wind in Ontario
from wind energy consultant Helimax Inc. (“Helimax”).'"° Helimax had identified 64 offshore
sites that were considered to have potential for wind project development in the Ontario Great
Lakes region and had performed a technical assessment and ranking of these sites.''! The site of

the Project was “[o]ne of the nine locations identified [by Helimax] as being most favourable for

offshore wind development.”!!?

120. According to the Claimant, in October 2008, Mr Ian Baines, the President of WEI,'"? met with
the Assistant Deputy Ministers for Energy, Finance and Natural Resources. During that meeting

the Assistant Deputy Ministers “indicated that they were determined to direct the OPA to take

steps to facilitate renewable energy development in the Province.”!"*

121. On 24 September 2009, the MNR wrote to Windstream, acknowledging its Crown land
applications.''* On the same day, Minister Cansfield informed Windstream that “in order to

maintain priority position within MNR’s site release process, [Windstream] must submit an

application to the FIT Program within the FIT launch application process.”!'®

was based on a subset of the grid cells for which Windstream had requested AOR status.'!

Windstream posted with WWIS’s application a CAD 3 million letter of credit, as required by the

FIT Program rules.'??

124. According to the Claimant, from 2009 until spring 2012, Windstream performed work to advance
the Project, including wind resource/energy yield testing, the preparation of designs relating to

the Project’s electrical system, a lake bottom investigation, financial assessments and the

organization of specialized consultants.'?°

125. On 8 April 2010, the OPA advised WWIS that it had approved WWIS’ FIT application.'** On

Windstream “that the Project was ‘special,’ and that he was ‘advancing’ Windstream’s proposal

to swap grid cells selected for the Project.”"°

On 25 June 2010, the MOE posted for public comment a further EBR notice, this time a policy
proposal entitled “Renewable Energy Approval Requirements for Off-Shore Wind Facilities— An
Overview of the Proposed Approach,” which outlined its approach for developing the regulatory
requirements and guidance in respect of offshore wind facilities (“Offshore Wind Policy Proposal
Notice”).“° Among other things, the draft policy proposed a five-kilometer shoreline exclusion
zone for offshore wind projects (“setback”). The MOE proposed the five-kilometer exclusion
zone “‘in light of its commitment to protect water bodies, including the Great Lakes, and to ensure
that Ontarians enjoy safe drinking water, beaches, food and fish, and natural and cultural
heritage.”!"!

The Offshore Wind Policy Proposal Notice further explained that “[partner] ministries [were]
working together to provide greater certainty and clarity on off-shore wind requirements” and that
the “Ontario Government [was] proposing an approach and [was] seeking input from interested
members of the public, early in the process, to inform the work that will be completed to finalize
the approach and the off-shore wind specific requirements under the REA regulation.”!?- The
Notice indicated that “[the proposed] approach [would] also be supplemented by the outcome of
research underway by the Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR),
and Ministry of Tourism and Culture and will be the subject of subsequent Environmental

Registry postings that [would] outline requirements for off-shore wind development.”

Still in June 2010, Windstream informed the MEI and the MNR that it “believe[d] that [it] could

99144

work within the proposed 5 km set-back guidelines”'™” and sent a proposal to the Government,

suggesting that it “release its application for parts of the lakebed ... that were within five

kilometers of Wolfe Island in exchange for other lakebed lands further offshore.”!*°

On 5 July 2010, Windstream attended a meeting with senior staff from the MNR and the MEI, in

the context of which it asked for clarifications with respect to the timing of receiving AOR status

and requested an extension from four to five years of the MCOD specified in the FIT Contract.'“°

Mr Paul Ungerman, the MEI’s representative, committed to following up on the issues
Windstream had identified regarding the Project.'*’ A further meeting was held with
Mr Ungerman on 7 July 2010, to discuss the Project and the extension of the deadline for the
Project to reach its MCOD.'** According to the Claimant, Windstream was told that “MEI
representatives [would] speak to OPA representatives about extending the commercial operation

date under the FIT Contract, and ... [would] support Windstream in its discussions with the MNR

on the process and methodology for the ‘land swap.’”"“?

135. On 5 August 2010, WWIS sent a proposed layout and description of the grid cells required for
the Project to be built outside the five-kilometer exclusion zone to the MNR.'’ On
9 August 2010, with the approval of the MEI and the Premier’s Office, the MNR sent Windstream
a letter confirming its willingness to discuss a reconfiguration of the Project site after the
conclusion of the five-kilometer setback policy proposal and promising to move “as quickly as

possible through the remainder of the application review process in order that [WWIS] may obtain

Applicant of Record status in a timely manner.”'*!

136. On the same day, Windstream requested that the MCOD in the draft FIT Contract be amended.'*
On 12 August 2010, the OPA confirmed to Windstream that it would issue a revised FIT Contract
with a special term that extended the MCOD by a year from the standard offer, i.e. from four to

five years from the contract date.'*> On 18 August 2010, the OPA provided WWIS with a revised

WWIS to bring the Project into commercial operation by its MCOD, specified as 4 May 2015.'°
The FIT Contract required the OPA to purchase all electricity generated by the Project at a rate
of CAD 190 per MW hour, with full escalation for inflation until the Project’s commercial
operation date, and escalation for inflation up to a maximum of 20% in total for the 20 years

starting from the date of the Project’s commercial operation.'

138. The public consultation period relating to the Offshore Wind Policy Proposal Notice was
originally open for 60 days until 23 August 2010, but according to the Respondent, due to
significant public interest, the MOE extended the consultation period by an extra fourteen days
until 7 September 2010.'*! The Respondent states that during the consultation period the MOE
received 1,403 comments.'®? Over 65% of respondents opposed offshore wind development, and
a majority of respondents expressed concern either that the proposed five-kilometer exclusion
zone might not be far enough from the shoreline, or that there were significant areas of scientific

uncertainty requiring further study.’

139. On 9 September 2010, Mr Uwe Roeper, the President of Ortech, and other representatives of
Ortech met with MNR officials on behalf of Windstream “to discuss the technical studies that
Ortech needed to carry out while MNR and MOE were considering the issues raised in ... [the
Offshore Wind Policy Proposal Notice].”' At this meeting, Ortech was informed that setting up
an offshore wind measurement mast required a temporary land use permit, “which could not be
granted until WWIS was given Applicant of Record status under the site release process.”!°* On
30 September 2010, Mr Baines wrote to the MNR and requested that WWIS “be allowed to erect

a temporary wind monitoring mast to carry out wind speed testing.”'** On 7 October 2010,

Windstream formally applied to the MNR for the “swap” of Crown land grid cells, also reiterating

its request to obtain AOR status.”

140. On 8 November 2010, WWIS received a Notification of Conditional Approval for Connection
from the IESO, allowing it to connect to the grid at the Lennox connection point.’ On the same
day, Hydro One, the owner of the relevant power lines, issued a CIA for WWIS, which provided
that WWIS was not expected to adversely impact transmission customers in the area of Lennox
County. '°

141. On 22 November 2010, the MNR informed WWIS that the Government’s offshore wind power
policy review was “still outstanding” and that it was “not yet able to consider advancing the Wolfe
Island Shoals project through the Application of Record process, nor implement the potential
exchange of grid cells.”!”” The MNR also informed WWIS that “no decision on ... permission
to conduct testing should be expected while the government’s offshore wind power policy review
is still outstanding.”!”'

142. On 10 December 2010, WWIS claimed a force majeure event under its FIT Contract “on account
of the lack of regulatory assistance from MNR and MOE.”'” In its force majeure notice, WWIS
indicated that “it was unable to advance further towards the milestone dates in the FIT Contract
without being able to carry out wind testing, further defining of the project area, and related
studies, all of which required that AOR status be granted.”'”> The force majeure event meant that
the MCOD would be extended for its duration, but either Party could still unilaterally terminate
the FIT Contract if the Project did not reach commercial operation within two years of the original
MCOD, i.e. by 4 May 2017.' Windstream had to maintain the CAD 6 million security deposit

posted at the signature of the FIT Contract during the force majeure period.'”*

143. WWIS subsequently proposed to MOE officials that the Project proceed as a “pilot project,”
generating scientific data to assist Ontario in determining how to proceed with future offshore
wind projects.'”° According to the Claimant, on 15 December 2010, Mr Baines discussed the
pilot project proposal with a policy advisor from the MEI.'” The Claimant also states that on
21 December 2010, Mr Benedetti spoke with a policy advisor from the MEI “who told him the
Ministry was receptive to the pilot project proposal, but it was unclear what the government’s

timelines would be for moving the project forward.”!”*

144. The Claimant states that on 19 January 2011, Mr Baines met with MEI representatives who
“confirmed that the pilot project concept was being favorably received” and told him to “leave it

with [them]” and to “have faith.”!” According to the Respondent, at the same time, the MNR

and the MOF intel express I

145. According to the Respondent, on 9 February 2011, the OPA announced that it would offer to
amend the contracts of all FIT Contract holders who had not yet reached commercial operation
so that they could extend their MCOD by up to one year. In the course of February and March
2011, the OPA contacted each FIT Supplier, including the Claimant, with an offer to execute an
amending agreement that would extend the MCOD by up to one year in exchange for trade-offs

by the Supplier on certain force majeure rights.'*' WWIS did not accept this offer.'*?

146. On 11 February 2011, officials from the MEI, the MOE, the MNR and the OPA held a conference

call with the Claimant to inform the latter of a forthcoming announcement regarding a deferral on

3

offshore wind projects and how it would affect Windstream.'*? During the call, officials

explained that the Government of Ontario had decided that it “will not be moving forward with
offshore wind until further science regulatory work and co-ordination with our U.S. partners is
complete.”'** The impact of the deferral was described by the Government officials in the

following terms:

“[Andrew Mitchell of MEI:] We set this call up today just to give you some notice about
a decision of the Government of Ontario is going to be announcing this afternoon. And
that decision is that we will not be moving forward with offshore wind until further science
regulatory work and co-ordination with our U.S. partners is complete. Our feeling is that
offshore wind in freshwater lakes is in its early developments and to date there are gaps
that exist in the science that don’t support siting wind projects in freshwater at this time.
... We acknowledge that your project is unique in that it has a FIT Contract and so that end
Perry [of the OPA] is here but we’ve asked that the OPA sit down with you to negotiate a
number of pieces including the force majeure provisions, the two-year force majeure
termination clause associated with those provisions and the security deposits ... .'**

[Brenda Lucas of MOE:] We came out at the end of the summer as you know and we’ve
proposed five fifty and did the EBR consultation and we had over 1400 people write in and
we have a lot more questions than we have answers so the concern from the Environment
Ministry’s perspective is a lot of questions, not enough information, not enough science to
build an offshore specific REA regulation and similarly questions about how we would
evaluate the reports and studies that any individual project brought in to us in terms of how
they would be able to mitigate any of those concerns from you know fish and fish habitat
to ice, freeze and thaw issues to noise issues over water, there’s just like I said, too much
uncertainty for us to go forward on that now, so our part of the news today essentially is
that we’re not ready with the REA regulation. We are going to take the time and do more
science work.'**

[Richard Linley of MNR]: [O]ur piece of the announcement is that MNR will be cancelling
all existing Crown Land Applications for access to lake beds for offshore wind
development but that does not mean those with the initial Feed in Tariff contracts which is
yourselves, but this will include those without that kind of record status and we will not be
accepting any new Crown Land Applications and to Brenda’s point, when there is greater
scientific certainty, consideration of offshore wind development will resume.”'*’

147. Later on the same day, the Government of Ontario publicly announced that it would not be
“proceeding with any development of offshore wind projects until the necessary scientific
research is completed and an adequately informed policy framework can be developed.”'** It

stated that:

“Ontario is not proceeding with proposed offshore wind projects while further scientific
research is conducted. No Renewable Energy Approvals for offshore have been issued and
no offshore projects will proceed at this time. Applications for offshore wind projects in
the Feed-in-Tariff program will no longer be accepted and current applications will be
suspended.”'*?

148. On the same day, the MOE and the MNR also published policy decisions, stating that:

“[dJuring ... [the moratorium], applications for offshore wind projects in the Feed-in-Tariff
program will no longer be accepted and the current applications will be cancelled; the MNR
will be cancelling all existing Crown land applications for offshore wind development that
do not have a Feed-in-Tariff contract, including those with Applicant of Record status.
MNR will not be accepting any new Crown land applications for offshore wind
development. When there is greater scientific certainty, consideration of offshore wind
development will continue.”'””

149. After the announcement of the moratorium, the Claimant engaged in without-prejudice settlement
negotiations with the OPA over its FIT Contract terms,'°! which still provided that WWIS had to
bring the Project into commercial operation by 4 May 2017 and maintain the CAD 6 million

security deposit.'?

150. On 23 February 2011, Windstream made a proposal to the OPA, suggesting that “the force
majeure situation persist until such date as Windstream elects to resume the Project, and that the

OPA waive its force majeure termination rights under Sections 10.1(g) and (h) of the FIT

9193

Contract. Windstream also requested that “it be permitted to elect when to resume the

39194

Project”'™ given the regulatory uncertainty,'°> and that the security deposit be returned for the

duration of the event of force majeure.'°°

151. In its response dated 18 March 2011, the OPA rejected Windstream’s requests.!°? The OPA
offered “to extend the MCOD for the Project to the earlier of (a) the date on which the Government

of Ontario makes a definitive decision to either allow development of the Project or (b) the fifth

+9198,

year anniversary of the original MCOD for the Project (so, May 4, 2020)”'” and “to waive its

to CAD 3 million."

152. Windstream subsequently approached the OPA with a proposal to replace the Project with a
ground-mount solar photovoltaic project that would allow WWIS to preserve its rights under the
FIT Contract." On 14 April 2011, Windstream gave a presentation to the OPA about its
proposed solar project.” However, the proposal was not received favorably, and the Claimant

states that during a meeting on 30 May 2011, the OPA made it “clear” to Windstream that the

proposed project would “not be considered.””°>

153. Following the OPA’s rejection, by letter dated 7 June 2011, Windstream requested that the OPA
remove its termination right prior to the NTP under Section 2.4 of the FIT Contract and “waive
all reporting requirements on Windstream for the duration of the force majeure delay.” Ina

further letter dated 13 June 2011, Windstream submitted a revised proposal regarding a

ground-mount solar project “as an immediate alternative to the 300 MW offshore wind project.”?°5
On 24 June 2011, in response to the two letters from Windstream, the OPA repeated its earlier

eg
position.2°°

154. On 5 July 2011, Windstream informed the OPA that it was “prepared to accept the five-year
extension provided that the force majeure could be further extended if the force majeure
conditions were not resolved on time for the Project to achieve commercial operation before it

risked triggering the termination provisions.”” Windstream also repeated its request that the

security deposit be returned.”

24 remain unchanged.”””?

156. After the deferral decision, the MOE developed a research plan to address the issues related to
offshore wind development that had been identified as requiring further study, including noise
propagation, water quality requirements, technical design requirements and safety issues.7!
According to the Respondent, while a number of studies have in the meantime been completed,

several others are still ongoing and are not expected to be completed before the end of 2016.7"!

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON THE DISPUTED FACTUAL ISSUES
The Claimant’s Position
The level of uncertainty regarding the regulatory framework

The Claimant contends that there was sufficient regulatory certainty at the time it decided to invest
in Ontario.” On 24 September 2009, when the FIT Program was launched, the MNR sent a letter
to the Claimant acknowledging its Crown land applications and stating that WWIS was required
to submit a FIT application within the initial FIT application period in order to maintain the
priority position of its AOR application.””! The press release announcing the launch of the FIT
Program and the GEGEA also indicated that Ontario provided “a stable investment environment
where companies know what the rules are — giving them confidence to invest in Ontario.”"” It
was generally understood among developers that the MNR would align “its Site Release process
and timelines with the OPA’s renewable energy procurement process.”””>

The Claimant submits that the overall REA framework fully applies to offshore wind, including
classified facilities and offshore wind facilities. 7 According to the Claimant, the MOE
document released on 20 September 2009, which explained to offshore proponents how to meet
MOE’s requirements for offshore wind projects under the REA Regulation, made it clear that
REA applications for offshore wind projects would be assessed based on site-specific

125

considerations.”> Accordingly, the REA Regulation provided the Claimant with reasonable

certainty regarding the required regulatory assessment process for the Project.”

163. The Claimant submits that in deciding to apply for a FIT Contract it relied on the MNR’s letter
of 24 September 2009, along with another letter from Minister Cansfield and Minister

207

Smitherman’s February 2009 speech.”

164. In the Claimant’s view, when it received the FIT Contract, the relevant authorities “all had
extensive regulatory and scientific expertise with respect to in-lake developments.””* The
Respondent had committed itself to developing setbacks and noise requirements for offshore wind
energy projects which would have led a reasonable developer to expect that the applicable
setbacks would be determined based on a project-specific assessment as part of the Offshore Wind
Facility Report that project proponents were required to prepare.” The REA Regulation and the
APRD provided the provincial requirements for offshore wind energy projects, thereby providing
the Claimant with reasonable regulatory certainty regarding the assessment process for offshore
wind energy.” The Claimant also alleges that large-scale offshore developments in the Great
Lakes are common and regulators in Ontario have decades of experience in regulating water

development as well as extensive knowledge of the Great Lakes ecosystem.”*!

165. According to the Claimant, MOE officials repeatedly noted that the REA Regulation provided a
rigorous approval process for offshore wind development.”>? This ensured that there were

protections in place to address any potential concerns.?*> The MOE gave no indication that

scat . . «aap 23
existing regulatory mechanisms were insufficient.?

166. The Claimant further considers that the Respondent’s approach to the approval process was
another tool for creating investor certainty. When the FIT Program was adopted, there was broad

coordination across the Ontario Government to “streamline” approvals and to ensure that project

proponents received the necessary approvals as expeditiously as possible.”

While the Claimant concedes that the Respondent provided no “guarantee” that the project would
be built, it submits that “the Government committed to doing its part” to ensure that developers
would meet the timelines under their respective FIT Contracts.** Such commitment was in line
with the main purpose of the FIT Program and the GEGEA, namely to get energy projects
permitted and built as efficiently and expeditiously as possible.” The Claimant points out that,
as part of this commitment, the Government implemented a “six-month service guarantee for the

issuance of the Renewable Energy Approvals.”?*

The Claimant further relies on MNR emails, which indicate that as early as 2008 MNR officials
were confident that existing regulatory mechanisms were sufficient to deal with site-specific

concerns for offshore wind projects.”

Furthermore, during the Claimant’s discussions and
interactions with representatives of all the involved Ministries, Government officials repeatedly
stated that the Project had the full support of the Ontario Government, that they understood the
need for certainty, and that the Government would work with the Claimant to resolve any

permitting issues.”

In the Claimant’s view, it was commercially reasonable to execute the FIT Contract despite the
fact that certain regulations for offshore wind energy were not yet in place.**' The Claimant also
rejects the Respondent’s claim that the Project would have been “first of a kind,” maintaining that
the “components proposed for this project have been used in many other applications.”?”

The Claimant submits that the FIT Contract was generally viewed by members of the industry as
the key requirement in the project development process that would have to be met before any
other material milestone would be pursued.”"? In addition, members of the industry understood
that the MNR “would support Ontario’s commitment to renewable energy by aligning the Crown
land access process with the OPA’s renewable energy procurement process” and that it “would
have been commercially reasonable for a contractor who had been awarded a FIT Contract to
assume it would receive Crown land tenure ina timely manner.” The Claimant’s expert witness

Ms Sarah Powell testified that the regulated community had understood that once one had a FIT

Contract, the Ministries would assist the developer with moving through the development
process.‘ Ms Powell added that the OPA generally took a pragmatic and commercial approach
to contracting and worked cooperatively with FIT Contract holders, which suggested that if a
delay had happened, the OPA would likely have considered some form of extension.” Similarly,
it would have been “commercially reasonable for a developer to assume that permitting of an
offshore wind project could have been completed in approximately three years.”"” A developer
could not have reasonably anticipated that Ontario would later reverse its support for offshore
wind projects.“*

The Claimant asserts that, by letter dated 9 August 2010, the MNR “provided explicit comfort to
Windstream that MNR would not cause regulatory delays to Windstream’s site approval.”?”
According to the Claimant, the letter gave Windstream “comfort that MNR was planning to
accommodate the proposed reconfiguration of WWIS’ Crown land applications within the
evolving policy direction, and that it would grant Windstream AOR status in a timely manner

once the policy review was complete.”**”

The reasons for the moratorium

The Claimant argues that, contrary to the Respondent’s official position,”*' the need for further
scientific research was not the motivation for imposing the moratorium.” According to the
Claimant, the Respondent’s suggestion cannot be reconciled with the fact that in 2008 Ontario
had already lifted a previous moratorium on offshore wind development imposed in 2006, after
confirming that such development was environmentally sound.’* The Claimant also notes that
Minister Cansfield announced at the time that the MNR had taken steps to address environmental
concerns regarding the impact of wind power projects.’

In the Claimant’s view, the moratorium was motivated by the rising costs of renewable energy
electricity as well as by considerations of political expediency of the governing Liberal Party in

the light of the 2011 elections.”*> The assertion that further scientific research was required was

only developed as a rationale of expediency after other potential rationales for regulating offshore
wind had been abandoned as untenable.”** The process was driven not by the Ministries’ technical
and policy experts but by the Premier’s Office, the ministers and their political staff.2°’ The
Claimant notes that there were documents in the Premier’s Office that were deleted, some of
which may have been relevant to these proceedings. The Claimant requests that an adverse
inference be drawn that the deleted documents would have further established that the Premier’s
Office directed the adoption of the moratorium, and that it was motivated by concerns over costs

and public opposition.”>*

174. The Claimant takes issue with the reliability of Mr John Wilkinson’s testimony that the
moratorium was decided by him, as the then Minister of Environment, and not the Premier’s
Office.” The Claimant notes that the main individual working on renewable energy policy
within the MOE, Ms Marcia Wallace, testified that she had not been aware of the decision to defer

offshore wind at the time that Mr Wilkinson alleges to have made the decision.”

175. As to costs, the Claimant explains that the price for offshore wind power, including for the WWIS
project, was CAD 190 per MW hour, and therefore significantly higher than the price of CAD 135

per MW hour to be paid for onshore wind power.”*!

176. In addition, the Claimant contends that in 2010 and 2011 groups opposing wind energy were
becoming increasingly active in Ontario. The Premier was frequently greeted by anti-wind
protestors while on the campaign trail, and anti-wind groups had organized mail-in campaigns to

facilitate complaints to elected officials about wind power and had begun to target the electoral

£263

ridings of various liberal members of the Provincial Parliament When anti-wind opponents

had mounted especially strong campaigns against offshore projects, the governing Liberal Party
became sensitive to the offshore wind power issue and its perceived impact on the upcoming

election.

177. The Claimant argues that political concerns were particularly influential during two parts of the
offshore wind policy-making processes: the period from April to July 2010 when the

five-kilometer setback proposal was being discussed and proposed to the MOE, and the period

from November 2010 to February 2011, which led to the moratorium being imposed.?°>

178. During the period from April to July 2010, before the proposed five-kilometer setback was posted
for public comments, the proposal was being discussed in inter-Ministerial correspondence,
which according to the Claimant underlines the absence of a scientific rationale supporting the
proposal.”°* According to the Claimant, “MOE employees were careful not to ‘rationalize’ the

proposed setback on the basis of scientific reasons or to suggest that it was ‘a science-based

999.267

number, and they were “looking for ecological reasons from MNKR to rationalize the

number.” The Claimant concludes from the minutes of MOE meetings discussing the setback
issue that “the concerns were focused on issues of ‘viewscape,’ as opposed to noise or scientific

rationales.””®” According to the Claimant, the setback of five kilometers was a number “pulled

out of the air?” in support of a political decision for an “aesthetic setback.”?”!

179. Specifically, the Claimant refers to internal MNR correspondence considering the setback

9272

discussion to be “driven politically’ and the apparent concern of MNR officials that the

five-kilometer setback would prevent all offshore wind projects from being developed.” In

addition, the Claimant relies on intergovernmental communication (including handwritten

274 25

notes,~"* emails,“ and draft communications””) to show that the Respondent was concerned

about public opposition to offshore wind power.”””

180. As for the period between November 2010 and February 2011, the Claimant asserts that the

Respondent was “looking for ways to move away from offshore development without sending a

in Ontario’s electricity transmission system.?” Po
i. the Respondent settled on scientific uncertainty as the basis for

imposing the moratorium.**! The Claimant points out that this rationale was adopted despite
MNR staff’s repeated assertions that there were sufficient mechanisms to deal with the

development of offshore wind projects.”

181. The Claimant further submits that the Respondent’s significant experience with construction
projects in fresh water lakes and rivers throughout the province also demonstrates that there was
not, in fact, any significant scientific or regulatory uncertainty concerning permitting or

environmental effects of offshore wind.”**

182. According to the Claimant, when it was awarded the FIT Contract, the Respondent had awarded
45 FIT Contracts for waterpower projects with considerable similarities with offshore wind
projects.’ These projects were to be constructed in fresh water and involved similar construction
techniques as well as nearly identical approval processes.”** Moreover, the Claimant contends

that the Respondent is routinely requested to issue permits for complex construction projects in

fresh water and has conducted extensive studies for these types of projects.”*°

The Respondent’s conduct after the imposition of the moratorium

The Claimant submits that the Respondent should have taken steps to ensure that it was not

penalized as a result of the moratorium.?”*

Even if the Respondent’s intent was to halt the
development of all offshore wind projects, the Respondent could have ensured that the Project
would be “frozen” rather than “cancelled,” by removing the contractual deadlines under the FIT
Contract."4 According to the Claimant, by failing to ensure that the OPA amended the FIT
Contract to insulate the Claimant from the effects of the moratorium, the Respondent failed to

keep a number of promises it had previously made to the Claimant, in particular:

a. _ that the Project would be frozen rather than cancelled;

b. that the Claimant would be kept whole through the province negotiating an acceptable
solution to ensure that the Claimant was “happy” with the process;

c. that the government would allow the Project to continue; and

d. that the OPA would enter into discussions with the Claimant that would include,
among other things, constraining the OPA’s right to terminate the FIT Contract if the
Project was delayed by more than two years.?”>

According to the Claimant, the last issue was of particular importance because the FIT Contract
terms allowed the OPA to terminate the Contract if the Project was delayed for more than two
years from its MCOD.”*° However, despite these commitments, the OPA rejected the Claimant’s
proposals to amend the FIT Contract to ensure that it would not be subject to termination while
the moratorium remained in effect.?”

In particular, the Claimant points out that in its first proposal it requested that it be permitted to
elect when to resume the Project “given that it remains unclear at this stage when a commercially
reasonable environmental approvals and Crown land site release process for fresh water off-shore
wind will be completed, or what those processes will entail.””°* It also requested the return of its
completion and performance security for the duration of the event of force majeure.”” In its
second proposal, the Claimant stated that it was prepared to accept the five-year extension
proposed by the Respondent, “provided that the force majeure could be further extended if the
force majeure conditions were not resolved on time for the Project to achieve commercial
operation before it risked triggering the termination provisions.”>”

The Claimant further contends that it was not in a position to accept what it considers an
“unreasonable” offer from the OPA.*°'! Under the OPA’s offer, the Commercial Operation Date
for the Claimant’s FIT Contract would have been extended by a maximum of five years while the
Project remained under force majeure, but the Contract could still have been terminated if the

302

Project did not achieve commercial operation by 4 May 202! The Claimant explains that it

properly decided not to accept this offer, because Ontario refused to specify the length of the

303

moratorium."”’ The Claimant notes that, in hindsight, the moratorium “did last longer than five

years."

The current status of the Project

The Claimant contends that, contrary to the Respondent’s assertions, *°>

the Project has effectively
been “cancelled.” This is because, even if the Respondent were to lift the moratorium, the Project
could no longer be built before the OPA’s right to terminate the FIT Contract would be
triggered.*% According to the Claimant, this right will inevitably arise when the Project fails to
achieve commercial operation two years after the Project’s MCOD, i.e. by 4 May 2017.°°7

In addition, the Claimant points out that the development and construction of the Project can no
longer be financed, since the FIT Contract is subject to unilateral termination by the OPA.* The
Claimant highlights that the OPA has exercised the power to terminate projects that are delayed
by more than 24 months in meeting their MCOD in the past.” According to the Claimant, the
fact that the OPA would be permitted to terminate the FIT Contract even if the Claimant built the
Project and brought it into operation on a date after May 2017 has rendered the Project impossible

to finance.*!”

In addition, the Claimant argues that, even if the OPA were to waive its ability to terminate, the
“uncertainty around offshore wind and mistrust in the investor community” would persist, so that

“none of the strategic partners, banks, pension funds, and utilities that Windstream was

oll

negotiating with would entertain an investment in the Project. In particular, the Claimant

points out that there was now a “[c]ontract [t]ermination [rJisk,” “a massive amount of mistrust

in the investor community,” “a high level of counter party risk to the contract,” “[p]olicy

[u]ncertainty,” “[s]upply [c]hain [d]estruction,” and a general “[n]egative [p]ublic [p]erception”

of the Project.??

The Claimant further contends that, as a result of the moratorium and the Government’s refusal
to insulate the Claimant against its consequences, the Project has become substantially worthless
and not financeable.*"? According to the Claimant, while “nominal value may be attributed to
past costs incurred related to certain assets of the Project, including the meteorological tower and

the studies performed,” given that “a potential purchaser ... would not be able to earn future

to these assets.”*!*

The Respondent’s Position
The level of uncertainty regarding the regulatory framework

The Respondent contends that the Claimant was aware of the lack of necessary regulatory details
at the time it made the decision to invest. The Government of Ontario had yet to finalize the
guidance material for offshore wind and had no significant experience in regulating large-scale
offshore wind projects.*'> The Respondent maintains that the Project would have been “first of a
kind” as no offshore wind project in Ontario had ever gone through an REA process or federal
environmental assessment.*!° In addition, not only would the Claimant’s Project have been the
first offshore wind project in North America, it would have been only the second freshwater
offshore wind project anywhere in the world.’!” As to the Claimant's assertion that the Project is
not “first of a kind” because it comprises pre-existing components, the Respondent’s expert
testified that these components have never before been merged together in an approvals process

for offshore wind.*!*

When the FIT Program was launched, “only two of the sixteen proponents that applied to MNR
for Crown land to develop offshore wind projects by December 2008 applied for a FIT Contract,
despite the fact that seven of them had already obtained AOR status and were therefore eligible
to proceed to the permitting stage.” With no experience having been developed in the Province
(or anywhere else in North America), neither the industry nor the Government of Ontario was
ready for the Project.*!?

According to the Respondent’s account, the 19 April 2010 meeting was designed to discuss
Ontario’s policy on offshore wind in general, as opposed to discussing the Claimant’s specific

0

projects.” The intention, according to the Respondent, was to provide the vision, while

identifying the challenges faced by the Respondent.*7!

196. In addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimant was aware of the lack of necessary details
in the REA Regulation.*” The Claimant itself expressed concerns with regard to the absence of

“established guidelines for access and control of off-shore property rights available for renewable

99323

energy projects, adding to the uncertainty of the REA process. According to the Respondent,

the Claimant’s knowledge of the underdeveloped state of offshore REA requirements is likely the

reason why the Claimant never formally initiated the process for applying for an REA — because

it had difficulty discerning what information it would have to submit.*74

197. The Respondent refers to several documents to support its claim that the Claimant knew of the
regulatory uncertainty prior to entering into the Contract.°> These documents include Ortech’s
presentation prepared for the Claimant suggesting “concerns ... over staff constraints at MOE to
process REA applications”>”° and Ortech’s letter dated 10 May 2011 indicating that the relevant
agencies “do not have well established guidelines for off-shore project adding to the uncertainty
of the REA process.”*?” The Respondent also refers to another letter from Ortech to the Claimant

describing the timeline proposed by the MNR to review its policy on Crown land access as “too

39328

long’”*** and a document prepared by the Claimant mentioning concerns about “A High Degree

of Regulatory Uncertainty.”

198. Indeed, the lack of regulatory certainty was the reason cited by the Claimant in its requests for
FIT Contract signing extensions, including its requests after the MOE’s 25 June 2010 EBR
posting.**° Under the circumstances, the Claimant could have no legitimate expectations that the

introduction of the GEGEA and the mere existence of the REA Regulation meant that its project

331

would be able to proceed quickly through the REA process.

199. The Respondent further contends that the Claimant had reason to be concerned about the

332

development and construction risks of its Project.” Such risks included seasonal construction

restrictions and weather disruptions, the lack of available specialized vessels, and the time

required for manufacturing the foundations for the wind turbines.**

Moreover, the Claimant had
even more reason to be concerned when on 25 June and 18 August 2010, the MOE and the MNR,
respectively, posted for public comment on the Environmental Registry policy proposal notices
regarding offshore wind and access to Crown land for offshore wind projects.*** The Respondent
highlights that the proposal notices explained that work on the regulatory framework for offshore
wind development was ongoing, and that the requirements for offshore wind projects under the
REA Regulation remained incomplete.**°

In light of this regulatory uncertainty, the Respondent submits that the Claimant made three
requests to the Respondent, which the Respondent however was unable to accommodate.**° First,
the Claimant requested to change its Crown land application to a different area. Second, it asked
the ME] to instruct the OPA to provide the Claimant with additional time to complete the Project.
Finally, the Claimant asked the MOE to confirm that the five-kilometer setback would not apply
to the areas relevant to the Project.*7 The Respondent further refers to an exchange that took
place on 10 August 2010 between the Claimant and the OPA, in which the Claimant reiterated its
concern with respect to the unresolved regulatory uncertainty.>*

The Respondent contends that the Government did not provide any assurances to the Claimant in
the months preceding the execution of the Contract.**? In particular, contrary to the contention of
one of the Claimant’s witnesses, *#” MNR officials made no commitment with respect to
facilitating access to Crown land.*' Indeed, according to the Respondent, the relevant MNR
officials “rebuffed the Claimant’s attempts to extract assurances in relation to its applications for
access to Crown land for the Project.”>

In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant assumed significant risks when it signed the FIT Contract
on 20 August 2010 while the MOE was still receiving feedback from the public and conducting

no

its own researc! More specifically, the Respondent contends that, by signing the Contract, the

Claimant accepted all the rights and obligations stipulated in the FIT Contract." Shortly after
signing the FIT Contract, MNR officials reminded the Claimant that “there was no policy or

 

procedure in place for offshore devel 45 The Respondent refutes the ion by the
Claimant that offshore wind projects are no different than onshore wind projects, referring to the

evidence and testimony of its experts that described the differences in costs and construction.“

The MNR also informed the Claimant that it was free to apply for permits to commence field
studies, such as surveying or sampling, while the public consultations on offshore wind continued
and the site release process was on hold. However, the Respondent insists that officials made it
clear that the Claimant would proceed with any such studies at its own risk, given that the policy
consultations were ongoing.*””

The Respondent further points out that the Claimant gambled that the MOE would adopt only a
five-kilometer setback as a means of addressing all of the concerns raised by the public and the
research.** Given that 85% of the Crown land that the Claimant had applied for was located
within the proposed five-kilometer setback, the Claimant also gambled that it would be allowed
to swap its existing Crown land applications for Crown land located outside the proposed
five-kilometer setback.“ Finally, in signing its FIT Contract, the Claimant accepted the OPA’s
termination rights and gambled that it would be able to bring its project into commercial operation
within five years, despite being well aware that the regulatory process for its permits and
approvals was still under development.>”

In addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimant’s reliance on “general statements by
ministers” was unreasonable.**! Specifically, the Respondent submits that Minister Cansfield’s
statement referred to by the Claimant, according to which Ontario “was open for business” was

352

made in 2008, prior to the development of the FIT Program.*’” Similarly, the Respondent points

prior to the GEGEA coming into force.** According to the Respondent, this statement “could

not accurately reflect Ontario’s efforts to operationalize the streamlined approvals process for

renewable energy projects” and “could not have created a reasonable or objective expectation that
the regulatory framework was or would be fully developed for offshore wind projects” at the time

of the execution of the FIT Contract.**°

The reasons for the moratorium

The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s assertions regarding the motivation underlying the
deferral are not supported by the evidence.**° In particular, the Respondent submits that there is
no evidence in the record to support the Claimant’s allegation that the decision to defer offshore
wind development was made because of electoral politics.**’ The Respondent points out that
Mr Wilkinson, the Minister of the Environment at the time, has confirmed that his decision had
nothing to do with politics.** The Respondent denies the Claimant's inference that the Premier’s
Office directed the deferral decision because of political motivations, noting that “the MOE had
been concerned for at least six months prior [to the decision] about the lack of standards and the
lack of science to justify the new standards.”*°? According to the Respondent, “the decision to
defer offshore development was taken by the Minister of the Environment upon being informed

77360

that the regulatory framework to approve projects was unfinishe« as confirmed by the

testimony of Mr Wilkinson.*°' The Respondent emphasizes that the MOE based the deferral

decision on public consultation spanning various considerations such as “the protection of human

‘cultural resources,
99362

health and the environment,” “ecological considerations, shipwrecks,”

“shipping lanes,” “recreational use,” “drinking water” and “beach erosion.

As such, the Respondent argues, the decision to defer offshore wind projects was grounded in the
precautionary principle, which suggests waiting until sufficient research had been conducted, so
that an adequately informed policy framework could be developed.** While the Respondent
concedes that data existed for onshore wind facilities, it submits that the MOE lacked the
information required to understand the impact that the construction and operation of an offshore

wind facility would have on the environment. Research was required to address numerous

never intended to undertake the science necessary to lift the deferral
Specifically, in the Respondent’s view, the decision not to proceed with offshore wind was
necessary to allow the regulator sufficient time to determine the rules, requirements and standards
that the proponent of an offshore wind facility would have to satisfy prior to the issuance of an
REA.*° Since the regulatory requirements could be the subject of “intense” scrutiny by
stakeholders and potential litigation, the Respondent submits that it needed to ensure that the

approval process was based on solid policy and scientific grounds.*”

The Respondent further points out that it is continuing to pursue the necessary research for the

development of the regulatory framework for offshore wind facilities.*7!

In particular, the
Respondent claims that it is currently conducting noise and decommissioning studies which will
assist with policy development.” As to Mr Wilkinson’s concerns about drinking water, the
Respondent submits that these were “partially addressed” in an internal study on water quality
impact within Lake Ontario (which provided a preliminary conclusion that the impact of an

offshore wind turbine would likely be quite small).°”

At the hearing, the Respondent confirmed that Ontario is “not planning to commence further

faulted for not prioritizing this work.”*”> This is because, the Respondent argues, “[g]iven the

its project after May 2012, the Respondent submits that “any science that Ontario plans to
undertake after May 2012 is irrelevant for the purposes of addressing Windstream’s claim.”>””
The Respondent notes, however, that once the noise and decommissioning studies are completed,

Ontario will analyze the findings to determine whether any further study is required.*”*

The Respondent also takes issue with the Claimant’s suggestion that the MOE issued requests for
further study proposals “to give the impression that it is proceeding with the scientific research?”
Ee’ The Respondent explains that the
internal MEI and MNR email relied upon by the Claimant should be construed as offering “a
relevant consideration by MEI” rather than “MOE’s and MNR’s justification for undertaking the

studies.”**!

The Respondent’s conduct after the imposition of the moratorium

The Respondent argues that, while the OPA put forward a number of reasonable solutions to
accommodate the Claimant in the context of the deferral, the Claimant chose to reject those offers
and make unreasonable and unrealistic demands instead.**? In particular, the Respondent points
out that the Claimant not only sought an extension of its MCOD until such date as the Claimant
elected to resume the project as well as the return of the full amount of the security deposit, a
removal of the time limitations on force majeure, and removal of the OPA’s termination right; it
also made requests unrelated to mitigating the impact of the deferral, such as the removal of its

domestic content requirement.**?

The Respondent states that OPA was willing to allow flexibility regarding the security provided,
the specific force majeure status, and the termination rights of both Parties, and that the Claimant
was offered a five-year extension of the MCOD.*** However, the Claimant failed to accept the
OPA’s offer and made demands that could not have been entertained by OPA.*** In this regard,
Mr Perry Cecchini testified that the Claimant’s demand was equivalent to asking for perpetual
force majeure, which would have been “irresponsible” for the OPA to allow when there needed
to be an end date.**° The Respondent also alleges that none of the Claimant’s proposed alternative

projects were acceptable since they were inconsistent with the FIT Rules and would result in

major implications to ratepayers and other renewable energy projects already under

development.**”

215. The Respondent states that the negotiations show that the Claimant wanted to dump the existing

(d)

deal under the FIT Contract and execute a new, better deal on its own terms and timeline.*** The
Respondent therefore concludes that “the fact that the Claimant’s project will not be able to
proceed to permitting is because the Claimant declined the opportunity to have its contract

v3
frozen.”**?

The current status of the Project

216. The Respondent states that the current legal status of the contract is that it is in force majeure.*”°

217. The Respondent points out that when it decided to defer all offshore wind projects, it canceled all

Crown land applications for offshore wind sites, with the exception of the Claimant’s. Given the
Claimant’s unique position as the only FIT Contract holder for offshore wind, its Contract was

frozen until the regulatory framework could be finalized.*”'

The Respondent attributes this
arrangement to the fact that the “OPA was willing to preserve [the Claimant’s] opportunity to
pursue a contract” and “didn’t want the Claimant’s [P]roject to fail because ... of government’s
lack of readiness to approve it.”*°? According to the Respondent, the deferral is intended to last
only as long as necessary to conduct scientific research and develop and implement an adequately

393

informed framework for offshore wind projects in Ontario.’ When the decision to implement

the deferral was made, this task was expected to take approximately 3-5 years.°"4

218. The Respondent further contends that the Claimant has been repeatedly informed that its Project

is only put on hold until the regulatory rules and requirements for offshore wind projects are

developed.**> According to the Respondent, the Project is therefore merely “frozen” and still

993!

“kept alive.”°°* That is, it has not been terminated by the OPA.*”” In addition, the Respondent

points out that “the legal status of other assets of the project ... remain unaffected.”

THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

There is no dispute between the Parties as to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear a claim on whether
the acts of an organ of the Government of Ontario such as the MNR, the MOE, the MEI and the
Premier’s Office are in breach of Chapter 11 of NAFTA.*” However, there is disagreement as to
whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear claims based on the attribution of conduct of the

OPA to the Respondent.’ The Parties also disagree on whether this question is relevant at all.

The Respondent submits that the measures challenged by the Claimant are attributable to the
Government of Ontario, not the OPA.“ According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s challenges
are directed to the Government of Ontario, and the MEI in particular, for allegedly failing to cause

the OPA to take certain measures.‘

Therefore, the question whether acts of the OPA can be
attributed to the Respondent for the purpose of Chapter 11 should be irrelevant.“”? However, if
the Claimant were challenging measures of the OPA, the Respondent contends that the Claimant
has failed to establish that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider whether such measures

breached the Respondent’s obligation under the NAFTA.“*

The Claimant states that its primary case is indeed that the MEI’s failure to act should be attributed
to the Respondent.’°> Given that the MEI exercised both de jure and de facto control over the
OPA,“”® the Respondent could have caused the OPA to comply with its commitment to “freeze”
the Claimant’s FIT Contract.*”? However, if the Tribunal were to find that this omission is not
attributable to the MEI, the Claimant suggests that the omission would necessarily have to be
attributable to the OPA.*”* In that case, the question of whether measures of the OPA can in turn

be attributed to the Respondent would not be “wholly irrelevant in this arbitration.”“”

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

consider the measures."'” The Respondent relies on Apotex v. United States, in which the tribunal

held that “Apotex (as claimant) bears the burden of proof with respect to the factual elements

necessary to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”""!

223. The Respondent submits that the OPA does not qualify either as a de jure or a de facto State organ
under international law." In order to qualify as a de jure State organ, the OPA would need to

have the status of a State organ under domestic law, as required by Article 4 of the International

» 413

Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (the “ILC Articles” However, in the

Respondent’s view, the OPA acts independently and is not an agent of the Crown, even if it was
created by a statute.“'* Moreover, in order to be considered a de facto State organ, the OPA would
have to act “in ‘complete dependence’ on the State, of which [it is] ultimately merely the

instrument.”*'> However, the OPA does not act in such a manner, nor does the Respondent

exercise complete control over it.‘"°

224. According to the Respondent, under Article 1503(2) of NAFTA, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to
consider measures of a State enterprise only insofar as those “measures were adopted or
maintained in the exercise of delegated governmental authority.”""’ The Respondent alleges that
the Claimant has failed to point to an act or omission of the OPA that was carried out in the
exercise of delegated governmental authority."'* In particular, the Respondent points out that the

fact that the OPA was established by statute does not automatically render all of its acts “an

419

exercise of delegated governmental authority. Rather, according to the Respondent’s

interpretation of Article 1503(2), “only a limited set of acts of State enterprises are subject to
Chapter 11.7?

The Respondent takes the view that the OPA was not exercising any delegated governmental
authority in its negotiations with the Claimant.””! First, while the OPA designed the FIT Program
pursuant to the Minister of Energy’s letter dated 24 September 2009, it was not delegated any

422

governmental authority to make decisions on regulatory instruments; “* the governmental

authority was exercised by the relevant Ministries. ‘°°

Second, in the Respondent’s view,
commercial negotiations and contracts entered into in that context do not qualify as “an exercise

of governmental authority” even if they were made in furtherance of a public policy objective.’

The Respondent also notes that the Claimant has not introduced any evidence that the Minister of
Energy del d to the OPA the imp] ion of the alleged i to the Claimant that
it would not be negatively affected by the deferral.*?> Moreover, even if there had been evidence,
such a delegation by the MEI would not amount to an exercise of governmental authority, as there
would be “nothing inherently governmental about the conduct of negotiations to settle a dispute

pertaining to a contract between a state enterprise and an investor.”“”°

In the same fashion, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to prove that the
decision to award Samsung — rather than the Claimant — the solar project, constituted an exercise
of governmental authority.*?’ According to the Respondent, “the consideration of how to resolve
a contractual dispute within [the FIT Program] is not an issue of exercising ‘governmental

authority.”

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

 

While the Claimant agrees that the OPA qualifies as a State enterprise for the purpose of
NAFTA,””’ it takes issue with the Respondent’s assertion that the OPA is an “independent”?

entity.’ According to the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to counter the Claimant’s

evidence which demonstrates that the MEI had both formal and informal control of the OPA.“”

More specifically, the Respondent has not replied to Mr Smitherman’s explanation that he

exercised a high degree of control over the OPA during his tenure.“**

229. In addition, according to the Claimant, the MEI “was heavily engaged with the OPA with respect

to post-moratorium negotiations with [the Claimant].”* The Claimant relies in particular on the

435

fact that the OPA’s first proposal to the Claimant was made at the direction of the MEI,*’° while

its second proposal was included in the MEI agenda for its weekly meetings.“*° The MEI had

also discussed with the OPA the possibility of allowing the Contract to “lapse” prior to the

437

imposition of the moratorium.**’ Moreover, according to the Claimant, “the OPA had earlier felt

compelled to fulfil the promise of the Premier’s Office and MEI to TransCanada to keep
TransCanada ‘whole.’”** The MEI had also intervened with the OPA to obtain a one-year

extension for the FIT Contract, over the OPA’s protests, and with the support of the

230. The Claimant disagrees for two reasons with the Respondent’s position that the OPA was not
exercising delegated authority “in failing to implement MEI’s commitment to ‘freeze’ the FIT
Contract or its decision to keep [the Claimant] ‘whole.’ First, according to the Claimant, the
Chief of Staff of the MEI advised the Claimant that the OPA would ensure that the commitment
would be met.’ Second, in assessing whether a State enterprise is operating in the exercise of

governmental authority, one needs to consider the purposes for which the relevant powers are to
be exercised and the extent to which the State enterprise is accountable to the Government.”
Accordingly, if the Tribunal were to find that the MEI did not retain for itself the responsibility
of keeping the FIT Contract “frozen,” then that responsibility would be “squarely directed to the

fulfillment of a governmental objective delegated to the OPA.”

Finally, the Claimant argues that the OPA’s administration of the FIT Program constitutes
“sovereign acts to carry out [the Respondent’s] objective of increasing procurement of electricity
from renewable energy sources,” and that the FIT Contract which “[the Respondent] tasked the
OPA with inistering, was the key of [the R dent’s] si policy objective

of procuring more electricity from renewable energy sources.”“*° According to the Claimant, the
Respondent’s argument “ignores the public purpose behind the OPA’s involvement in the FIT

Program, which simply cannot be characterized as merely commercial in nature.”““°

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The disagreement between the Parties concerns the interpretation and application of

Article 1503(2) of NAFTA (“State Enterprises”), which provides:

“2. Each Party shall ensure, through regulatory control, administrative supervision or the
application of other measures, that any state enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts
in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party’s obligations under Chapters Eleven
(Investment) and Fourteen (Financial Services) wherever such enterprise exercises any
regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated to
it, such as the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions or
impose quotas, fees or other charges.”
Article 1503(2) of NAFTA makes it clear that the State parties to NAFTA are responsible for the
conduct of State enterprises, but only to the extent that such enterprises are empowered to exercise
governmental authority. This is consistent with Article 5 of the ILC Articles, which further
specifies that “[t]he conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State ... but which
is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be
considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in
that capacity in the particular instance.” In other words, the conduct of persons or entities such
as State enterprises which are not formal organs of the State can only be attributable to the State

if the person or entity in question is exercising governmental authority in the particular instance.

The Tribunal notes that under the Electricity Act of 1998, while the OPA was “not an agent of
the Crown,” the Government of Ontario (the MEI) had the authority to issue directions to ops.”
Consequently, to the extent that OPA acted on the basis of such directions, its conduct could be
considered attributable to Canada, depending on whether the direction in question involved a

delegation of exercise of governmental authority to the OPA. Thus, the determination of whether

Canada requires an assessment of the relevant directions and therefore cannot be made in
abstracto, but only in concreto, in the context of an assessment of the relevant direction. Any
such determination is necessarily closely intertwined with the merits and therefore cannot be
decided independently of the merits. Consequently, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to defer

the consideration of this issue to the merits.

V. THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMANT’S CLAIMS

A. NAFTA ARTICLE 1110 — EXPROPRIATION

1. The Claimant’s Position

(a) The Respondent has indirectly expropriated the Claimant’s investment

235. The Claimant submits that WWIS, the Project and the FIT Contract are each investments in

Canada‘

and that the Respondent has indirectly expropriated these investments through the
imposition of the moratorium and its “failure to fulfill its promise [made during the conference
call of 11 February 2011] to take positive steps to ensure that Windstream was not penalized as a
result of [the moratorium].”“” The Claimant contends that these two measures “have rendered
WWIS, the Project and the FIT Contract substantially worthless.”“*° In particular, the Claimant
characterizes the FIT Contract as “a valuable asset” and “personal property under Ontario Law"!
and asserts that the FIT Contract meets the ratione materiae requirement under expropriation

provisions.“

236. The Claimant notes that Article 1110 of NAFTA prohibits NAFTA parties from expropriating
investments without compensation,**> whether directly or indirectly.“ An indirect expropriation
under Article 1110 of NAFTA occurs when the investor is substantially deprived of the value of
its investment by measures attributable to the relevant NAFTA Party.*** In the Claimant’s view,
the test that has been most widely applied by arbitral tribunals to determine whether measures
amount to an indirect expropriation is the “sole effects” test.°° According to the Claimant, “the
test ... is to look solely at the effects of the deprivation, not at the purpose.”"5” The Claimant

explains that “[uJnder that test, expropriation occurs where the investor has been substantially

deprived of the value or economic viability of its investment.”***

v. Mexico,*” the Claimant submits that a substantial deprivation of the value of an investment

amounting to an expropriation occurs when:

“‘a) the investment is no longer capable of generating a commercial return;

b) the investor has lost, in whole or in significant part, the use or reasonably-to-be expected

economic benefit of the investment;

c) the most economically optimal use of the investment has been rendered useless;

or

d) the investment’s economic value has been neutralized or destroyed, as if the rights

related thereto had ceased to exist.”"“*
The Claimant explains that WWIS has the obligation to bring the Project into commercial
operation by 4 May 2015 pursuant to the FIT Contract. This deadline can only be extended by
up to two years (i.e., to 4 May 2017) by reason of force majeure. Thereafter, either party will be

entitled to terminate the FIT Contract.***

While the Claimant’s Project currently has force
majeure status, the Claimant argues that there is no longer any realistic prospect that the Project
will reach commercial operation by 4 May 2017. The Claimant notes that this was admitted by
Mr Cecchini of the OPA during his testimony.“ According to the Claimant, the deadline became
unachievable as of 4 May 2012,** “[iJn light of the period that would be required to re-start the
Project, confirm regulatory requirements, obtain the required approvals, complete development
work and build the Project.”“*’ The Claimant argues that, consequently, the Project is no longer
“financeable.”“** The Claimant adds that, even if the OPA were to waive its right to terminate
the FIT Contract, the Government’s actions have created such a level of uncertainty around the
offshore wind industry that none of the potential partners with whom Windstream was negotiating

would now invest in the Project.“

The Claimant contends that, as a direct consequence of the moratorium and the Respondent’s

failure to effectively “freeze” the Project as promised,*” its investments in the Project and the

FIT Contract are now substantially worthless,‘”! and this amounts to an indirect expropriation.4””
The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s assertion that “the fact that Windstream’s
investments are now worthless is somehow Windstream’s fault.”*7 The OPA rejected
Windstream’s request that the FIT Contract remain under force majeure for the duration of the
moratorium and instead proposed to limit any extension to five years, while retaining the security,
regardless of the fact that the Ontario Government had not specified the duration of the

moratorium.’ The Claimant did not accept the OPA’s offer because it was “unreasonable.”*”>

240. The Claimant submits that the situation in the present arbitration is “analogous” to that underlying
the Khan Resources v. Mongolia decision.*”° The Claimant points out that the tribunal in that
case found that the invalidation and failure to re-register a mining license made the execution of
contractual obligations impossible and thus “deprived the claimant of the benefits of the relevant

agreements, even though the agreements had never been formally terminated.’”“””

241. The Claimant further contends that “[i]t is the nature of the deprivation that is relevant, not the
duration of the measure,” arguing that, as a consequence, the Respondent’s argument about “the
alleged temporariness of the moratorium is misplaced.”"”* The Claimant refers to the decision in
Belokon v. The Kyrgyz Republic, in which the tribunal concluded that a “temporary” measure

suspending the powers of the board and managing bodies of five Kyrgyz banks was

expropriatory’” and emphasizes that the decision in Tecmed, on which the Respondent relies,

“confirms that a temporary measure may lead to a permanent deprivation.”“*’ The Claimant
points out that “[t]here is no indication on the record that the Ontario Government truly intends

to lift the moratorium in the near future, or at all.’**!

The expropriation of the Claimant’s investment was unlawful

The Claimant further submits that the Respondent’s alleged expropriation of its investment was

unlawful.“

According to the Claimant, an expropriation is an unlawful breach of Article 1110
of NAFTA unless it meets the following criteria: (i) it is made for a public purpose; (ii) it is
conducted on a non-discriminatory basis; (iii) it is conducted in accordance with due process of

law and Article 1105(1); and (iv) compensation is paid in accordance with Article 1110(2)-(6)."**

The Claimant alleges that the expropriation of its investment was not done for a public purpose
and that, in particular, the moratorium was not adopted for a legitimate public purpose.** As a
consequence, according to the Claimant, it falls below the standard set by the International Law

Commission, according to which:

“[t]he power to expropriate should be exercised only when expropriation is necessary and
is justified by a genuinely public purpose or reason. If this raison d’étre is plainly absent,
the measure of expropriation is ‘arbitrary’ and therefore involves the international
responsibility of the state.’”“*°
The Claimant further contends that “Ontario has realized an economic benefit of between [CAD]
1.3 billion to [CAD] 2.5 billion by imposing the moratorium and indirectly cancelling the
Project.”“*° According to the Claimant, Ontario wanted to prevent the Project from proceeding
“so that the OPA would not be required to procure power from WWIS at the higher offshore
energy prices.”“*’ The Claimant refers to a statement by the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure,
Mr Brad Duguid, made shortly after the imposition of the moratorium, asking “[i]f we’re reaching
our clean energy objectives with onshore projects in solar, wind, bioenergy, why would we then

want to expand into offshore which is going to be more costly?”"**

According to the Claimant, the expropriation was also discriminatory. The moratorium
discriminated against Windstream, as a FIT Contract holder, by preventing it from proceeding
through the REA process in order to bring its Project into operation by the deadline in its FIT
Contract. According to the Claimant, such a constraint was not imposed on other FIT Contract

holders.“

The Claimant further contends that the expropriation was not carried out in accordance with due
process requirements. In the Claimant’s view, the imposition of the moratorium “overrides the
provisions of the REA Regulation and of Wind Policy 4.10.04” that have been adopted “to
encourage Windstream and other developers to invest in renewable energy projects in Ontario.”“”°
The Claimant contends that “[t]his regulatory framework applies equally to offshore wind projects

as it does to onshore ones, yet has been eviscerated with respect to offshore wind projects.”"”!

Finally, the Claimant claims that the Respondent failed to pay any compensation for its

. . . 9
expropriatory measures, which also renders it unlawful.‘”

The rationale for the moratorium is not relevant for the expropriation analysis

The Claimant submits that the rationale for the moratorium is not relevant for the expropriation

analysis.

The Claimant refers to the Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration, in which the
Respondent argues that the moratorium cannot have the effect of substantially depriving
Windstream of the value of its investment because “it was a bona fide, non-discriminatory
governmental decision implemented in the public interest” and that “Article 1110 does not

9493

prohibit such legitimate governmental decision making. The Claimant submits that this

argument should be rejected for several reasons.**

First, the Claimant argues that there is no public policy exception to expropriation and that the
Respondent’s argument that regulatory measures having a legitimate public purpose cannot be
expropriatory should be rejected.*®> The Claimant avers that “recognition of a broad ‘public
purpose’ exception to expropriation would be inconsistent with the plain wording of
Article 1110,” as “Article 1110(1)(a) provides that a public purpose is a prerequisite to a finding
of expropriation, including indirect expropriation.”“°*

The Claimant also argues that the Respondent’s position is based on an incorrect interpretation of
the Methanex decision, pointing out that, while the Methanex tribunal broadened the scope of the
“police powers” doctrine, thus making certain types of general regulatory measures

non-compensable, the tribunal in that case found that the challenged measures did not

substantially deprive the investor of the value of its investment.’ The Claimant further asserts
that many tribunals have rejected the application of a broad “public purpose” exception, including
the NAFTA tribunals in Pope & Talbot, Metalclad and Feldman, as well as the tribunals in
Santa Elena v. Costa Rica,”? Azurix™ and Vivendi 11°! In particular, the Claimant states that
the tribunal in Vivendi I observed that “the application of a public policy exception to
expropriation is inconsistent with the plain language of Article 1110 (and many expropriation
provisions in BITs)” and held that “Article 1110 provides that a failure to compensate an investor

for the expropriation of its investment is a breach, even if the expropriation is for a public

purpose.”5"

252. The Claimant further points out that the decisions in Chemtura, Suez, Saluka and Methanex, on
which the Respondent relies, involve the application of the police powers doctrine, rather than a
broad public purpose exception to expropriation”? According to the Claimant, the police powers
doctrine is not applicable in the present arbitration because it has to be construed narrowly and
cannot apply when the measure complained of was not adopted in good faith or for a legitimate
public purpose; when its effects are disproportionate to its stated public policy rationale; or when
the measure is contrary to specific commitments made to the investor and to the investor’s

legitimate expectations.“ In this context, the Claimant asserts that, in this case, “the moratorium

and the failure to freeze ... are not proportionate or necessary for legitimate public purpose."

253. Second, the Claimant alleges that the moratorium was not adopted in good faith or for a legitimate
public purpose.** In particular, in the Claimants view, the moratorium was politically motivated
and was not based on a rationale that would justify the application of the police powers doctrine.

The Claimant alleges that the moratorium was motivated by concerns about the cost of offshore

power and public opposition to wind turbine projects, particularly in certain key electoral ridings
for the governing Liberal Party, rather than “scientific uncertainty” concerning offshore wind

development.*”

The Claimant submits that the “scientific uncertainty” rationale put forward by the Respondent is
undermined by many elements, including that: (i) it was a rationale arrived at by politicians (rather
than scientific personnel) only after a number of other rationales for constraining offshore wind
were considered and rejected; (ii) several key government officials expressed skepticism about
the legitimacy of scientific uncertainty as a rationale for imposing a moratorium on offshore wind;
(iii) it was inconsistent with Minister Cansfield’s statement of 21 October 2009 that the

government’s “research made it clear that developing offshore wind potential would be practical
and environmentally sound once the appropriate infrastructure is in place;” and (iv) Ontario has
made no serious efforts to advance scientific research following the moratorium.* The Claimant
emphasizes that the Respondent “has not provided any credible evidence of harm to the
environment.” As to the alleged concern about drinking water, the Claimant asserts that it has
been accepted that there is no problem with drinking water, not to mention there is no credible

evidence of a significant threat to drinking water.*'°

Third, the Claimant contends that the effects of the Respondent’s measures have been

disproportionate to their stated public policy rationale.*!!

According to the Claimant, the
Respondent could have resorted to less intrusive measures to achieve its stated public policy

objective.*

Fourth, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s measures were contrary to Ontario’s specific
commitments and Windstream’s legitimate expectations, noting that “tribunals that accept a
public policy exception to expropriation do not apply it where the measure is contrary to the
state’s specific commitments to the investor or to the investor’s legitimate expectations.”*'>
According to the Claimant, the moratorium was a reversal of Ontario’s self-promotion as “open

for business” for offshore wind and its repeated assurances that it supported the Project.°'*

The Respondent’s Position
The FIT Contract is not an interest capable of being expropriated

The Respondent submits that there is no expropriation in this case. According to the Respondent,
the Claimant’s argument that the FIT Contract has been rendered “substantially worthless” must
fail as the FIT Contract does not create an investment capable of being expropriated.*'* Since
NAFTA contains a closed definition of investment, the Claimant must demonstrate that the FIT

Contract is among the exhaustive list of investments found in Article 1139.5"

Moreover, relying on Emmis v. Hungary, the Respondent contends that the existence of a valid
FIT Contract does not excuse the Claimant from proving that “specific rights ... under the
Contract have vested such that they are capable of being expropriated, and that there was an
expropriation.”*!’ While the Respondent does not dispute the fact that the FIT Contract “imposes

99518,

some vested rights and obligations,”"” it contends that the Claimant has failed to show that such

rights have been expropriated.”

According to the Respondent, the right that the Claimant alleges has been expropriated is the
supposed right to a revenue stream under the FIT Contract.*”° In the Respondent’s words, what
the Claimant had was nothing more than “an opportunity.”*?! This, however, was not a “vested
right” since “the FIT Contract provided only a potential, speculative interest in a future revenue
stream, contingent upon, among other things, obtaining the required permits and reaching
Commercial Operation by the deadlines required.”*” As such, the alleged right was not “certain
and demonstrable” and not capable of being expropriated.*> The Respondent notes that “only
once the project enters into commercial operation is a supplier entitled to the revenue stream under
the FIT contract.” The Respondent stresses that in this case the Claimant had not even begun the
process of obtaining the relevant permits such as a NTP which are preconditions for the project
to enter into commercial operation.*** From the perspective of the Respondent therefore, unless

the Claimant met the preconditions required by its FIT Contract, “the fact that the FIT contract

offered a fixed price is completely irrelevant as to whether the right to claim payment has vested

under the FIT contract.”

The economic impact of the moratorium does not amount to an expropriation

The Respondent submits that an expropriation requires a “taking” of fundamental ownership
rights that causes a substantial deprivation of the economic value of an investment.*”° In this case,
the Respondent argues, the moratorium could not have constituted an expropriation because (i)
the Project had no value at the time of the measures the Claimant complains of; and (ii) the deferral

resulting from the moratorium is temporary in nature.*””

The Respondent argues that when Ontario decided to defer offshore wind development the Project
had not reached a stage at which it could realistically be completed within the deadlines imposed
by the FIT Contract and, as a consequence, the Project had no value.*?* In the words of the

Respondent:

“[g]iven where the Claimant was in the development process when it signed its FIT
Contract, and given the first-of-a-kind nature of its proposal, the Windstream Wolfe Island
Shoals offshore wind facility was doomed to fail from the moment that the Claimant signed
on the dotted line.”
In addition, the Respondent submits that the current case law of NAFTA tribunals requires
showing that the expropriation is “permanent, and not ephemeral or temporary.”**° The
Respondent points out that since the moratorium it has conducted several studies relating to
offshore wind and continues to complete the work required to develop regulatory rules and
requirements for offshore wind facilities, thus demonstrating that the deferral is only a temporary

measure.*?

The Respondent argues that the temporary nature of the measure is reflected in the fact that the

Claimant’s assets remain intact;*** the FIT Contract is still in place and under force majeure.**

Accordingly, the Respondent takes the position that “the Claimant could obtain its security

deposit sooner if it entered into a mutual termination agreement with the OPA.”>*4

The moratorium has not interfered with the Claimant’s reasonable expectations

The Respondent further claims that the moratorium has not interfered with the Claimant’s
reasonable expectations. The Respondent observes that “it is not the function of Article 1110 to
eliminate the normal commercial risks of a foreign investor” or to compensate investors for their
imprudent business decisions.** The Respondent contends that the Claimant knew that its Project
“required regulatory change to proceed” and “accepted these risks when it invested in Ontario.”**°
The Respondent further notes that “by the time the first FIT contracts were offered, the regulatory

framework for offshore wind projects had not been any further developed.”*”

According to the Respondent, this uncertainty was “clearly communicated to the public in the
MOEFP’s policy proposal notice of June 25", 2010.”°°* Moreover, in accordance with the FIT
Contract that the Claimant signed, “the Claimant assumed the obligation of bringing the project
into commercial operation, including obtaining all the necessary permits and approvals such as
the REA, access to Crown land, and completing applicable federal permits.”**” The Respondent,
therefore, takes the position that “the Claimant was solely responsible for ensuring the technical,

regulatory and financial viability of its project.”*“°

The measure was not of an expropriatory character

The Respondent states that many types of government regulation can have significant effects on
investments, yet this does not mean that all such measures would constitute indirect

expropriations. Referring to the decision in Feldman v. Mexico, the Respondent points out that:

“a non-discriminatory measure, designed to protect legitimate public welfare objectives
such as health, safety and the environment, is not an indirect expropriation except in the

rare circumstance where its impacts are so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot
be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith.”*""

According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to meet the following criteria established

by NAFTA tribunals for the indirect expropriation of an enterprise:

“(i) whether the investor remained in control of its investment, (ii) whether it directed its
day-to-day operations, (iii) whether its officers and employees were detained by the State,
(iv) whether the State supervised the work of the investor’s officers and employees or not,
(v) whether the State had taken the proceeds of sales other than through taxation, (vi)
whether the State interfered with management or shareholders’ activities, (vii) whether the
State prevented the distribution of dividends to shareholders, (viii) whether the State
interfered with the appointment of directors or management, and (ix) whether the State had
taken any other actions ousting the investor from full ownership and control of the
investment.”>?

The Respondent points out that the “Claimant has not even attempted to argue that any of these

99543

criteria are met in this case. The Respondent distinguishes the decisions in Santa Elena v.

Costa Rica and Vivendi II quoted by the Claimant on the basis that “they involved measures
targeted at a particular investment as opposed to regulatory measures of general application.”*“

The Respondent further refers to the precautionary principle, noting that “there were legitimate
concerns that the science was not sufficient to support the development of a regulatory framework
that would be capable of assessing the effects of the first large scale freshwater offshore wind

farm in the world.”***

The Respondent also refers to the public consultation process on offshore
projects, where it received an unprecedented number of responses from the public and points out
that, because of this, it “anticipated that REAs for offshore wind projects would be appealed to
administrative tribunals and the courts.”**°

The Respondent further submits that the moratorium was of general application and
non-discriminatory.*” Finally, according to the Respondent, “impacts of the deferral on the
Claimant are not so severe in the light of its purpose that the deferral cannot be reasonably viewed

as having been adopted and applied in good faith.”***

3. Submissions pursuant to Article 1128 of NAFTA

(a) Submission of the United States

271. According to the United States, determining indirect expropriation is a “fact based inquiry””

which, once the scope of the property interest has been established,*’ considers several factors
including: “(i) the economic impact of the government action; (ii) the extent to which that action

interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and (iii) the character of the

government action.”**!

272. As to the first factor, the United States submits that a claimant must show that “the government
measure at issue destroyed all, or virtually all, of the economic value of its investment, or

interfered with it to such a similar extent and so restrictively as ‘to support a conclusion that the

property has been ‘taken’ from the owner.”

273. According to the United States, the second factor requires “an objective inquiry of the

reasonableness of the claimant’s expectations, which ‘depend in part on the nature and extent of

999553

governmental regulation in the relevant sector.

274. As to the third factor, the United States explains that it requires a determination of the nature and

character of the government action; in particular, whether “such action involves physical invasion

by the government or whether it is more regulatory in nature.”***

(b) Submission of Mexico

275. Mexico takes the position that a breach of Article 1110 based on indirect expropriation requires
at a minimum a “finding that a measure or series of measures attributable to the host State resulted

in the effectively permanent, substantially complete deprivation of the economic benefit of an

‘investment,’ as defined in Article 1139, that is (or was) owned or controlled by an investor of
another party.”°°> Mexico further states that an “investment” cannot exist in the absence of vested

(and not contingent) legal rights comprising an asset described in Article 1139.°°°

276. Mexico submits that “the existence (or non-existence) of investor’s ‘distinct, reasonable,
investment-backed expectations’ is at most a factor to consider in determining whether a measure
or series of measures have risen to the level of an indirect expropriation.”*’ According to
Mexico, “a host state’s failure to satisfy such expectations does not amount to an indirect
expropriation.”*** Mexico adds that a bona fide regulatory action taken in the public interest that
adversely affects the value or viability of an investment will not ordinarily amount to an indirect

expropriation.°?

277. Contrary to the positions of the United States and Mexico,” the Claimant submits that “there is

no broad public purpose or public interest exception to expropriation under Article 1110.”
According to the Claimant, even tribunals that have found an exception under the police powers

doctrine have recognized that the doctrine has traditionally been narrowly construed.5?

278. The Claimant relies on the Methanex and Chemtura decisions, asserting that “proven harm” (and
not public interest) is necessary to justify an otherwise expropriatory measure.** Even in cases

in which harm is proven, the Claimant contends that the measure will not “fall within the narrow

279. The Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 31(3) of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties (the “Vienna Convention”),*® “the clear and long-standing agreement of the
NAFTA Parties regarding the interpretation” should be taken into account in interpreting
Article 1110 of NAFTA”

280. According to the Respondent, “[w]ithout substantial deprivation of a property right there can be

no expropriation.”**’ The Respondent agrees with Mexico’s statement that expropriation requires

vested legal rights to exist and not contingent contractual rights,°** and reiterates its position that

“the Claimant’s contractual rights were contingent on obtaining regulatory approvals and permits

and therefore did not constitute vested rights that can be expropriated.”

281. The Respondent emphasizes that “the character of a measure is relevant to the indirect
expropriation analysis and that bona fide regulatory action taken in the public interest is not
ordinarily expropriatory or compensable.”*”” The Respondent notes that all three NAFTA parties

share this view.*”'

The Respondent argues that “interference with an investor’s expectation is only one factor in an
indirect expropriation analysis, and is not conclusive on its own,” and notes that all three NAFTA

Parties also agree with the position.*”

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Parties disagree not only on whether an expropriation has taken place, but also on the criteria
for such determination. The relevant provision of NAFTA, Article 1110, sets out the criteria for
legality of expropriation and defines the modalities of compensation, but does not provide any
criteria for determining whether or when an expropriation has taken place. However, the
provision does distinguish between direct and indirect expropriation, and as summarized above,

it is the Claimant’s case that the Respondent has indirectly expropriated its investment.

NAFTA tribunals have generally taken the view that under Article 1110 of NAFTA the
determination of whether an indirect expropriation has taken place is in the first place a matter of
evidence, that is, a factual determination of whether an effective or de facto taking of property
that is attributable to the State has taken place, even if there has been no formal transfer of title,
and even if the host State has not obtained any economic benefit. If it is determined that such a
de facto taking has indeed taken place, the issue arises as to whether the taking is lawful, and what
the appropriate form and level of relief should be. In certain circumstances, the question may
also arise as to whether the alleged taking is excused by a justification provided under

international law, such as the police powers doctrine.

The Tribunal agrees that the first step in the process of determining whether an effective taking
has taken place is to determine whether the investor has been substantially deprived of the value
of its investment.*” This is a test that has been applied by numerous investment treaty tribunals,

including NAFTA tribunals. Thus, in ADM v Mexico, the tribunal held:

“The test on which other Tribunals and doctrine have agreed — and on which the Claimants’
[sic] rely — is the ‘effects test.’ Judicial practice indicates that the severity of the economic
impact is the decisive criterion in deciding whether an indirect expropriation or a measure
tantamount to expropriation has taken place. An expropriation occurs if the interference is
substantial and deprives the investor of all or most of the benefits of the investment. There
is a broad consensus in academic writings that the intensity and duration of the economic

288.

deprivation is the crucial factor in identifying an indirect expropriation or equivalent

measure.”>"4

The Cargill v Mexico tribunal similarly stressed that a finding of expropriation requires “radical

deprivation of the Claimant’s economic use and enjoyment of its investment:”

“Tt is widely accepted that a finding of expropriation of property under customary
international law requires a radical deprivation of a claimant’s economic use and
enjoyment of its investment. This is the consistent view of previous NAFTA tribunals.
‘[T]he affected property must be impaired to such an extent that it must be seen as
‘taken.’’ ‘The taking must be a substantially complete deprivation of the economic
use and enjoyment of the rights to the property, or of identifiable distinct parts thereof
(i.e., it approaches total impairment).’ It is a view also stated in numerous BIT
arbitrations. Therefore, putting to the side the question of sufficiency of the duration
of the interference, the Tribunal must find a radical deprivation of the Claimant’s
economic use and enjoyment of its investment for the period of the interference.”*”°
In Metalclad v Mexico the tribunal analyzed the distinction made in Article 1110 of NAFTA
between direct and indirect expropriation, noting that both require “the effect of depriving the
owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit
of property:”
“Thus, expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged
takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in
favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property
which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or
reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the
obvious benefit of the host State.”*”°
The Claimant claims that such a de facto taking of its investment has occurred in the present case.
According to the Claimant, under the FIT Contract, WWIS had the obligation to bring the Project
into commercial operation by 4 May 2015. This deadline could be extended, but only up to two
years, i.e., until 4 May 2017, for reason of force majeure, whereafter either party will be entitled
to terminate the Contract. The Claimant contends that, while the Project is currently under force
majeure, there is no longer any realistic prospect that the Project can reach commercial operation
by 4 May 2017. Consequently, the Project is no longer financeable and has effectively lost all of
its value. This is the case even if the OPA were to waive its right to terminate the FIT Contract
as the conduct of the Ontario Government has created such uncertainty around the offshore wind

industry in Ontario that no potential investor would be prepared to invest in the Project.

As summarized above, the Respondent argues that, on the facts, there has been no expropriation
in this case because the Project had no value at the time of its alleged taking. At most, the
Claimant was deprived of an “opportunity” to develop the Project. Moreover, the moratorium is
only a temporary measure and therefore could not have resulted in a permanent deprivation of the
Claimant’s investment. The Claimant’s assets, including the security deposit, remain intact and

could be returned if the Claimant entered into a mutual termination agreement with the OPA.

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the relevant evidence and finds that, on the facts, no
expropriation has taken place in this case. First, the Claimant’s FIT Contract is still formally in
force and has not been unilaterally terminated by the Government of Ontario; consequently, while
the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the Project can no longer be completed by the MCOD,
4 May 2017, it continues to remain open for the Parties to re-activate and, as appropriate,
renegotiate the FIT Contract to adjust its terms to the moratorium. Second, and more importantly
in the context of the Claimant’s expropriation claim, the Claimant’s CAD 6 million security
deposit is still in place and has not been taken or rendered otherwise worthless as a result of any
action taken by the Government of Ontario. Under Article 10.1(g) of the FIT Contract, if by
reason of force majeure the MCOD is delayed for an aggregate of more than 24 months (which is
the case here), completion and performance security will be returned at the time of the termination
of the agreement by either party. Consequently, the Respondent cannot terminate, and indeed
confirmed at the hearing that it would not be able to terminate, the FIT Contract pursuant to
Article 10.1(g) without returning the security. It therefore cannot be said that the Claimant has

been substantially deprived of its investment.

In reaching the conclusion that, on the facts, the Claimant has not been substantially deprived of
its investment, the Tribunal has taken into account its determination of the overall value of the
Claimants’ investment, as set out in Section B below. As determined in Section B, the amount of
money invested by the Claimant in the Project — its sunk costs — do not substantially exceed, if at
all, the value of the security deposit. Consequently, although the Tribunal accepts (as determined
in Section B below) that the Claimant’s investment consists not only of the sunk investment costs
and the security deposit, but also of the value created by the Claimant in developing the Project,
the value of the asset that is still available to the Claimant as it has not been taken (i.e., the security
deposit) is substantial, in particular when compared to the overall value of the investment. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the Claimant has been substantially

deprived of the value of its investment.

NAFTA ARTICLE 1105 — FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that the Respondent has failed to grant Windstream’s investments fair and
equitable treatment in breach of its obligations under Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. According to
the Claimant, fair and equitable treatment is one of the elements included in the umbrella concept
of minimum standard of treatment.*”” The Claimant submits that the minimum standard of
treatment is a rule of customary international law and as such constitutes the “floor” of treatment

protected under Article 1105.5

Citing various arbitral awards, the Claimant explains that examples of treatment that have been
deemed to fall below the fair and equitable treatment standard include the breach of commitments
or of the investor’s legitimate expectations;*” failure to observe the required regulatory fairness
and predictability;**° arbitrariness;**! and discrimination.**? The Claimant notes that, while bad
faith is a persuasive indicator of unfair treatment, it is not a necessary element for finding a breach

of Article 1105(1).>*

The Claimant accepts that it has the burden of proving that the legal standard has been breached.***
However, as to proving what the relevant legal standard is, the Claimant submits that there is an
equal burden on either side to provide evidence of customary law, i.e., state practice and opinio
juris.**° The Claimant emphasizes that its main position is not that “there is a customary
international law principle under [the fair and equitable treatment standard] of legitimate
expectations that is ... independent and standalone.”**° According to the Claimant, legitimate
expectations is one of the elements or factors examined by tribunals when determining whether a

breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard has occurred.**”

295. The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s position that the threshold for proving a breach of
Article 1105(1) is “extremely high” is incorrect.*** In Bilcon v. Canada, the tribunal rejected
Canada’s arguments that the challenged conduct needs to rise to the level of shocking or
outrageous behavior.**’ The Claimant also cites the tribunal in Mondev v. United States, which

confirmed that “[t]o the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the

outrageous or the egregious.”>””

296. The Claimant submits that the only NAFTA tribunal to have accepted the “egregious conduct”
standard — based on the 1926 Neer decision — is the one in Glamis Gold, but that its reasoning

“has consistently been rejected by NAFTA tribunals, other tribunals applying the minimum

99591

standard of treatment and commentators. What is more, according to the Claimant, the

Respondent “has failed to show any evidence of state practice and opinio juris that [the fair and

equitable treatment standard, under minimum standard of treatment,] requires conduct that is

+592

outrageous or egregious. In any event, in the Claimant’s view, there is no substantial

difference between the Claimant’s and the Respondent’s standard; the same factors are

593
relevant.°”*

297. According to the Claimant, there is a consistent practice of arbitral tribunals when applying the

standard under Article 1105(1) to consider “whether a state has breached an investor’s legitimate

expectations arising from specific commitments made to the investor to induce the investment.”°"*

(a) The moratorium was arbitrary, grossly unfair and contrary to the Respondent’s
commitments and representations and the Claimant’s legitimate expectations

the Claimant to enter into the FIT Contract and breached the Claimant’s resulting legitimate
expectations.°°> The Claimant contends that the moratorium has prevented Windstream from
obtaining access to Crown land to develop the Project in accordance with the timelines set out in

the FIT Contract.*”

The Respondent’s i P ions and included that: (i) Ontario was
“open for business” for offshore wind; (ii) timely approval of applications to use Crown land for
offshore wind energy development could be expected by those submitting applications; (iii) the
streamlined regulatory approvals process created by the GEGEA applied equally to all renewable
energy projects, including offshore wind projects; (iv) the GEGEA, and the FIT Program and
REA process it created, would make Ontario the “destination of choice for green power
developers ... including wind, both onshore and offshore” by providing “certainty that
government would issue permits in a timely way” and a fair price guaranteed “for decades,” and
that the Act would “coordinate approvals from the [MOE and MNR] into a streamlined process
with a service guarantee;” (v) Ontario was satisfied that its research “made clear” that developing
offshore wind was environmentally sound, and as a result lifted the earlier deferral on accepting
applications for offshore wind project development; (vi) the Project had the “highest priority” for
receiving AOR status and would receive “priority attention from MNR;” (vii) the Ontario
Government, including the Premier’s Office, supported the Project; (viii) the Government was
working “feverishly” to develop offshore REA guidelines and that, as of May 2010, the guidelines
would be available “very soon;” (ix) the MNR “appreciate[d] Windstream’s need for certainty”
before it signed a FIT Contract, and would “move as quickly as possible through the remainder
of the application review process in order that [WWIS] may obtain Applicant of Record status in
a timely manner;” (x) the approval process for the Project would be expedited; and (xi) the Project
could proceed as an offshore wind pilot project.°°’ The Claimant emphasizes that “[w]ithout this
repeated and continuous confirmation of the government’s support for the Project, Windstream
would not have invested time and capital in the Project.”5*

The Claimant points out that Minister Smitherman stated in his witness statement that remarks he
had made on the occasion of the introduction of the GEGEA “were designed to attract investors
to Ontario.”*” Windstream relied on these commitments when it decided to invest in WWIS and

the Project.“ In the view of the Claimant, “[tJhese representations are akin to the representations

given to the claimant in Bilcon, on which the tribunal in that case relied in finding that Canada

had breached Article 1105(1).”"

The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s assertion that in light of the allegedly
underdeveloped regulatory framework for offshore wind, Windstream’s reliance on these
representations was not reasonable.” According to the Claimant, Windstream’s reliance on the
Ontario Government’s commitment to issue regulatory approvals for offshore wind projects in a
timely way “would only be unreasonable if the Government had made public statements reneging

+9603

those commitments; the 2008 decision of Minister Cansfield to lift the deferral was based on

research that “made clear” that the environmental approvals process in place was sufficient to

ensure compliance of offshore wind projects with environmental standards;°™ and Ontario never

publicly communicated that it was “not ready” to receive investment in offshore wind projects.°>

In the Claimant’s view, in terms of the REA Regulations, all the main rules were in place for the
project to move forward.® The Claimant maintains that the REA Regulations specifically
applied to offshore wind including classified facilities and offshore wind facilities. °”
Furthermore, there existed a regulatory framework that included not only the REA Regulations,
but also the FIT Contract, renewable energy procurement initiatives from the Ministry of Energy,
the Environmental Protection Act, and the site release process. The Claimant further notes that
the Offshore Wind Facility Report served as a “specific piece of guidance documentation”
published in relation to REA Regulation 359, and included environmental assessment
components.®” In addition, as to the setback issue, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent
that there was regulatory uncertainty, arguing that each setback would be determined on a specific
basis based upon each individual project.°'? The Claimant’s witness, Mr Uwe Roeper, explains
that there have been many projects in which there have been no specific setback guidelines and,
in those instances, the standard approach is followed that uses science and the specific

requirements.°!! In sum, the Claimant maintains that “there were sufficient rules in place ... for

the project to have proceeded through the REA application and through the application provisions
in the MNR.”°?

According to the Claimant, the “moratorium was an abrupt withdrawal of Ontario’s support for
the Project,” with “devastating consequences” that rendered the Project “substantially

9613

worthless. In particular, the Claimant sees the moratorium as contrary to ministerial

commitments that the GEGEA would provide offshore wind developers with “certainty,” that the

99614

MNR and the MOE “would issue permits in a timely way,””"" and to the MNR’s commitment to

“move as quickly as possible” with respect to Windstream’s application for the AOR status.°'°

Further, the Claimant contends that, “[r]ather than amending the regulatory framework in place
for offshore wind projects at the time Windstream invested in the Project, in adopting the
moratorium Ontario decided to override that framework by fiat, with complete disregard for the
regulatory process.”*'® The Claimant points out that the moratorium lacked formal legal authority
because it was based on “nothing more than policies announced via [online] postings ... and via
press releases.”*'” This notwithstanding, the practical effect of the moratorium was to “override”
the REA Regulation, which promised to proponents of offshore wind projects that they “could
apply for, and obtain, a Renewable Energy Approval.”*'* The Claimant characterizes the
moratorium as a “shocking and unexpected repudiation of a policy’s very purpose and goals” and
a “willful disregard of the law,” which the Claimant says has consistently been found by arbitral
tribunals “to be arbitrary and grossly unfair.”°!°

The Claimant also alleges that the moratorium was “politically motivated” by the “desire to
indefinitely stall offshore wind development” out of considerations including “cost savings” and
“countering public opposition to offshore wind development,” rather than any “scientific

uncertainty.”°°

Finally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to fulfill its promises to ensure that the

21

moratorium would not penalize Windstream.®! The Claimant contends that the Respondent

could have treated Windstream “fairly” by ensuring the Project was “frozen” and not “cancelled”

or by giving it an alternative project, like it did for TransCanada.°

The Respondent discriminated against the Claimant

The Claimant submits that the Respondent also breached Article 1105(1) of NAFTA by treating
other investors more favorably.? The Claimant points out that several NAFTA awards have
found that discriminatory treatment can amount to a breach of Article 1105. In addition, the
Claimant submits that discriminatory intent is not necessary to qualify a given measure as
discriminatory under international law; what counts is the discriminatory effect.°

According to the Claimant, the Respondent discriminated against it when compared to the
treatment of TransCanada, Samsung, other applicants for Crown land and the other developers of
large-scale projects who were awarded FIT Contracts at the same time as Windstream.°° In
particular, the Claimant submits that the Respondent kept TransCanada “whole” after cancelling
its project, but refused to do the same for Windstream.®” The Claimant also complains that the
Respondent gave a solar project that the Claimant had proposed as an alternative to the Project to
Samsung, thus “prevent[ing] Windstream from salvaging the value of its FIT Contract and
Project, and instead favour[ing] the interests of Samsung.”

The Claimant further submits that within the period of over six years since Windstream applied
for AOR status to develop the Project, the Respondent granted that status to “at least 19 other
wind energy developers,” but not to Windstream, despite the “MNR’s commitment to
Windstream ... that [it] would receive Applicant of Record status in a ‘timely manner.’”°?
According to the Claimant, “Ontario has allowed every other developer of a large wind project
... to receive the benefits of its FIT contract,” while “Windstream has been singled out and

prevented from receiving the benefit of its FIT Contract.”°*°

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s allegations “that Ontario’s adoption and
implementation of the deferral violated Canada’s obligation to provide the Claimant with the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment because it (1) was arbitrary and
grossly unfair; (2) constituted a repudiation of the regulatory framework; (3) violated the
commitments and representations made by Ontario contrary to the Claimant’s legitimate
expectations; and (4) was discriminatory” are without any merit.°*! The Respondent argues that
Article 1105(1) of NAFTA only requires Canada to accord the customary international minimum
standard of treatment of aliens, referring to NAFTA’s Free Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) Notes

of Interpretation of 31 July 2001.57

According to the Respondent, the Tribunal must “consider the applicable customary rules, which
requires proof of extensive uniform, consistent, and general practice by States, together with the
States’ belief that such practice is required by law.”°> The Respondent notes that “the practice
of states does not support the proposition that standalone FET clauses have become part of the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment” and “there is no uniform consistent
practice.”°* According to the Respondent, “to prove a breach of Article 1105 requires proving a
breach of a customary international law standard, such as denial of justice or a breach of an
investor’s full protection and security.”°*> The Respondent submits that “the Claimant has not
met its burden in identifying a standard of customary international law and has not alleged a denial

of justice or a breach of full protection and security.”°*°

According to the Respondent, the threshold to establish a breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA is
very high.’ In particular, following the FTC Note of Interpretation, NAFTA tribunals “have
consistently affirmed that a violation of the minimum standard of treatment under customary
international law will not be found unless there is evidence of egregious conduct, such as serious

malfeasance, manifestly arbitrary behaviour or denial of justice.”°**

The Respondent argues that the tribunal in S.D. Myers v. Canada held that, to establish a breach
of Article 1105 of NAFTA, it must be “shown that an investor has been treated in such an unjust

or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international

perspective.”*” The S.D. Myers tribunal elaborated that “determination must be made in the light
of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic
authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.” The Respondent further refers to
summaries of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law provided by
the tribunals in Thunderbird, Waste Management, Glamis, Cargill and Mobil.“"!

The Respondent concludes that “it is clear from the consistent post-FTC Note of Interpretation
NAFTA jurisprudence ... that the measure in question must hit a high level of severity and gravity

in order to breach the exacting threshold set by Article 1105.”

The moratorium was neither manifestly arbitrary nor grossly unfair

The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s allegation that Ontario’s decision to defer the
development of offshore wind was made because of “economic benefit, along with electoral
politics,” stating that such an allegation is “unsubstantiated by the evidentiary record” of this
arbitration.“ The Claimant’s allegation that the decision to defer offshore wind development
was made “because of electoral politics” is not supported by the evidence.“ According to the
Respondent, the record is “replete with evidence concerning the reason for the deferral,” i.e.

the need to ground the offshore wind policy framework on solid scientific foundation.

While the Respondent does not deny that it was aware of public opposition to offshore wind, it
argues that such opposition required that the regulatory framework be backed by scientific
research. “© The Respondent considers it “absurd for the Claimant to suggest that the
consideration of public concerns by elected officials is somehow a breach of Article 1105."
Similarly, while conceding that the impact on ratepayers was a consideration in deciding to
impose the deferral, the Respondent argues that “Article 1105 does not prevent elected officials
charged with managing public finances from considering the full context of their decisions when

making policy choices.”

The Respondent explains that because the REA process was intended to be standardized and
prescriptive in nature to ensure that the development of renewable energy projects does not
adversely affect human health and the environment, the determination of requirements for project
proponents “was a necessary prerequisite for the issuance of REAs for offshore wind projects.”
As the REA Process also provides third-parties with a right of appeal," the Respondent had to
adopt a “cautious approach, especially in light of the public opposition to offshore wind.”°*
Accordingly, Ontario’s decision to institute a temporary deferral on offshore wind development

“was neither manifestly arbitrary nor grossly unfair.”°?

The moratorium did not amount to a repudiation of the regulatory framework for offshore
wind

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s characterization of the REA Regulation.°?
Contrary to the Claimant’s assertion that the deferral amounts to a repudiation of the existing
regulatory framework for offshore wind, the Respondent contends that the moratorium is “fully
in support of the development of offshore wind policies in the REA Regulation.”°™ Indeed, the
moratorium was necessary to allow the regulator sufficient time to determine appropriate rules,
requirements and standards.*°° According to the Respondent, it could not repudiate a regulatory

framework “that did not yet exist.”°*°

The Respondent acknowledges that “the REA Regulation applies equally to offshore wind
projects as it does to onshore wind and other renewable energy projects,”**” but contends that the
Claimant ignores the technology-specific requirements in the REA Regulation which are reflected
in different classifications of renewable energy generation facilities.“ The decision to defer
offshore wind development was necessary “to allow the regulator sufficient time to determine the
rules, requirements and standards that the proponent of an offshore wind facility would have to
satisfy prior to the issuance of a REA.”° According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s

contention that the deferral was “unnecessary to achieve its stated environmental objective” is

therefore unfounded. Without “scientifically sound rules” the MOE could not be in a position

to assess a project and issue a REA accordingly."

(c) Neither the moratorium nor Ontario’s subsequent conduct vis-a-vis the Claimant breached
any specific commitments to the Claimant

320. The Respondent argues that, even assuming a mere breach of a commitment or representation
was sufficient to demonstrate a breach of Article 1105 of NAFTA, the Claimant has not provided

any evidence “that Ontario made any specific assurances, which could reasonably have been

19662

relied upon by the Claimant to induce it to invest in Ontario. In particular, the customary

international law minimum standard of treatment does not require a State to respect an investor’s
legitimate expectations, as explained by the arbitral tribunals in Waste Management II, Glamis
and Mobil.* According to the Respondent, the mere failure to meet a commitment does not fall
below the customary international law standard of treatment required by Article 1105 of

NAFTA.

321. The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s argument that a breach of legitimate expectations
in and of itself could amount to a breach of Article 1105.°° Specifically, the NAFTA decisions
that the Claimant relies on provide no assistance because the tribunals in those cases failed to
apply the customary international law standard.*° The Respondent suggests that, at most, the
standard can be used as a “relevant factor” in assessing the egregious behavior under customary

international law, referring to the decisions in Thunderbird, Glamis Gold and Mobil."

322. The Respondent also argues that the only relevant expectations for the Article 1105 NAFTA
analysis are those that are objective and reasonable, based on specific assurances made to induce

the investment, and existing at the time of the investment. However, the Claimant has failed

to prove that it had any expectations that would be relevant to an Article 1105 analysis.“ In

be permitted to proceed merely because the OPA (an independent State enterprise) offered it a

Finally, the Respondent’s expert, Mr Gareth Clarke, notes that the Project had a “significant risk

39674

profile’”®”" as it would have been “the first offshore wind project permitted in North America and
particularly under the REA process” and subject to more scrutiny from the various agencies
involved,*” and because it was in an early stage of development as there were still a number of

technical, and environmental studies and other work to do to develop the project.°”*

The moratorium and Ontario’s subsequent conduct did not discriminate against the
Claimant

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to make any distinction between its
Article 1105 NAFTA claims with respect to TransCanada and Samsung and its Articles 1102 and
1103 NAFTA claims, whereas the FTC Note of Interpretation clearly states that “[a]
determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate
international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).”6”
According to the Respondent, the Claimant therefore inappropriately relies on its allegations of
discriminatory treatment under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 to establish a breach of
Article 1105.°%

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has also failed to prove, on the facts, that it was subject

to any discriminatory treatment. According to the Respondent, the Claimant was treated in its

capacity as a FIT project proponent, whereas neither TransCanada nor Samsung participated in

the FIT Program.*”

The Respondent notes that none of the comparators that the Claimant has identified are offshore

wind developers.**°

The Respondent points out that “there are currently no offshore wind
proponents in Ontario with AOR status” and that “no other offshore wind projects have been
developed or proceeded through the REA process in Ontario.”**' According to the Respondent,
the Claimant actually received more favorable treatment because its Project was “merely frozen,”

whereas all other offshore wind applications were cancelled.”

Ontario took reasonable efforts to ensure that the Claimant was not adversely affected by
the moratorium

The Respondent submits that it “took all reasonable measures to accommodate the Claimant.”

In particular, during the telephone conference on 11 February 2011 the Government of Ontario
(through officials from the MEI, MOE, MNR and the OPA) explained to the Claimant the effects
of the decision on its Project and presented various options as to how to move forward.* In other
words, “Ontario confirmed that whereas all other offshore FIT and Crown land applications were
cancelled, the Claimant’s Project and its Crown land applications were not terminated.”° The
Claimant “was invited to engage the OPA in ‘without prejudice’ negotiations specifically in
respect of the Force Majeure, two-year Force Majeure termination clause and security deposit
provisions in the FIT Contract.”°**

The Respondent submits that the Claimant “did not pursue the available options ... and instead
chose to make unreasonable and unrealistic demands of Ontario and the OPA,” seeking “an
extension of its MCOD until such date as the Claimant elected to resume the project.”*’ The
Claimant also requested “the return of the full amount of the security deposit, a removal of the
time limitations on Force Majeure, and removal of the OPA’s termination right,” as well as
making “requests unrelated to mitigating the impact of the deferral, such as the removal of its
domestic content requirement.”** According to the Respondent, “[i]f the Claimant had accepted

the OPA’s proposal, then the harm that it claims occurred on May 4, 2012, when its financing

Respondent also contends that the Claimant’s “alternative proposals” were “unreasonable,” as

they were “inconsistent with the FIT Rules and would result in major implications to ratepayers

and other renewable energy projects that were already under development.”°”°

3. Submissions pursuant to Article 1128 of NAFTA
(a) Submission of the United States

329. The United States submits that the FTC’s interpretation of Article 1105 is binding on all NAFTA
tribunals constituted under Chapter 11.°°' As confirmed by the FTC, the term fair and equitable

treatment does “not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the

customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.”°

330. According to the United States, customary international law has two components, State practice
and opinio juris.? Both requirements “must...be identified to support a finding that a relevant
rule of customary international law has emerged.” The United States points out that

“legitimate expectations’ is not a component element of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ under

19695

customary international law that gives rise to an independent host State obligation,”””’ and an

investor’s expectation with respect to “a particular legal regime dofes] not preclude a State from
taking future regulatory action.”°* Consequently, “something more” than mere interference with

the investor’s expectations is required under the minimum standard of treatment.°”

claimant must show that the State breached the customary international law rule and the minimum
standard of treatment.”' Such a determination “must be made in the light of the high measure of

deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate

Article 1102 or 1103 has been breached does not establish a breach of Article 1105(1).”””

“State practice’ for purposes of proving customary international law, although such decisions can
9704

be relevant for determining State practice when they include an examination of such practice.
Mexico also reiterates its position that “Article 1105(1) does not provide a blanket prohibition on
discrimination against foreign investors or their investments,” stressing that “[n]ationality-based
discrimination falls under the purview of NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103, and not
Article 1105.”

Mexico also refers to the United States’ submission in the Mesa case, in which the United States

argued as follows:

“Article 1105 thus reflects a standard that develops from State practice and opinio juris,
rather than an autonomous, treaty-based standard. ... Arbitral decisions interpreting
‘autonomous’ fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security provisions in
other treaties ... do not constitute evidence of the content of the customary international
law standard required by Article 1105. ...

 

States may modify or amend their regulation to achieve legitimate public welfare objectives
and will not incur liability under customary international law merely because such changes
interfere with an investor’s ‘expectations’ about the state of regulation in a particular sector.

The burden is on a claimant to establish the existence and applicability of a relevant
obligation under customary international law that meets the requirements of State practice
and opinio juris. ‘The party which relies on a custom,’ therefore, ‘must prove that this
custom is established in such a manner that it has become binding on the other Party.’ Once
a tule of customary international law has been established, the claimant must show that the
State has engaged in conduct that violates that rule. Determining a breach of the minimum
standard of treatment ‘must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that
international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters
within their borders.”””°
Mexico endorses the following positions adopted by the Respondent in its Rejoinder: (i) “[o]nly
States can engage in relevant actions which, if followed out of opinio juris and in concert with
enough other States, coalesce into binding custom; (ii) “none of the awards cited by the Claimant,
NAFTA or otherwise, undertakes the requisite examination of State practice and opinio juris
necessary to prove that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens
has the same substantive content as the autonomous fair and equitable treatment standard;”
(iii) “the threshold for establishing a breach of the customary international law minimum standard

of treatment under Article 1105(1) is high, requiring evidence of egregious conduct”; and

(iv) “NAFTA tribunals have accorded a high level of deference to domestic authorities” in

(c) The Claimant’s reply to the submissions of the United States and Mexico

337. The Claimant submits that the United States’ and Mexico’s proposed interpretation of

Article 1105(1) should be rejected.”* The Claimant relies on the FTC’s Notes of Interpretation,”

710 712

the decisions in Pope & Talbot’ and Bilcon,”'! the United States’ submission”? and Professor

3

Dolzer’s opinion,” arguing that the Tribunal should be guided by “the interpretation of

Article 1105(1) set out in the decisions of NAFTA tribunals” and also by “the interpretation of
the fair and equitable treatment standard in other arbitral decisions.””'* According to these
decisions, in determining whether the minimum standard has been breached, “the tribunal should

consider whether the state has breached specific commitments made to induce the investment that

were reasonably relied upon by the investor.”7!5

338. The Claimant rejects the position of Mexico and the United States that State practice and opinio
juris must be proven independently in every case.”'° The Claimant also submits that Mexico and
the United States do not provide any assistance to the Tribunal as to how “state practice and opinio
juris concerning the precise scope of the requirement to grant fair and equitable treatment under
Article 1105 would ever be established.””'” The Claimant argues that the Tribunal should be
guided by the decisions of other NAFTA tribunals which “have consistently referred to the
formulations of the content of Article 1105(1) adopted by other NAFTA tribunals, and other
arbitral tribunals interpreting the fair and equitable treatment component of the minimum standard

of treatment.””'* According to these decisions, conclusive proof with respect to State practice or

opinio juris is not required for the purpose of establishing the conduct that would amount to a

breach of the minimum standard of treatment.” The Claimant argues that the Tribunal may also

be “guided by the decisions of arbitral tribunals interpreting the ‘autonomous’ fair and equitable

treatment standard established under bilateral and multilateral investment treaties...”””°

339. The Claimant notes that “even the Glamis Gold tribunal, on which the United States relies, found
that a breach of an investor’s legitimate expectations could constitute a breach of Article 1105(1)
‘where a Contracting Party’s conduct creates reasonable and justifiable expectations on the part
of an investor (or investment) to act in reliance on said conduct...’””?! In the Claimant’s view,
there is no general rule of customary international law that requires the application of the
“shocking or outrageous” standard established in Neer in the circumstances of the present

proceedings.”

340. The Claimant submits that, as explained by Professor Dolzer, both State practice and opinio juris
provide for the provision of fair and equitable treatment as part of the minimum standard of

. . 23
treatment under customary international law.”

Indeed, fair and equitable treatment provisions
have become “pervasive” in bilateral and multilateral investment treaties, representing efforts to

standardize foreign investment protection.” As to opinio juris, the Claimant relies on Professor

 

Dolzer’s opinion that “the fact that states have overwhelmingly included fair and equitable

treatment provisions in investment protection treaties ‘constitutes the best evidence of what states

29725

consider themselves obliged to do under customary international law. The Claimant notes

that Professor Dolzer’s opinion has not been challenged in these proceedings.””°

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal should reject the submission of the United States and
Mexico that entering into treaties containing fair and equitable treatment provisions constitutes a
policy decision by a State and not an action taken out of legal obligation. According to the
Claimant, this submission “ignores that the sheer number and pervasiveness of bilateral
investment treaties evidences that states, when entering into bilateral investment treaties, consider
themselves bound by the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment to foreign

investors.””””

The Respondent’s reply to the submissions of the United States and Mexico

The Respondent agrees with the other NAFTA parties that “the Claimant must prove that the
specific rules of customary international law regarding the treatment of the investment that it
alleges have crystallized into widespread and consistent State practice flowing from a sense of
legal obligation.””* According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to meet its burden of
proof as “neither the Claimant’s Memorial nor the Claimant’s Reply Memorial contain any
discussion of State practice and opinio juris necessary to prove a rule of customary international

law.”

The Respondent also agrees with the United States and Mexico that “decisions of international
courts and arbitral tribunals interpreting ‘fair and equitable treatment’ as a concept of customary
international law are not themselves instances of ‘state practice’ for the purpose of evidencing
customary international law.”7*° Moreover, in the Respondent’s view, “none of the decisions on
which the Claimant relies as evidence of the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment contain any analysis of State Practice and opinio juris.”"! Canada also disagrees with
the Claimant’s argument that the autonomous fair and equitable treatment standard and the
minimum standard of treatment under customary international law “are similar standards, and that
the autonomous standard has relevance to the customary international law standard,” referring

again to the other NAFTA parties’ submissions.”

According to the Respondent, the Tribunal is not entitled to “second-guess domestic policy and

decision-making and to question the domestic regulatory process.””*? Supporting the common

position of the United States and Mexico, the Respondent submits that “a determination of breach
of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment ‘must be made in the light of

the high measures of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic

authorities to regulate matters within their borders.”””™

345. The Respondent further argues that “no established rule of customary international law has

emerged that generally prohibits any nationality-based discrimination against foreign

735

investors,”’*” rejecting the Claimant’s allegation that Canada breached its Article 1105 obligation

“[by] providing more favourable treatment to Samsung and TransCanada.””*°

346. The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s assertion that “there is a breach of Article 1105
when a state ‘breaches the investor’s legitimate expectations arising from state representations
and assurances’ or ‘fails to maintain regulatory fairness and predictability.”"”"” The Respondent

alleges that “the Claimant failed to establish that such protections are part of the minimum

» 738

standard of treatment at customary international law. The Respondent relies on the

submission of the United States, to the effect that “the concept of ‘legitimate expectations’ is not

a component element of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ under customary international law that

9739

gives rise to an independent host State obligation. The Respondent also concurs with

Mexico’s position that “States may modify or amend their regulations to achieve legitimate public
welfare objectives and will not incur liability under customary international law merely because

such changes interfere with an investor’s ‘expectations’ about the state of regulation in a particular

sector.”

4. The Tribunal’s Analysis
(a) The interpretation and content of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA

347. As summarized above, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has breached Article 1105(1)
(“Minimum Standard of Treatment”) of NAFTA. Article 1105(1) provides:

“1, Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in
accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security.”

While the Parties disagree on the content of the minimum standard of treatment set out in
Article 1105(1), as well as on how the content of the standard should be established, they agree
that the interpretation of this provision by the FTC in its Notes of Interpretation of 31 July 2001
is binding on all NAFTA tribunals under Article 1131(2) (“Governing Law”) of NAFTA.”! The
FTC’s Notes of Interpretation state:

“I, Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments
of investors of another Party.

2. The concepts of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and security’ do not
require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.

3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or
of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach

of Article 1105(1).”
The Claimant submits that both Parties bear the burden of proving the content of the standard.
According to the Claimant, rather than requiring the Parties to prove the existence of custom on
the basis of state practice and opinio juris, NAFTA tribunals have relied primarily on arbitral
jurisprudence in determining the level of conduct that amounts to a breach of the requirement of
fair and equitable treatment. The Respondent submits, in response, that it is the Claimant that
bears the burden of proving the content of the standard because it is the party alleging that the
standard has been breached. In support of its position, the Respondent refers inter alia to Cargill
v Mexico, in which the tribunal held that “it is for the party asserting the custom to establish the

content of that custom.”

The Tribunal agrees that it is in the first place for the party asserting that a particular rule of
customary international law exists to prove the existence of the rule. However, in the present case
the issue is not whether the relevant rule of customary international law exists; the minimum
standard of treatment contained in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA is indeed a rule of customary
international law, as interpreted by the FTC in its Notes of Interpretation. The issue therefore is
not whether the rule exists, but rather how the content of a rule that does exist — the minimum
standard of treatment in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA — should be established. The Tribunal is

therefore unable to accept the Respondent’s argument that the burden of proving the content of

71 Article 1131(2) of NAFTA provides that “[a]n interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this
agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section.”

98

351.

352.

the rule falls exclusively on the Claimant. In the Tribunal’s view, it is for each Party to support
its position as to the content of the rule with appropriate legal authorities and evidence. On this
issue, the Respondent argues, and the Claimant appears to agree, that the Tribunal is not strictly
bound by the Parties’ positions although it may be said to be bound by the record before it in the
sense that, if the Tribunal considers that there are issues or questions that neither Party has fully
or properly addressed, or if it wishes to refer to legal authorities other than those cited by the
Parties, it should draw the Parties’ attention to those issues, questions and authorities and solicit
the Parties’ views thereon. This is indeed what the Tribunal has sought to do in the course of the
present proceedings, having put forward a series of questions both before and during the February

2016 hearing, including regarding the content of the minimum standard of treatment.

The Tribunal further agrees with the Respondent that in principle the content of a rule of
customary international law such as the minimum standard of treatment can best be determined
on the basis of evidence of actual State practice establishing custom that also shows that the States
have accepted such practice as law (opinio juris). However, the Tribunal notes that neither Party
has produced such evidence in this arbitration. In the circumstances, the Tribunal must rely on
other, indirect evidence in order to ascertain the content of the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment; the Tribunal cannot simply declare non liquet. Such indirect
evidence includes, in the Tribunal’s view, decisions taken by other NAFTA tribunals that
specifically address the issue of interpretation and application of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA, as
well as relevant legal scholarship.”

The Tribunal notes that other NAFTA tribunals have adopted a similar approach when seeking to
determine the contents of the minimum standard of treatment in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. Both
Parties have also extensively cited to NAFTA awards and legal scholarship. Furthermore, while
decisions of earlier international tribunals such as the Neer tribunal are often referred to as
reflective of the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment,
including by the Respondent in the present proceedings, the Tribunal notes that Neer is also an
award (or more accurately, a decision of an international claims commission), not direct evidence
of State practice, and that the Neer tribunal itself did not have any direct evidence relating to State
practice before it.”* The Tribunal is therefore unable to determine the content of the customary

international law minimum standard of treatment by revisiting the evidence before the Neer

™ This approach is consistent with the approach that the International Court of Justice is required to adopt under
Article 38 of its Statute, which provides that the Court may refer to “judicial decisions and the teachings of the
most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”
(emphasis added).

78 See L. F. H. Neer and Pauline Neer (United States) v. United Mexican States (Mexico-United States Claims
Commission), Decision of 15 October 1926, para. 4 (citing Basset Moore, John, American Journal of International
Law (1910), p. 787.

tribunal. Nor did the Neer decision deal with the treatment of foreign investors, and consequently

the factual circumstances of the case are in any event not directly relevant here.

The Parties also disagree on the content of the minimum standard of treatment. According to the
Claimant, the minimum standard of treatment is an “umbrella concept” which incorporates
different elements, the fair and equitable treatment standard being one of these elements. Citing
Pope & Talbot, the Claimant contends that the FTC Notes do not require that the reference to the
fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 1105(1) should be ignored; any other reading
would require “including” to be read as “excluding.” Moreover, according to the Claimant, the
content of the minimum standard of treatment is not static, but evolves over time with the
development of customary international law, as explained by Professor Dolzer in his expert

opinion.

The Respondent argues, in turn, that a breach of the minimum standard of treatment requires
“egregious” conduct, and while bad faith is not required to commit a breach, it will in practice
often be present. A ding to the Respond treaties ining “ ” fair and
equitable treatment standards are not evidence of State practice or opinio juris, and the expert
opinion of Professor Dolzer must therefore be rejected. Moreover, mere inconsistency with
domestic law or breach of contract is not sufficient to breach customary international law, nor are

NAFTA tribunals courts of appeal from decisions of domestic courts.

The Tribunal has carefully analyzed the Parties’ positions and considers that, when determining
the content of the standard of treatment contained in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA, it cannot
disregard the language of the provision. While the FTC in its Notes of Interpretation established
that the rule contained in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA, bearing the heading “Minimum Standard of
Treatment,” is the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, it does not follow
that the terms used in this provision have thereby become irrelevant; there is nothing in the FTC’s
Notes which would suggest that NAFTA tribunals should entirely disregard the relevant rules of
treaty interpretation. Indeed, there can be no “plain reading” of a treaty provision that would
involve no interpretation at all; “plain meaning” is in itself a result of interpretation.
Consequently, when determining the content of the standard of treatment contained in
Article 1105(1), the Tribunal must take into account both FTC’s Notes of Interpretation, which
establish that the standard contained in Article 1105(1) is indeed the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment, and the general rule of treaty interpretation, as reflected in
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which establishes that a treaty must be interpreted “in good
faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context

and in the light of its object and purpose.”

100

356.

357.

358.

As to the terms used, Article 1105(1) provides that each State party shall accord to investments
of investors of another party “treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and
equitable treatment and full protection and security.” Consequently, while keeping in mind that
the standard set out in the provision is the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment, the Tribunal must also take into account the express language of the provision, which
refers to “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security.” The Tribunal therefore
considers that the treatment required under Article 1105(1) is fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security consistent with the minimum standard of treatment under customary
international law. In other words, as stated by the FTC, the treatment required is not “in addition
to or beyond” that which is required by the customary international law standard, but one that is
in accordance, or consistent, with the standard, while remaining “fair and equitable” and

providing “full protection and security.”

In the present case, the Claimant argues that the Respondent is in breach of the “fair and equitable”
treatment component of the minimum standard of treatment, but does not allege that the
Respondent has failed to provide “full protection and security.” The Tribunal does not consider
it helpful, for purposes of determining the content of the “fair and equitable” treatment component
of the standard, to look for dictionary definitions of the terms used in Article 1105(1) — “fair” and
“equitable.” This is not only unhelpful as it would effectively result in replacing these terms with
other words which would then also have to be interpreted; but also because it would create the
risk that if the alleged breach were to be assessed in light of such other terms rather than the terms
actually used in Article 1105(1), the standard to be applied would not be the standard set out in
Article 1105(1), but another standard that might not be in accordance with the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment. The State parties to NAFTA must have
considered, when using the terms “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security,”
that it is these terms, and not any others, that best reflect the content of the minimum standard of
treatment set out in the provision. Nor can the FTC’s Notes of Interpretation be taken to mean
that a NAFTA tribunal must entirely disregard the terms “fair and equitable” and “full protection
and security” in Article 1105(1) when considering whether the customary international law

standard of treatment set out in the provision has been met.

Given that the Claimant invokes the “fair and equitable” treatment element, but not the “full
protection and security” element of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA, in support of its Article 1105
claim, the Tribunal must determine whether the Respondent’s conduct that the Claimant alleges
as a breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA may be considered “unfair” or “inequitable” in
accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. This

determination is best done, not in the abstract, but in the context of the facts of this particular case,

101

359.

taking into account the indirect evidence of the content of the customary international law

minimum standard of treatment as evidenced in the decisions of other NAFTA tribunals.

As noted above, this is also how other NAFTA tribunals have approached the issue. The Tribunal
agrees in particular with the Pope & Talbot tribunal, which stated:

“The [FTC] Interpretation concluded that Article 1105 prescribes the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of
treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of other Parties. The Interpretation
does not require that the concepts of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and
security’ be ignored, but rather that they be considered as part of the minimum standard of
treatment that it prescribes. Parenthetically, any other construction of the Interpretation
where by the fairness elements were treated as having no effect, would be to suggest that
the Commission required the word ‘including’ in Article 1105(1) to be read as ‘excluding.’
Such an approach has only to be stated to be rejected. Therefore, the Interpretation requires
each Party to accord to investments of investors of the other Parties the fairness elements
as subsumed in, rather than additive to, customary international law.””“*

360. Similarly, the Mondev tribunal observed:

361.

“When a tribunal is faced with the claim by a foreign investor that the investment has been
unfairly or inequitably treated or not accorded full protection and security, it is bound to
pass upon that claim on the facts and by application of any governing treaty provisions. A
judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on
the facts of the particular case. It is part of the essential business of courts and tribunals to
make judgments such as these. In doing so, the general principles referred to in Article
1105(1) and similar provisions must inevitably be interpreted and applied to the particular
facts.

[T]he FTC interpretation makes it clear that that in Article 1105(1) the terms ‘fair and
equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and security’ are, in the view of the NAFTA
Parties, references to existing elements of the customary international law standard and are
not intended to add novel elements to that standard. The word ‘including’ paragraph (1)
supports that conclusion. To say that these elements are included in the standard of
treatment under international law suggests that Article 1105 does not intend to supplement
or add to that standard. But it does not follow that the phrase ‘including fair and equitable
treatment and full protection and security’ adds nothing to the meaning of Article 1105(1),
nor did the FTC seek to read those words out of the article, a process which would have
involved amendment rather than interpretation.””°

The Tribunal underwrites all of these observations, including in particular the Mondev tribunal’s

observation that “[a] judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it

must depend on the facts of the particular case.””"° The Mondev tribunal rightly stressed that “[i]t
is part of the essential business of courts and tribunals to make judgments such as these;” and that
“TiJn doing so, the general principles referred to in Article 1105(1) and similar provisions must

inevitably be interpreted and applied to the particular facts.””"”

In other words, just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating (and not in its description), the
ultimate test of correctness of an interpretation is not in its description in other words, but in its

application on the facts.

The determination of whether the Respondent is in breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA

As summarized above, the Claimant contends that the Respondent breached Article 1105(1) of
NAFTA by imposing a moratorium on the development of offshore wind, which was contrary to
the representations and commitments made by the Respondent when encouraging the Claimant
to invest in the development of offshore wind in Ontario, and by failing to respect its promise to
ensure that the moratorium would not penalize the Claimant. The Claimant also contends that the
Respondent breached Article 1105(1) by treating other investors, specifically TransCanada and

Samsung, more favorably by offering them alternative projects.

The Respondent denies all of these allegations, contending that the development of offshore wind
was deferred in order to ensure that the regulatory framework would be backed by solid scientific
research. The Respondent acknowledges that the cost of offshore wind, and its impact on
ratepayers, was also a consideration when the decision to defer the development of offshore wind
was taken, but this was an entirely legitimate concern. The Respondent contends that, following
the moratorium, it took reasonable measures to accommodate the Claimant, but the Claimant
failed to pursue the available options and instead made unreasonable and unrealistic demands.

The Respondent also denies that there was any discrimination.

The Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence produced by the Parties surrounding the
moratorium and the subsequent conduct of the Parties, in order to determine whether

Article 1105(1) of NAFTA might have been breached.

The Tribunal notes that following the signing of the FIT Contract on 20 August 2010, the position
of the Government of Ontario grew gradually more ambiguous towards the development of

offshore wind. Thus, while the Government appears to have envisaged still in August 2010 that

the relevant regulatory framework, including the setback requirements, would be in place possibly
Po its position started changing in the
fall of 2010. This change appears to have coincided with the receipt and analysis of the
information generated through the EBR posting of 25 June 2010, which indicated an increasing

resistance to the development of offshore wind.” Thus, while the MOE in a workshop held on

il The briefing note specifically reported on the EBR comments, noting that two thirds

MNR and MEI officials an outline for a strategy for the development of offshore wind, which
stressed the need for further technical and environmental research, Po
fF but envisaged that “[t]he required research will not delay the implementation
of any off-shore wind projects.””*! On 7 December 2010, the officials of the MEI, MOE and
MNR met to discuss “ways to move away from the off-shore development,” while possibly going
ahead with the Windstream project as a pilot. It was noted that the OPA was considering its
options, including legal and financial risks “associated with not pursuing off-shore.””*

It does not appear from the evidence that the various options that were being considered and the
related concerns were communicated to Windstream, either at the meetings between the
government officials and Windstream representatives or otherwise. On 10 December 2010,
Windstream delivered a force majeure notice to the OPA, effective from 22 November 2010,
stating that MNR’s failure to proceed with the permitting process, in particular the site release

process, and MOE’s failure to take steps to implement its policy proposal to create an exclusion

On 6 January 2011, the representatives of MNR, MEI, MOE and the Premier’s Office held an
energy issues meeting. At the meeting, MEI made a presentation stating that, while there was
“significant potential for offshore wind development in the Great Lakes,” extensive offshore wind
development could have a “substantial impact” on electricity costs for Ontario consumers given
the prices paid for output, and that the EBR process had indicated that there were significant

concerns relating to the development of offshore wind power.’** i options were outlined for

the development of ofhore ind

On the following day, 7 January 2011, Minister of Environment Mr Wilkinson received a briefing
memorandum from his senior policy adviser Ms Brenda Lucas which updated the Minister on the

energy issues meeting that had taken place earlier during the day.”° The memorandum noted that

the “[d]irection from the meeting was to proceed with Po

for a follow-up meeting with the Deputy Minister of the Environment which took place either on
7 or 8 January 2011. At the meeting, Mr Wilkinson put questions to the Deputy Minister on a
number of issues, including the impact of the Project on drinking water, which the Deputy was
not able to answer. Mr Wilkinson testified that he then decided, on the spot, that he could not

accept the development of offshore wind development in the circumstances.

However, the evidence before the Tribunal suggests that Mr Wilkinson’s decision was not a
definitive one, or at least not effectively communicated within the Government of Ontario, or
even within MOE, as Ms Wallace testified at the hearing that she was not aware that any such

decision had been taken.” Subsequent communications between Ontario Government officials

provisions and the security deposits ... .”°

[Ian Baines of WWIS:] Now I understand you said that there is an announcement at 2
o’clock and the announcement will be that there will no offshore wind, so those two
statements are kind of at odds with each other. If the public is being told there is no offshore
wind, they’re going to assume there is no Wolf Island Shoals project and I am not sure how
a meeting is going to resolve that. We certainly can meet with you for clarification, but
what I am hearing very clearly is the project has been terminated by the government.

[Perry Cecchini of the OPA:] No you are not hearing that.

On the same day, the Ontario government issued a press release, announcing that it would not be
proceeding with offshore wind development,” and the MOE and MNR posted decision notices
to the same effect on Ontario’s Environmental Registry.”** There were no changes made to the
regulatory framework, including the REA Regulation and Wind Policy 4.10.04, which continued

to envisage the development of offshore wind.”

Starting in the spring of 2011 and continuing until 2012, several communications, meetings and
discussions took place between WWIS and the OPA, in an attempt to agree on the required
changes to the FIT Contract to reflect the moratorium. While the parties were able to agree on
waiving the OPA’s pre-NTP termination rights under Section 2.4(a) of the FIT Contract, and
although the OPA accepted WWIS’s force majeure claim retroactively from 22 November 2010,
the discussions did not produce an agreed outcome, nor did the OPA accept WWIS’s proposal to
convert the offshore wind project into a solar project. The Government also did not accept WWIS
proposal of 2 March 2012 to the Premier’s Office to designate the Project as an “active research
project” which would have left the moratorium in place, but would have addressed the science

questions raised in connection with the moratorium.

By 4 May 2012, the ongoing force majeure had delayed commercial operation for more than
24 months after the original MCOD, which in turn triggered the right of the OPA to unilaterally

terminate the FIT Contract. Consequently, in the absence of any further amendments to the FIT

Contract to address the suspension, as of this date the Project effectively became

non-financeable.””

On 17 October 2012, Windstream filed a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under
NAFTA Chapter 11.

The Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence before it, in order to determine whether the
Government of Ontario’s conduct during the relevant period could be characterized as unfair and
inequitable and thus in breach of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.
The Tribunal is unable to find that the Government of Ontario’s decision to impose a moratorium
on offshore wind development, or the process that led to it, were in themselves wrongful. The
Tribunal notes that, while the conduct of the Ontario Government during the period leading up to
the moratorium could have been more transparent, and although Windstream was kept in the dark
as to the evolving policy position of the Government while Windstream continued to invest in the
Project, the Government’s evolving position was at least in part driven by a genuine policy
concern that there was not sufficient scientific support for establishing an appropriate setback, or

exclusion zone, for offshore wind projects.

At the same time, however, the evidence before the Tribunal suggests that the decision to impose
the moratorium was not only driven by the lack of science. The impact of offshore wind on
electricity costs in Ontario, as well as the upcoming provincial elections in November 2011, also
appear to have influenced the decision, and the latter in particular in light of the public opposition
to offshore wind that had emerged during the relevant period in many parts of rural Ontario
(although not in Kingston, where the Project was located). Again, however, the Tribunal is unable
to find, on the basis of the evidence before it, that these concerns were the predominant reason
for the moratorium, or that the decision to impose the moratorium amounted to a breach of
Article 1105(1) of NAFTA just because the Government failed to communicate these other

concerns when imposing the moratorium.

As to the period following the moratorium, the Tribunal notes that, while the MOE developed

research plans relating to offshore wind,’””' and while it appears that the Government did conduct

Majeure, the Commercial Operation Date is delayed by such event(s) of Force Majeure for an aggregate of more
than 24 months after the original Milestone Date for Commercial Operation (prior to any extension pursuant to
Section 10.1(f), then notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, either Party may terminate this
‘Agreement upon notice to the other Party and without any costs or payments of any kind to either Party, and all

some studies,”

the Government on the whole did relatively little to address the scientific
uncertainty surrounding offshore wind that it had relied upon as the main publicly cited reason
for the moratorium. Indeed, many of the research plans did not go forward at all, including some
for lack of funding, and at the hearing counsel for the Respondent confirmed that Ontario did not
plan to conduct any further studies. Nor have the studies that have been conducted led to any

amendments to the regulatory framework.

Most importantly, the Government did little to address the legal and contractual limbo in which
Windstream found itself after the imposition of the moratorium. While the regulatory framework
continued to envisage the development of offshore wind, additional and more detailed regulations
governing offshore wind specifically were never developed. The Government let the OPA
conduct the negotiations with Windstream even if the decision on the moratorium had been taken
by the Government and not by the OPA, and without providing any direction to the OPA for the
negotiations although it had the authority to do so under the GEGEA (a power it had exercised
when introducing the FIT program). As a result, as the negotiations between the OPA and
Windstream failed to produce results, by May 2012 the Project had a reached a point at which it
was no longer financeable. Nonetheless, the Government failed to clarify the situation, either by
way of promptly completing the required scientific research and establishing the appropriate
regulatory framework for offshore wind and reactivating Windstream’s FIT Contract, or by
amending the relevant regulations so as to exclude offshore wind altogether as a source of
renewable energy and terminating Windstream’s FIT Contract in accordance with the applicable
law. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Government’s conduct vis-a-vis Windstream
during the period following the imposition of the moratorium was unfair and inequitable within

the meaning of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA.

The Tribunal concludes that the failure of the Government of Ontario to take the necessary
measures, including when necessary by way of directing the OPA, within a reasonable period of
time after the imposition of the moratorium to bring clarity to the regulatory uncertainty
surrounding the status and the development of the Project created by the moratorium, constitutes
a breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. It was indeed the Government of Ontario that imposed

the moratorium, not the OPA, so it cannot be said that the resulting regulatory and contractual

limbo was a result of the Claimant’s own failure to negotiate a reasonable settlement with the
OPA. The regulatory and contractual limbo in which the Claimant found itself in the years
following the imposition of the moratorium was a result of acts and omissions of the Government
of Ontario, and as such is attributable to the Respondent. The Tribunal therefore need not consider
whether the conduct of the OPA during the relevant period must also be considered attributable

to the Respondent.””

evidence before the Tribunal suggests that the Government expected that Windstream would
bring legal action to settle the consequences of the moratorium, which the Government was unable
to address within a reasonable period of time either by way of appropriate regulatory action or by

way of an appropriate direction to the OPA.

In light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent is in breach of Article 1105(1)
of NAFTA.

NAFTA ARTICLES 1102 AND 1103 — LESS FAVORABLE TREATMENT
The Claimant’s Position
Test for less favorable treatment

The Claimant argues that three elements must be established for a prima facie violation of
NAFTA Articles 1102 or 1103: “treatment,” “like circumstances” and “treatment less

”775 The Claimant submits that once it has established that it was afforded treatment

favorable.
less favorable than that accorded to national investors in like circumstances, the burden shifts to
the NAFTA Party to establish that the discriminatory treatment has a “reasonable nexus to rational
government policies that (1) do not distinguish, on their face or de facto, between foreign-owned
and domestic companies, and (2) do not otherwise unduly undermine the investment liberalizing

objectives of NAFTA.”””°

The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s contention that the procurement exception

contained in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a) forecloses Windstream’s claims based on Articles 1102

 

the Tribunal also need not consider whether an adverse inference should be drawn, as

requested by the Claimant, in light of the evidence that some of the emails relating to the Project may have been
intentionally deleted by officials of the Premier’s Office. See para. 173 above.

and 1103 because the FIT Program involved procurement by a State enterprise.””’ According to
the Claimant, it “never claimed that it was subject to less favourable treatment by the OPA in
connection with ‘the FIT Program,”” but its case is rather based on the less favorable treatment it
received “in connection with the means by which the Ontario Government implemented a
termination of “the various relevant projects.”””* Accordingly, “the relevant measure for the
purpose of the analysis under Article 1102 is the failure to keep Windstream ‘whole’ after the
moratorium was made,” which cannot be qualified as procurement.’ The Claimant points out
that “the procurement exception must be construed narrowly” as applying only to “the act of

“procuring” and that the Respondent provides no authority for a broader interpretation.”

In addition, the Claimant contends that “‘procurement’ does not extend to procurement of
electricity by the OPA for the purpose of reselling it to customers,” but only to “the obtaining of
title to or possession of a good or a service.””*! The Claimant points out that the UPS v. Canada
case relied on by the Respondent “did not involve procurement by a government for the purpose

of resale” and, therefore, “does not assist Canada’s argument.””*

The Respondent has accorded to the Claimant treatment that is less favorable than that
accorded to other entities in like circumstances

In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent’s treatment of Windstream was less favorable than its

. ae 3
treatment of TransCanada, a Canadian company, in like circumstances. ”**

The Claimant submits that TransCanada and Windstream were in like circumstances, as they were
both parties to power purchase agreements with the OPA that guaranteed them fixed prices for

785

electricity,” and since both contracts were under force majeure.”*° The Claimant contends that

both contracts had similar force majeure provisions™* and were terminated by Ontario “for
political reasons.””*”
The Claimant alleges that Ontario, having terminated TransCanada’s contract, kept it “whole”

“by awarding it a new project and compensating it for its costs associated with the

cancellation.””** By contrast, Ontario failed to do the same thing with regard to Windstream
following the moratorium.” According to the Claimant, “there can be no rational policy to

justify such discriminatory treatment of Windstream vis-a-vis TransCanada.”””°

The Claimant also submits that the Respondent’s treatment of Windstream was less favorable
than its treatment of Samsung, a South Korean company, in like circumstances.” Referring to
the solar project that Windstream proposed to the OPA,”” the Claimant alleges that Windstream
and Samsung were in like circumstances “as two possible recipients of contracts to develop the
solar project.””°> While Ontario offered Samsung a FIT Contract “for the very solar project that
Windstream proposed following the moratorium,” no such contract was offered to the

795

Claimant.” Consequently, the Claimant alleges, an investor of a third party’ received better

treatment than Windstream.””°

Moreover, according to the Claimant, the Respondent has allowed every other developer of a
large wind project that was awarded a FIT Contract at the same time as the Claimant to develop
its project and receive the benefits of its FIT Contract, unimpeded by the Government or by any
moratorium. As the only developer of an offshore wind project that was awarded a FIT Contract,
the Claimant argues that it was singled out and prevented from receiving the benefit of its FIT
Contract when all other developers of large-scale wind projects who were awarded a FIT Contract

have been allowed to proceed through the regulatory process.””

The Respondent’s Position

Articles 1102 and 1103 of NAFTA do not apply because the challenged measures involve
procurement

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal should dismiss the Claimant’s arguments because they
are precluded by Article 1108(7)(a) of NAFTA, which expressly preserves the NAFTA parties’
right to pursue policy objectives in carrying out procurement programs, even when doing so

amounts to discriminatory treatment.”* The Respondent argues that the FIT Program and the

measures taken by Ontario involve procurement and that the procurement at issue in this

arbitration is “by a Party or state enterprise.”*”°

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant’s suggested narrow interpretation of the
procurement exception in Article 1108 should be rejected.’ The Respondent considers that the
term “procurement” must be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning and in light of
its object and purpose; accordingly, Article 1108 applies whenever the impugned measures
“involve the acquisition of products or services by a [State] Party or State enterprise.”*”

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s proposition that the procurement exception does
not apply to the subsequent treatment applied to an investor under the procurement contract and
that, as a result, Article 1108 does not apply to the Respondent’s failure to keep the Claimant
“whole” and the “cancelation” of the Claimant’s Contract.*? The Respondent contends that
“procurement” under Article 1108 includes “all aspects of a procurement process, including any

stoppage of it or other decisions related to it.”**

Finally, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that “procurement” does not cover the
“procurement of electricity by the OPA with the purpose of reselling it to the customers.”*”>
According to the Respondent, there is nothing in the language of Article 1108 that excludes
procurement for the resale to the public.*”° The Respondent relies on the ADF and UPS decisions,
considering that neither tribunal required that the government (as opposed to the public) be the

owner or possessor of the procured goods or service.*””

The Claimant bears the burden of establishing the essential elements of Articles 1102 and
1103

The Respondent notes that the Claimant bears the burden to show that: (i) the government
accorded both the Claimant and the comparators “treatment with respect to the establishment,
acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition” of their
respective investment; (ii) the government accorded the alleged treatment “in like circumstances;”

and (iii) the treatment accorded to the Claimant or its investments was “less favourable” than the

treatment accorded to the comparator investors or investments. *”

More specifically, the
Respondent submits that the Claimant must show that “there was any nationality-based
discrimination.”*” According to the Respondent, the Claimant failed to identify “how the
treatment it received was as a result of nationality-based discrimination.”*"”

The Respondent submits that even if the Tribunal does not agree that the Claimant’s Article 1102
and Article 1103 claims are barred by the procurement exemption in Article 1108(7)(a), they
should still be dismissed because the Claimant has failed to identify treatment accorded in like

circumstances.*!!

The Claimant has failed to identify comparators that are accorded treatment “in like
circumstances”

The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s investment was accorded treatment in its capacity as
a participant in the FIT Program, a standardized renewable energy procurement program
specifically designed to achieve certain public policy objectives.*'? According to the Respondent,
“the standardized features of the FIT Program and the underlying policy objective are wholly
different from the RFP [request for proposals] for a gas-fired plant, which resulted in
TransCanada’s contract, and the GEIA [Green Energy Investment Agreement], the investment
agreement pursuant to which Samsung is accorded treatment.”*!3 The Respondent points out that
neither TransCanada nor Samsung participated in the FIT Program, and that neither of them

applied for Crown land to develop an offshore wind facility.*'

In sum, the Respondent argues that none of the comparators identified by the Claimant was an
offshore wind proponent and that neither TransCanada nor Samsung were “in like circumstances”
to the Claimant.*'> According to the Respondent, the Claimant conflates “treatment and the
circumstances in which it was accorded,” thus “effectively strik[ing] the like circumstances

requirement from Articles 1102 and 1103.”*!

circumstances

399. The Respondent notes that the Claimant seeks to distinguish itself from other offshore wind
proponents on the basis that it was the only offshore wind proponent that was offered a FIT
Contract.*'7 However, in the Respondent’s view, this “does not justify its attempt to ignore an

entire class of comparators who are in more like circumstances in favour of remote

comparators.”*'*

400. Given that the Claimant was the only offshore wind proponent to receive a FIT Contract, the

Respondent submits that the better class of comparators is other offshore wind proponents who

9

were affected by the moratorium.*’” Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that the treatment

accorded to the Claimant is not so much less favorable as different compared with that accorded

to TransCanada.*””

401. The Respondent argues that, when compared to other offshore wind proponents, the Claimant
received more favorable treatment than investors “in like circumstances.”*”! While all other
Crown land applications for offshore wind development were cancelled, the Claimant’s Crown

land application was only “frozen,” thus keeping the Claimant’s Project alive.*?

investments of investors of a NAFTA party “be accorded the best or most favorable treatment
given to any national or third State investor or investment.”**° The appropriate comparison should
be “between the treatment accorded to the NAFTA Party’s investment or investor and a national
or third State investment or investor in like circumstances.”*””

According to the United States, “circumstances” mean the “conditions or facts that accompany
treatment as opposed to the treatment itself.”*”* Consequently, Articles 1102 and 1103 require,
among other characteristics, consideration of the regulatory framework and policy objectives as
well as the business sector.*? In comparing the claimant with investors or investments in like
circumstances, the national or third State investor or investment must be the same “in all relevant
respects but for nationality of ownership.”*”

The United States also submits that the Claimant’s Article 1102 and 1103 claims are barred by
the procurement exception in Article 1108(7) of NAFTA. When interpreted in accordance with
its ordinary meaning, as required by the Vienna Convention,**! the exception in Article 1108(7)

The Claimant notes, in response to the United States’ contention that “Article 1102 and 1103

repeatedly held that the claimant is not required to demonstrate discriminatory intent in order to

TransCanada in like circumstances.” Specifically, Windstream need not establish that it was

treated less favorably because of its status as a foreign investor.**

The Claimant did not submit any reply on the United States’ submissions on Article 1108(7).

The Respondent’s reply to the submission of the United States

According to Canada, all NAFTA parties agree that “NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 prohibit

nationality-based discrimination.” **°

Canada adds that “simply establishing that there are
distinctions made between investors or that such distinctions result in less favourable treatment
of a foreign investor is not sufficient to establishing a breach of the NAFTA’s non-discriminatory
provisions.”**” According to Canada, “[t]he onus is on the Claimant to establish all of the

elements required to establish a breach of the nondiscriminatory provisions.”***

The Respondent did not submit any reply on the United States’ submissions on Article 1108(7).

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The relevant provisions of NAFTA, Articles 1102 and 1103, deal with national treatment and
most-favored-nation treatment, respectively. These provisions apply to both investors and
investments “with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct,
operation, and sale or other disposition of investments,”**? insofar as the relevant investors and

investments are “in like circumstances.”

The Parties disagree on a number of issues, including whether the Claimant can be considered to
have been in “like circumstances” to TransCanada and Samsung, as well as whether the
Claimant’s claims are excluded by virtue of the procurement exception in Article 1108(7)(a) of
NAFTA, which provides that “Articles 1102, 1103 and 1107 do not apply to ... procurement by

a Party or a State enterprise.”

The Claimant argues that the Respondent’s treatment of Windstream was less favorable than that
of TransCanada, a Canadian company, and that the two companies were “‘in like circumstances.”
Similarly, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s treatment of Windstream was less favorable

than that of Samsung, a South Korean company, which also was allegedly “in like circumstances.”

The Claimant further contends that every other developer of large-scale wind projects that had

been awarded a FIT Contract at the same time as the Claimant was allowed to develop its projects.

The Respondent, in turn, contends that the Claimant’s investment was accorded treatment in its
capacity as a participant in the FIT Program, a renewable energy procurement program with
standardized rules, prices and contracts. However, TransCanada and Samsung were not “in like
circumstances” as they had made their investment in an entirely different legal context and neither
had applied for Crown land to develop an offshore wind facility. TransCanada’s contract was
issued pursuant to a request for proposals (“RFP”) for a gas-fired plant, and thus did not involve
renewable energy, whereas Samsung had entered into an investment agreement, the Green Energy
Investment Agreement, with the Ontario Government for the construction of 2,500 MW

renewable energy generation project consisting of both wind and solar power.

Having considered the Parties’ positions and the supporting evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied
that the treatment accorded to the Claimant cannot be considered to have been in “like
circumstances.” Unlike TransCanada and Samsung, the Claimant had a FIT Contract for offshore
wind development, and indeed it was the only holder of such a contract. Accordingly, the
moratorium and the related measures did not apply to TransCanada and Samsung in the first place,
which therefore were not affected by them. The Tribunal further notes that the moratorium only
applied to offshore wind and that it was not applied in a non-discriminatory manner in that it
resulted in the cancellation of all offshore wind projects, with the exception of that of the
Claimant, which was the only holder of a FIT Contract. The Tribunal is therefore unable to agree
that the Claimant was treated less favorably than other prospective developers of offshore wind

projects, which were the only proponents that could be said to have been in “like circumstances.”

In the circumstances, the Tribunal need not consider whether the procurement exception in
Article 1108(7)(a) of NAFTA applies to the procurement of electricity by the OPA for purposes

of resale in the Ontario electricity market.

The Claimant’s claims for breach of Articles 1102 and 1103 of NAFTA therefore stand to be

dismissed.

THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED BY THE CLAIMANT

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

 

The Applicable Legal Standards

The Claimant contends that it is entitled to damages in an amount sufficient to wipe out all the
economic losses suffered by it as a result of Canada’s NAFTA breaches, as calculated in the
expert reports of Messrs Richard Taylor and Robert Low of Deloitte (the “Deloitte reports”).
In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent’s imposition of the moratorium together with its failure
to meet its promise in keeping the Claimant whole rendered the Claimant’s investment effectively

worthless.**!

The Claimant argues that, because NAFTA does not describe a method for determining reparation
for illegal acts, customary international law applies. The proper authority on this issue is the
Chorzéw Factory decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice,’ which established
that a State responsible for an illegal act “must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences
of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would in all probability have existed if the

act had not been committed.”*"*

As to the date for calculating damages, the Claimant takes the view that in cases of unlawful
expropriations an investor can choose between the date of the expropriation and the date on which

a tribunal renders its award.“

Contrary to the Respondent’s submission,“ the Claimant
contends that it is not relevant whether NAFTA tribunals have adopted this approach.“ The
Claimant explains that NAFTA tribunals have “considerable discretion in fashioning what they
believe to be reasonable approaches to damages.”**” Accordingly, the Tribunal has discretion in
following the decisions of other tribunals establishing that the Claimant may choose either the
date of breach or the date of the award as a valuation date.“* According to the Claimant, the right
to choose between calculating damages based on the date of the breach and calculating damages

based on the date of the award “applies equally to damages arising from Canada’s breaches of

Articles 1105(1), 1102 and 1103.”*? In this context, the Claimant takes the position that the
appropriate valuation date is the date of the award.**’ At the same time, the Claimant also
advances its alternative position that the appropriate valuation date is 22 May 2012, which is the

date of the breach.**!

As to a breach of Article 1105(1), the Claimant submits that it is entitled to be put in the position
in which it would have been had the moratorium not been imposed or had the Respondent kept it

852

whole for the imposition of the moratorium."*” According to the Claimant, “the result is the same”

and it is “entitled to be put in the position it would have been in had the moratorium not been

imposed, whichever is higher.”***

As to the alleged breach of Article 1102, the Claimant submits that it is “entitled to be put in the
same position it would have been in had Ontario treated Windstream the same a[s] it treated
TransCanada,” namely by keeping it whole following the moratorium. According to the
Claimant, the “damages resulting from Canada’s breach of Article 1102 are the same as its

damages resulting from Canada’s breach of Article 1105(1).”***

Finally, as to the alleged breach of Article 1103, the Claimant contends that it is entitled to be put
in the position in which it would have been had the Respondent awarded the solar project to the
Claimant instead of Samsung.** The Claimant submits that calculating the damages arising from
a breach of Article 1103 “would involve an alternate DCF [Discounted Cash Flow] analysis,”
which it has not performed, but proposes to prepare it if “the Tribunal were to dismiss
Windstream’s claims for breaches of Articles 1110, 1105(1) and 1102 but allow Windstream’s

claim for breach of Article 1103.8

The Discounted Cash Flow Method is Appropriate

The Claimant submits that the appropriate method for calculating damages in this case, in which
the “investment has been rendered substantially worthless,” is the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”)
method that allows one “to determine the value the investment would have had ‘but for’ the illegal

act.”*7 The Claimant explains that this method measures the “present value of the future cash

and that it is deemed

appropriate when the projected cash flows are capable of determination and are not speculative.*°

424. Contrary to the Respondent’s contention,**' the Claimant asserts that its hypothetical cash flows
from the Project can be determined with a reasonable degree of certainty.*°? The Claimant

submits that the Project would more likely than not have achieved commercial operation and even

863

generated revenues, but for the moratorium.*°’ According to the Claimant, the Project did not

face significant regulatory risks* and would have received the required approvals.*® The

Claimant also argues that it would also have received tenure to the Crown land necessary to

867 868

develop the Project,*®° which was technically feasible*” and financeable.

425. The Claimant further points out that the cash flows from the Project “can be forecast with a
relatively high degree of confidence,” because “(i) the price per kilowatt for electricity sold by
the Project is established by contract, (ii) the Project’s projected electricity output can be
reasonably estimated on the basis of numerous high-quality and independently prepared wind
resource assessments, (iii) the majority of the Project’s capital costs and operating costs would
have been contractual and therefore can be determined using benchmark data, and (iv)
engineering for the Project would not have involved the use of any novel technology.”*” In any
event, the DCF methodology accounts for future uncertainties and risks through the application
of an appropriate discount rate.“”? The Claimant emphasizes that, as a consequence, tribunals
have accepted the DCF methodology in a number of cases involving projects or companies that

faced future risks.*”

Specifically, tribunals have considered the DCF methodology as appropriate even in the absence
of a proven record of profitability when a long-term contract or concession guaranteed a certain

level of profits, which is the case here.*”

By contrast, the Claimant asserts that the cases relied
on by the Respondent to show that the DCF methodology is not appropriate are not relevant to
the present situation, because none of them involved an investment with a contract providing for

a fixed revenue stream.*”

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the OPA and the Respondent themselves have used the
DCF methodology to determine the respective net present values of TransCanada’s cancelled
gas-fired power plant project and of the replacement project that it was awarded,’ even though

at the time these projects were valued they had not yet received all the required approvals.*”°

The Comparable Transaction Methodology as an Alternative Approach

In the event that the Tribunal rejects the DCF method, the Claimant suggests that the comparable
transaction approach, which “determines project value on the basis of transactions involving
projects at a similar stage of development” would be “the second most-appropriate
methodology.”*”* According to the Claimant, this approach is “appropriate to determine the value
of Windstream’s investments because precedent transaction multiples would reflect value
attributed to the FIT Contract and turbine contracts and other characteristics of the Project, such
as wind data and resource assessments, seismic, engineering and electrical interconnection

work."877

By contrast, the Claimant contends that the Investment Value approach proposed by the

t*”* severely undervalues the Claimant’s investment.” Referring to Deloitte’s expert

Respondent
report, the Claimant argues that the Investment Value approach is inappropriate because it
ascribes no value to the FIT Contract, which according to the Claimant is its most valuable
asset.**? Specifically, the Claimant points to market research conducted by Deloitte to establish

that FIT Contracts have significant value beyond the investment costs associated with project

Contract is a valuable asset.**?

4. Quantification of the Claimant’s Losses

430. The Claimant has quantified its losses under two scenarios, namely (a) “in the event that the
Tribunal finds the moratorium to be a breach of Articles 1101, 1105 or 1102 of NAFTA” and (b)
“in the event that the Tribunal finds the moratorium did not breach Articles 1110, 1105 or 1102

of NAFTA, but the failure to keep Windstream whole following the imposition of the moratorium

constituted a breach of these articles.”***

431. For each of these scenarios, the Claimant has quantified its losses using the DCF method based
on a valuation date of (a) 22 May 2012 and (b) 19 June 2015 (the latter being the date of Deloitte’s
second report).*** The Claimant considers the former date to be “the date of breach.”*** The
Claimant explains that “the Project became substantially worthless on the date on which it was

no longer possible for the Project to reach commercial operation before triggering the OPA’s

29886

termination rights under Section 10.1(g) of the FIT Contract,”*”° adding that “this occurred as of

May 22, 2012.88’ The Claimant therefore contends that it is entitled to damages calculated on

the basis of 22 May 2012 or on the basis of the date of the award, whichever amount is higher.***

(a) Valuation “but for” the moratorium

432. According to the Claimant, its calculations in the scenario “but for” the moratorium are based on
“reasonable assumptions about the Project’s development, construction and operation” if no
moratorium had been imposed, the Project had been “permitted to proceed through the regulatory

approvals process unimpeded by regulatory delays,” “the Ontario Government [had] fulfilled its

connection with Windstream’s investments.”**? In particular, the Claimant has assumed that:

(a) “MOE would have confirmed its proposed regulatory amendment to include a five-
kilometer setback, or confirmed that it would not proceed with any regulatory
amendment (such that setbacks for offshore wind projects would continue to be
assessed on a site-specific basis);

MNR would have fulfilled its commitment to discuss the reconfiguration of
Windstream’s applications for Crown land for the Project (if a five-kilometer setback
was confirmed), and would have thereafter fulfilled its commitment to ‘move as
quickly as possible through the remainder of the application review process so that
[WWIS] may obtain Applicant of Record status in a timely manner.”

MOE and MNR would have fulfilled their commitment to process WWIS’ application
for a REA within the six-month service guarantee;

MNR would have permitted Windstream to proceed through MNR’s Crown land
application process and granted Windstream site release; and

the Ontario Government would have dealt with Windstream in good faith and not have
subjected the Project to unreasonable regulatory delays.”*””

analysis of the Respondent’s expert URS, on which the Respondent relies,*” is flawed in that it
“incorrectly assumes that the Project was ‘first of a kind’ and therefore faced considerable
uncertainty,” failing to appreciate that the Project utilizes pre-existing, proven technology
borrowed from other industries that are neither novel nor present any technical challenges. URS
also “incorrectly presents generic development risks ... as extraordinary risks for the Project,”
overestimates the length of time it takes to complete field studies, “incorrectly concludes that
numerous Project activities would occur in sequence, when in fact they would occur in parallel,”
“incorrectly assumes that only a single construction vessel spread would have been used in
support of foundation installation,” fails to appreciate the advantage this Project had over others
in being able to use readily-available vessels that currently exist on the market to construct the
foundations, and “incorrectly concludes that Windstream’s project team lacked sufficient
experience to bring the Project into commercial operation,” among other things.””

The Claimant also contends that the Respondent’s expert report overstates the construction,
design and permitting risks of the Project,’ pointing out that all of these are risks that “more
likely than not, would have been managed by the experienced development team created by
Windstream.”” The Claimant notes that its schedule had a 10% contingency for mechanical
failure built into it which is both a standard and conservative estimate as well as contingency for
weather. °’> In any event, the Claimant points out that the possibility that the Project may not
achieve the relevant milestones has been “expressly accounted for in the discount rate applied to
determine the net present value of the Project.” The Claimant concludes that “the project was
buildable; the timelines were achievable; and that the project, more likely than not, would have
succeeded had the moratorium not been imposed upon it.”°*>

Assuming a five-kilometer setback was implemented, the Claimant quantifies the value of its
investment using the DCF method as between CAD 277.8 million and 369.5 million based on a
valuation date of 22 May 2012; and between CAD 459.5 million and 565.5 million based on a
valuation date of 19 June 2015.°°

Valuation “but for” the Respondent’s failure to insulate the Claimant from the effects of
the moratorium

In the event that the Tribunal does not find the Respondent in breach for imposing the moratorium,
the Claimant claims compensation for the Respondent’s breach in failing to insulate the Claimant
from the effects of the moratorium.*” The alternative “but-for” scenario assumed by the Claimant

to calculate the damages arising from this failure is one in which:

(a

“the FIT Contract remained under force majeure for the duration of the moratorium

without triggering any termination right by the OPA;

the Ontario Government completed the research it deemed necessary in good faith and

in a timely manner;

(c) the Government lifted the moratorium within a reasonable period of time —
Windstream has assumed a three-year moratorium imposed between February 11,
2011 and February 11, 2014;

(d) the Project would be permitted to resume development in February 2014;

(e) by that time, MNR would have fulfilled its commitment to discuss the reconfiguration
of Windstream’s applications for Crown land for the Project (if a five-kilometre
setback was confirmed), and would have thereafter fulfilled its commitment to ‘move
as quickly as possible through the remainder of the application review process so that
[WWIS] may obtain Applicant of Record status in a timely manner;’

(f) MOE and MNR would have fulfilled their commitment to process WWIS’ application

for a REA within the six-month service guarantee; and

award of interest is “to compensate the damage resulting from the fact that, during the period of
non-payment by the debtor, the creditor is deprived of the use and disposition of that sum he was
supposed to receive.”*"” In relying on the Chorzéw Factory principle, the Claimant proposes the
use of compound interest, as opposed to simple interest.’'* In the Claimant’s view, the awarding
of compound interest reflects the actual damages suffered, thereby guaranteeing full reparation.°!”

By contrast, the Claimant points out that the Respondent’s view that the Claimant has the burden

to prove that the present circumstances justify the awarding of interest”? is unsupported by any

authority.°?!

responsibility became engaged’” and should be annually compounded “until the date of full

payment of the award.””” In the event that the Tribunal establishes the date of the breach as the

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION
The Claimant Bears the Burden of Proof

The Respondent points out that, for the Claimant to be able to claim damages, it needs to prove

that the alleged NAFTA breaches caused it actual and specific loss.°™

According to the
Respondent, the Claimant fails to meet this burden of proof, since “[t]he Project has never been

anything more than a speculative and unrealistic venture” with “no material value in the market

place,” and “what Windstream considered its most valuable asset, the FIT Contract, turned out to
be an insurmountable hurdle.”””’ As a consequence, the Respondent takes the view that “not only
should the Claimant be unable to recover any damages for its alleged future lost profits, it would
also be inappropriate for the Tribunal to award the Claimant any of its investment costs.”°* The
Respondent submits that a claim for lost profits must be grounded upon appropriate data which

can be known with a sufficient degree of certainty.”*!

The Respondent points out that the Claimant “significantly [altered] its programme and schedule”
in its Reply submission, thus demonstrating that the Claimant’s original planning suffered from
deficiencies, a “lack of preparatory work,” and an “underestimation ... of the complexities
associated with a project of this magnitude.””*? The Respondent claims that “[t]hrough the 2015
redesign of its Project, the Claimant has tacitly admitted that its initial plans would have resulted
in Project failure.””** According to the Respondent, the “Claimant should not get the benefit of
information and analysis only available in 2015 to prove in hindsight that its Project had value”
and the Project’s feasibility should rather “be assessed as it was planned by Windstream in
2010/2011.”°3" In any event, the Respondent suggests that “[e]ven under the new 2015
programme, the Claimant would not have been able to develop its Project in the timelines required

by its FIT Contract.”?°5

The Respondent also criticizes the Claimant’s calculation of damages for a breach of Article 1102
of NAFTA, arguing that “the Claimant has made no effort to explain how there is a causal link
between the treatment accorded to TransCanada and the fact that the Claimant could not bring its
Project into commercial operation.”**° As to the alleged breach of Article 1103 of NAFTA, the
Respondent points out that “the Claimant did not even attempt to quantify the losses it allegedly

3993
suffered.””*”

Valuation Date

The Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s assertion that it is entitled to choose between a

valuation as of the alleged expropriation date and a valuation as of the date of the award.” The

Respondent takes the position that “the only relevant date is the date of the breach.””?? The
Respondent’s expert used 22 May 2012 as the valuation date for most of its analysis, except for
one of the alleged breaches of Article 1105 of NAFTA, where 11 February 2011 was used.™° In
doing so, the Respondent contends that the Claimant fails to rely on any NAFTA award or
justification to support its approach.' According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s reliance on
Feldman and S.D. Myers is inappropriate because neither of these decisions involves damages
claims based on expropriation.” The Respondent also stresses that “it should not be for the
Claimant to, on one hand reap the benefits of an increase, while on the other hand, if the value of
the investment has decreased ... ask for the higher valuation on the date of expropriation.””*

According to the Respondent, “[iJn the end, the Tribunal need not even engage in such an
analysis,” since the “Claimant cannot point to any factual events that demonstrate a change in
value of the Project” and the difference in the Claimant’s calculations based on the two dates

“relates only to the different time value of money, not any other factor."

No Evidence of Damage as a Result of the Deferral

The Respondent submits that the Claimant fails to distinguish the damages arising out of the mere
imposition of the deferral itself from those derived from the failure to lift the deferral.°**
According to the Respondent, this means that the Claimant has not provided a but-for scenario

for the Tribunal.°“°

As to the Claimant’s calculations of damages for an alleged breach of Article 1105 of NAFTA
based on the decision to defer offshore wind projects, the Respondent claims that “the Claimant’s
use of May 22, 2012 for the valuation date ... is entirely misguided” and that the appropriate date
would have been the “project restart date” of 11 February 2011.” The Respondent also argues
that “[b]y the Claimant’s own logic ... a deferral that was lifted any time before May 22, 2012

would not have caused the Claimant to lose the full value of its Project,” yet “the Claimant offers

no valuation ... that demonstrates what loss the Claimant would have incurred if the deferral had
99948

been of a shorter duration.
The Respondent submits that, by the time the decision to defer offshore wind projects was made,
the Claimant’s Project already had no market value since the Project would not have been able to
reach Commercial Operation within the time frames outlined in the FIT Contract.” According
to the Respondent, a project that could not be built prior to the OPA having an unfettered right to

terminate the FIT Contract has no value.”

The Respondent highlights “considerable problems” regarding the Claimant’s project schedule,
claiming in particular that it appeared to “underestimate the risks of certain activities in
development and their influence on ability to secure financing to enable the Project to progress to
its next stage,””*! and that it did “not provide for any contingency to take into account any delays
in the Project,” nor “take into account adequate time to construct and establish the foundation

952

manufacturing facility.””°~ Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant did not provide

adequate timing for the initial field studies and “additional fieldwork following confirmation of

19953

the final layout. These scheduling problems, not the deferral decision, resulted in the

Claimant’s deprivation of the Project’s investment value.

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant’s revised programme still “remains
unreasonably optimistic and fails to adequately account for possible risks that could result in
Project delays,” and that the Claimant’s attempt “to remedy the mistakes in the Claimant’s
original programme ... has resulted in new errors and incorrect assumptions.” °! The
Respondent’s expert Green Giraffe indicates that the combination of assumptions that the
Claimant makes is absolutely unrealistic.’ In particular, the Respondent suggests that “the new
programme ... does not follow the proper sequencing of events based on the FIT Contract itself,
Ontario law, or that of the Claimant’s own experts,” and that it clearly “has been created solely
for the purpose of this arbitration ..., not for the purpose of realistically determining how long it

would have taken to actually develop and construct the Claimant’s Project.”°*°

According to the Respondent, even under the revised programme, the Claimant would still have

failed to develop the Project within the required timelines due to the considerable risks faced by

well as other various project risks."°” The Respondent also refers to development risks,’”’ risks
relating to Crown land access,” permitting and design,’ project viability risks®® as well as
967

construction risks involving manufacturing facilities, procurement, and vessel availability.

The Respondent relies on URS’s proposed adjusted programme schedule to show that the
Claimant could not have brought the Project into Commercial Operation “more than two and a
half years following the MCOD required by the Claimant’s FIT Contract, and over a year
following the Supplier Default Date.”*°* The Respondent explains that:

“when the relevant adjustments are made to the Claimant’s proposed schedule to take in
into account the advice of its own experts,” the binding procurement lead times under the
[Turbine Sales Agreement],°”’ an appropriate time for mobilization following the lifting of
the deferral,°’! the appropriate time to complete the permitting process,” and the lead time
for financial closure,°” the relevant time to construct the onshore manufacturing
facilities,” foundation manufacture,’”> and installation,°”° the construction of offshore
electrical substation,” turbine erection’”* and commissioning,” the result is that the
Claimant’s Project would not have reached Commercial Operation until August 2018°°° at
the earliest.”

The Respondent further submits that, in light of the speculative nature of the Project as well as
the associated risks, “as a matter of law” the application of the DCF method is not an appropriate

way to value the Claimant’s investment.’*' In the event that the Tribunal finds that the harm

suffered by the Claimant was the result of the alleged breach, the Claimant should only be entitled
to receive the value of its investment cost.’ Tribunals have consistently confirmed that “where
an investment is still in the preoperational stage or has no history of profits, awarding any amount
for future profits would require an impermissible degree of speculation.””**

According to the Respondent, the existence of a FIT Contract does not provide a guarantee that
the Claimant’s Project would reach Commercial Operation and generate revenue.”*’ Taking into
account “the speculative nature of the project, its undeveloped status, the lack of permitting, the
known development and construction risks, questions around whether it could attract necessary
investors and financing, and the speculative cost profile, there is no reason why the Tribunal
should vary from a well-established approach to damages in the circumstances of this particular
case.”**> The Respondent further rejects the Claimant’s characterization of Canada’s position on
the basis that BRG itself used the DCF methodology, pointing out that BRG only uses this
methodology to show that even if it is used the Project had no value.”*° The Respondent’s expert
considers the DCF methodology involves too many subjective adjustments for the purpose of

ing damages°*’ and it does not capture risk properly in an early-stage development

project

In addition, the Respondent takes the view that the Claimant’s assertion that it accounted for the
Project risks in its DCF analysis is not supported.’ Thus the Respondent highlights that
“Deloitte’s lack of appropriate risk quantification leads to the absurd conclusion that Windstream
is entitled to a 1,300% return on the money it alleges to have invested to date.””””

The Respondent further disputes the relevance of the authorities relied on by the Claimant in this
context. The Respondent points out that the tribunal in Anatolie Stati v. Kazakhstan held that a
claim for lost profits needs to meet a “high standard of proof”®’! and that a claim for lost

According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to meet the burden to show that, despite the
construction and development risks associated with the Project, profits would have been
realized.°”? The Respondent further asserts that the commercial risks involved in Karaha Bodas
v. PLN are distinguishable from the project risks in the present case." Similarly, the Claimant’s
FIT Contract is distinguishable from the contract in Joan Micula v. Romania because the Claimant
does not have a “guaranteed revenue stream or level of profit.”°°> Moreover, none of the present
circumstances are analogous to the circumstances in Khan Resources v. Mongolia that supported
an award in favor of the claimant.”

As to the Claimant’s argument that the OPA relied on the DCF methodology in the context of the
TransCanada project, the Respondent points out that “TransCanada’s project ... was proceeding
through a well-established regulatory process for a well-known technology” and that,
consequently, “the speculation that makes the DCF methodology inappropriate for the Claimant’s

Project did not apply to the valuation of a gas-fired plant.”°””

The Respondent further notes that, at the time of the execution of the FIT Contract, the Claimant
had no permitting or Crown land access.”* The Claimant had also failed to conduct any necessary
environmental studies.” The Claimant had only applied for an AOR status, an application that
provided no guarantee that the Project would be developed.' In these circumstances the Project
would not have any material value.'°’! The Respondent further disputes the Claimants assertion
that a comparable transactions approach would confirm its valuation using the DCF method,

arguing that “real world experience” indicates the opposite.'"

According to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal accepts the DCF as the appropriate
methodology, “Deloitte’s failure to account for development and construction risks, as well as
various errors and incorrect assumptions in its analysis, cause Deloitte to drastically overvalue
the Project,” leading it to a value that “is not in line with the real world.”!°"? Once the necessary
corrections are made for these errors and assumptions, a DCF valuation reveals that in February

2011 the Project was already worthless.'0*

464. The Respondent highlights the following assumptions as sources of errors in Deloitte’s

465.

calculations:

a.  Deloitte’s “minimal adjustment” for risk, which is “not adequate to reflect the real risk
faced by the Project.”!

b. Deloitte’s inappropriate choice of a valuation date.'°°°

c. Deloitte’s misplaced assumption that a Turbine Sales Agreement (“TSA”) '7
concluded between the Claimant and Siemens in November 2011 providing for the
supply of 130 turbines for the Project at a price “slightly higher’!””* than CAD 700
million would have been renegotiated!” to a lower price.'°"? The Respondent points
out that the Claimant has failed to provide any evidence to that effect. '°"
Additionally, according to the Respondent, Deloitte erred in relying on European
(instead of North American) market costs for assessing costs associated with the
turbines.'°?

. eloitte’s numerous other errors and omissions, “including with respect to the base
d.  Deloitt th d lud. ith t to the b
land rent and decommissioning costs.”!°"3

According to the Respondent, once all these errors and unreasonable assumptions are corrected,

the result is a “net negative value for the Project on the valuation date.”!°"

No Evidence of Damage as a Result of the Failure to Lift the Deferral or Insulate the
Claimant from the Effects of the Deferral

466. The Respondent argues that it was impossible for the Respondent to cause any damage to the

Claimant because the Claimant’s Project already had no market value on the purported valuation
date, 22 May 2012. By this date, it was “a foregone conclusion” that the Project would fail to
meet the time frames specified in the FIT Contract, and “because of its riskiness and its high

costs.”10!5

been in had Ontario kept the Claimant’s FIT Contract ‘frozen’ during the deferral.”'°' The
Respondent claims that “the correct ‘but for’ scenario is the same as that used if the failure to lift

the deferral by May 22, 2012 is seen as the breach.”!"!”

468. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the same development and construction risks that apply
for the 11 February 2011 scenario also apply to this scenario.'°"* In both scenarios, the Claimant
would have failed to bring the Project into Commercial Operation by the time frames required by
the FIT Contract.'"'? According to the Respondent, the delay in the Project restart date from
11 February 2011 to 22 May 2012 means that the Project would not have reached Commercial

Operation until 28 October 2019 — a full year after the Supplier’s Default Date.'°?°

5. In the Alternative, the Claimant Failed to Prove its Investment Costs

469. Finally, the Respondent contends that the Project is unlikely to have been sold for “even the value

of its sunk costs at the date of the breach.”""?! As such, the Claimant should not be entitled to any

1022

investment costs. In the event that the Tribunal finds that the Claimant could have brought its

Project into Commercial Operation within the time frames of the Contract and that the Project

1023 Even then, the

1024

had a positive value, the Claimant should only be entitled to investment costs.

Claimant has failed to discharge its burden in proving the quantum of such costs.

470. The Respondent lists four reasons that would preclude the Tribunal from awarding any
compensation for the Claimant’s investment costs. First, the Claimant’s reliance on Vivendi II is
misplaced because the tribunal did not hold that approximations were allowed in the context of
investment costs.'°> Second, the Claimant has included in its calculations numerous expenditures
that were made after the date of the alleged breaches.'°° Third, the Claimant should not be
entitled to certain sunk costs that were incurred prior to the breach or costs that it was

unreasonable to incur.'° Finally, the evidence submitted by the Claimant does not support the

quantum of the losses it claims.'°”*

The Respondent concludes that if the Tribunal were to decide that the Claimant is entitled to
investment costs, the Claimant should be awarded only “a fraction” of its alleged expenditures of
CAD 17 million.’ In particular, the Respondent claims that an audit of the evidence provided
by the Claimant shows that as of 25 June 2010 (the date on which the Claimant knew that the
Project might not proceed) the Claimant’s investment amounted to only CAD 0.208 million.'°*°
By 22 November 2010 (the date the Project entered into force majeure status) the Claimant had
invested CAD 0.528 million.'°*' By 11 February 2011 (the date of the deferral) the Claimant had
invested CAD 0.921 million.'°” Finally, by 22 May 2012 (the Claimant’s own valuation date) it
had spent only CAD 1.746 million.'°

The Claimant has not Proven it is Entitled to Pre-Judgment Interest

472. The Respondent agrees that if interest is to be awarded, a 3% interest rate annually compounded

should be used.'"* The Respondent asserts that, while the Tribunal has discretion in awarding
interest, “the Claimant bears the burden of proving that the circumstances of this case justify an
award of interest to ensure full reparation.”!"> In this case, the Respondent contends that the

Claimant fails to establish why full reparations can only be met with an award of interest.'°°°

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

473. Having found that the Respondent is in breach of its obligations under Article 1105(1) of NAFTA,

1029

the Tribunal must determine the relief that the Claimant is entitled to as a result of the breach.
The Tribunal recalls that the purpose of the compensation to be awarded is to make the Claimant
“whole,” keeping in mind the Tribunal’s determination that the Claimant has not lost the entire
value of its investment as the FIT Contract is still formally in force (albeit under an extended
force majeure) and, accordingly, as the CAD 6 million letter of credit is still available to the
Claimant and has not been lost or taken by the Government. The compensation to be awarded to
the Claimant must therefore reflect the Claimant’s loss (damage to the investment) rather than the
full value of the investment. This latter would be relevant only if the Claimant has lost the entirety

of its investment as a result of an expropriation, which is not the case here.

476.

As a first step, the Tribunal must determine the appropriate method of valuation, taking into
account the development stage of the Project. The evidence before the Tribunal indicates that
there are three critical value milestones for offshore wind projects: (a) permitting (early stage);

(b) contracting, financing and construction (late stage); and (c) operations. '°37

The early
development stage ends when the developer has site control, grid access and the revenue regime
(e.g., FIT Contract) in place and when the project is fully permitted, whereas the late development
stage ends when the project becomes operational. The value of the project increases as it moves
along in this continuum of project development. According to Dr Jéréme Guillet of Green
Giraffe, while the DCF method is used in the industry to value offshore wind projects, it is not
usually used for projects that have not yet reached financial closure, given the many risks and
uncertainties surrounding such projects.!°*

The Tribunal notes that, while the Claimant did have a FIT Contract and a grid connection, it did
not yet have site control and the permitting process had not yet been completed. The relatively
early development stage of the Project is also reflected in the investment cost, which the Claimant
alleges amounts to some CAD 17.4 million (including the security deposit of CAD 6 million),!°”
whereas the development cost of a fully-permitted project of a similar capacity (i.e., 300 MW)
would typically be in the range of EUR 20-40 million (CAD 29-58 million at today’s exchange
rate).'“° The Project must therefore be considered an early-stage project. Accordingly, based on
the evidence of Dr Guillet, which the Tribunal accepts, the DCF method is not an appropriate
method of valuation for the Project, given its early development stage and the related risks and

uncertainties.

The Tribunal considers that, in the circumstances, the Project can be best valued, and the damage
to it quantified, on the basis of the comparable transactions methodology. While the Tribunal
agrees, as noted by Deloitte, that there are limitations in directly applying transaction references
in the context of the Project due to the different geographic areas served, terms of power pricing
agreements, wind levels and project size, the evidence relating to comparable transactions is the
best evidence before it, and the Tribunal finds it reasonable to rely on this evidence, subject to
any adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the fact that the Claimant’s investment has not

been expropriated.

‘57 See RER-Green Giraffe, pp. 18-25. The Deloitte reports similarly distinguish between early-stage, late-stage,
under construction and installed projects; see CER-Taylor/Low, para. 4.68.

038 RER-Green Giraffe, paras. 22, 94.

139 As discussed in para. 481 below, the Tribunal does not accept that all of the CAD 17.4 million can be
considered investment costs.

‘00 RER-Green Giraffe, para. 72.

138

477. The most comprehensive evidence relating to the comparable transactions methodology was
provided by Dr Guillet of Green Giraffe, and the Tribunal therefore takes his evidence as the
starting point of analysis; the evidence of other experts, including that offered by Messrs Taylor
and Low of Deloitte and Mr Goncalves of BRG, is referred to as appropriate.'°"!

478. Dr Guillet testified that offshore wind projects have relatively consistent values in Europe.
Depending on the development stage, the project value may range from below
EUR 0.1 million/MW for projects that are not fully permitted (i.e., that do not have one of site
control, permits, a revenue regime and grid access) to EUR 0.2 million/MW for fully permitted

early-stage projects!

to approximately EUR 4 million/MW for projects that have reached
financial closure, and up to EUR 4.5 million/MW for projects that have reached commercial

. 3
operation. '

As to the early-stage projects specifically, Dr Guillet’s evidence on actual
transactions before the Tribunal shows that the overall valuations of such projects range from
EUR 0.01 million/MW to approximately EUR 0.1 million/MW, depending on the development
stage, whereas late development stage projects have been sold for prices ranging from EUR 0.1
million/MW to EUR 0.5 million/MW. The evidence of Messrs Taylor and Low on late stage
(fully permitted) projects indicated valuations from CAD 0.2 million/MW to CAD 0.7
million/MW, with a median of CAD 0.35 million/MW (approximately EUR 0.24 million in
September 2016).'"* Their evidence is thus consistent with that of Dr Guillet for late-stage

projects.

479. Dr Guillet’s evidence on early-stage projects covered six different transactions, whereas
Mr Goncalves’ evidence covered three of the transactions considered by Dr Guillet, as well as

one additional transaction on an early-stage project (Luchterduinen) which was not included in

1045

Dr Guillet’s evidence. The multiples of these seven transactions range from

EUR 0.01 million/MW to approximately EUR 0.1 million/MW, with a median of approximately
EUR 0.08 million/MW and an average of approximately EUR 0.06 million/MW.'“° As noted

above, Messrs Taylor and Low did not consider early stage projects.

1041 See CER-Taylor/Low, pp. 10, and RER-BRG, pp. 87-88. In relying on Dr Guillet’s evidence, the Tribunal
keeps in mind that some of the third-party confidential evidence underlying the Green Giraffe Report was not
made available to the Claimant; see above paras. 63-66.

Tribunal has no basis to adjust these estimates.

483.

Depending on whether one relies on the median or the average multiple, and subject to any further
adjustments that may be required as noted above, the evidence on comparable transactions thus
suggests that the value of the Project would fall between EUR 18 million (based on the average
multiple of EUR 0.06 million/MW) and EUR 24 million (based on the median multiple of EUR
0.08 million/MW).

The Claimant’s sunk investment costs may be used as a “reality check” to test whether the above
valuation is appropriate.'” According to the Claimant, its sunk costs amount to approximately
CAD 17 million (CAD 17,428,000). The Tribunal has taken note of the Respondent’s criticism
of the Claimant’s calculation of its sunk costs, and although the Tribunal agrees with much of the
criticism, including that the CAD 6 million security cannot be considered a “sunk” cost, it does
not agree that no costs incurred by Windstream after May 2012 can be accepted because the
Claimant argues that as of that date the Project was no longer financeable; as noted above, the
FIT Contract is still in force and the Parties could have at any time revived the Project, had the
Respondent promptly completed the scientific studies. Consequently, costs incurred by the
Claimant after May 2012 may be taken into account, insofar as they are not to be accounted for
as arbitration costs. Conversely, as the Tribunal has determined that the Project has not been lost
in its entirety, but has only been damaged, not all of the costs incurred by the Claimant after May
2012 can be considered arbitration costs. Based on this yardstick, the Claimant’s sunk costs
would amount to some CAD 8-10 million, i.e., approximately EUR 5.5-7 million, at today’s

exchange rate.

The Tribunal notes that, while the Claimant’s sunk costs are substantially lower than the
provisional valuation of EUR 18 to 24 million based on the comparable transactions method, this
is not inconsistent with the evidence before the Tribunal, which suggests that a developer typically
earns a “premium” on a project when sold, which reflects the value added to the project by the
developer.'* In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider that any further adjustments
are necessary and concludes that EUR 0.07 million/MW (i.e., EUR 21 million), which represents
the mid-point of the range of valuation reached above (EUR 18 to 24 million), is an appropriate

valuation of the Project.

While the Tribunal considers that this is the proper valuation of the Project, it should be kept in
mind that, as determined above, the Claimant is not entitled to compensation for the full value of

its investment: the Claimant has not lost the letter of credit, which is still in place, and the FIT

07 ‘The expert evidence before the Tribunal suggests that there is a relationship between the developer’s
investment costs and the valuation of the project, depending on the development stage; see RER-Green Giraffe,
paras. 21-26, 72, 94-100.

486.

Contract is still in force and could, in theory, be still revived and renegotiated if the Parties so
agreed. Consequently, in order to quantify the damage caused by the Respondent’s breach to the
value of the Claimant’s investment, a further adjustment must be made to reflect the value of the
letter of credit (CAD 6 million). On the other hand, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate
or necessary to make any further adjustments to reflect the fact that the FIT Contract is still
formally in place; although the FIT Contract could have been reactivated and renegotiated by the
Parties at any time during the period from 11 February 2011 until the date of this award, as a
matter of fact this has not happened and consequently, as at the date of this award, the FIT
Contract cannot be considered to have any value. (It is another matter that the Parties can create
such value by reactivating and renegotiating the FIT Contract after the award, which option is still

open to them.)

Finally, the Tribunal must decide the date at which the damage to the Claimant’s investment is to
be quantified, as this will determine the EUR/CAD exchange rate to be applied to the EUR 0.07
million/MW valuation of the Project; it is to this CAD amount that the CAD 6 million adjustment
must be applied. The Tribunal considers that, since (as determined above) the Claimant has not
lost the full value of its investment, the proper date of quantification of the damage to the
investment, and accordingly of the Claimant’s loss, is the date of this award. It is on this date that

the damage to the Claimant’s investment crystallized.'

Based on the exchange rate of the date of the award, the value of the Project as determined above
(EUR 21 million) amounts to CAD 31,182,900. Consequently, taking into account the letter of
credit that still, as at the date of this award, remains available to the Claimant, the damage to the
Claimant’s investment, and therefore the amount of compensation that the Claimant is entitled to,
amounts to CAD 25,182,900. The Tribunal determines that this amount is payable within 30 days

of the notification of this award.

In view of the date of quantification of the Claimant’s loss, the Tribunal need not take a decision
on interest. Moreover, the Tribunal cannot contemplate that the Respondent will not comply with

the award and therefore does not fix an interest for late payment.

‘9 The Tribunal notes, in this connection, that the comparable transactions on the basis of which the value of the
Project is determined took place over a period of years between 2009 and 2013 and accordingly they benchmark
the market value of the Project, based on its development stage (which did not substantially change since
11 February 2011), over the entirety of this period and not on any particular date.

VII. COSTS

A.

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

487. If it is successful in this arbitration, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal order the Respondent

to bear the costs of arbitration that have been incurred by the Claimant as defined in Article 40 of

the UNCITRAL Rules, in the total amount of CAD 6,474,864.84, including the following costs:

a. legal fees of CAD 3,323,115.01;

b. costs of expert witnesses, third-party service providers and witness travel costs of
CAD 2,268,712.27;

c. disbursements of CAD 233,037.56; and

d. Tribunal and PCA costs advanced by the Claimant of CAD 650,000.00.!°°

488. The Claimant submits that the legal costs are reasonable having regard to the volume of evidence

and written submissions, and argues that the costs are “well within the range of legal costs

incurred by claimants in investment treaty arbitrations.”!"!

489. The Claimant also submits that the witness fees and third-party costs incurred by the Claimant

are reasonable. Referring to summaries of its expert evidence,'°* the Claimant argues that the
evidence was necessary to respond to the Respondent’s arguments and to satisfy the Claimant’s
burden of proof (especially, to establish the reasonableness of the Claimant’s decision to invest
in the Project, the technical feasibility of the Project and the quantum of the Claimant’s
damages).'°? The Claimant notes that its costs claim does not include the costs of expert evidence

already counted in its sunk cost calculation.'°*

490. The Claimant further submits that “a number of the steps taken” by the Respondent caused the

Claimant to incur costs that would otherwise have been avoided. According to the Claimant,
these steps included (i) the Respondent’s production of documents 30 days before the Claimant’s
original deadline to file its Reply Memorial; (ii) the Respondent’s request to strike portions of the
Claimant’s Memorial and evidence from the record on the ground of parliamentary privilege

(which, the Claimant notes, was rejected by the Tribunal); and (iii) the inclusion of what the

Claimant terms “incorrect and unsubstantiated assertions” in the Respondent’s rejoinder expert
evidence.'°> The Claimant also argues that the non-production of documents and information
relied upon by the Respondent’s experts, BRG and Green Giraffe, had necessitated the Claimant
bringing a motion to the Tribunal to take the non-production into account when assessing the
weight to be given to the expert evidence.'°° The Claimant also argues that the production of

certain documents by the Respondent during the hearing caused wasted costs through

Mr Cecchini needing to be recalled to testify a second time.'°57

491. Inthe Claimant’s view, if it is wholly successful, the Tribunal should order the Respondent to pay
the Claimant’s costs of arbitration in full, in accordance with the principle that costs follow the
event.'°* The Claimant notes that Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules specifies that a tribunal
should award the successful party its legal costs and the costs of arbitration. The Claimant
considers this provision to create a rebuttable presumption that the unsuccessful party will bear
these costs. The Claimant submits that this presumption is consistent with the “increasingly

common practice in investment arbitration endorsed by Canada — that costs should ‘follow the

event? 2109

492. The Claimant further submits that in cases where the claimant was not wholly successful, tribunals
have awarded legal and arbitration costs because the respondent forced the claimant to initiate the

arbitration. Thus, the Claimant argues that if it is partially successful, the Tribunal should order

the Respondent to pay an appropriate portion of the Claimant's costs.'°°°

493. However, if the Claimant is not successful, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal “bear in mind

the several decisions in which NAFTA tribunals have declined to order an unsuccessful claimant

to pay the respondent’s costs, particularly where, as here, the claimant brought this arbitration in

good faith and had no other meaningful way of obtaining compensation.”!"*!

494. The Claimant opposes the Respondent’s contention that, if the Claimant is only partially
successful, the Tribunal should order the Claimant to pay for the portion of claims that did not
succeed. The Claimant considers this position to be without merit and lacking in arbitral
precedent.' The Claimant denies that the decision in European American Investment Bank v.
The Slovak Republic supports the Respondents position. The Claimant refers instead to the cost
awards in Pope & Talbot, Rumeli, Cargill and PSEG, which take an “overall view of the case”
and award the claimant part of its legal costs when the claimant succeeds in part.'°°> The Claimant
also objects to the Respondent’s assertion that it advanced “untenable or frivolous claims” that
contributed to the costs of the arbitration. The Claimant maintains that its claims regarding the

OPA and breaches of Articles 1102 and 1103 of NAFTA are appropriate. In addition, the

Claimant submits that its damages claim is appropriate.'°**

495. The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s argument that certain of the Claimant’s expert reports
and document requests increased the Respondent’s costs. The content of the Respondent’s
pleadings, the Claimant observes, does not evidence that the Respondent incurred any costs in
responding to those expert reports. With respect to document production, the Claimant explains

that it only pursued further document production requests because of the Respondent’s “repeated

failure to comply with its documentary production obligations.”!°°>

496. The Claimant contends that the costs claimed by the Respondent are “disproportionate and

unreasonable.” The Claimant notes that the Respondent used a larger legal team than the

B. THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

497. The Respondent submits that pursuant to Article 1135 of NAFTA and Article 42 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal should direct that the costs of the arbitration be borne by the
unsuccessful party, except if it determines that the circumstances require apportionment between

the parties.

498. The Respondent argues that all costs should be borne by the Claimant on the basis that the claims
are “without merit.” According to the Respondent, these costs include the Respondent’s share of
the Tribunal’s fees and expenses and the Respondent’s legal and other costs. The Respondent

claims a total amount of CAD 8,261,052.35, which consists of the following:

a. arbitration costs of CAD 650,000;

b. lawyer fees of CAD 4,215,554.93;

c. expert and consultant costs of CAD 3,225,912.58; and
d. additional disbursements of CAD 169,584.84.!°7

499. The Respondent submits that its costs are reasonable, stating that “[s]ignificant resources were
necessary to defend this case, owing to the Claimant’s numerous allegations of NAFTA breaches,
involving three provincial government ministries, the OPA, and former political staff, as well as

to the Claimant’s inappropriate claim for lost profits, which unnecessarily added significant

complexity to the case.”!°°

500. The Respondent submits that the general presumption that costs follow the event has been
supported by investment treaty tribunals, including numerous NAFTA tribunals, which have held
that the prevailing party in an arbitration should be awarded its arbitration costs in whole or in

part.'° In addition to arguing that the Claimant knew or ought to have known its claims are

without merit, the Respondent also claims that the Claimant: (i) filed “irrelevant” expert reports,
(ii) made “unnecessary and improper” procedural motions and (iii) presented an “incoherent”

damages case based on an “inappropriate valuation methodology” and an “insufficient”

evidentiary record to meet its burden of proof.'°”

501. The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s argument that the Tribunal should require the
Respondent to bear its own costs even if the Claimant is wholly unsuccessful in its claims.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant fails to offer a compelling reason or supportive arbitral

decisions to justify such a departure from the general principle of costs following the event.'°”!

502. The Respondent further submits that even if the Claimant is partially successful, it should be
required to bear the Respondent’s costs for its unsuccessful claims. Referring to academic
commentary and the decision in European American Investment Bank in support of its position,
the Respondent states that the principle that costs follow the event must be “based on an
assessment of relative success rather than simply on which party won the case.”"” In this regard
the Respondent argues that the Claimant inappropriately advanced and maintained
(i) jurisdictional arguments relating to the OPA,'”” (ii) claims regarding alleged breaches of
Article 1102 and 1103!” and (iii) a damages claim that was “incoherent and based on an

inappropriate valuation methodology and insufficient evidentiary record.”"°”

The Respondent dismisses the Claimant’s reliance on PSEG to support its contention that the
Respondent should bear the Claimant’s costs even if it is only partially successful. The
Respondent submits that the PSEG case is inapposite authority because the tribunal had only taken
the approach it did because the case involved a denial of justice — according to the Respondent

there is no denial of justice in the present dispute.'°”°

504. In addition, the Respondent submits that even if the Tribunal holds that the Claimant is successful

505.

on all of its claims, the Tribunal should exercise its discretion and determine that each party should
bear its own arbitration and legal costs “because of the inefficient manner in which the Claimant
presented its case.”!°”’ In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant filed expert reports that were
“irrelevant” or “unnecessary” to establish its claims.'°* The Respondent also considers that the
Claimant’s continued requests for information, including information outside of the Respondent’s
care, custody and control, were “improper.”!°”

Even if an award of costs for the Claimant could be justified, the Respondent contends that the
Claimant’s claimed costs are unreasonable. The Respondent describes the Claimant’s costs as
being “caused by its own litigation strategy” rather than the Respondent’s actions. With respect
to the document production criticism levelled by the Claimant, the Respondent notes that the
Tribunal has already ruled that the Respondent’s document production efforts were “satisfactory.”
The Respondent further denies that late production by the Respondent had any cost impact on the
Claimant and argues that its motion to strike portions of the record based on parliamentary

privilege has no bearing on costs.'°*

506. The Respondent also argues that the Claimant seeks to recover certain illegitimate amounts that

1076

are not included in the definition of costs set out in Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules,
specifically the costs for Mr Baines, Mr Mars and Mr Ziegler to attend the hearing on days other
than when they provided testimony, as well as the costs associated with its requests made under

the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.'°*!

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

Article 1135(1) of NAFTA provides that a “tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the
applicable arbitration rules.” In the present case, the relevant provisions are Articles 40 and 42

of the UNCITRAL Rules. Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:

“1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems
appropriate, in another decision.

2. The term ‘costs’ includes only:

(a

The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to
be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;

(b

(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the
arbitral tribunal;

The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(d

The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses
are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e

The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to
the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and
expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.”

Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules further provides:

1. “The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or
parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the
parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the case.

2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other
award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result
of the decision on allocation of costs.”

Pursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration
in the final award. Both Parties have made advances in the amount of CAD 650,000, which
amount in total to CAD 1,300,000 (equivalent to EUR 871,010.12 as converted to Euros upon
receipt by the PCA).

As to Articles 40(2)(a), (b), (c), and (f), according to Section 19.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, each
member of the Tribunal received a fee of USD 3,000 for each day of participation in meetings of
the Tribunal or eight hours of other work performed in connection with the proceeding pro rata,
as well as subsistence allowances and reimbursement of travel and other expenses within the
limits set forth in Regulation 14 of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes

(“ICSID”) Administrative and Financial Regulations and the Memorandum on the Fees and

148

S11.

512.

513.

514.

Expenses of ICSID Arbitrators. Based on these rates and converted to Euros upon payment by
the PCA, the fees of the members of the Tribunal amount to EUR 93,274.79 for Mr R. Doak
Bishop, EUR 155,618.23 to Dr Bernardo Cremades and EUR 191,024.76 to Dr Veijo Heiskanen.
The travel and other expenses of the Tribunal amount to EUR 54,393.81. The PCA’s fees and
expenses for registry services, which were paid in accordance with the PCA’s Schedule of Fees,
amount to EUR 112,806.65. Other costs incurred (including costs of court reporting, IT/AV
support, catering, courier services, hearing venue services, office supplies and printing,
telecommunications, and banking services) amount to EUR 203,648.31. No fees or expenses of

an appointing authority were claimed by the Parties.

Accordingly the total costs of the arbitration (excluding the legal and other costs incurred by the
Parties under Articles 40(2)(d) and (e)) amount to EUR 810,766.55. The PCA will provide the
Parties with a statement of account after the issuance of this award and will return the unused

balance to the Parties in equal shares.

Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes that “[t]he cost of the arbitration shall in principle
be borne by the unsuccessful party.” The Parties agree with this principle, although the
Respondent also argues that, in the event the Claimant is successful on all of its claims, the Parties
should be ordered to bear their own costs, due to the Claimant’s allegedly inefficient conduct of

the arbitration.

Having considered the applicable legal framework and the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal
considers it appropriate that each Party bear its share of the above-listed arbitration costs, i.e., the
costs and fees of the Tribunal, the costs and fees of the PCA, and other costs incurred in relation
to the arbitration. These costs effectively arise out of the Parties’ arbitration agreement and thus
constitute costs that both Parties have agreed to bear, and it cannot be said that either Party or
their counsel has acted in the context of this arbitration in a manner that would have resulted in
unnecessary or unreasonable additional costs. On the contrary, the Tribunal appreciates the highly
professional and constructive manner in which the Parties and their counsel have conducted this

arbitration.

As to the legal and other costs incurred by the Parties under Articles 40(2)(d) and (e), the Tribunal
considers it appropriate to apportion these costs in accordance with the cost follows the event
principle, on which both Parties agree. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant
has prevailed in this arbitration, and although only one of its four claims was granted, this was
one of its two principal claims. However, the Tribunal did not accept the Claimant’s principal
method of valuation, to which much of the evidence, in particular expert evidence related, and on

which much of the time at the hearing was spent. In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers it

149

appropriate that the Respondent be ordered to reimburse the Claimant 50% of its legal and other
costs, i.e., CAD 2,912,432. This amount is payable within 30 days of the notification of this

award.
