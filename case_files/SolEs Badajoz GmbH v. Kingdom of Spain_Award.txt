INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty
which entered into force on 16 April 1998 with respect to the Federal Republic of Germany
and the Kingdom of Spain (the “ECT”), and the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force

on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The claimant is SolEs Badajoz GmbH (“SolEs” or “Claimant”), a company incorporated

under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or “Respondent’).

Claimant and Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to various legislative and regulatory measures implemented by Spain
that modified the regulatory and economic regime applicable to producers of electricity
from photovoltaic (“PV”) energy sources, which allegedly negatively impacted Claimant’ s

investment in two PV plants located in the Autonomous Community of Extremadura.

In particular, Claimant alleges that Spain has breached its obligation under (i) Article 10(1)
of the ECT concerning fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) and compliance with
obligations entered into with investors or investments (umbrella clause); and (ii) Article 13
of the ECT by means of the indirect expropriation of its investment. Claimant submits that
it is entitled to receive compensation for damage caused as a result of Respondent’s

violations of the ECT amounting to EUR 95.8 million.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 3 August 2015, ICSID received a request for arbitration from SolEs against Spain,
accompanied by exhibits C-0001 to C-0041 and legal authorities CL-0001 to CL-0015
(the “Request for Arbitration”).

By letter of 14 August 2015, ICSID requested additional information from SolEs
concerning its Request for Arbitration, which was provided on 21 August 2015,

accompanied by legal authorities CL-0016 to CL-0023.

On 24 August 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration,
as supplemented on 21 August 2015, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the
ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of
Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral
tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure

for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the
ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be
appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement
of the Parties. Pursuant to the Parties’ agreed method of constitution, failing an agreement
of the Parties on the presiding arbitrator, she or he would be appointed by the Secretary-

General of ICSID, without limitation to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.

The Tribunal was composed (until 24 October 2017) of Judge Joan E. Donoghue, a national
of the United States of America, President, appointed by the Secretary-General;
Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, appointed by Claimant; and Mrs. Anna

Joubin-Bret, a national of France, appointed by Respondent.

On 16 February 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”),
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the
Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Gonzalo Flores,

ICSID Team Leader/Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the

2

Tribunal. On 8 August 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that Mrs. Ana Constanza
Conover Blancas, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Mr. Flores as the Secretary of

the Tribunal.

On 8 April 2016, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first

session with the Parties by teleconference.

Following the first session, on 22 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
embodying the Parties’ agreements on procedural matters and the Tribunal’s decisions on
the disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 established, inter alia, that the applicable
Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages
would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris,
France. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the procedural calendar applicable to

this arbitration.

On 18 April 2016, the European Commission (the “Commission” or “EC’”) filed with
ICSID an application for leave to intervene as non-disputing party, pursuant to Arbitration
Rule 37(2), concerning the question whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the case
(the “First EC Application”). The Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted a copy of the

application to the Tribunal and the Parties on the same date.

On 6 May 2016, in response to an invitation to provide comments from the Tribunal, each

Party filed observations on the First EC Application.

On 23 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 “On the European
Commission’s Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party of
April 18, 2016”. In its order, the Tribunal dismissed the First EC Application on the ground
that it was premature. The Tribunal observed that the Commission sought to address the
Tribunal’s alleged lack of jurisdiction at a time in which Respondent had not yet indicated
whether it intended to object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal noted that it would
be “unable to determine the existence or the extent of any disagreement between the Parties

[...] regarding the jurisdiction of the Centre or of this Tribunal” until it received Claimant’s

memorial and Respondent’s counter-memorial.! The Tribunal indicated that its decision
was without prejudice to its consideration of any application to intervene by the
Commission to be filed at a later stage, and it mentioned the date in which Respondent’s

counter-memorial (including preliminary objections, if any) was to be filed.

18. On9 September 2016, Claimant filed a Statement of Claim (““Claimant’s Memorial”), with
exhibits C-0042 to C-0181 and legal authorities CL-0024 to CL-0106. The pleading was
also accompanied by two witness statements and two expert reports, as follows: (i) Witness
Statement of Thomas Hopp dated 8 September 2016 (“First Hopp Statement”);
(ii) Witness Statement of Markus Voigt dated 8 September 2016 (“First Voigt
Statement’); (iii) Expert Report of The Brattle Group (“Brattle”) titled “Changes to the
Regulation of Photovoltaic Installations in Spain Since November 2010” dated
9 September 2016, prepared by José Antonio Garcia and Carlos Lapuerta, with exhibits
BRR-0001 to BRR-0127 (“First Brattle Regulatory Report”); and (iv) Expert Report of
The Brattle Group titled “Financial Damages to Investors” dated 9 September 2016,
prepared by Carlos Lapuerta and Richard Caldwell, with exhibits BQR-0001 to BQR-0086
(‘First Brattle Quantum Report”).

19. On 18 January 2017, the Commission filed with ICSID a second application for leave to
intervene as a non-disputing party (the “Second EC Application”). The Secretary of the
Tribunal transmitted a copy of the application to the Tribunal and the Parties on the

same date.

20. On 27 January 2017, Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on
Jurisdiction (“Respondent’s Counter-Memorial”), with exhibits R-0001 to R-0232 and
legal authorities RL-0001 to RL-0076. The pleading was also accompanied by a witness
statement and an expert report, as follows: (i) Witness Statement of Carlos Montoya dated
24 January 2017, with 60 supporting exhibits “W-”, their numbering ranging from W-0005
to W-0453 (“First Montoya Statement”); and (ii) Expert Report of Altran-MaC Group
(‘AMG’) titled “Expert Report Relating to the Arbitration SolEs Badajoz GmbH vs. the

' Procedural Order No. 2 “On the European Commission's Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing
Party of April 18, 2016” dated 23 May 2016, 20.

Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case ARB/15/38” dated 27 January 2017, prepared by Grant
Greatrex, Jestis Fernandez Salguero and Carlos Montojo Gonzdlez, with supporting

documents | to 40 (“First AMG Report’).

21. On 9 February 2017, in response to an invitation to provide comments from the Tribunal,

each Party filed observations on the Second EC Application.

22. On 21 February 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 “On the European
Commission’s Second Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party of
18 January 2017’. In its order, the Tribunal authorized the Commission to file a written
non-disputing party submission no later than 31 March 2017, under certain procedural
directions and subject to a condition. The Tribunal noted that while “[i]t would be
premature for the Tribunal to decide whether any costs attributable to the participation of
the Commission should be borne by the Commission [...] the Commission shall include in
its submission an undertaking that it will comply with any decision on costs to be issued by

the Tribunal.”?

23. On 2 March 2017, the Commission filed with ICSID a “Request to Alter Procedural
Order No. 3 of 21 February 2017 on the European Commission’s Second Application for
Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party of 18 January 2017”, by which it requested
the Tribunal to remove the condition to provide an undertaking to comply with any decision
on costs to be issued by the Tribunal. The Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted a copy of

the request to the Tribunal and the Parties on the same date.

24. On9 March 2017, in response to an invitation to provide comments from the Tribunal, each

Party filed observations on the Commision’s request to alter Procedural Order No. 3.

25. By letter of 17 March 2017, the Tribunal declined the Commision’s request to alter
Procedural Order No. 3. The Tribunal indicated the following:

The Tribunal wishes to express that the procedural directions laid
out in Procedural Order No. 3 (including paragraph 47(d), related

2 Procedural Order No. 3 “On the European Commission’s Second Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-
Disputing Party of 18 January 2017” dated 21 February 2017, { 47(d).

to the allocation of costs) are not included in order to deter
participation by the Commission. Rather, they are intended to
ensure that the Commission’s participation does not unduly burden
or unfairly prejudice either Party, consistent with ICSID Arbitration
Rule 37(2).

Having considered the Commission’s Request and the views of the
Parties, the Tribunal declines to alter Procedural Order No. 3. The
Tribunal emphasizes that it has made no decision that any costs
should be allocated to the Commission, as was stated in Procedural
Order No. 3. In addition, the Tribunal offers the following
clarifications in response to the Commission’s Request, which may
be of assistance to the Commission:

(a) Paragraph 47(d) does not contemplate any order that would
allocate to the Commission costs other than those arising from
its participation in this case;

(b) If the Commission intervenes as a Non-Disputing Party, the
Tribunal will seek the views of the Commission (in addition to
those of the Parties) in respect of the possible allocation of costs
to the Commission, prior to any decision on the allocation of
those costs.

On 21 March 2017, the Commission submitted a communication informing the Tribunal

that it would not provide the requested undertaking on costs. The Commission did not file

a non-disputing party submission in this proceeding.

On 3 April 2017, following exchanges between the Parties, and in accordance with
Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties submitted their document production applications in

the form of Redfern Schedules for decision by the Tribunal.
On 14 April 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on document production.

On 10 July 2017, Claimant filed a Statement of Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial
on Jurisdiction (“Claimant’s Reply”), with exhibits C-0182 to C-0187 and legal
authorities CL-0107 to CL-0118. The pleading was also accompanied by two witness

statements and two expert reports, as follows: (i) Second Witness Statement of Thomas

Quantum Report’).

On 17 July 2017, Respondent requested disclosures from Dr. Alexandrov concerning his
relationship with The Brattle Group (“Brattle”), Claimant’s expert in this
case. Dr. Alexandrov provided his observations concerning Respondent’s request on

26 July 2017.

On 4 August 2017, Respondent requested further disclosures from Dr. Alexandrov
concerning his relationship with Brattle. Dr. Alexandrov provided his observations

concerning Respondent’s request on 18 August 2017.

On 15 September 2017, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on
Jurisdiction (“Respondent’s Rejoinder”), with exhibits R-0233 to R-0359 and legal
authorities RL-0077 to RL-0095. The pleading was also accompanied by a witness
statement and an expert report, as follows: (i) Second Witness Statement of Carlos
Montoya dated 13 September 2017, with 50 supporting exhibits ““W-”, their numbering
ranging from W-0005 to W-1029 (“Second Montoya Statement”); and (ii) Second Expert
Report of Altran-MaC Group titled “Rebuttal Expert Report Relating to the Arbitration
SolEs Badajoz GmbH vs. the Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case ARB/135/38” dated
15 September 2017, prepared by Grant Greatrex, Jestis Fernandez Salguero and Carlos

Montojo Gonzalez, with supporting documents 41 to 113 (“Second AMG Report”).

On 18 September 2017, Respondent proposed the disqualification of Dr. Alexandrov, in
accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9

(the “Disqualification Proposal”). On the same date, the Centre informed the Parties that

7

the proceeding was suspended until the Disqualification Proposal was decided, pursuant to
Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Parties were also informed that the Disqualification Proposal
would be decided by the other Members of the Tribunal, in accordance with Article 58 of

the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 9(4).

By letter of 19 September 2017, the Parties were informed of the applicable schedule for

the filing of written observations on the Disqualification Proposal.

On 25 September 2017, Claimant submitted its observations on the Disqualification
Proposal. On 28 September 2017, Dr. Alexandrov furnished his explanations, as envisaged

by Arbitration Rule 9(3). On 6 October 2017, the Parties filed simultaneous observations.

On 10 October 2017, the non-challenged arbitrators invited Dr. Alexandrov to provide
additional explanations and fixed a date by which the Parties could submit an additional

simultaneous round of observations on the Disqualification Proposal.

On 12 October 2017, in response to the invitation of the non-challenged Members of the
Tribunal, Dr. Alexandrov furnished additional explanations. On 17 October 2017, the

Parties filed an additional simultaneous round of observations.

On 18 October 2017, Claimant requested the non-challenged Members of the Tribunal to
exclude from consideration certain pages from Spain’s observations of 17 October 2017
and accompanying annexes. In the alternative, Claimant requested to be given a minimum
of fifteen days to file a responsive submission. On 19 October 2017, Respondent requested

the dismissal of Claimant’s request of 18 October 2017.

On 19 October 2017, the Parties were notified that Judge Joan E. Donoghue and Mrs. Anna
Joubin-Bret were equally divided and that the Disqualification Proposal would be decided
by the Chairman of the Administrative Council (the “Chairman’”), in accordance with

Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 9(4).

By communications of 20 October 2017, Claimant requested the Chairman to
decide on its request of 18 October 2017, and Respondent maintained its objection to

Claimant’s request.

On 24 October 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that Dr. Alexandrov had submitted

his resignation as an arbitrator in this case.

On that same date, Mrs. Joubin-Bret advised the Centre that she had decided to step down
as arbitrator in this case, having accepted the position of Director of the International Trade
Law Division in the Office of Legal Affairs of the United Nations and ex officio Secretary
of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, and the Centre so informed

the Parties.

Also on 24 October 2017, each Party was invited to appoint a new arbitrator, in accordance

European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain, YCSID Case
No. ARB/13/30 (“RREEF Decision”), together with a written submission commenting on

the relevance of such document.

On 21 March 2019, Claimant filed observations requesting the Tribunal to reject
Respondent’s request of 18 March 2019, or alternatively to grant an equal opportunity to
Claimant to submit and comment on the partial dissent to the RREEF Decision and the
Final Award of 14 November 2018 rendered in Foresight Luxembourg Solar 1 S. A.R1., et
al. v. Kingdom of Spain, SCC Case No. 2015/150 (“Foresight Award”).

On 10 April 2019, the Tribunal granted the Parties’ requests to introduce the
RREEF Decision and the Foresight Award into the record, together with the dissenting
opinions accompanying these rulings. The Tribunal invited the Parties to simultaneously

submit by 17 April 2019 short submissions commenting on those documents.

On 17 April 2019, each Party provided its comments concerning the documents admitted

authorities RL-0104 and RL-0105. Claimant’s submission was accompanied by legal
authority CL-0151.

On 18 April 2019, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed.

On 9 and 10 May 2019, the Parties filed their respective submissions on costs. Pursuant to
instructions from the Tribunal, each Party was allowed to provide comments on the other

Party’s costs by 17 May 2019.

93. On 21 May 2019, the Tribunal took note of a communication from Claimant of 17 May
2019 indicating that it had no comments on the Respondent’s submission on costs, and
noted that no comments to Claimant’s costs submission had been filed by Respondent by

the due date of 17 May 2019.

94. On 11 June 2019, Respondent filed with ICSID comments on Claimant’s submission on
costs of 10 May 2019, noting that it had not been able to submit them by the deadline
established by the Tribunal. On the same date, Claimant objected to the introduction into
the record of Respondent’s submission. On 12 June 2019, the Tribunal noted that
Respondent had submitted its document nearly one month after the deadline established by
the Tribunal for such filing and, having considered all relevant circumstances, the Tribunal

declined to accept Respondent’s submission into the record of the proceeding.

Il. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

95. This case arises out of Claimant’s investments in Spain in PV plants, which use one of
several technologies that produce renewable energy. As background, the Tribunal sets out
below the key developments in the regulatory framework governing investments in
renewable energy in Spain, focusing on those developments of greatest relevance to this

proceeding. It then describes Claimant and its investment.

A. Regulatory Framework

qd) General Background and Description of the “Special Regime” in Place when
Claimant Invested

96. The 1978 Spanish Constitution is the supreme law of Spain.* The Parliament enacts

legislation (“Laws” or “Acts”).> Royal Decree Laws (“RDL”s) are adopted by the

government in emergency situations and require subsequent legislative approval.°

5 Spanish Constitution, Article 66.
°Id., Article 86.

Royal Decrees (“RD’s) are promulgated by the Council of Ministers to complement or

develop legislation,’ and ministries issue ministerial orders and resolutions.®

97. Law No. 54/1997, known by its Spanish acronym “LSE” (Ley del Sector Eléctrico), was
enacted in 1997 to regulate the activities involved in the supply of power, including
generation, transmission, distribution and retailing. It liberalized the energy sector and set
out two regimes for energy production, an Ordinary Regime and a Special Regime that
encouraged the production of energy from renewable sources. Under the Special Regime,

remuneration was supplemented by a premium. The LSE stated:

To work out the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the power
to the network, the effective contribution to environmental
improvement, to primary energy saving and energy efficiency, the
generation of economically justifiable useful heat and the
investment costs incurred shall all be taken into account so as to
achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of
money on capital markets.°

98. From enactment of Law 54/1997 through 2004, Spain adopted successive regulations
designed to regulate and to encourage energy production from renewable sources, which
provided additional details regarding the Special Regime, including the remuneration of
producers of renewable energy.'!? Under RD 436/2004, PV plants participating in the
Special Regime were entitled to receive (i) a regulated tariff (consisting of a single, flat
rate) or (ii) either the price resulting in the organized market or the price freely negotiated
by the plant operator supplemented by an incentive and by a premium.'! The regulated

tariff and the premium were calculated as a percentage of an annual average or reference

electricity tariff.'? The tariffs and the premiums were payable during the useful life of the
plants, but the rates were reduced after the first twenty-five years from their

commissioning. *

99. In 2005, Spain adopted the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan (the “2005-2010 PER”).'*
It noted that overall growth in renewable energy had been lower than expected and referred
to national indicative targets for renewable energy that had been set by the EU in 2001. The
2005-2010 PER concluded that, in order to meet Spain’s target for the year 2010, Spain
needed to revise its 2000-2010 Plan for Promotion of Renewable Energies.'* The 2005-
2010 PER addressed PV facilities in particular:

Production of electricity directly through photovoltaic sources
presents undeniable energetic, industrial, environmental and social,
etc. advantages. Among them, the implementation of photovoltaic
solar energy as widely as possible will contribute to boosting future
technological development, which will cause this power generating
process to be increasingly competitive compared to other
generation methods.'®

100. The 2005-2010 PER proposed to increase the capacity target for PV plants from 135

megawatts (“MW”) to 400 MW.!” It identified public support as “an essential factor to

218

drive growth of different renewable sectors”'* and stated that public aid to achieve the

proposed increases in PV capacity would amount to €499.4 million (for 2005-2010). !°

101. In February 2007, the National Energy Commission (“CNE” or “NEC”)”” of Spain issued
a report on a proposed royal decree regulating energy production under the Special Regime
(“2007 CNE Report”).”! It set out the criteria that, in the opinion of the CNE, should
apply to the special regime: (a) reaching the planning targets; (b) minimizing regulatory
uncertainty; (c) facilitating operation of the system; and (d) incentivizing voluntary
integration in the market.” As to the criterion of minimizing regulatory uncertainty, the

2007 CNE Report stated:

The NEC understands that transparency and predictability in the
future of economic incentives reduces regulatory uncertainty,
incentivising investments in new capacity and minimizing the cost of
financing projects, thus reducing the final cost to the consumer. The
regulation must offer sufficient guarantees to ensure that the
economic incentives are stable and predictable throughout the
service life of the facility. In each case, regulation must provide
both transparent annual adjustment mechanisms, associated to
robust trend indexes (such as the average or reference tariff, the
CPI, ten-year bonds, etc.) and regular reviews that only affect new
facilities (e.g. every four years) with regard to investment costs,
which could also affect the reduction of operating costs at
existing facilities.

 

102. The 2007 CNE Report also noted that the facilities subject to the Special Regime are

capital-intensive, with a long period for capital recovery.”

20 The CNE was created by Act 34/1998, of 7 October 1998, on the Hydrocarbons Sector, in its Additional Provision
Eleven (R-0043). Its purpose was to promote “the competitive operation of the energy sector to guarantee the effective
availability and delivery of quality and competitive services concerning the supply of electricity and hydrocarbons
(liquid and gaseous) to the benefit of the market as a whole and consumers and users.” (Additional Provision Eleven,
Sixth, 1(a)). The CNE was integrated in the National Commission of Markets and Competition by Act 3/2013 of
4 June 2013, on the creation of the National Commission of Markets and Competition (R-0046).

2! CNE Report 3/2007 dated 14 February 2007 concerning a proposed Royal Decree on Regulation of the Electric
Energy Production Activity under a Special Regime and Certain Technology Facilities Regulated under the Ordinary
Regime (CL-0027, R-0101).

103. In May 2007, Spain adopted RD 661/2007, which replaced the framework for the Special
Regime that had been specified in RD 436/2004.”> As stated in its preamble:

Spanish society today, in the context of reducing dependence on
foreign energy, better use of available energy sources, and a greater
awareness of the environment, is increasingly demanding the
employment of renewable sources of energy and efficiency in the
generation of electricity as basic principles in the achievement of
sustainable development from an economic, social, end
environmental point of view.

The creation of the special regime for the generation of electricity
meant an important milestone in the energy policy of our country.
The targets in respect of the promotion of renewable energy and
combined heat and power are covered in the Renewable Energy
Plan 2005-2010 and in the Strategy for Energy Saving and
Efficiency in Spain (E4), respectively. In view of the above, it can
be seen that although the growth seen overall in the special regime
for electricity generation has been outstanding, in certain
technologies the targets posed are still far from being reached.

From the point of view of compensation, the business of the
production of electrical energy under the special regime is
characterized by the possibility that the compensation system can be
supplemented by the receipt of a premium under the terms and
conditions established in the regulations, in order to determine
which such factors as the voltage level of the energy delivered into
the grid, the contribution to the improvement in the environment,
primary energy saving, energy efficiency, and the investment costs
incurred, may all be taken into account.

The economic framework established in the present Royal Decree
develops the principles provided in Law 54/1997, of 27 November,
on the Electricity Sector, guaranteeing the owners of facilities under
the special regime a reasonable return on their investments,
and the consumers of electricity an assignment of the costs
attributable to the electricity system which is also reasonable,

°5 Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 May, Regulating the Activity of Electricity Production under the Special Regime
(CL-0003, R-0071) (“RD 661/2007”), Article 1(a).

although incentives are provided to playing a part in this market
since it is considered that in this manner lower government
intervention will be achieved in the setting of prices, together with
better, more efficient, attribution of the costs of the system,
particularly in respect of the handling of diversions and the
provisions of supplementary services.°®

104. Under RD 661/2007, two options were available for producers participating in the Special

Regime, a premium relative to market prices and a “regulated tariff” (i.e., a feed-in tariff,
or “FIT”).?” Whereas the FIT under RD 436/2004 had been set with reference to prevailing
market prices, the FIT under RD 661/2007 was “a fixed sum which shall be the same for
all scheduling periods and shall be determined as a function of the Category, Group, [or]
Sub-Group to which the facility belongs, and the installed power, and where applicable

the length of time since the date of commissioning{.)’>

105. RD 661/2007 set out formulae for calculating the FITs for three categories of plants (which

depended on the capacity of the plant), and specified a reduced rate after the first twenty-
five years of operation.”° The applicable FIT was to be updated annually using a consumer
price index (“CPI”).*° In order to participate in the Special Regime, installations were
required to be registered on the Administrative Registry of Production Installations under

the Special Regime (“RAIPRE”).*!

106. Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 also provided for the review of tariffs:

During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring
reports on the degree of fulfilment of the Renewable Energies Plan
(PER) 2005-2010, and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings
Strategy in Spain (E4), together with such new targets as may be
included in the subsequent Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020,
there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and
lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with regard to
the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of

participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its

and a reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed
with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets.
Subsequently a further review shall be performed every four years,
maintaining the same criteria as previously.

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits
indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the
deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January
of the second year following the year in which the revision shall
have been performed.**

107. On 29 September 2007, the General Energy Secretary, having been advised that 85% of
the PV target defined in RD 661/2007 had been reached in September 2007,** issued an
order specifying that only PV facilities registered before 30 September 2008 could benefit
from the FITs established in RD 661/2007.*4

108. In July 2008, the CNE issued a report (CNE Report 30/2008) with respect to a
proposed Royal Decree that would govern PV facilities that were registered after the
29 September 2008 deadline that had been set by the General Energy Secretary. Noting
the unexpected growth in what it described as an “over-incentivized market,”*> the CNE
expressed its agreement with the objective of the proposed Royal Decree, i.e., the
establishment of a “system of tariffs that guides the reduction of costs of technology, so
that by moderating its expansion, cost reductions are progressively transferred to the
owners of the facilities, and ultimately to the consumer.”*® As in the 2007 CNE Report,”
CNE Report 30/2008 summarized the four criteria in the CNE’s methodology, including

the following:

b) Legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations.
Stability and predictability of economic incentives (tariffs and

premiums) reduce regulatory uncertainty, which encourages
investments in new capacity to address their projects, while
minimizing the cost of financing and thereby reducing the final cost
to the consumer. The current regulation has established annual
updates of economic incentives, based on robust indexes (such as
the IPC, ten-year bonds, etc.), and periodic reviews every four
years, which in this case only affect the new facilities.

Certainly, the principles of legal certainty and the protection of
legitimate expectations (Article 9.3 EC) do not constitute
insurmountable obstacles to the innovation of the legal system and
cannot therefore be used as instruments to petrify the legal
framework in force at any given time. In this sense, these
principles do not prevent the dynamic innovation of the regulatory
frameworks, nor of new normative provisions which can be applied
pro-future to situations initiated before it comes into force. But
these principles do require that regulatory innovation - especially if
it is abrupt, unforeseeable or unexpected - is carried out with certain
guarantees and cautions (transitional periods to adapt to the new
regimes, where appropriate compensatory measures, etc.) that
dampen, moderate and minimize, as far as possible, the
disappointing of any expectations generated by the previous
regulations.*®

109. Analyzing the proposed Royal Decree in light of its four criteria, the CNE stated:
5.2 On the criterion of minimizing regulatory uncertainty

Special-regime production facilities are often capital-intensive and
have long recovery times. The regulation of the generation facilities
under the special regime established in Royal Decree 661/2007, has
tried to minimize the regulatory risk of this group, providing
security and predictability to economic incentives during the useful
life of the facilities, by establishing transparent mechanisms to
update them annually, and by exempting existing installations from
the four-year review, since the new incentives that are being set out
only affect the new installations.

The guarantees included in this regulation allow for better
financing, with lower project costs and less impact on the electri
tariff finally paid by the consumer.*®

 

110. Royal Decree 1578/2008, regarding remuneration for PV power plants that obtained their
permanent registration after 29 September 2008, was adopted on 26 September 2008.*°
The preamble recalled that RD 661/2007 had established a new compensation framework
for renewable energy for the purpose of meeting the goals in the 2005-2010 PER, and that
the growth of installed capacity in the PV sector had been greater than expected. To avoid
excessive compensation that would have repercussions for the costs of the system and
would create disincentives for investing in research and development, the new Royal
Decree stated that it would “modify the economic regime downward, following the expected
evolution of the technology, with a long-term perspective.”*' RD 1578/2008 raised the
goals for installed capacity that had been set in RD 661/2007 and set out a “new economic
regime that stimulates technological evolution and the competitiveness of photovoltaic
facilities in Spain over the medium and long term.”

111. To guarantee a minimum market for the development of the PV sector and to ensure
continuity of the support system, RD 1578/2008 established a compensation mechanism
whereby installations were pre-registered at the beginning of development of a project (a
pre-assignment registry), “which will provide the necessary legal security to promoters
with respect to the return that the facility will earn once it is put into operation.”"*® The
specific FIT assigned to a facility depended on the pre-registration date.** On a quarterly

basis, the FIT adjustable to newly-registered plants was adjusted.*> The applicable FIT

RD 661/2007.*”

The Fifth Additional Provision of RD 1578/2008, entitled “Modification of the
compensation for generation by photovoltaic technology,” stated: “During the year 2012,
based on the technological evolution of the sector and the market, and the functioning of
the compensatory regime, compensation for the generation of electric power by
photovoltaic solar technology may be modified.” The Parties disagree about the meaning

of this provision.

Claimant refers to the laws and regulations up to and including RD 1578/2008, which was

in effect at the time of Claimant’s investment, as the “Original Regulatory Regime.”

(2) The Disputed Measures

Claimant’s case arises out of regulatory changes subsequent to RD 1578/2008, which it
describes as the “Disputed Measures.” For convenience, the Tribunal divides the

Disputes Measures into two sets of measures.

Before describing the two sets of Disputed Measures, the Tribunal provides background
information regarding the tariff deficit, i.e., the gap between the revenue of the Spanish

Electricity System (“SEE”) and the costs of regulated activities in the electricity sector.

The tariff deficit in the SEE began in the year 2000.** It increased during the global
economic crisis, which led to reduced demand for energy as compared to expectations. The
2005-2010 PER had forecast an increase in energy demand of 4% during that period,*”
which was adjusted to an annual increase of 3.72% in the PER 2011-2020.°° Energy

A 2014 Report by the European Commission stated that the tariff

117. The growth of the tariff deficit was addressed in a report prepared by the CNE in
March 2012.*° That report stated that from 2006 to 2010, average revenues from access
tolls had increased by 70% in accumulated terms, while the increase in access costs was
140%. The three most significant access costs items were Special Regime premiums
(representing 40.3% of total costs in 2010), network costs (39.8%) and the cost of financing

the accumulated deficit (10.5%).*4

118. The 2012 CNE Report forecast that the tariff deficit would continue to increase (with the
precise figures dependent on the scenario that was used) and stated that the tariff deficit
would be “unsustainable” unless measures were introduced either on revenues or regulated
costs. The 2012 CNE Report also stated that prices paid by household consumers and

industrial consumers in Spain were higher than the EU average.*°

119. As indicated below, in the summary of Party positions with respect to liability, the Parties
disagree on many points with respect to the tariff deficit, such as the contribution that PV
subsidies made to the tariff deficit and the extent to which Spain could have taken measures

other than the Disputed Measures in order to address the tariff deficit.

update FITs.*?

121. RDL 14/2010 of 23 December 2010,” entitled “on the Establishment of Urgent Measures
for the Correction of the Tariff Deficit in the Electricity Sector,” referred to the need to
address the tariff deficit. It stated that, since the adoption of RDL 6/2009 in April 2009,
“there have been a series of supervening circumstances that have had a direct impact on
the anticipated tariff deficit.” It observed that the global crisis had led to a decline in
demand for energy, while there had also been increased energy production. Producers in
the Ordinary Regime had seen a reduction in hours and wholesale prices, but those in the

Special Regime had received preferential rates. The preamble of RDL 14/2010 provided:

In formulation of these measures, care has been taken to ensure the
safeguard of the supply of electricity, in terms of universality,
quality, safety and continuity and to ensure the protection of
consumer rights for electrical power supply, under equitable terms,
as well as to ensure compliance of the targets regarding energy
efficiency and the promotion of renewable energies. In parallel,
special attention and care has been taken not to affect the economic-
financial balance of companies within the sector, and not solely for
large companies, preserving the principles of a free market, which
are governed under Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the electricity
sector, but also for sets of power generation facilities, monitoring
such, because, especially in the case of power generation companies
under the special regime, these have secured adequate and
reasonable compensation.

57 Royal Decree Law 14/2010 dated 23 December 2010, on the Establishment of Urgent Measures for the Correction
of the Tariff Deficit in the Electricity Sector (CL-0006, R-0058) (“RDL 14/2010”).

[I]t is deemed reasonable that producers under the special regime
also make a contribution to mitigate the additional costs on the
system, and such contribution must be proportionate to the
characteristics of each technology, to the degree of participation in
the generation of such additional costs and to the current extent for
compensation, whose reasonable return, nonetheless, is
guaranteed. Thus, for the same purpose, there has been
Government approval, over recent months, for regulatory measures
directed at producers of wind, solar thermal and co-generation
electricity.

Thus, in consideration of the rate of growth of photovoltaic
installations, and for safeguarding the principle of sufficiency for
compensation, due to the special impact that the deviations in the
forecast generation of this energy source have caused to the tariff
deficit, it is established, in general terms, the possibility for limiting
the recognised equivalent operating hours entitled by the prevailing
economic system.°!

122. Accordingly, RDL 14/2010 imposed a cap on the number of hours per year for which a PV
installation could sell electricity at the FIT, after which it could sell electricity at the

prevailing market rate.

123.

o

Law 15/2012,° the Law on Tax Measures for Energy Sustainability, imposed energy-
related taxes, including a tax on the value of energy production. This tax, set at the rate of
seven percent, applied, inter alia, to the remuneration received pursuant to the Special

Regime under RD 1578/2008.

RDL 2/2013 of 1 February 2013, on Urgent Measures in the Electricity System and in

effects of tax changes.

b. The Second Set of Disputed Measures

125. Subsequent changes in Spanish law and regulations (in 2013 and 2014) led to the
abolition of the Special Regime, including the FITs. The Tribunal refers to these measures
(RDL 9/2013 (12 July 2013), Law 24/2013 (26 December 2013), RD 413/2014
(6 June 2014) and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014) as the Second Set of

Disputed Measures.

12

an

RDL 9/2013 (12 July 2013) amended Law 54/1997 and abrogated RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008. It set forth “urgent measures to ensure the financial stability of the
electricity system.” Its preamble stated that the “Spanish electricity system has generated
a tariff deficit for a decade.” It indicated that between 2004 and 2012, revenues from
consumer toll fees had increased by 122%, whereas regulated costs had increased by
197%. It cited special regime premiums as having contributed in particular to this gap. It
described the situation as unsustainable, thus requiring urgent measures, and stated that

past measures had proven insufficient.
127. RDL 9/2013 amended Article 30(4) of the LSE, replacing it with the following text:

4, Additionally, and in the terms determined legally by Royal Decree
of the Council of Ministers, for the remuneration for the sale of the
energy generated, valued at market price, the facilities shall be able
to receive a specific remuneration made up of one term per power
unit installed, that covers, when appropriate, the investment costs of
standard facility that cannot be recovered by the sale of energy and
an end to the operation that covers, as applicable, the difference
between the operating costs and revenue by participation in the
market of such standard facility.

For purposes of calculating this specific remuneration, the Law
shall consider the following for any standard facility throughout its
useful life and in reference to the business activity carried out by an
efficient and well-managed company:

© Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 dated 12 July 2013, on Urgent Measures to Guarantee the Financial Stability of the
Electricity System (CL-0010, R-0064) (“RDL 9/2013”).

° RDL 9/2013.

30

a) The standard revenue for the sale of the energy generated, valued
at the production market price.

b) The standard operating costs.
c) The standard value of the initial investment.

For these purposes, this shall never include the costs or investments
determined by regulations or administrative acts which are not
applicable across the entire Spanish territory. In the same way, this
will only take into account those costs and investments that respond
exclusively to the field of production of electricity.

As a result of the unique characteristics of the insular and extra-
peninsular electricity systems, standard facilities may be defined
exceptionally for each one of them.

This remuneration scheme does not exceed the minimum level
necessary to cover the costs that allow for the facilities to compete
equally with the rest of technologies in the market and that would
lead to a reasonable rate of return by reference to the standard
facility applicable in each case. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
exceptionally the remuneration scheme may also include an
incentive for investment and the execution within a specific time
period when the facility in question involves a significant reduction
of costs in the insular and extra-peninsular systems.

This reasonable rate of return shall focus, before tax, on the average
yield in the secondary market of the Obligations of the State within
ten years by applying the appropriate differential.

The parameters of the remuneration scheme may be revised every
six years.”

128. RDL 9/2013 directed MINETUR to approve a Royal Decree applicable to existing facilities
receiving feed-in tariff remuneration, effective on the date of RDL 9/2013 (12 July 2013).

67 Td., Article 1. The Spanish original of the last two paragraphs cited above reads as follows: “Esta rentabilidad

129. Law 24/2013 eliminated the distinction between the Ordinary Regime and the Special

Regime and confirmed the changes contained in RDL 9/2013. It authorized the
establishment of a “Specific Regime” for remuneration of renewable energy
facilities. Under the Specific Regime (which applies to Claimant’s plants), remuneration
for each category of installation type is premised on the standard income, standard
operating costs and standard initial investment figure of an efficient, well-managed facility

of that category.”” Law 24/2013 also states:

The remuneration regime will not exceed the minimum level
required to cover costs which allow production installations from
renewable energy sources, high-efficiency and waste cogeneration
to compete on an equal footing with the other technologies on the
market and which allows a reasonable return to be earned on the
installation type in each applicable case. This reasonable return
will refer, before tax, to the mean yield on the secondary market for
Ten-Year State Bonds, applying the appropriate differential.”

As contemplated by RDL 9/2013, in June 2014 Spain adopted two measures providing
greater details regarding the new remuneration scheme applicable to renewable energy
facilities. These measures (RD 413/2014 and IET/1045/2014)” set out detailed parameters
for various categories of “model facilities” on which remuneration was based. Consistent
with RDL 9/2013, these remuneration parameters were effective as of the date of

RDL 9/2013 (i.e., 12 July 2013). The remuneration parameters may be amended.”

Under these provisions, the target return at the beginning of 2020 will be set with reference
to the average yield of 10-year Spanish State bonds for the 24-month period prior to the
month of May of the year preceding the beginning of each regulatory period, increased by

a to-be-specified spread. However, prior to 2020, the target return is instead based on the

Spanish law in 2007 for the purpose of constructing, installing and operating PV plants in
the Autonomous Region of Extremadura, Spain.*° Fotones operates the two PV plants at

issue in this case: Badajoz I and Badajoz II.*!

135. Between November 2007 and December 2009, Fotones followed the administrative
processes at the municipality, regional and national level related to the establishment and
operation of the “La Verilleja” PV plant, which corresponds to present-day PV plants
Badajoz I and II. Construction of the plants was authorized on 2 April 2008.8? On
29 October 2008, Fotones submitted its first applications for registration of Badajoz I and
Badajoz II in the Pre-allocation Tariff Registry.** The resolution registering Badajoz I was

issued on 10 December 2009 and the resolution registering Badajoz II was issued in

February 2010. These dates determined the FIT applicable to each plant.*+

(3) Claimant’s Acquisition of Fotones

138. On 25 March 2010, Claimant and FS Solar entered into an agreement for the purchase and
sale of all shares of Fotones.*? Some details regarding the acquisition and financing, as

described by Claimant, follow:

In connection with this acquisition [...] SolEs Badajoz paid
EUR 18,678,523 for the transfer to it of (i) a profit participating
loan of EUR 2,517,671, (ii) an intercompany loan of
EUR 15,987,197, which FS Solar had previously provided to the
Company and (iii) the reimbursement of an amount of EUR 173,655
under the agreement on remuneration and reimbursement of
expenses with the [Landesbank Baden-Wiirttemberg].

In May 2010, SolEs Badajoz began the re-financing of Fotones de
Castuera which included the execution of the following agreements:

- (i) a new intercompany loan agreement entered into on
11 May 2010 by and among SolEs Badajoz and Fotones de
Castuera for an amount of EUR 17,000,000 (the “IC Loan
Agreement”);

- (ii) a credit facility agreement dated 25 May 2010 in relation to
the erection and operation of Badajoz I and Badajoz II between
Fotones de Castuera, as borrower and two German banks (the

Castuera was extended over EUR 93,475,000 in credit. This

agreement was amended a number of times. [...]”°
Claimant also describes agreements between Fotones and two German banks governing
hedging transactions and a December 2012 participative loan agreement between SolEs

Badajoz and Fotones de Castuera.”!

Claimant states in summary that “SolEs Badajoz thus obtained third party debt funding in
the amount of EUR 93,475,000 and itself invested EUR 35.68 million (EUR 18,678,523
paid in accordance with [a share purchase agreement] and the IC Loan in the amount of

EUR 17,000,000).”°?

. According to Claimant’s witness Thomas Hopp, the mix of equity provided by the investor
and third party financing to effect the acquisition “was a typical debt financing model for
the Spanish PV sector. The project had a leverage of 72%, meaning that 72% of the initial
capital was provided by loans and the remaining 28% was provided by equity. Based on
my discussions with other investors and banks at the time, this was in the low range of
leveraging for projects in the Spanish PV sector, where leverage was frequently closer to

80% debt financing”.*

Vv. THE APPLICABLE LAW

144. The Tribunal next addresses the applicable law, a matter to which the Parties devoted
considerable attention in their post-hearing briefs. The Parties recognize that the applicable

law includes the ECT.°°

145. Both Parties have relied on the law of treaties, as reflected in the Vienna Convention on
the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”), to which both Germany and Spain are parties.°’ For

convenience, the Tribunal sets out below certain provisions of the VCLT:

Article 30. APPLICATION OF SUCCESSIVE TREATIES
RELATING TO THE SAME SUBJECT-MATTER

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the
rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties
relating to the same subject-matter shall be determined in
accordance with the following paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be
considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the
provisions of that other treaty prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the
later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in

made, inter alia, at Cl. Mem., { 409; Resp. C-Mem., { 145; and Cl. Reply, 336.

operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the
extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the
later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties
to the earlier one:

(a) As between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies
as in paragraph 3;

(b) As between a State party to both treaties and a State party to
only one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties
governs their mutual rights and obligations.

5. Paragraph 4 is without prejudice to article 41, or to any question
of the termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty under
article 60 or to any question of responsibility which may arise for a
State from the conclusion or application of a treaty the provisions
of which are incompatible with its obligations towards another State
under another treaty.

Article 31. GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION
1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their

context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall
comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and
annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between
all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the
other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

39

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that
the parties so intended.

Article 32. SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation,
including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances
of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the
application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the
interpretation according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

Article 41. AGREEMENTS TO MODIFY MULTILATERAL
TREATIES BETWEEN CERTAIN OF THE PARTIES ONLY

1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude
an agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:

(a) The possibility of such a modification is provided for by the
treaty; or

(b) The modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:
(i) Does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their
rights under the treaty or the performance of their

obligations;

(ii) Does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is
incompatible with the effective execution of the object and
purpose of the treaty as a whole.

40

146.

2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph I(a) the treaty otherwise
provides, the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their
intention to conclude the agreement and of the modification to the
treaty for which it provides.

The central disagreement between the Parties is the question whether EU law is applicable

law in respect of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and in respect of the merits.

A. The Parties’ Positions

147.

148.

149.

(dd) Claimant’s Position

According to Claimant, Article 42 of the ICSID Convention indicates that the applicable
law is the rules of law agreed by the parties to the dispute. In this case, the agreed rules of
law are those of the ECT. Article 26(6) of the ECT states that a tribunal “shall decide the
issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of
international law.” Thus, “the applicable law is first and foremost the ECT.”** Claimant

also invokes the law of treaties and the law of State responsibility.”

Claimant maintains that provisions of EU law (including rules regarding State aid) are not
applicable law because those provisions are not “principles of international law.” It states
that the European legal order is autonomous and is distinct from “general public
international law and from the ECT.”'® Claimant considers that the CJEU has made clear
that “EU law and international law are radically separate.” It states that there is no room

for the applicability of EU law to an ECT dispute.'!

Claimant addresses the awards in Electrabel v. Hungary and Blusun v. Italy, on which
Respondent relies. Claimant asserts that the key holding in Electrabel was that “EU law
as a whole is part of the international legal order,’ which the tribunal in Electrabel stated
in the context of rejecting claimant’s argument that only EU treaties were part of

international law. According to Claimant, the tribunal in Electrabel did not consider the

4l

distinct nature of the EU legal order within the international legal order and did not take
proper account of the characterization of the European legal order by the CJEU
itself. Claimant asserts that the tribunal in Blusun failed to offer any explanation for

applying EU law in that case. '?

150. For these reasons, Claimant considers that “EU law is simply not applicable to a dispute
governed by the ECT, whether regarding jurisdiction, or the merits.”!°> EU law is also
inapplicable as domestic law, according to Claimant. Under Article 27 of the VCLT, a
State cannot rely on domestic law as an excuse for failing to comply with treaty
obligations.!°' “EU law can only be relevant at most as fact since it is part of a legal order

which is distinct from the ECT and the general public international order.” !°

(2) Respondent’s Position

151.

Respondent recognizes that the ECT is applicable law. Like Claimant, Respondent also
relies on the law of treaties as applicable law. It has raised no objection to Claimant’s

reliance on the law of State responsibility.

15

N

Respondent asserts that EU law is applicable law. It states that EU law has a triple nature,
as international law, as domestic law and as fact.!°° It maintains that the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (““TFEU”) sets out rules that have priority over other
tules. As an international treaty, the TFEU is international law between Germany and
Spain, according to public international law. The Tribunal is bound by ECT Article 26(6)
to apply “applicable rules of and principles of international law.”'*’ Respondent also

relies on a November 2017 decision of the European Commission that states that “Union

102 Jd., 26 (referring to Electrabel S.A v, Hungary, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable

103 Td. , {| 28 (footnotes omitted).

104 7. Y¥f 29-31. Under Article 27 of the VCLT, a party to a treaty “may not invoke the provisions of its internal law
as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.”

106 See infra, | 161.
7 See Resp. PHB, 19.

42

law provides for a complete set of rules on investment protection” and that EU law is part

of the applicable law in an intra-EU dispute. !°°

153. Respondent maintains that applicable EU laws “are not only the TFEU but also the relevant
rules on energy matters of EU,” such as directives.'°? Respondent states that this has been
the conclusion of tribunals in Electrabel, Blusun and Wirtgen v. Czech Republic.'!° It
considers that Claimant’s observations regarding Electrabel and Blusun are nothing more
than a disagreement with the conclusions of those tribunals. According to Respondent, the

body of EU law applicable to this case includes the case law of the CJEU."!!

154. Respondent also asserts that EU law is applicable as domestic law, as a relevant
fact. It maintains that Claimant was aware of the applicability of EU law regarding state
aid''? and of the “binding nature of EU Laws in the Spanish framework.”!? Spain

considers that Claimant distorts Respondent’s position on “the relevance of EU law as

internal Spanish law.” Respondent does not invoke the applicability of EU law as an

excuse for failing to comply with the ECT. Instead, “[t]he relevance of its application as

a fact is that the EU state aid rules are essential to assess the objective and reasonable

Expectations of the Claimant.”

B. The Tribunal’s Analysis

155. In articulating their positions with respect to applicable law, both Parties invoke

Article 26(6) of the ECT, which states that a tribunal “shall decide the issues in dispute in

Affairs and Cooperation from the European Commission, entitled “Support for Electricity Generation from Renewable

accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international

law.” They disagree on whether EU law is part of “international law.”

15

an

The positions of both Parties are premised on the view that Article 26(6) governs not only
the law applicable to the merits, but also the law that governs the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. Thus, the Tribunal first considers whether the phrase “issues in dispute” in
Article 26(6) has a scope that extends beyond the dispute on the merits to determine the

law that governs the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

15

n

Paragraph (6) of Article 26 of the ECT must be interpreted in its context, i.e., in light of
other provisions of the Treaty,'!> including the other paragraphs of Article 26, entitled
“Settlement of Disputes between and Investor and a Contracting Party’. Article 26(1)
states that “[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting
Party [...] which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of [...] Part IIT’ of the ECT
“shall, if possible, be settled amicably”.''© Part III of the ECT contains the substantive
standards of investment treatment, including those on which Claimant relies in this
case. Paragraph (2) is the first of a series of paragraphs of Article 26 that address the
circumstances in which “such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1).” Absent an indication to the contrary, the phrase “issues in dispute” in
paragraph (6) of Article 26 can be expected to have the same scope as paragraph (1), which
refers to disputes that “concern an alleged breach of an obligation [...] under Part II,” in
other words, to the merits of a dispute. If the drafters of the ECT had intended the scope
of Article 26(6) to extend beyond Part III of the ECT, such that it governed the law to be
applied by Tribunal to decide whether it had jurisdiction over a dispute, they could have so
indicated. Article 16 of the ECT, which addresses the relationship between the ECT and

other treaties, for example, refers both to Part III and Part V (Dispute Settlement). !!7

4S VCLT, Article 31(1) and 31(2).
46 ECT, Article 26(1).

'!7 Article 16 addresses situations in which “two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international
agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter
of Part III or V of this Treaty.”

44

158. Claimant asserts jurisdiction on the basis of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and
Article 26 of the ECT. For purposes of arbitration within the framework of the ICSID
Convention, the Tribunal considers that Article 26(6) operates as a choice of law provision,

as contemplated by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:

The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules
of law_as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such
agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State
party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and
such rules of international law as may be applicable.
(Emphasis added).

159. Thus, Article 26(6) contains the agreement of the disputing parties as to the law to be
applied to the dispute that concerns an alleged breach of an obligation of a Contracting
Party under Part III of the ECT and states the law applicable to the merits. It does not assist
the Tribunal in addressing the effect of EU law on its jurisdiction. This matter will be

considered when the Tribunal addresses Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction.

160. Turning to the law applicable to the merits, Article 26(6) requires the Tribunal to
decide the dispute in accordance with the ECT and “applicable rules and principles of

international law.” These applicable rules and principles unquestionably include the
law of treaties, and, where applicable, the law of State responsibility. The Tribunal focuses
here on Claimant’s contention that EU law is not “international law” for purposes

of Article 26(6).

161.

Respondent has asserted that EU law has a “triple nature,” as international law, as domestic
law and as fact. The ECT does not identify domestic law as a source of applicable law. The
Tribunal therefore considers that, when EU law is understood to operate as Spain’s
domestic law, it operates as fact.''* For purposes of determining the applicable law, the
Tribunal sets aside Respondent’s invocations of EU law as domestic law or fact (to be

considered when the Tribunal reaches the merits) and addresses the question whether

ARB/07/22, Award dated 23 September 2010 (RL-0039) (“AES Summit”), {| 7.6.6, describing EU competition law
as having a dual nature, as an international law regime and as national law, which is to be considered as fact.

45

EU law provides “applicable rules and principles of international law,

ECT Article 26(6).

pursuant to

162. Claimant alleges breaches of the ECT, which, as the Parties recognize, is to be interpreted
and applied pursuant to the law of treaties. In the interpretation and application of the ECT,
the ECT itself and the law of treaties can call for examination of other treaties. A clear
example of this possibility is found in Article 16 of the ECT, pursuant to which the
substantive protections of another “international agreement” cannot derogate from the
investor protections contained in Part III of the ECT if the provisions of the ECT are more
favorable to the Investor or the Investment than are the provisions of the other international
agreement. More generally, when the ECT is interpreted and applied pursuant to the
VCLT, treaties other than the ECT could also play a role as applicable law in a variety of
ways, e.g., aS agreements relevant to the interpretation of the ECT (pursuant to Article 31
of the VCLT) or as agreements that modify the ECT (pursuant to VCLT Article 40). Thus,
under both the ECT and the law of treaties, there are circumstances in which the provisions
of a treaty other than the ECT could have an impact on the substantive law to be applied in
a dispute in which a breach of Part III of the ECT is alleged and thus can play a role as

applicable law.

163. Under Claimant’s approach, however, EU treaties would not be “international agreements”
that fall with within the scope Article 16 of the ECT, nor would they be considered
“treaties” or “‘agreements” under the VCLT. The VCLT defines a treaty as “an
international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by
international law{.]”!'? In the view of the Tribunal, EU treaties are clearly “international
agreements” under ECT Article 16 and “treaties” and “agreements” under the
VCLT. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that EU treaties cannot be excluded as
potential sources of “applicable rules and principles of international law” within the

meaning of ECT Article 26(6).

49 VCLT, Article 2(1)(a).

46

164. However, under Article 16 of the ECT, a provision of another treaty can only operate as
the rule of decision that supplants the investment protection provisions of Part III of the
ECT if that other treaty provides substantive protections that are more favorable to
investors than are the investment protection provisions of Part III of the ECT. Claimant

has not invoked any such provision in an EU treaty, nor does the Tribunal find one to exist.

165. A fortiori, even assuming that an EU instrument that is derived from an EU treaty (such as
a decision of the European Commission) could be regarded as international law for
purposes of Article 26(6) of the ECT, it follows from Article 16 of the ECT that the
provisions of an EC decision could replace an investor protection provisions of the ECT as
arule of decision only if the EC decision contained investor protection provisions that were
more favorable to investors than are the provisions of Part III of the ECT. No such

provision has been identified in this proceeding.

166. Respondent asserts that European Commission decisions on State aid are binding,
referring in particular on a 2017 decision in which the European Commission concluded
that Spain’s current regime for remuneration of renewable energy providers meets EU
requirements for State aid.'?° Respondent points to the finding of the tribunal in Electrabel
that EU law was applicable law (in a case arising under the ECT), including the EU “droit
dérivé’, such as decisions of the European Commission.!?! The tribunal in Electrabel
made this observation in a case in which the claimant’s “principal claim” was that the
respondent had violated the ECT by terminating an agreement “following a legally binding
order of the European Commission,” which the claimant did not dispute was legally

binding on the respondent under EU law.!”

By contrast, even assuming that some
statements in the 2017 decision could be “binding” on Spain under EU law, the 2017
decision invoked by Respondent could not have operated as law governing Respondent’s

imposition of the Disputed Measures on Claimant and other investors in 2010-2013.

168.

169.

170.

For the forgoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the applicable law in this case is the
Energy Charter Treaty, interpreted pursuant to the law of treaties and supplemented by the
customary international law of State responsibility. For the reasons stated in the preceding

paragraphs, EU law is not part of the law applicable in this case.

PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

Claimant asserts jurisdiction on the basis of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and
Article 26 of the ECT. It maintains that all requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention are met.!?? Respondent has not disputed that the jurisdictional requirements

of the ICSID Convention have been met.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention

are met:

e Spain has been an ICSID Contracting State since 17 September 1994.

e Claimant is a company incorporated in Germany, which has been an ICSID
Contracting State since 18 May 1969, and thus is a “national of another
Contracting State’ within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention.

e Claimant’s shareholding, interests and other rights in Fotones constitute an
“investment” for purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

e There is a legal dispute between Claimant and Respondent arising directly out of
Spain’s alleged acts and omissions with respect to Claimant’s investment in Spain
which, according to Claimant, violate Respondent’s obligations under the ECT.

Jurisdiction pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention also depends on the Parties’
consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre. Claimant maintains that Spain has given its
consent pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT. However, Respondent has lodged two
objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, which can be understood as a contention that it
did not consent to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and Article 26 of the ECT:

17.

1. First, Respondent maintains that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide this case. It
argues that Claimant is not a protected investor since Article 26 of the ECT does not apply
to disputes between a national of the EU and an EU member State and asserts that EU law
takes precedence over the ECT and bars the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.!7* Claimant opposes

this objection and submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction. !2>

N

Second, Respondent maintains that Spain’s 7% tax on the value of the production of
electrical energy through the enactment of Law 15/2012 (the “TVPEE”), is a taxation
measure that is excluded from the scope of ECT Article 10(1) (which includes the FET
standard and the umbrella clause), by virtue of ECT Article 21. Accordingly, the Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction over Claimant’s claim of alleged breaches of Article 10(1) of the ECT
based on the adoption of the TVPEE.!?° Claimant opposes this objection and submits that
the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide alleged violations of Article 10(1) of the ECT in

relation to the enactment of Law 15/2012.!77

3. Respondent also submits an admissibility objection. It argues that Claimant cannot submit
at the present time claims concerning an alleged breach of Article 13 of the ECT on
expropriation related to Respondent’s adoption of the TVPEE. Respondent acknowledges
that taxation measures are applicable to Article 13 of the ECT; however, Article 21(5) of
the ECT requires Claimant (or the Tribunal, as applicable) to first refer the issue to the
competent national tax authorities for a six-month period.'?* Claimant opposes this
objection and submits that its claim on expropriation based on the enactment of

Law 15/2012 is admissible. !7°

'4. Before setting out the Parties’ positions in respect of Respondent’s preliminary objections,

the Tribunal makes three preliminary points.

175. First, although the main thrust of each Party’s position on the preliminary objections has
remained constant, there has been considerable variation in the precise formulations used
by the Parties in support of their positions. A number of awards relating to the renewable
energy sector have been issued or made public during the pendency of this case, and the
Parties understandably have taken into account those awards as they have become
available. The summary of Party positions that appears below is intended to set out their
positions, without capturing each and every point made by a Party. The Tribunal has
considered the various arguments presented by each Party in support of its positions,

including the arguments not summarized below.

176. Second, Respondent took note in the written pleadings of a case that was then pending
before the CJEU, which presented the question of the compatibility between a bilateral
investment treaty and EU law.'°? The CJEU delivered its Judgment in that case, Achmea
v. Slovakia,'*! after the Parties had completed their written submissions and prior to the
Hearing. The Parties presented their respective views on the implications of the Achmea
Judgment at the Hearing. For the convenience of the reader, the Tribunal will summarize
that Judgment in paragraphs 190-198 below before it sets out the Parties’ positions on

the Judgment.

177. Third, as noted in Procedural Order No. 6, the Parties agreed at the Hearing that their post-
hearing briefs would not address questions of jurisdiction and admissibility. The summary
of Party positions on these matters is based on positions taken by the Parties in their written

pleadings and at the Hearing.

S

(dd) The Parties’ Positions
a. Respondent’s Position

Among the various arguments that Respondent has presented in support of its jurisdictional

objection ratione personae, there are two main strands.

First, Respondent maintains that the ECT should be interpreted such that there is no
jurisdiction over a dispute brought by an Investor of one ECT Contracting Party against
another Contracting Party if both Contracting Parties are also Member States of the
European Union. It advances an implied exception to Article 26 of the ECT for these

“intra-EU disputes,”

which it supports with reference to the text of various ECT
provisions and the purposes of the ECT. It maintains that the ECT was negotiated against
the backdrop of a principle of primacy of EU law, which must be taken into account in

interpreting the Treaty.

The second strand of Respondent’s jurisdictional objection, which would apply even if the
Tribunal rejected Respondent’s interpretation of the ECT, is the contention that EU law
has priority over other treaty obligations of EU Member States and, in particular, that the
TFEU takes precedence over the dispute settlement provisions of the ECT. At the Hearing,
it placed particular emphasis on the Judgment of the CJEU in Achmea v. Slovakia. '*?

(i) The Contention that there is an Implied Exception from Article 26(1) of

the ECT for Intra-EU disputes

Respondent notes that the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in Article 26(1) of the
ECT requires the dispute to be between a Contracting Party and an investor of another

Contracting Party.'** Respondent argues that this provision “inevitably implies” the

'32 The Tribunal uses the term “intra-EU dispute” to refer only to the situation in the present case, in which both the
claimant’s State of nationality and the respondent State were members States of the European Community when the
ECT was negotiated and ratified by the two States and the claimant invoked the ICSID Convention and the ECT as
the basis for jurisdiction. It takes no position on other circumstances in which expressions such as “intra-EU dispute”
are sometimes used.

exclusion from Article 26 of disputes between EU nationals and EU member States, in
relation to intra-7EU disputes and investments made within the EU (“intra-

EU investments”). '*>

Respondent explains that Germany (Claimant’s country of nationality) and Spain are
member States of the EU, as was the case at the time of their respective ratifications of the
ECT. As such, they were unable to contract obligations between themselves within the
framework of the EU internal energy market. In turn, according to Respondent, the EU, as
the organization to which its member States had granted their sovereignty with regard to
the internal energy market, became a Contracting Party to the ECT.'*° Claimant is
therefore not an Investor of another Party, nor is it from the “area” of another Contracting
Party, as required by Article 26(1) of the ECT.'*’ Respondent concludes that Article 26 of
the ECT cannot generate any obligations between EU member States,!** and Claimant
cannot therefore be considered as “an Investor of another Contracting Party”, as required

under this provision.

Respondent considers that there is “Jiteral recognition in the ECT itself’! that the ECT
does not apply to intra-EU investments and intra-EU disputes. The conclusion follows
from the interpretation, purpose and context of the ECT.'#° In Respondent’s view, from a
literal interpretation of provisions such as Articles 1(2), 1(3), 25 and 26(6) of the ECT, the
following can be observed:

e Article 1(2): Regional Economic Integration Organisations (“REIOs”) are included

in the definition of Contracting Parties, and the EU is the only REIO that is a party
to the ECT.'4!

e Article 1(3): The definition of REIOs explicitly recognizes their authority to take
decisions binding on their member States in respect of certain matters a number of
which are governed by the ECT. If the ECT had not wanted to consider that part
of the matters comprised by it were exclusively decided by the EU, such
formulation would not have been adopted. !

e Article 25: This provision excludes from the application of the ECT’s most favored
nation clause the preferential treatment applicable between parties to an economic
integration agreement, thereby preventing the intra-EU investment promotion and
protection system from extending to ECT signatory States that are not
EU member States. '*3

e Article 26(6): This provision sets forth that disputes shall be decided in accordance
with the ECT “and applicable rules and principles of international law.” In this
case, EU law is applicable international law and its rules and principles must be
applied with the same hierarchy as the ECT itself. Therefore, the initiation of
arbitration proceedings under the ECT by an EU investor against an EU member
State would be contrary to EU law and incompatible with the content of
Article 26(6).!4

184. According to Respondent, to consider that intra-EU disputes are covered by the ECT would
defeat the purpose of the ECT. The intention of the EU and its member States in
concluding the ECT was not to cover the area of intra-EU investments, which had been
already covered by EU law.'4> Respondent relies on the preamble of the ECT to indicate
that its purpose was to promote industrial cooperation between the East and the West, and
to speed up the economic recovery of Eastern Europe through cooperation in the

energy sector. !4°

185. In support of its proposed interpretation of the ECT, Respondent asserts that the primacy
of EU law is “the essential Principle” upon which its jurisdictional objection ratione
personae rests.'*”7 The ECT must be interpreted in light of the jurisprudence of the CJEU

that was in effect when the ECT was concluded. Respondent explains that the principle of

primacy was first established by the CJEU in the Costa v. ENEL judgment of 1964 and
means that EU law has preference and prevails over the application of any other law
(national or international) when regulating internal EU relations.'** It also invokes a 1991
Opinion in which the CJEU found the draft Agreement to Create a European Economic
Area to be incompatible with the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, in light of
Article 219 of the European Economic Community (EEC) Treaty (the predecessor of
Article 344 of the TFEU), pursuant to which Member States undertook not to submit
disputes concerning interpretation or application of the EEC Treaty to any method of

dispute settlement not provided by the EEC Treaty. !4°

Respondent considers that the principle of primacy of EU law is explicitly recognized in
Article 25 of the ECT as it refers to ‘preferential treatment’. The European
Communities made an explicit declaration in relation to Article 25 to the effect that its
application would only allow those derogations necessary to safeguard the preferential

treatment resulting from the European Communities. '*!

Respondent claims that the principle of primacy of EU law should be respected because
the present dispute affects essential elements of EU Law (such as State aid, free movement
of capital and freedom of establishment), which fall under the competence of the EU’s own

judicial system and, ultimately, of the CJEU.'*?

Respondent also considers that to uphold jurisdiction in this case would be contrary to the
principle of non-discrimination between EU investors. This would allow Claimant to
resort to a dispute settlement mechanism outside the EU’s judicial system to resolve what

is an intra-EU dispute, to which Spanish investors have no access. '*>

(ii) The Effect of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
(Including the Implications of Achmea v. Slovakia)

190. Before setting out Respondent’s position, the Tribunal summarizes the relevant parts of

the Judgment of the CJEU in Achmea v. Slovakia.

191.

In Achmea, the CJEU considered a request from the Federal Court of Justice of Germany

for a preliminary ruling:

(1) Does Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision
in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member
States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT) under
which an investor of a Contracting State, in the event of a dispute
concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may bring
proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal
where the investment protection agreement was concluded before
one of the Contracting States acceded to the European Union but
the arbitral proceedings are not to be brought until after that date?

If Question 1 is to be answered in the negative:

(2) Does Article 267 TFEU preclude the application of such
a provision?

If Questions 1 and 2 are to be answered in the negative:

154 See, e.g., Resp. Rej., | 109, citing SA.40171 (2015/NN).

Treaty”, Journal of International Economic Law 15 (1), Oxford University Press, 2012 (RL-0064), pp. 101, 103
and 108.

55

(3) Does the first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU preclude the
application of such a provision under the circumstances described
in Question 1?'°°

192. Article 267 TFEU provides in its relevant part:

193. Article 344 of the TFEU provides that: “Member States undertake not to submit a dispute
concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement

other than those provided for therein.

194. The request of the Federal Court of Justice was made in the context of a proceeding to
enforce an award against Slovakia issued by a tribunal constituted pursuant to the
Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, to which
Slovakia succeeded in 1993 (the “Netherlands-Slovakia BIT”). As the CJEU noted,

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction
to give preliminary rulings concerning:

(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions,
bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;

Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a
Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a
decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment,
request the Court to give a ruling thereon.

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court
or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no
judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall
bring the matter before the Court.

195. In Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, the Contracting Parties consent to arbitration
of “disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party
concerning an investment of the latter” if the dispute has not been settled amicably within

a period of six months.'*’ Article 8(6) of the BIT also addresses the applicable law:

The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in
particular though not exclusively:

- the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

- the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements between the
Contracting Parties;

- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;
- the general principles of international law.'

196. In respect of the first and second questions of the Federal Court of Justice, related to

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, the CJEU framed the issues as follows:

[T]he referring court essentially asks whether Articles 267 and 344
TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as
Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those
Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments
in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter
Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that
Member State has undertaken to accept.'°!

197. According to the CJEU, an arbitral tribunal convened pursuant to the Netherlands-

Slovakia BIT “may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law,” pursuant to
Article 8(6) of the BIT.'® However, because such an arbitral tribunal is not a court or

tribunal of a Member State, it is not entitled to seek a preliminary ruling from the CJEU. In

'59 See Slowakische Republik v. Achmea BV (CJEU Case No. C-284/16), Opinion of the Advocate General dated
19 September 2017 (CL-0119) (“Opinion of the Advocate General”), J 13 (citing the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT,
Article 8(1) and (2)).

s7

addition, an award rendered by such a tribunal is subject only to limited review in the courts

of EU Member States.'°*

Consequently, having regard to all the characteristics of the arbitral
tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT [...], it must be considered
that, by concluding the BIT, the Member States parties to it
established a mechanism for settling disputes between an investor
and a Member State which could prevent those disputes from being
resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law,
even though they might concern the interpretation or application of
that law.

198. The CJEU therefore ruled:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between
Member States, such as Article8 of the Agreement on
encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between
the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak
Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those
Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments
in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter
Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that
Member State has undertaken to accept.‘

199. In its written pleadings, Respondent maintained that the EU legal system for the protection
of EU investors prevails over the protection of investors that is provided by the ECT. In
the present case, Claimant’s investment was made within the framework of the Internal
Market in Electricity of the EU. It follows that the dispute should be resolved within the
EU legal system, per Article 344 of the TFEU.'® Otherwise, if the Tribunal were to

resolve the dispute presented in this arbitration, it would have to deliver an opinion on the

tights of EU investors in the framework of the Internal Market in Electricity, which would

interfere with the competence of the EU judicial system.!°

Thus, Respondent submits that EU law precludes recourse to any dispute settlement
mechanism other than that established by its treaties, which may interfere with its Internal
Market (i.e., an area without internal borders that ensures the free movement, inter alia, of
services and capital).'®* Such market includes an Internal Market in Electricity, which is
regulated, inter alia, through a number of directives.'©? Spain asserts that the promotion
of investment that it made in renewable energies was enshrined in the obligations that it
undertook, as an EU member State, to achieve the aims established by these
EU directives.'”” Respondent argues that, because the EU jurisdictional system has the
exclusive competence to interpret EU Law, and one of the main aims of the aforementioned
directives is to protect investors, the institutional and judicial framework of the
EU provides the appropriate means and legal remedies in case the rights of EU nationals

are violated. !7!

According to Respondent, although the Judgment in Achmea involved a bilateral
investment treaty, the reasoning of the CJEU in Achmea applies equally to the
ECT. Respondent points out that the CJEU interpreted the TFEU to preclude an investor-
State arbitration provision in “an international agreement concluded between Member
States... [s]uch as” the BIT at issue in that case, and thus is not limited to an agreement
between two Member States.'’? The jurisprudence on which the CJEU relies in Achmea

includes prior decisions in which the CJEU addressed multilateral treaties.'"> Respondent

20!

N

Respondent states that the “prerequisites” set out in Achmea are met in the present case:
The Tribunal has to interpret and apply EU law. The CJEU cannot exercise its powers
through a preliminary ruling, and, under the ICSID Convention, the review of the award
rendered by the Tribunal “cannot be made by the European Court of Justice totally.” Asa

result, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. 175

203.

a

Respondent also states that:

The Achmea case ruling affirms that the principle of primacy of the
European Union law precludes that intra-European Union disputes
regarding investments could be solved by arbitral tribunals. This is
admitted under the international law, because Article 41(b) of the
Vienna Convention allows that two or more of the parties of a
multilateral treaty may modify a multilateral treaty when it affects
only procedural rules.

So the international law allows that in 2008 the Member States of
the European Union modified between them the priority of the
methods to resolve disputes between the Member States.'"°

Respondent cites in support of its position the November 2017 decision communicated by
the European Commission to Spain.!”” In that communication, the Commission referred
to the pendency of “investor-State arbitration against Spain on the basis of the Energy
Charter Treaty against the changes brought by the Royal Decree 413/2014 to beneficiaries

of the premium remuneration scheme it replaces.”'”* It stated, in relevant part:

The Commission considers that any provision that provides for
investor-State arbitration between two Member States is contrary to
Union law; in particular, this concerns Article 19(1) TEU, the
principles of the freedom of establishment, the freedom to provide
services and the free movement of capital, as established by the

Treaties (in particular Articles 49, 52, 56, and 63 TFEU), as well as
Articles 64(2), 65(1), 66, 75, 107, 108, 215, 267 and Article 344
TFEU, and the general principles of Union law of primacy, unity
and effectiveness of Union law, of mutual trust and of legal
certainty.

[...] Union law provides for a complete set of rules on investment
protection (in particular in Articles 49, 52, 56, and 63 TFEU, as
well as Articles 64(2), 65(1), 66, 75 and 215 TFEU). Member States
are hence not competent to conclude bilateral or multilateral
agreements between themselves, because by doing so, they may
affect common rules or alter their scope. As the two sets of rules on
investment protection potentially applicable between an EU
Member State and an investor of another State (i.e. the Treaties and
intra-EU bilateral investment treaties (BITs) or the ECT in an intra-
EU setting) are not identical in content and are applied by different
adjudicators, there is also a risk of conflicts between the
international investment treaty and Union law.

[...] The resulting treaty conflict is to be solved, in line with the
case-law of the Court, on the basis of the principle of primacy in
favour of Union law. For those reasons, ECT does not apply to
investors from other Member States initiating disputes against
another Member States."

b. Claimant’s Position

205. Claimant opposes Respondent’s jurisdictional objection ratione personae. In its view, the
ECT applies to intra-EU investments and intra-EU disputes and provides jurisdiction over

its claims.

201

an

Claimant submits that it is a protected investor under Article 26 of the ECT and that there
is no implied exception to the ECT for intra-EU investments or intra-EU disputes. It also
opposes Respondent’s argument that the EU legal system prevails over the investor
protections of the ECT and disagrees with the conclusions that Respondent draws from the

Achmea Judgment.

179 Td., 160-163 (footnotes omitted).

61

 

(i) The ECT ins no implied exception for intra-EU i
207. Claimant states that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide this case since there exists a

dispute between a “Contracting Party” and an “Investor of another Contracting Party”, as

required under Article 26 of the ECT.

208. Claimant indicates that the Parties satisfy the definitions of these terms, as set out in
Articles 1(2) and 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT, respectively. Spain qualifies as a “Contracting
Party” as it is a “state [...] which has consented to be bound by [the ECT] and for which
the Treaty is in force.”'®® Claimant is “a company [...] organized in accordance with the
law applicable in [a] Contracting Party” (in this case, a company organized under the laws
of Germany). Therefore, Claimant is an Investor of a Contracting Party.'*! By extension,
Claimant’s investments in Spain qualify as “an Investment of [an Investor of a Contracting

Party] in the Area of [another] Contracting Party” under Article 26(1) of the Treaty. !*?

209. Accordingly, because Spain is a Contracting Party and SolEs Badajoz is an Investor from
the Area of another Contracting Party, according to the terms of the ECT, Claimant

concludes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae in this case. '*°

210. Claimant also disputes the conclusions that Respondent draws from various provisions of
the ECT. In Claimant’s view, from a reading of provisions such as Articles 1(2), 1(3), 25
and 26(6) of the ECT, which have been invoked by Respondent to imply that the Tribunal

lacks jurisdiction, the following can be observed:

e Article 1(2): Claimant agrees with Respondent that this provision provides the
definition of a REIO, the EU being the only REIO that is a party to the
ECT.'*4 Claimant argues that, as a REIO, the EU is a party to the ECT, and the
member States of the EU are also parties to the ECT and are each bound by the
ECT, in their own capacity. Claimant submits that the ECT makes no exception to
jurisdiction as to a dispute between State that is a party to the ECT and an investor
of another State party to the ECT on the basis that both States are also members of

62

the same REIO. Accordingly, there cannot be an exception to jurisdiction for intra-
EU disputes under the ECT. !8°

e Article 1(3): Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s interpretation of this
provision. Claimant notes that Spain cannot establish that the EU (then the
European Economic Community (“EEC”)) member States transferred competence
over energy investments and their protection to the EEC at the time they signed the
ECT. In fact, the Lisbon Treaty, which transferred to the EU exclusive competence
over investment protection, was not signed until 2007.'*°

e Article 25: Claimant indicates that Respondent has failed to establish why and how
this provision impacts the arbitration clause of the ECT. Claimant explains that the
fact that the benefits extended among EU member States do not automatically
extend to non-EU signatories of the ECT “does not exclude the fact that EU
Member States are bound by other obligations under a different treaty regime, in
this case, the arbitration clause of the EcT.”'87

Claimant also considers that the EC’s declaration under Article 25 of the ECT
mentioned by Respondent is a limited carve-out from the ECT that allows
EU Member States to extend benefits between themselves without an obligation to
extend them to non-EU Members and in fact suggests that outside the “necessary”
“derogations” from the ECT rules, the ECT provisions will prevail.!**

e Article 26(6): Claimant recalls that, pursuant to this provision, tribunals established
under the ECT shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this treaty and
applicable rules and principles of international law. Claimant argues that the
primary applicable law in this case is the ECT itself (as the dispute concerns
breaches of the FET, expropriation and the umbrella clause contained in the ECT),
and not EU law.!*°

211. In addition, Claimant rejects Respondent’s assertion that the inclusion of intra-EU disputes
within the ECT would defeat the purpose of the ECT. Claimant relies, inter alia, on the
findings of the Eiser tribunal, which found nothing in the ECT to justify the exclusion of a
large category of investors and potential disputes from its scope.!*° That is, nothing in the

ECT allows a disparity of treatment that would result in “a mandatory and unjustified

non-EU disputes being resolved through the ECT’s dispute settlement mechanisms).'°! On
the contrary, Claimant notes that the purpose of ECT Article 26 is to provide investors with
a choice of dispute settlement fora, and that such free choice constitutes an integral part of

the guarantees that are provided by the ECT. !°?

212. Claimant refutes Spain’s reliance on a “principle of primacy of EU law” to contest

Claimant’s argument that there is no requirement or justification to apply EU law in this
case.!°? It rejects Respondent’s contention that provisions of the ECT such as Article 25

explicitly recognize EU primacy.!*

213. Contrary to Respondent’s assertion, Claimant submits that the EU legal system does not

confer particular protections upon EU investors which are preferable to the protection
conferred by the ECT. The ECT provides investors with a wide range of protections,
including guarantees against discrimination and the FET standard under

international law.!°°

214. Claimant considers Respondent’s assertions to be irrelevant in view of Article 16(2) of the

ECT, which provides that if ECT Contracting Parties enter into international agreements
addressing matters covered by Parts III (“Investment Promotion and Protection”) or V
(“Dispute Settlement”) of the ECT, any provision which is more favorable to the investor
or investment shall prevail.!°° Under Part V, Article 26(1) and (2) of the ECT, an investor
may choose to submit a dispute for resolution (a) to the courts or tribunals of the
Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, (b) in accordance with another previously

agreed procedure or (c) to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with

Article 26. The ECT’s option of giving investors access to international arbitration is more

favourable than litigation before Spanish courts, pursuant to EU law.!””

5. Thus, according to Claimant, pursuant to Article 16(2) of the ECT, provisions of
subsequent EU agreements (including the TFEU, on which Respondent relies) cannot
prevail over more favorable protections granted to investors by the ECT, such as the right

to dispute settlement under Part V of the ECT.!°*
(ii) The TFEU and the Achmea Judgment have no effect on the Tribunal’s
Jurisdiction
6. Claimant submits that the present case does not involve the interpretation and application

of EU law and, even if it did, that would not preclude the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over

this dispute. !°

_

Claimant dismisses Respondent’s reliance on Article 344 of the TFEU to conclude that
such provision impedes Spain from referring matters relating to the Internal Market in
Electricity to arbitration as it would require the Tribunal to rule on the rights of an EU
investor and to apply EU law.? Claimant notes that this case does not involve the
interpretation and application of EU Law. It concerns violations of certain provisions of
the ECT. Therefore, the primary applicable law is the ECT itself.?°! Claimant refers to the

findings of the tribunals in Eiser, Charanne, and Isolux in support of this assertion.7°

8. In its Rejoinder, Claimant notes that the ECT and EU law are two distinct regimes under
international law, and such autonomy is reinforced by the fact that Claimant’s claim is

brought under the ECT and not under EU law.?°? Claimant highlights that a foreign

219. Claimant cites the Charanne award to the effect that there is no rule of EU law that prevents
an arbitral tribunal from applying EU law to resolve a dispute between an EU investor and

multilateral treaties, there would be no clash between the ECT and EU law because the
ECT, as a treaty concluded by the EU, is part of EU law.?'4 Claimant also states that, even
if there were a clash between the ECT and EU law, it would be resolved pursuant to
Article 27 of the VCLT, which provides that a party may not invoke its internal law as

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

a. The Contention that the ECT Contains an Implied Exception for
“Intra-EU Disputes”

223.

o

The contention that the ECT does not apply to intra-EU investments and intra-EU disputes
calls for the interpretation of the ECT. Consistent with Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the
Tribunal interprets the ECT in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, in their

context and in light of the object and purpose of the treaty.

22:

-

The starting point is an examination of definitions in Article 1 of the ECT of terms that are
used in the jurisdictional article (Article 26). A company incorporated under the laws of a

Contracting Party (such as Claimant, incorporated under the laws of Germany) fits within

213 Rev. Tr. Day 1 (ENG), 12:4 (Mr. Oyewole). Claimant invokes the award in Masdar in support of this conclusion

the definition of “Investor” in Article 1(7)(a)(ii). Respondent is a State that is a Contracting
Party of the ECT as defined in ECT Article 1(2). The dispute that is the subject of this case
arises out of Claimant’s investment in the land territory of Spain and thus in the “Area” of

Respondent, as defined in ECT Article 1(10)(a).

225. Article 26, entitled “Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and a Contracting Party,”
applies to a dispute between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting
Party “relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an
alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III.”?!® Claimant has exercised
the choice of procedure available to it under Article 26(2) of the ECT by initiating
arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Convention. By becoming a Contracting Party to the
ECT, the Kingdom of Spain has consented unconditionally to the submission of such a
dispute to arbitration (ECT Article 26(3)). Taking into account the ordinary meaning of
Articles 1 and 26, the present case concerns a dispute over which this Tribunal

has jurisdiction.

226. According to Respondent, however, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae
because “[b]oth Germany, the country of the Claimant, and the Kingdom of Spain are
member States of the European Union{, which is a] Contracting Party of the ECT and
therefore the Claimant does not originate from ‘another Contracting Party’, as demanded
by Article 26 of the ECT to be able to resort to arbitration.’*" To similar effect is
Respondent’s assertion that Claimant is not from the “area” of another Contracting
Party.??° On Respondent’s theory, Article 26(1) refers to a dispute between a Contracting
Party and an Investor of “another” Contracting Party and thus requires diversity of
nationality and Area. However, if two Contracting Parties are also member States of a

REIO, there is no diversity of nationality or of Area.

227. It would be highly unusual for a court or tribunal to interpret a treaty to contain an implied
exception to its terms. The implied exception proposed by Respondent is not a small tweak
of the Treaty. If established, it would mean that the negotiators concluded a treaty that was
largely inoperable as between EU investors and other EU Member States, but did not

indicate that exception in the text.

228. It is necessary to consider whether Respondent’s proposed interpretation of the ECT finds

support in “context,”??!

in particular, in the provisions that address the particular situation
of the European Community, which was an active participant in the negotiation of the
ECT.” The Treaty permits a REIO, as defined in Article 1(3), to become a Contracting
Party. The European Community signed the treaty and became a Contracting Party in

that capacity.

229. The definition of the “Area” in Article 1(10) contains a definition of the term “Area” that
is tailored to the situation of a REIO; the Area of a REIO is defined as the Areas of its
member States. Having set out a specialized definition of “Area” that applies to a REIO,
negotiators also could have specified that the “Area” of a Contracting Party that is also a
Member State of a REIO is deemed to be the entire Area of the REIO. They did not do so,
nor did they indicate that a State cannot be “another Contracting Party,” as that phrase is

used in Article 26, if the two States in question are also Member States of a REIO.

230. Respondent points to Article 25 of the ECT in support of the claimed intra-EU
exception. That provision expressly allows derogation from the ECT’s most-favored
nation provision by permitting States parties to an Economic Integration Agreement (“EIA”)
to accord preferential treatment to each other without extending the same treatment to other
ECT Contracting Parties. Had the drafters of the ECT intended an additional derogation
denying to intra-EU investors the protections and dispute settlement options that would

otherwise apply, they could have done so. They did not.

N

In the view of the Tribunal, the various provisions of the ECT that refer to REIOs and EIAs
demonstrate that negotiators used express language to address the circumstances of the EU
when they decided that differentiation from the situation of other Contracting Parties

was necessary.

As noted by the Tribunal in Eiser, “[t]reaty law and practice provide familiar mechanisms
for treaty makers wishing to limit or exclude application of particular provisions in
particular situations.”> The ECT “includes multiple limiting decisions and
understandings [...] Yet the EEC sought no similar clarifying provisions regarding what
Respondent now contends is a major exclusion in the ECT’s coverage.”** Of particular
relevance is Decision | of the ECT, which provides that the Svalbard Treaty prevails in the
event of any conflict between that treaty and the ECT and that any dispute about the
existence or extent of such a dispute is excluded from Part V of the ECT (Dispute
Settlement).??> Had there been an intention to state any special rules for EU treaties or
REIO treaties more generally, or for intra-REIO investments and intra-REIO disputes,

another decision could have been included. That was not done.

It might also be suggested that the primacy of EU law over inconsistent obligations in non-
EU treaties was so firmly established at the time that the ECT was being negotiated that no
express exception for intra-EU investments and intra-EU disputes was necessary.
Respondent points to Opinion 1/91 of the European Court of Justice to support the asserted
primacy of EU law. In that Opinion, the Court concluded that the proposed European
Economic Area (“EEA”) Court was incompatible with the Treaty Establishing the
European Economic Community because the EEA Court could be required to interpret and
apply EU law.° It stated that the “exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice is

confirmed by Article 219 of the EEC Treaty, under which Member States undertake not to

iser, | 187.

Decisions that appear in Annexes of the ECT are integral parts of the Treaty.

26 Opinion 1/91, 172.

submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of that treaty to any method

of settlement other than those provided for in the Treaty.”?*"

234. The Tribunal does not find in this Opinion and other authorities cited by Respondent a
principle of EU primacy over non-EU treaties that was so obvious in the early 1990s that
there was no need for an express exclusion of intra-EU disputes from the investor-State
arbitration provisions of the ECT. Even decades later, a number of arbitral tribunals and
the Advocate General of the ECJ have concluded that Article 344 of the TFEU (which is
identical in substance to former Article 219 of the EEC Treaty) does not even address the
same subject matter as the investor-State provisions of an investment treaty and thus that
EU law does not conflict with the investment treaty at issue.?* It cannot be the case that
the opposite conclusion was so obvious to participants in the negotiations of the ECT that

no express exception was needed.

235. Respondent does not convince the Tribunal that the object and purpose of the ECT calls
for an interpretation of the Treaty that implies an exception for intra-EU
disputes. Respondent is no doubt correct that increased East-West cooperation was one
objective of the ECT, but the preamble makes clear that the object and purpose of the treaty
was much broader, to include the catalysation of economic growth through measures to

liberalise investment and trade in energy.

236. Respondent has not pointed to any supplementary means of interpretation of the ECT
(such as the travaux préparatoires) that would call into question the ordinary meaning

of Article 26.

237. Taking into account the ordinary meaning of Articles 1 and 26 of the ECT, in light of
the other provisions of the ECT and its object and purpose, the Tribunal concludes that
there is no implied exception to the ECT that excludes intra-EU investments and

intra-EU disputes from the Treaty.

b. The Claim that the TFEU Excludes the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction, Taking
into Account Achmea v. Slovakia
238. Having concluded that the ECT applies to intra-EU investments and intra-EU disputes, the
Tribunal must now consider whether the TFEU operates to change the meaning or validity
of the ECT for those ECT Contracting Parties that are also EU Member States. The
Tribunal, which is not an institution of the European Union, approaches this question from
the vantage point of a tribunal established pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the
ECT. It focuses in particular on the Parties’ arguments as updated by the Judgment of the

CJEU in Achmea.

239. Respondent maintains that the investor-State provisions of the ECT are inconsistent with
the TFEU and that the TFEU takes precedence over the ECT. It considers that the
reasoning of the CJEU in Achmea applies equally to the ECT. Thus, the Tribunal does not
have the jurisdiction that it would otherwise have under Article 26 of the ECT. The

position advanced by the European Commission?” is to the same effect.

240. Claimant considers that the reasoning in Achmea involved a bilateral investment treaty and
that its reasoning does not apply to the ECT, a multilateral treaty to which the EU is also

a party.

241.

The Tribunal addresses three questions regarding the relationship of the ECT to the
TFEU. First, does Article 344 of the TFEU address the same subject matter as Article 26
of the ECT? Second, if so, is there an inconsistency between the two treaties? Third, if

there is an inconsistency, which treaty takes priority?

242. As to the question whether Article 344 of the TFEU addresses the same subject matter, the
Tribunal notes that some past tribunals have concluded?” that Article 344 of the TFEU
does not address investor-State arbitration. On this reasoning, Article 344 of the TFEU has
a different subject-matter from that of Article 26 of the ECT, so there is no conflict between

the two provisions and no need to decide whether one treaty takes precedence over the

29 See Y 204 supra.
230 See Eiser, | 204; Charanne, | 438; Masdar, { 340; Electrabel Decision, { 4.153.

other. This was the logic of the opinion of the Advocate General in Achmea, which stated
that arbitration between an investor and a Member State of the EU does not come under

Article 344 of the TFEU.”*!

243.

oO

The CJEU did not agree with the Advocate General. It found instead that the obligations
of The Netherlands under Article 3 of the BIT (in which The Netherlands had consented to
investor-State arbitration) were inconsistent with the TFEU. It concluded that the TFEU

(in particular, Articles 267 and 344) had primacy over the BIT.

244. The Tribunal in Masdar, writing after the Judgment of the CJEU in Achmea, concluded
that the reasoning of that Judgment, which involved a bilateral treaty between EU Member
States, did not apply to the ECT, a multilateral treaty to which the EU itself is a party.?°

However, the Tribunal sees reason to doubt that the bilateral nature of the treaty at issue

in Achmea was critical to the reasoning of the CIEU. Respondent is correct in pointing out

that the Court in Achmea relied on past jurisprudence that did not address
bilateral agreements, such as Opinion 1/91, which addressed a treaty to which non-EU

States, EU Member States and the European Community were to be parties.*> The

Tribunal also notes that the European Commission has taken the position that the “ECT

does not apply to investors from other Member States initiating disputes against another

Member States.”?**

245.

an

This Tribunal considers it prudent to proceed, arguendo, on the assumption that a provision
of a non-EU treaty in which treaty parties agree to investor-State dispute settlement does
fall within the scope of Article 344 of the TFEU, even if the investment treaty is a
multilateral treaty to which the EU itself is a party, such as the ECT. Assuming that this is
the case, it would follow from the reasoning in Achmea that the consent of EU Member

States to investor-State arbitration pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT is in conflict with

246.

247.

Article 344 of the TFEU, as the TFEU has been interpreted by the CJEU. The Tribunal

must therefore determine which treaty takes precedence.

When a treaty does not expressly address possible inconsistencies between that treaty and
prior or subsequent treaties on the same subject-matter, Article 30 of the VCLT (entitled
“Application of Successive Treaties Relating to the Same Subject-Matter’) provides
residual rules that can be used to determine which treaty has primacy. As to Part V of the
ECT (concerning Dispute Settlement), however, no resort to these residual rules is
necessary, because Article 16 of the ECT expressly addresses the relationship between the
dispute settlement chapter of the ECT and the provisions of another treaty on that subject

matter. It does so in clear terms and comprehensive terms, as follows:

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior
international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international
agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of
Part III or V of this Treaty,

(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to
derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement
or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under
that agreement; and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed
to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from
any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this
Treaty, where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor
or Investment.

Pursuant to Article 16, if (as the Tribunal has assumed above) the “right to dispute
settlement” provided in Part V of the ECT is in conflict with Article 344 of the TFEU, the
provisions of the TFEU can derogate from an Investor’s right to dispute resolution under
Part V of the ECT only if the provisions of the TFEU are more favourable to the Investor

than is Part V of the ECT.

74

248. Part V of the ECT provides a right to dispute settlement that is additional to those otherwise

249.

250.

251.

235 Article 16 of the ECT also appli
here address

available to an investor in respect of an intra-EU dispute, i.e., the right to initiate investor-
State arbitration. Part V of the ECT also expressly preserves the right of an Investor to
pursue resolution of a dispute in “the courts or administrative tribunals of a Contracting
Party” or another previously agreed dispute settlement procedure. Because the ECT adds
the mechanism of investor-State dispute settlement to the mechanisms that would
otherwise be available to an investor, the Tribunal finds that the provisions of the TFEU
are not more favourable to an investor than is Part V of the ECT, and thus that the TFEU

cannot derogate from the rights of an investor of Part V of the ECT.7°>

Article 16 of the ECT has a comprehensive temporal scope; it applies both to
treaties that are subsequent to the ECT (such as the TFEU) and prior EU and European

Community treaties.

Bearing in mind that the task of this Tribunal is to determine its own jurisdiction,
pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the ECT, and that the Tribunal is not an institution
of the EU, the Tribunal concludes that, if the ECT and the TFEU address the same subject
matter, Article 16 of the ECT means that the TFEU may not derogate from the dispute
settlement provisions of the ECT and thus that the TFEU does not detract from the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The Tribunal also notes that Respondent suggested at the Hearing that the EU and its
Member States had modified the ECT in 2008, referring to Article 41 of the VCLT, which
allows two or more parties to a multilateral treaty to modify the treaty as between them,
under defined conditions.**° Respondent does not specify the terms of such modification.
It does not address the conditions in Article 41 to have been met here (i.e., that the
modification does not affect the enjoyment of other parties of their rights and does not
relate to a provision derogation from which is incompatible with the effective execution of

the treaty’s object and purpose). Moreover, Article 41 requires notification of any intended

 

to Part III of the ECT (Investment Promotion and Protection), but the Tribunal
's jurisdiction and thus does not address the question whether the investment protection provisions of the

 

ECT are more favorable to an Investor than the provisions of EU treaties.

253.

modification to the other parties to the treaty. No such notification was provided.
Accordingly, there is no basis to conclude that the ECT has been modified to include an

intra-EU exception to jurisdiction.

On the basis of the above analysis, and having considered fully the Parties’ many assertions
in relation to jurisdiction over intra-EU disputes (including those not specifically addressed
in this Award), the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s objection to its jurisdiction in respect of

intra-EU disputes.

On 11 February 2019, the Tribunal granted Respondent’s request to file as an additional
legal authority the Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member
States of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice
in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European Union (signed by twenty-two
EU Member States) and Claimant’s request to file two related documents, the Declaration
of Governments of the Member States of 16 January 2019, signed by five EU Member
States and the Declaration of the Government of Hungary of 16 January 2019.75” The
Parties were invited to submit brief observations on these declarations. Rather than
reprising the Parties’ observations in detail, the Tribunal notes that each Party sought to
make use of these declarations to reinforce positions that it had previously taken in these
proceedings. Having considered those observations, as well as the three Declarations, the
Tribunal considers that these Declarations do not affect the reasoning that the Tribunal has
used in addressing the objection to its jurisdiction. As stated at paragraphs 245-249 above,
even assuming, arguendo, that the “right to dispute resolution” provided in Part V of the
ECT is seen to conflict with Article 344 of the TFEU, Article 16 of the ECT provides that
the TFEU can derogate from Part V of the ECT only if the TFEU is more favorable to

investors than is Part V of the ECT. The Tribunal has found that this is not the case.

(dd) The Parties’ Positions

Respondent maintains that, pursuant to the exception for tax measures contained in
Article 21 of the ECT, it has not consented to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear alleged
breaches of ECT Article 10(1) related to the TVPEE, a 7% tax on the value of energy
production that was imposed in Act 15/2012. Claimant responds that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction to decide whether the TVPEE violates ECT Article 10(1) because the
Article 21 applies only to genuine tax measures and the TVPEE is not a bona fide

tax measure.

a. Respondent’s Position

Article 26 of the ECT limits the Contracting Parties’ consent to arbitration to “an alleged
breach of an obligation of [a Contracting Party] under Part III [of the ECT].”?*
Article 10(1) of the ECT is located in Part III of the ECT. However, Article 21(1) of the

ECT provides:

Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty
shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the
Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.”

Respondent points out that the exceptions contained elsewhere in the ECT do not apply to
an alleged breach of Article 10(1)*° and that this conclusion has been confirmed by the

ECT Secretariat and previous arbitral jurisprudence.”

257. Respondent notes that, pursuant to Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT, the term “taxation
measure” includes “[a]ny provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting
Party[.]’ Respondent maintains that the TVPEE fits within this definition. Act 15/2012
was passed by the Spanish Parliament in accordance with Article 133 of the Spanish
Constitution, which grants the State the authority to establish taxes.*47_ The TVPEE is
levied on the performance of the activities of production and incorporation into the SEE of
electric energy. Act 15/2012 explicitly refers to the taxation nature of the TVPEE*“ and
the TVPEE satisfies the definition of tax set forth in Spanish Act 58/2003 on General
Taxation.” The self-assessment and payment to the Public treasury of the TVPEE is made
through a tax form, in accordance with a ministerial order which has been deemed to be
compliant with domestic law by the Spanish High Court.?4° The Spanish Constitutional
Court has confirmed the taxation nature of the TVPEE and its conformity with the

Spanish Constitution.?*”

258. Respondent also considers that the TVPEE is a tax under international law.*8 It relies,
inter alia, on prior decisions of arbitral tribunals to support its contention that the concept
of tax in international law has a number of defining characteristics which the TVPEE
fulfills, as follows: (a) the tax is established by law;74? (b) such law imposes an obligation
on a class of people (in this case, the TVPEE is levied on all persons who produce and
incorporate energy into the SEE);”*° and (c) this obligation involves paying money to the
State for public purposes. Respondent also notes that the European Commission has

confirmed the TVPEE’s taxation nature and its consistency with EU law.”*!

Accordingly, the TVPEE is a tax within the meaning of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT.

Respondent maintains that the Tribunal should reject Claimant’s contention that the

TVPEE is not a bona fide taxation measure.?>*

Tt submits that only “extraordinary
circumstances” could exempt a taxation measure from the protection of the taxation carve-
out in Article 21(1), such as a tax with a purpose that is “entirely unrelated” to the purpose
of raising revenue for the State (e.g., the destruction of a company or the elimination of a

political opponent).?°*

Respondent also contends that the good faith analysis proposed by Claimant implies
examining the economic effects of such tax. Respondent recalls the tribunal’s conclusion
in EnCana that the determination of what constitutes a tax measure “is primarily a question
of its legal operation, not its economic effect” and that, while the economic effects or
impacts of a tax “may be unclear and debatable[,] nonetheless a measure is a taxation
measure if it is part of the regime for the imposition of a tax.”** The legal operation of
the TVPEE is that of a taxation measure; it is not appropriate to examine its economic
effect in order to determine that it constitutes a taxation measure for purposes of the

ECT.25

Moreover, Respondent disputes Claimant’s assertion that the TVPEE is not a bona fide
taxation measure because it allegedly discriminates against renewable producers in
comparison to conventional producers and is a disguised tariff cut.°° The TVPEE applies
to all energy producers (both renewable and conventional) and its impact is neutralised as

it is a recoverable cost by renewable producers under the current remuneration

scheme.”°’ Respondent also notes that its position is aligned with that of the tribunals of

the Isolux and Eiser cases.

263. Based on the above, Respondent concludes that Article 10(1) of the ECT does not generate
obligations for Contracting States with respect to the TVPEE. As a consequence, the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction with regard to Claimant’s claim of an alleged breach of

Article 10(1) of the ECT through the adoption of the TVPEE.°*

b. Claimant’s Position

264. Claimant submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claim that the TVPEE violates
Article 10(1) of the ECT. Article 31(1) of the VCLT obligates Respondent to interpret the
ECT in good faith. Thus, a measure that is not a bona fide tax cannot fall within the
exception in Article 21(1). The TVPEE is not a bona fide tax measure, but is instead a
measure with the purpose and effect of reducing the remuneration to which Claimant was
entitled pursuant to the Original Regulatory Regime, in a manner designed to avoid liability
under the ECT. Moreover, the Tribunal cannot isolate the TVPEE from the rest of the

Disputed Measures.

265. Claimant disputes Respondent’s “formalistic interpretation” of the definition of “Taxation
Measures” under Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT and the alleged main characteristics of the
concept of tax under international law. If the observance of formal aspects sufficed to
qualify a measure as legitimate tax measure, a State would be able to impose a draconian
tax as long as it observed basic formalities, thereby circumventing the protections of the
ECT. The Tribunal’s analysis should privilege substance over form, taking into account

the context in which Law 15/2012 was implemented and Respondent’s motivations.”°°

266. Claimant considers that the standard indicated by Respondent (under which the analysis of
the good faith of taxation measures is justified only in extraordinary circumstances) sets

the threshold too high. The TVPEE was the product of an act of bad faith and satisfies

Respondent’s suggested criterion of destruction of a company, given that it contributed to
the dismantling of the Original Regulatory Regime and brought Claimant “to the brink

of ruin.”

7. In support of its contention that the TVPEE is not a bona fide tax, Claimant asserts that the
fact that the TVPEE is of general application is irrelevant, because PV investors are
de facto discriminated against because they are unable to pass on the cost of the tax on to
their customers (i.e., since conventional energy producers did not benefit from the same
FIT incentives, even if the TVPEE was applied to both conventional and renewable energy
producers, only the latter were subject to a reduction of FITs).?°! Because the cost of the
TVPEE cannot be passed to consumers, Claimant’s investment lost value directly
corresponding to the amount levied, amounting to disguised deprivation of

: a 2
Claimants investment.”

oe

Claimant asserts that the TVPEE is a tariff cut framed as a taxation measure “to reduce
revenue streams without appearing to modify the fixed, regulated prices established by the
FITs” to “avoid overtly breaching investors’ rights and thereby limit its exposure to
liability under the ECT.”?® It argues that the TVPEE was an initial step towards the
destruction of a regulatory system based on fixed FITs.7° Respondent “necessarily knew”
that the FITs provided for in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were fixed and they could
not be modified. Respondent therefore must have known that the cost of a tax such as the
TVPEE could not be passed on by the energy producer. In both intent and in effect, the

TVPEE “was a deliberate and substantial reduction of the FITs, by indirect means.”

Claimant concludes that the introduction of the TVPEE through Act 15/2012 was an
attempt to circumvent the protections of the ECT. Therefore, it should not fall within the

scope of Article 21 of the ECT.

Claimant also considers that the TVPEE cannot be isolated from the other Disputed
Measures by the Tribunal as “[t]hey have a cumulative damaging effect and they have all

contributed to Spain’s breaches of the ECT.”?8"

Based on the above, Claimant concludes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear its claim

that the introduction of the TVPEE breaches Spain’s obligations under ECT Article 10(1).

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The TVPEE imposes a 7% tax on a large class of persons that includes Claimant. Its
provisions, as noted by Respondent, are consistent with a tax measure, as is the method of
its adoption (enactment by the Spanish Parliament in accordance with Spain’s Constitution
and its law regarding taxation measures). The TVPEE generates revenue for the State,
which is included in the State General Budget. The Tribunal considers that it has the

characteristics of a “taxation measure” within the scope of ECT Article 21(1)(7)(a)(i).

Article 21(1) of the ECT contains an explicit exception from jurisdiction in respect of
alleged breaches of Article 10(1). The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that this explicit

tax carve-out could only be overridden in extraordinary circumstances.

Claimant asserts that, rather than being a bona fide tax measure, the TVPEE is the
“tariff cut which dares not speak its name.”®. Claimant’s contention is that Respondent
styled the measure as a tax, rather than a reduction in applicable tariffs, in response to the
initiation of arbitration by investors that claimed that Respondent’s changes to
remuneration under RD 661/2007 violated the ECT, and did so in order to reduce the

remuneration of producers of renewable energy without appearing to reduce

tariffs. Claimant maintains that such a measure runs afoul of Respondent’s obligation

to perform its obligations under the ECT in good faith.?”°

Even assuming that Respondent took into account the provisions of the ECT in deciding to
impose the TVPEE, the fact that a State’s legislation is informed by its treaty obligations
would not be sufficient to establish that the State had failed to perform its obligations under
that treaty in good faith. During the period when Respondent enacted the TVPEE (2010-
2012), it took other measures (e.g., the change in inflation index and the cap on hours) that
were not subject to the tax carve-out and thus could be challenged as violations of

Article 10(1). It has defended the legality of all of those measures in this proceeding.

The Parties refer to the conclusions of other tribunals that have addressed the question
whether a measure constitutes a bona fide tax. In Yukos, the tribunal found that the
respondent State had launched a “full assault” on the investor and its beneficial owners in
order to bankrupt the investor and to appropriate its assets while, at the same time,
removing its chief executive officer “from the political arena”.*" No extraordinary
conduct of this sort is alleged by Claimant, nor is it established by the record before

the Tribunal.

Thus, the Tribunal concludes that the TVPEE is a taxation measure within the scope of
Article 21(7) of the ECT and that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide
Claimant’s claim that the TVPEE violates Article 10(1) of the ECT.

LIABILITY

A. The Alleged Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Obligation (Article 10(1))

278.

In its relevant part, Article 10(1) of the ECT reads as follows:

2” VCLT, Article 26.
2" Yukos, | 1404.

ARTICLE 10
PROMOTION, PROTECTION AND
TREATMENT OF INVESTMENTS

(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions
of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable
and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting
Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall
include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of
Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.
[N]o Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or disposal.

qd) Overview of the Parties’ Positions
a. Claimant’s Position

279. The thrust of Claimant’s fair and equitable treatment allegation is that Respondent violated

Claimant’s legitimate expectations. As stated in Claimant’s Reply:

Spain’s commitment to the Claimant’s investment must be judged
according to an objective standard, understood in the light
of Spain’s past commitments (in the present case, RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008, and indeed Law No. 54/1997). On the basis of
such previous legislation, SolEs Badajoz and other investors who
qualified under RD 1578/2008 were entitled to expect that a
“reasonable return” under the Spanish PV regime would (1) remain
at a level consistent with the return provided by the regulatory
scheme up to that point; (2) remain at a broadly secure, fixed
rate (rather than the variable rate now offered by the New
Regulatory Regime); and (3) at most, be subject to reasonable and
limited amendments which would nevertheless leave the core
features of the regime intact. Spain, of course, chose to disregard
these expectations.?””

280. Claimant emphasizes in particular that the “essential feature” of the Original Regulatory
Regime was “a guaranteed FIT for a period of 25 years, which allowed any investor to

calculate the estimated income derived from the investment, providing certainty to

w

N

investors.”? The FITs applicable to Claimant’s plants were based on production, without
a cap, and provided priority of dispatch (i.e., access to the electrical grid).7"" Claimant
considers that Spain “annihilated the economic foundation of the Original Regulatory
Regime when it enacted the new Regulatory Regime, starting in 2013 (notably RDL 9/2013
and Order IET 1045/2013).”??

Claimant also maintains that the changes introduced by the Disputed Measures were
disproportionate and unreasonable.?”° It states that there were alternative measures that
Spain could have chosen to address the tariff deficit. Instead, Respondent adopted the
Specific Regime, which employs an unreasonable “one size fits all” approach, using
arbitrarily-determined hypothetical costs. The Disputed Measures are irrational because

there were other, less drastic means of addressing the tariff deficit.2”7

According to Claimant, the Disputed Measures were disproportionate in two senses. First,
the Disputed Measures suddenly and unexpectedly removed essential features of the

regulatory regime in place.?’

Second, Claimant maintains that the burden that the
Disputed Measures imposed on PV investors was not commensurate with the economic

rationale or public interest.?”?

b. Respondent’s Position

Respondent submits that Claimant was not induced to believe that the Original Regulatory
Regime would remain immutable, and that the Disputed Measures have maintained the
economic and regulatory foundation which induced SolEs to invest. Respondent submits
that Claimant, in the absence of a specific commitment, could not hold a legitimate

expectation that the regime established by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 would not be

subject to modification, a possibility that Spanish law clearly admitted.**” In Respondent’s
view, and as indicated by the /solux tribunal, investors in renewable energy projects should
have known that, pursuant to Spain’s legislation, the limit to any regulatory change is the
reasonable return for the investment, which has been respected in this case.”*! Respondent
requests the Tribunal to apply this criterion in determining whether there has been a breach

of the FET standard.?*

In the alternative, Respondent (referring to the Charanne award), requests the Tribunal to
find that the “essential elements” of its regulatory regime have been respected following
the enactment of the Disputed Measures.”** Respondent disagrees with Claimant’s
characterization of the essential elements of the regulatory regime. According to
Respondent, the essential elements, which have always been maintained, are the
methodology of using standard installations to set remuneration, the principle of a

reasonable rate of return and the priority of dispatch.?*+

Respondent also opposes Claimant’s contention that the Disputed Measures were
unreasonable and disproportionate. It maintains that the measures were based on the need
to guarantee the sustainability and balance of the SEE which was being affected by (1) the
economic crisis that had brought about a reduction in electricity demand; (2) the increase
of the tariff for consumers; (3) the existence of over-compensation in the renewable energy

sector (“RE sector’); and (4) the expectation of an increase of the tariff deficit.2*°

286. Respondent also submits that the adoption of the Disputed Measures must be placed within
the context of international commitments deriving from the collapse of the Spanish
financial system. This collapse gave rise to the Memorandum of Understanding
signed with the European Union on 20 July 2012. In this Memorandum, Spain undertakes
to adopt macroeconomic measures to deal with the specific imbalance: “address the
electricity tariff deficit in a comprehensive way”.*®° According to Respondent, statements
of the European Union, the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) and the International
Energy Agency in 2014 and 2015 recognized that the measures it had adopted, including
the Disputed Measures, had resolved the macroeconomic problem derived from the

tariff deficit?”

287. According to Respondent, the Disputed Measures were carried out respecting the principle
of reasonable return in accordance with the cost of money in the capital market.7**
Respondent disputes Claimant’s contentions about the effect that the Disputed Measures
had on Claimant’s return. It maintains that Claimant’s pre-tax return under the Specific
Regime is in the range of 8.03%7* to 8.11%,” which is higher than the 7.398% target
under the Specific Regime. According to Respondent, based on calculations by its experts,

Claimant is currently receiving project returns that exceed the reference rate of return when

Claimant invested (“‘around’ 7% after taxes’).?°!

(2) The Legal Standard
a. Claimant’s Views on the Legal Standard

(i) Legitimate Expectations

~

Claimant asserts that the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment includes, as “an
integral component of FET” the stability of the legal system. It submits that this obligation
is “reinforced in the ECT’, noting that “Article 10(1) provides that the Contracting States
are under the obligation to ‘encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors’.””°? Claimant further asserts that FET encompasses
the protection of investors’ legitimate expectations.°? Those legitimate expectations may
arise not only from commitments made directly to a particular investor, but also from
legislative and regulatory acts. Claimant submits that, while States retain a right to modify
their legislation, investors are “entitled to believe that regulatory changes would not ‘come
to unforeseeably and abruptly suppress the essential characteristics of the existing
regulatory framework.” A State cannot radically alter the legal framework upon which

an investment is based without breaching the FET standard.?°>

9. Claimant states that an investor’s legitimate expectations are to be evaluated as of the date
of its investment.?°° This is an objective standard, taking into account not only what an
investor knew (its subjective expectations) but also the expectations of a prudent investor

as of the date of the investment.”

S

Claimant rejects as “artificial” certain limitations on the scope of the FET standard
suggested by Respondent.?* In particular, Respondent cannot avoid liability by

establishing that it has met national treatment and non-discrimination standards, on which

Claimant does not rely.?°? Claimant also maintains that the FET standard is an obligation
that is distinct from and goes beyond the minimum standard of treatment under

international law.*°°

291.

Claimant supports its assertion on the applicable legal standard under the ECT, in particular
as to the import of the protection of investors’ legitimate expectations, by reference to a
host of arbitral awards and commentaries, with an emphasis on the stability of the legal
and business framework on which an investor relied in making its investment. Claimant

refers to the statement in Biwater Gauff that:

the purpose of the fair and equitable treatment standard is to
provide to international investments treatment that does not affect
the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign
investor to make the investment, as long as these expectations are
reasonable and legitimate and have been relied upon by the investor
to make the investment. *°!

292. Claimant recognizes that a State “always retains its right to modify its legislation,” but it
asserts, relying on Eiser, that it cannot do so in a manner that radically alters the legal

framework upon which an investment is based without breaching the FET:

Taking account of the context and of the ECT’s object and purpose,
the Tribunal concludes that Article 10(1)’s obligation to accord fair
and equitable treatment necessarily embraces an obligation to
provide fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of the
legal regime relied upon by investors in making long-term
investments. This does not mean that regulatory regimes cannot
evolve. Surely they can. “[T]he legitimate expectations of any
investor [...] [have] to include the real possibility of reasonable
changes and amendments in the legal framework, made by the
competent authorities within the limits of the powers conferred on
them by the law.” However, the Article 10(1) obligation to accord
fair and equitable treatment means that regulatory regimes cannot
be radically altered as applied to existing investments in ways that

deprive investors who invested in reliance on those regimes of their
investment’s value [...]°°”

(ii) Disproportionate and Unreasonable Measures

293. Claimant also alleges that the Disputed Measures were disproportionate and unreasonable.

29:

295.

As to disproportionality, it invokes two legal standards. First, it cites the statement of the
Tribunal in Charanne that modifications to a regulatory regime that are not random or
unnecessary meet the proportionality requirement “provided that they do not suddenly and
unexpectedly remove the essential features of the regulatory regime in place.”* Second,
the Disputed Measures imposed on PV investors such as Claimant, resulted in “huge
losses” that were “not commensurate with the alleged economic rationale and ‘public

interest’ put forward by Spain.”*°*

x

Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s contention that the Tribunal should consider
whether the Disputed Measures were unreasonable under what Respondent has described
as the “EDF v. Romania test.” Claimant states that this test enquires into whether measures
are discriminatory, whereas Claimant’s FET case does not require any showing that the

measures were discriminatory.*°°

n

Claimant also addresses Respondent’s observations regarding the “AES test.” Claimant
states that it “agrees that per the ‘AES Test’, as Respondent identifies it, ‘[a] challenged
measure must also be reasonable. That is, there needs to be an appropriate correlation
between the State’s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it. This

has to do with the nature of the measure and the way it is implemented.””*°°

b. Respondent’s Views on the Legal Standard

296. Respondent observes that Claimant’s FET case is broken into two alleged violations, the

legitimate expectations claim, which Claimant links to stability, and the claim that

Respondent enacted disproportionate and irrational measures.*°’ Respondent “shares with
the Claimant that the following duties should be examined within the FET standard of the
ECT: (i) not to violate the reasonable and objective expectations of the investor, (ii) to
create stable and transparent conditions and (iii) not to adopt irrational and
disproportionate measures in detriment of the investor.”*°’ Respondent responds
separately to each of these violations and refers to the legitimate expectations claim as the

“main structuring element” of the claim.*”

29

_

Respondent does not deny Claimant’s assertion that “[t]he Precedents that apply the ECT

bl

incorporate within the Fair and Eq Treatment s lard both the

of respecting the reasonable and objective Expectations of the investors and of creating

stable conditions.”>"°

(i) Legitimate Expectations

29)

°

Respondent submits that the principle of legitimate expectations does not amount to “a
requirement for the host State to freeze its legal system for the investor’s benefit’, over and
above the needs of the State’s general interest. Instead, “a reasonable evolution of the host
State’s law is part of the environment with which investors must contend”.*'' Respondent
states that arbitral precedents applying the standard of legitimate expectation have

established that:

the ECT is not a type of insurance policy for investors against the
risk of changes in the regulatory framework and, therefore:

a) There must be specific commitments made to an investor that the
regulations in force will remain unchanged{; and]

91

b) The investor’s expectations have to be reasonable and justified
in relation to any changes to the laws of the host country.>'*

299. Respondent, quoting the Award in Plama, recognizes that stable and equitable conditions

are part of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the ECT.*!* However,

Respondent states that the “‘stable conditions’ referred to in the ECT clearly allow the

adoption of reasonable and proportionate macroeconomic control measures, provided

these are adopted as a result of a reasonable cause. This principle has been stated by

many previous awards.”?!4

300. Respondent stresses that stability is not equal to “petrification” of the regulation in place
when the investment was made. Respondent quotes with approval the statement of

Electrabel that:

The host State is not required to elevate unconditionally the interests
of the foreign investor above all other considerations in every
circumstance. [...] even assuming that Electrabel had an
expectation that it would be awarded the maximum compensation
[...], once weighed against Hungary’s legitimate right to regulate in
the public interest, such an expectation does not appear reasonable
or legitimate. [Emphasis and ellipsis added by Respondent]*!>

301. Respondent further refers in the same vein to the Charanne award’s statement that

To convert a regulatory standard into a specific commitment of the
state, by the limited character of the persons who may be affected,
would constitute an excessive limitation _on power of states _to
regulate the economy in accordance with the public interest.

[...] in the absence of a specific commitment toward stability, an

investor cannot have _a legitimate expectation that a regulatory

302. Respondent agrees with Claimant that it is appropriate to assess the legitimate expectations
that an investor had at the time of its investment to determine whether there has been a
violation of the FET standard and that legitimate expectation must be evaluated with
reference to an objective standard, i.e., with reference to the information regarding the
regulatory regime that a prudent investor should have known.*!’ Respondent also asserts
that an investor in a highly regulated sector such as renewable energy must have engaged

in exhaustive due diligence.*!*

(ii) Disproportionate and Unreasonable Measures

303. Respondent maintains that the measures that it took were reasonable and non-
discriminatory.*!° As many awards have recognized, the ECT allows the adoption of

reasonable and proportionate macroeconomic control measures.”

304. Respondent states that arbitral case law contains three tests that Spain applies to establish
that the Disputed Measures were “not abusive or disproportionate, by meeting the FET
objectives and standards established in the ECT:

(a) The EDF Test v. Romania, which allows us to examine whether Spain has

fulfilled the main objective of the ECT, adopting non-discriminatory measures
against the Claimant;

allows us to examine whether the Kingdom of Spain has respected the FET standard

Spain has respected the minimum protection standard guaranteed by International
Law for long-term investments, as happens in the Energy Sector.”**!

305. As to the “EDF Test” and non-discrimination, Respondent asserts that the main objective
of the ECT was “to achieve the introduction of a free market in order to carry out energy-
related activities without discrimination on account of the investor's nationality”*” and

that the “best standard of protection afforded by the ECT” is national treatment.?”7

306. In respect of the legal standard that Respondent describes as the “test of AES Summit”

Respondent states:

The test set out in the AES SUMMIT case is used to determine
whether or not an abusive (unreasonable) or disproportionate
measure exists that does not comply with the FET standard laid
down by the ECT. This Award has been invoked by the Claimant,
so that the parties agree on the decision criterion applicable in
respect of this Award. The Tribunal of the Case Aes Summit v.
Hungary established:

‘There are two elements that must be analysed to determine
whether a State’s act was unreasonable: the existence of a
rational policy; and the reasonableness of the act of the State
in relation to the policy.

A rational policy is taken by a State following a logical
(good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a
public interest matter.

(...)A challenged measure must also be reasonable. That is,
there needs to be an appropriate correlation between the
State’s public policy objective and the measure adopted to
achieve it. This has to do with the nature of the measure and
the way it is implemented.’**

307. With respect to Total v. Argentina, Respondent states that “[t]he Arbitration Tribunal in
the Total Case assessed whether the Principle of economic equilibrium that allows a long-
term investor to recover costs and to obtain a return on their investment was
respected.”**> Respondent states that this test has been met because Claimant recovers
investment costs necessary for construction and operation of the plants. It bases this
conclusion on the assertion that, since 1989, the costs that Respondent has used to set
remuneration for renewable energy plants have not included costs outside of construction

and operating costs, such as financing.*”°

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis
30:

~

As stated in Electrabel v. Hungary, “the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment
comprises several elements, including an obligation to act transparently and with due
process; and to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures or from
frustrating the investor’s reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework
adversely affecting its investment.”**’ The tribunal in Blusun v. Italy observed that a State
has no obligation to grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs. However, if it does so “and if
it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not
disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to
the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial

resources on the basis of the earlier regime.”**8

309. In the present case, Claimant alleges that Respondent violated its FET obligation in two
ways. It relies primarily on the alleged failure to respect Claimant’s legitimate
expectations and secondarily on the contention that the Disputed Measures were

unreasonable and disproportionate.

(i) The Legal Standard Applicable to Claimant’s Legitimate
Expectations Claim
310. The centrepiece of Claimant’s case is the allegation that Spain has failed to meet
Claimant’s legitimate expectations and thus has violated the FET obligation contained in
Article 10(1) of the ECT. Claimant does not allege that Spain has expressly promised
Claimant that Spain would maintain the legal regime that was in place when Claimant
invested. Instead, Claimant asserts that Respondent, through its laws, regulations and other
authoritative pronouncements, made “clear representations” that “the financial support
provided would be long lasting and stable, thereby making it attractive to potential
investors.”*?? Claimant says that, having relied on these representations when it made its
investment in March 2010,” it has a legitimate expectation of what it calls a “guaranteed
FIT” and other “essential” or “core” features of the regulatory regime in place when it
invested, for the twenty-five year period specified in RD 1578/2008. It asserts that the
Disputed Measures annihilated those expectations by eliminating the “fixed” FIT and

331

“other core components” that determined the remuneration of PV plants. Claimant

maintains that the Disputed Measures drastically reduced the value of its investment.

311.

Respondent answers Claimant’s legitimate expectations claim by asserting that its
regulatory regime gave Claimant no legitimate expectations beyond that of a reasonable
return with reference to the cost of capital, as specified in the governing Spanish legislation,
and that Claimant continues to receive a reasonable return under the Specific
Regime. Alternatively, Respondent states that Claimant’s legitimate expectations have
been met because the essential features of the regulatory regime on the basis of which
Claimant invested have been retained in the Special Regime. Respondent states that the
Disputed Measures were enacted to correct a macroeconomic imbalance, i.e., the tariff
deficit, exacerbated by the economic crisis. It also maintains that Claimant’s investment

has not been impaired.

314.

The Parties agree on several well-established points on which there is no need for the
Tribunal to dwell. First, they concur that the ECT should be interpreted in accordance with
the law of treaties.*** Second, they agree that legitimate expectations are to be evaluated
as of the date of Claimant’s investment. Third, they recognize that, in order for an investor
to establish “legitimate” expectations, it is not sufficient for the investor to demonstrate its
subjective expectations. The evidence must establish the legitimacy of its expectations on

an objective basis, i.e., with reference to the expectations of a prudent investor.

The Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s assertion that “specific commitments made to
an investor” are necessary to an FET claim.**? As has been widely recognized, an
investor’s legitimate expectations can also arise from provisions of law and regulations and
from statements made by or on behalf of the State for the purpose of inducing investment

by class of investors.>*4

The Parties have addressed the implications of the reference to stability in the first sentence
of Article 10(1) of the ECT (“Each Contracting Party shall [...] encourage and create
stable [...] conditions”). Respondent regards this sentence to be “soft law.”**> Claimant
maintains that this sentence contains a specific obligation to create stable investment
conditions. However, Claimant does not ask the Tribunal to find that Respondent has
breached a stability obligation that is independent of the FET obligation. Instead, it
identifies a stable and predictable business environment as an aspect of Respondent’s FET
obligation.**° Claimant states that a host State’s regulatory regime is subject, “at most [...]
to reasonable and limited amendments which would nevertheless leave the core features

of the regime intact.”**"

315. For purposes of assessing Claimant’s legitimate expectations claim, the Tribunal considers,
as stated by the Tribunal in Eiser, that the FET obligation “necessarily embraces an
obligation to provide fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of the legal
regime relied upon by investors in making long-term investments.”*** The “obligation to
accord fair and equitable treatment means that regulatory regimes cannot be radically
altered as applied to existing investments in ways that deprive investors who invested in

reliance on those regimes of their investment’s value.”*?

31

a

As observed by the tribunal in Charanne, “an investor has a legitimate expectation that,
when modifying the regulation under which it made the investment, the State will not act
unreasonably, contrary to the public interest or in a disproportionate manner.”*° In
addressing claimant’s legitimate expectations, the Charanne tribunal gave a distinctive

meaning to “proportionality”:

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the proportionality
requirement is fulfilled inasmuch as the modifications are not
random or unnecessary, provided that they do not suddenly and
unexpectedly remove the essential features of the regulatory
framework in place.*"!

317. The Tribunal finds this formulation of “proportionality” to be suitable to the circumstances
of this case, and notes that it has been applied by other tribunals considering changes in

renewable energy subsidies, including Antin,*? Blusun, Eiser,>“* and RREEF.* This

Tribunal will therefore also consider proportionality, as formulated in Charanne, in

considering Claimant’s legitimate expectations claim.

318. In the view of the Tribunal, the FET provision of the ECT does not operate as a stabilization
provision that applies generally to the laws and regulations in place at the time of an
investment. Instead, the assessment of a legitimate expectations claim requires “a
weighing of the Claimant’s legitimate and reasonable expectations on the one hand and
the Respondent’s legitimate regulatory interests on the other.”**° Both the legitimacy of
the investor’s expectations and the host State’s scope to modify its regulatory regime
without violating the FET obligation must be measured in light of any undertakings of
stability that are contained in the laws, regulations and authoritative pronouncements of the

host State, upon which the investor relied when it made its investment.

319. In order to evaluate the expectations that Claimant could legitimately have had at the time
of its investment, the Tribunal will examine Respondent’s law and regulations, informed
by other evidence, including regulatory reports, other pronouncements by Spanish
authorities and the case law of Spain’s Supreme Court. It will take into account the
characteristics of investments in photovoltaic plants, as well as the economic conditions at
the time of Claimant’s investment, such as the large tariff deficit and the global economic
crisis. After stating its views on Claimant’s legitimate expectations, the Tribunal will
consider whether, by enacting the Disputed Measures, Respondent failed to respect

those expectations.

(ii) The Legal Standard Applicable to a Claim of Disproportionate and
Unreasonable Measures

320. Claimant relies primarily on the alleged failure to respect Claimant’s legitimate
expectations. Secondarily, Claimant alleges that the Disputed Measures also violated

Respondent’s FET obligation because they were disproportionate and unreasonable.

17 March 2006 (“Saluka”), | 306.

99

321.

The Tribunal first addresses the three “tests” suggested by Respondent to determine

whether measures are reasonable (not arbitrary) and non-discriminatory.

322. Claimant has not alleged that it has faced discrimination, nor is a showing of discrimination
necessary to establish a violation of an FET obligation, so the Tribunal sets aside what

Respondent labels the “EDF test.”

323. With respect to the test that Respondent describes as the Total v. Argentina test, the
Tribunal does not understand that tribunal to have decided that a State’s FET obligation is
met whenever it is established that a claimant’s construction costs and operating costs are
covered by a remuneration regime. The Tribunal in Total considered a range of factors in
reaching its conclusions. The phrase of that Award on which Respondent relies, taken out
of context, cannot fairly be described as a free-standing “test” of whether an FET obligation

has been met.

324. Of greater interest is the award in AES Summit. In that case, the claimant alleged, inter alia,
that the respondent had failed to meet two obligations contained in Article 10(1)
of the ECT, the FET obligation and the “non-impairment” obligation, which provides
that “no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures the “management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal” of an
Investment.*4” In the present case, Claimant does not allege that Respondent breached the

non-impairment obligation.

325. The excerpt that Respondent invokes as a legal standard applicable to the present case
(which was embraced at least in part by Claimant), does not appear in the part of the AES
Summit award that addresses the legal standard relevant to the FET obligation.*** It is
located instead in the portion of the award that addresses the legal standard applicable to

non-impairment obligation.*4”

Without suggesting that the FET obligation and the non-impairment obligation have
identical content, the Tribunal embraces the notion of reasonableness used in AES Summit
and endorsed by both Parties. In order for a challenged measure to be reasonable, there
must be “an appropriate correlation between the state’s public policy objective and the

measure adopted to achieve it.”*°° The FET standard prevents a host State from acting “in

 

away that is ifestly inconsistent, sparent, unr ble (i.e. unrelated to some

rational policy) or discriminatory (i.e. based on unjustifiable distinctions).”*'

As to Claimant’s contention that the Disputed Measures are disproportionate, the Tribunal
takes note of two ways in which disproportionality can be understood. The first of these is
the formulation of the Tribunal in Charanne, cited earlier,**? which this Tribunal

has adopted.

The question of proportionality can also be addressed by weighing the legitimate policy
interest pursued by the State against the impact of the measure on the investment or a class
of investments to which the claim belongs. These competing considerations can be
examined in light of the degree of stability in the regulatory regime in place at the time of
an investment. As stated in Electrabel, the requirement that measures be reasonable and
not arbitrary “includes the requirement that the impact of the measure on the investor be
proportional to the policy objective sought.”>?

Before turning to the evidence, the Tribunal briefly addresses certain other points of law

raised by the Parties’ positions.

The Parties have addressed the implications of due diligence — or lack thereof — by an

investor. Respondent states that Claimant did not “perform a minimum due diligence”

separately considered claimant’s “arbitrariness” claim, which the tribunal found to encompass several concepts,
including disproportionality and reasonableness). See also, Novenergia II - Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg), SICAR v. Kingdom of Spain, SCC Arbitration (2015/063), Final Arbitral Award dated
15 February 2018 (RL-0099) (“Novenergia IT”), | 705 (finding that Spain’s measures did not relate to a rational public

prior to its investment.**+ Claimant states that the clear language of RD 661/2007 RD
1578/2008, along with additional materials and the public statements of the Spanish
government, gave investors a clear understanding of Spain’s “favourable framework.” In
these circumstances, Claimant maintains that it was not compelled to conduct a “formal

due diligence procedure.”*>°

The Tribunal considers that a formal due diligence process is not a precondition to a
successful claim of legitimate expectations. However, an investor cannot benefit from
gaps in its subjective knowledge of the regulatory environment because, under an objective
standard, the investor’s legitimate expectations are measured with reference to the
knowledge that a hypothetical prudent investor is deemed to have had as of the date of the
investment. The extent of inquiry that is incumbent on a prudent investor depends on the

particular circumstances of the case.

332. As to Respondent’s suggestion that the standard of treatment required by the FET provision

of the ECT is fulfilled when the Contracting Party meets the minimum standard required

by international law, 3°

the Tribunal recalls that, after setting out several obligations,
including the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, Article 10(1) of the ECT
provides: “In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than
that required by international law, including treaty obligations.” The Tribunal considers
that this sentence indicates that the standard of treatment under international law, including
other treaty obligations, operates as a floor, with the consequence that the FET obligation
in Article 10(1) cannot be interpreted to require less than is required by “international law,
including treaty obligations.” Moreover, the Parties have not advanced particular
arguments based on asserted similarities or dissimilarities between the requirements of the
FET provision in Article 10(1) and those otherwise found in international law, including

other treaty obligations.

333. The Parties invoke numerous prior arbitral awards. The Tribunal has taken this arbitral

case law into account, without being bound by the conclusions of other tribunals.

334. This case is one of many proceedings arising out of changes in Spain’s regime for
remuneration of renewable energy providers. Even when cases arise under the same treaty
(the ECT) and involve the same regulatory regime, the awards reveal variations in critical
evidence, including the date of investment, the type of renewable energy, and the evidence
given by witnesses and experts. Each claimant presents its legal theory and its evidence in
a unique way, with inevitable consequences for the way in which Respondent defends the
case. In circumstances in which a tribunal’s conclusions follow from accumulated
inferences of fact, these distinctions mean that the conclusion in any one case is highly

specific to that case. This Tribunal bases its decision on the record in this proceeding.

an

Each Party bears the burden of proving the facts that it alleges. Thus, in the main, the

burden of proof falls on Claimant.

(3) The Evidence
a. The Evidence on which Claimant Relies
(i) Claimant’s Expectations as of the Time of the Investment

336. Claimant maintains that its legitimate expectations follow from provisions of Spain’s law
and regulations, as they stood when Claimant invested, as well as other pronouncements
by Spain. It claims that it was induced to invest by the regulatory regime that was in place

when it invested.

337. Claimant states that the date of its investment was March 2010, when it acquired ownership
of Fotones. The fact that it engaged in additional financing transactions in May 2010 does
not change the date of investment and, in any event, the information available in the market
was similar in March and May 2010, so the legitimate expectations of Claimant would have

been the same during either month.*>”

103

338. Claimant and Brattle make a series of observations about the general characteristics of

investment in PV plants.

33

©

PV plants are expensive as compared to non-renewable forms of energy production. They
are capital-intensive, meaning that the largest component of their cost is the initial
investment (purchase and installation of equipment).*°* Claimant’s experts stated that
initial capital expenses for a PV plant account for about 90% of “levelised costs” of a
PV plant, i.e., “the annual price per MWh of electricity that the PV installations would
need to earn, increasing each year by inflation, to obtain sufficient revenues to compensate
for all operating and maintenance costs over the life of the facility, pay back the initial
investment, and provide a reasonable return to the investor.” Operating and maintenance

costs account for the remaining ten percent.*?

34

S

Claimant’s expert explains that, because an investment in a PV plant is so capital-intensive,
the initial investment cost drives the economics of a plant. The investor is “stuck with”
those costs for the lifetime of the plant.*©’ The expert presented the view that the Original
Regulatory Regime therefore reflected the cost of money by establishing a rate of return
that was reasonable as of the time that an investment was made, to be adjusted in light of
inflation. As to RD 1578/2008 in particular, this was accomplished by adjusting the tariffs

applicable to new plants on a quarterly basis.*°!

341.

Claimant has also called attention to the method of financing investments in
PV plants. Equity shareholders face lower risks if their revenue streams are predictable

and stable, as is the case with a long-term, fixed FIT, adjusting over time with

358 Cl. Mem., { 28.

359 First Brattle Regulatory Report, [ 49. Brattle defines “levelised costs” as follows:
“The term ‘levelised cost’ includes depreciation and interest payments, which are both accounting costs, and
other items that accountants would not normally consider as ‘costs’: the payment of outstanding principal
on loans, and also the portion of accounting profits that is necessary to provide a reasonable return on the
initial equity investment. It is appropriate to describe a portion of the accounting profits as a ‘cost,’ because
the return on investment is a cost in a broader sense of the word. If a PV project cannot offer shareholders
a reasonable return on equity then investors will simply turn elsewhere.” First Brattle Regulatory Report,

inflation. Stability and predictability has important implications for debt financing. If a
project is seen to have a sufficiently low risk of default, lenders will make non-recourse or
limited-recourse loans.*** According to Claimant’s experts, a typical financing structure
for a PV project involves non-recourse or limited-recourse financing for about 60-80% of
total initial capital costs.*** Claimant states that there is “no doubt that Spain not only
envisaged that investors would seek financing for their renewable energy projects, it also
acknowledged that such financing would enable them to obtain higher returns on

their investments.” >

342. In support of its contention that the Original Regulatory Regime was informed by Spain’s
understanding that PV investments were highly leveraged, Claimant notes the analysis in
the 2005-2010 PER, which is premised on approximately 77% external financing for

renewable energy investments.°*°>

343. According to Claimant, stable and predictable FITs translate into stable and predictable
revenues, thus reducing the risks for PV investors, which, in turn, reduces the return that is

necessary to attract investors.*©°

344. To substantiate its legitimate expectations claim, Claimant identifies what it considers to
be the provisions of Spain’s laws and regulations that were key to the legitimate
expectations of a PV investor in March 2010. When Claimant invested, Article 30(4) of
Law 54/1997 specified “reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of money
on capital markets.”*°’ Claimant observes that the preamble of RD 661/2007 refers to the

principles of Law 54/1997, “guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the special regime

a reasonable return on their investments.”°%

allowed providers to elect a “regulated tariff, which shall be the same for all scheduling
periods;”*® Article 17(c), pursuant to which this financial support applied to all production
(without limitation as to number of hours);3”° and Article 44(3), which, according to
Claimant, exempted existing FITs from future revisions of tariffs.*”! In addition, according
to Claimant, RD 661/2007 provided for a guaranteed priority of dispatch, assuring that all
production could be introduced into the grid subject to the established tariff.”

Claimant observes that CNE Report 3/2007, issued in advance of RD 661/2007, stated that
the new regulation “must offer sufficient guarantees to ensure that the economic incentives
are stable and predictable throughout the service life of the facility.” That report also
stated that the regulation must provide, inter alia, for regular reviews “that only affect
new facilities.”°"

Claimant also calls attention to the press release issued by Respondent upon adoption of
RD 661/2007, entitled “Government grants profitability and stability with new Royal

Decree for renewable energy and cogeneration,” which included these statements:

Future revision of the tariffs will not affect facilities already
operating. This guarantee gives legal certainty for the producer,
providing stability to the sector and promoting its development. The
new regulation will not have retroactive effects. Installations
commissioned up until 1 January 2008 will remain under the
previous regulation in terms of the fixed-tariff option throughout
their service life. [...]

technologies has been the reason why the new regulation seeks
stability over time that allows entrepreneurs to plan in the medium

348. According to Claimant, the essential features and benefits of RD 661/2007 (including
stable and predictable FITs and priority of dispatch) continued to apply
under RD 1578/2008. It notes that the preamble of RD 1578/2008 stated that the Royal
Decree was necessary to provide “continuity and expectations” to renewable

energy investments.>”°

©

Claimant observes that RD 1578/2008 reduced FITs for PV investments, but did so only
for facilities that had not met the deadline to qualify for the FITs governed by
RD 661/2007. In addition, whereas FITs for plants operating under RD 661/2007 applied
for the useful life of a plant, FITs for plants operating under RD 1578/2008 did not extend
beyond 25 years.

35

S

Claimant notes that the preamble of RD 1578/2008 refers to the pre-assignment registry
that is used for setting FITs under RD 1578/2008, stating that “a mechanism is established

 

for assigning compensation by regis ion in a comy ion assignment registry, at the
beginning of the development of a project, which will provide the necessary legal security
to promoters with respect to the return that the facility will earn once it is put into
operation.”*”© Tt also points to Article 4(3) of RD 1578/2008, which
provides: “Registrations in the compensation preassignment registry shall be associated
with a period of time hereinafter referred to as the ‘call for registration,’ which will create

the right to receive the compensation set in such period of time.”>”

Claimant maintains that, prior to the Disputed Measures, Spain had not made changes to

account reduced investment costs. However, those updated FITs did not apply to a plant
that had previously been assigned a FIT based on its date of entry into the pre-

assignment registry.

Claimant also points to the Fifth Additional Provision of RD 1578/2008, which provides:

“During 2012, based on the technological evolution of the sector and the market, and the

 

functioning of the comy ‘y regime, com| ion for the generation of electric power
by photovoltaic solar technology may be modified.”*” Claimant considers that this
provision necessarily refers only to modification of compensation for new facilities,
because it is not feasible to modify a PV plant after it has been constructed in order to take
advantage of “technological evolution.” It points out that this interpretation of the Fifth
Additional Provision corresponds to the view expressed by the CNE in October 2009 (in
response to an inquiry from an investor) that “modification of the remuneration regime
referred to in additional provision five should be applicable to new facilities registered

from 2012 onwards.”**°

Claimant submits that Spain’s open support for renewable energy and its intense promotion
of the Original Regulatory Regime publicly, “on numerous occasions, in a variety of fora,
before multiple persons, over an extended period of time” reinforced Claimants legitimate
expectations.**! According to Claimant, Respondent widely advertised the Original
Regulatory Regime, inter alia, through government statements, CNE reports, presentations
made abroad specifically directed at foreign investors, press releases and presentations,

declarations from the Minister of Energy, activities promoted by MINETUR, and other

official programs and documents.**?

Claimant refers, for example, to presentations for the
purpose of promoting Spain’s remuneration scheme that included the statements that, under
RD 1578/2008, FITs “will be guaranteed for a determined quota”*** and that Spanish

legislation “[g]uarantee[s] the necessary legal security for investors.”?**

355. Claimant concludes that all of these substantial and formal guarantees were key to
attracting Claimant’s investment, and —as was found to be the case in Micula — Respondent
could not remove such incentives and legal framework without breaching Claimant’s

legitimate expectations and the FET standard.**°

356. Claimant states that SolEs investigated, and was fully aware of, Respondent’s regulatory
environment before and at the time it invested (e.g., through enquiries and analysis that
Claimant, or Voigt & Coll, had carried out since 2006).*8° It states that no due diligence
was required to establish legitimate expectations in light of the clear language of
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 and that no amount of due diligence could have foreseen
the drastic changes undertaken by Respondent.**”

357. Claimant disputes Respondent’s contention that there were warning signs, prior to
Claimant’s investment, that the regulatory regime applicable to existing plants would
change. It considers that contemporaneous evidence leads to the opposite conclusion.
For example, Claimant refutes Spain’s assertion that press reports had indicated certainty
about upcoming regulatory changes, and that the industry was aware of those
changes. It considers that those reports suggest instead that Spain intended to adjust tariffs

without changing those of existing plants, as it had in RD 1578/2008. As illustrations, it

points out that a February 2010 press report on which Spain relies refers to planned projects
(thus making reference to plants to which a FIT had not yet been assigned) and calls
attention to a May 2010 report indicating that the then-Chairwoman of the CNE stated that

“the return on current and future investments will be guaranteed.”**8

Claimant also addresses an Altran and Arthur D. Little Report of a workshop held in
April 2010**° and offers an interpretation that differs from that of Respondent. Whereas
AMG represented that the Report indicated a 25% chance that FITs for existing facilities
would be reduced in five years, Claimant and its expert consider that this report referred
instead to a ten percent chance of a 25% reduction FITs within five years and, moreover,
that the risk addressed in the report was not the risk that tariffs on existing facilities would
be reduced, but rather to a risk of missing a tariff window, with the consequence of being

assigned a new, lower in a subsequent tranche.*”°

As further evidence of industry expectations, Claimant relies on testimony of Respondent’s
expert, Mr. Greatrex, at the Hearing. As discussed below,*?! Respondent’s Expert Report
stated that there was “almost total certainty” as of the date of Claimant’s investment of the
introduction in the short term of measures that would reduce Claimant’s remuneration. In
cross-examination, Mr. Greatrex addressed statements that he had made in e-mails sent
during the period March 2009 to March 2010, when he was a partner at Arthur D Little
with responsibility for PV investments in Portugal and Spain. In a March 2010 e-mail,

Mr. Greatrex referred to an unleveraged return of 10% on a PV project in Spain, which

brief:

During the hearing, Mr. Greatrex recognized that the e-mail did not

so much as suggest the possibility of the impending annihilation of

the [Original Regulatory Regime]. Mr. Greatrex’s email does not

include any warning that the potential return ‘north of 15%’ was at

any risk of being substantially cut after the implementation of the
measures that he claims today were widely foreseen at the time.*??

360. Claimant also addresses Respondent’s contention that the case law of Spain’s Supreme
Court? made clear that Claimant could have had no legitimate expectation other than that
of areasonable return. Claimant considers that only the case law of Spain’s Supreme Court

that was issued prior to Claimant’s investment is relevant to its case and that none of the

 

relevant case law addressed substantial retroactive changes in the energy sector.*** It states

that the relevant case law establishes that:

(a) Spain did not have an unlimited right to amend the regulatory
framework; (b) principles of legal certainty, predictability, and
stability prevented Spain from radical amendments with no
guarantees, transitional periods or compensatory measures; and
(c) if such Spain were to violate such principles, a diligent, well-
advised investor was entitled to believe that Spain would be liable
for the damages caused.°*°

361. 397

Claimant counters Respondent’s contention””’ that, because there is no right to State aid
under EU law, an investor can have no legitimate expectation that support for renewable
energy will be maintained. With respect to European Commission decisions regarding
State aid programmes of Member States, Claimant points out that the European
Commission has made no finding that the Original Regulatory Regime is incompatible

with EU regulations, nor has the Original Regulatory Regime been challenged on that

Commission, that, according to Claimant, were higher than the rate of return pertaining

to Claimant.4°

In response to Respondent’s observations regarding statements made in prospectuses that
Claimant issued to prospective investors, Claimant acknowledges that the prospectuses
included a provision about regulatory risks, including the risk of the FITs
changing. Claimant states that such warnings were mandatory under German regulations
and that, “[a]s Mr. Hopp has explained, this disclaimer did not mean that SolEs Badajoz

was aware of any specific risk of retroactive changes — or that it accepted any such risk.”*°!

Claimant maintains that Spain had represented the return under the Original Regulatory
Regime to be 7-8%, calculated without financing and after taxes. It notes, for example,
that the 2005-2010 PER referred to a return of “around 7%, on equity (before any
financing) and after taxes’** and that the 2008 CNE Report contemplated a return of 7%,
as had been used in RD 661/2007.4%

Implementation Review Country Report — Spain** recommended that Spain raise
environmental taxes. That Report estimated that Spain could raise €3.45 billion in real
2005 terms and €6.96 billion by 2030.*°° According to testimony by one of the Brattle
experts, €3.45 billion would have compensated for the Disputed Measures.*°” Claimant

also asserts that the tariff deficit was the result of Spain’s own actions and omissions.*°°

As to the First Set of Disputed Measures, Claimant maintains that RDL 14/2010, which
capped the number of hours for which a PV plant would receive the FIT, had a clear
negative impact on the sector.*°? Further measures taken in 2012 and 2013 “retroactively
reduced incentives and support’ to PV facilities. These included Law 15/2012 (which
imposed a seven percent tax, and as to which the Tribunal has concluded that it lacks
jurisdiction) and RDL 2/2013, which changed the index used to make annual adjustments
to the FITs for inflation.*"° Claimant states that these measures reduced the revenue of

its plants.4!!

Turning to the Second Set of Disputed Measures, pursuant to which Claimant is subject to
the Specific Regime, Claimant asserts that the rate of return under the Specific Regime is
lower than it had been under the Original Regulatory Regime. Claimant points out that,
because the rate of return under the Original Regulatory Regime was calculated before
financing and after taxes, a fair comparison requires that the rate of return under the
Specific Regime also be calculated before financing and after taxes. It also points out that

the target rate of return under the Specific Regime is subject to periodic revision.

Claimant asserts that the current rate of return under the Specific Regime, which is 7.398%

before taxes, equates to a return of 5.9% after taxes. This is lower than the target return of

7-8% (without financing and after taxes) under the Original Regulatory

: 2
Regime.*!”

According to Claimant’s expert, the return under the Original Regulatory
Regime (7-8% after taxes) would be between 8.7% and 10% before taxes. Claimant’s
expert further states that, because the rate of return under the Original Regulatory Regime
was set without consideration of financing, the after-tax return under the Original
Regulatory Regime cannot be fairly compared to the after-tax return under the Specific
Regime that is calculated using a low tax rate (6.51%) that results from the “tax shield”
that arises from high leveraging. It is inappropriate to calculate a low tax rate based on
interest payments when the Original Regulatory Regime calculated returns without

financing, as Respondent’s experts do.*!

In response to Respondent’s contention that the Specific Regime offers a reasonable return
tied to the cost of money, as did the Original Regulatory Regime, Claimant states that a
“reasonable return” cannot be a “wholly subjective, self-judging standard that depended
entirely on Spain’s unilateral determination.”*'+ Claimant’s expert points out that yields
on Spanish bonds were roughly the same in 2013 as they were when Spain adopted
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008. Thus, a change in the “cost of money” could not justify
the change in economic parameters in 2013, when the Specific Regime replaced the

Original Regulatory Regime.*!>

In response to Respondent's assertion that the rate of return under the Original Regulatory
Regime was set with reference to greenfield investors, whereas Claimant is a brownfield
investor, because construction of its PV plants had largely been completed with Claimant
acquired them, Claimant’s expert accepted both that Claimant was “largely” a brownfield
investor and that a brownfield investor does not bear construction risk, but explains that a
brownfield investor pays a premium to the greenfield investor in order to reduce

that risk.4!°

Claimant states that the detrimental aspects of the “midstream switch” in regulatory regime
extend beyond a comparison of two rates of return. The structure of the tariff that applies
to Claimant’s plants has also changed. Under the Original Regulatory Regime, the FIT
applied to every megawatt-hour produced, creating an incentive to build efficient plants
and to maximize production to achieve an “efficiency reward.” By contrast, under the
Specific Regime, plants receive the pool price (which is much lower than the subsidized
FIT) once they reach an annual cap, which reduces the efficiency reward.*"’ Brattle states
that Claimant’s plants are 20% more efficient than the standard plants used to set rates

under the Specific Regime.*!®

Claimant also maintains that the lack of clarity in the Specific Regime makes it impossible
to predict the future regime and thus to predict future cash flows. It states that Respondent
has retained the discretion to alter parameters such as the target rate of return, which is
subject to revision every three or six years. Under the Specific Regime, the target rate of
return will depend on the yield on ten-year Spanish bonds, to which a “spread” will be
added, but there is no clear or specific methodology for establishing the target rate of return

or, more specifically, the spread that will be applied in setting the target rate.*!°

Claimant’s expert also states that there is a logical problem in the analysis of the rate of
return presented by Respondent’s expert. On the one hand, AMG justifies a 21% reduction
in revenue on the ground that there had been excess profits under the Original Regulatory
Regime. On the other hand, AMG maintains that the rate of return under the Specific
Regime is close to 7% after tax, as it was under the Original Regulatory
Regime. Claimant’s expert considers that the correct analysis is that the cost of money has
not changed, but the return has been reduced, leading to far lower revenues for PV plants.*”°

According to Claimant’s expert, this observation is consistent with the position that the

CNMC took in 2013, shortly after the new regulatory regime was adopted. The CNMC

3. While Claimant maintains that the FET standard can be breached without evidence of
impairment of the investment, it considers that such impairment is in any event present in
this case due to the extent of the financial damages suffered by Claimant. Claimant refers
to the findings of the tribunal in Total v. Argentina to conclude that such impairment is an

international wrong for which compensation must be paid.*””

‘4. Claimant asserts that the new regulatory regime impaired its investment due to the loss of
value of its shares in Fotones, the fact that it is no longer in a position to obtain any return,
and that it has been denied future cash flows from Fotones which were assured under the
prior regime.*?? For instance, Claimant asserts that Respondent’s measures reduced the
aggregate present value of Fotones’ future cash flows by 41%, and reduced the free cash
flows to SolEs over the operating lifetime of the plants by 88.4% compared to the Original

Regulatory Regime.***

Claimant has an acquired right to all future tariffs, for all energy produced by its plants

over a 25-year span.*?°

376. With respect to the date of investment (that is, the date relevant to determining Claimant’s
legitimate expectations), Respondent recognizes that Claimant acquired its interest in
Fotones in March 2010, but states that Claimant’s “actual brownfield investment” was not
made until May 2010, when Claimant obtained additional financing.*?° When asked at the
Hearing to address the significance that it attached to the May date, Respondent answered
that there had been “news in the renewable sector regarding the future amendments to the
regulatory framework’, referring to three documents that it had submitted as evidence,

which were “issued by newspapers.”*"

377. According to Respondent, Spain made no specific commitments in favor of Claimant or its
investments.*?* No diligently informed investor could expect the freezing of an entire
regulatory regime due to the mere fact of fulfilling a mandatory administrative registration

procedure (in this case, RAIPRE).*”?

378. Respondent argues that Claimant’s expectations, beyond that of a reasonable return, are
not objective, taking into account all the evidence, including the regulatory regime itself,
statements by the Government and the CNE, the case law of Spain’s Supreme Court,
EU requirements regarding State aid and industry and press reports that make clear that the
renewable energy sector was well aware of possible changes to the remuneration scheme.
According to Respondent, there were warning signs that the Government would modify
the remuneration of photovoltaic producers, limited by the principle of a reasonable rate

of return.4*°

379. Respondent states that “Claimant has given a biased explanation of the regulatory

only purpose of trying to sustain [its] thesis on the supposed immutability of RD 661/2007
and RD 1578/2008.”**! Respondent submits that Claimant’s expectations are not
reasonable within the regulatory framework applicable to the RE sector in Spain.** An
investor ought to have known that such framework had, inter alia, the following basic
principles: the regulatory system is governed by the principle of regulatory hierarchy and
it is not limited to RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 (instead, it is comprised by Act 54/1997
and the regulations which implemented it, as interpreted by case law); subsidies to the
Special Regime are a cost for the SEE, subordinated to the principle of its economic
sustainability; the remuneration of the Special Regime consists of a subsidy which, added
to the market price, provides RE plants with a reasonable return; and the determination of

the subsidies is fixed on the basis of changing demand and other basic economic data.**?

Respondent emphasizes the centrality of the principle of reasonable return, stating that “all
the consecutive supportive schemes approved by the Kingdom of Spain through RDs and
RDActs, since the RD 2818/1998 to the RDAct 2/2013, were enacted to develop the
LSE 54/1997 and within the limits of its principles of reasonable rate of return and
sustainability” of the Spanish Electricity Sector.*** The principle of reasonable rate of
return incorporates the notion of balance.**° Remuneration must be sufficient for the
investor but not excessive for the consumer.**° If cost exceeds income, the tariff deficit
arises.°” The cost of money, to which Article 30(4) of the LSE refers, is dynamic. The
target rate of return must also be dynamic.*** The Disputed Measures applied the principle

of reasonable return, resolved a situation of imbalance that jeopardized the stability of the

381.

According to Respondent, RD 661/2007 was approved to resolve the overcompensation
problem caused by RD 436/2004 and implied a reduction in the remuneration of PV plants
and thus could not have been enacted to attract foreign investors.*#° Respondent states that

Claimant has failed to prove that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 “contain[s] any

stabilization clause.”**!

382. Respondent also claims that registration pursuant to RD 1578/2008 did not give Claimant
a right to a stable FIT.“ As to the Fifth Additional Provision of RD 1578/2008,

Respondent raises a procedural concern, as follows:

The first and foremost with respect to the Claimant’s new position
regarding the RD 1578/2008 and its 5"" Additional Provision is that
everything that the Claimant now alleges was not exposed in its
pleadings, that is, all of its arguments are ex-novo and it has
not been proved that this way it had interpreted the mentioned
RD 1578/2008. The Respondent refers to the Exhibit C-189,
CNE Consultation on the Fifth Additional Provision of
RD 1578/2008, 22 October 2009, which the Claimant did not allege
in the written procedural phase, despite the fact that the
aforementioned query is from 2009, and also, he included it in the
record shortly before the hearing.**

383. With respect to the substance of the Fifth Additional Provision, Respondent states that the
provision, which states that remuneration “may be modified,” is “totally contrary” to
Claimant's position of guaranteed tariffs for the operational life of the plant.“4 Respondent
considers that its interpretation of the Fifth Additional Provision is supported by the

explanatory statement (preamble) of RD 1578/2008, which provides:

With this purpose in mind, an annual capacity goal has been
proposed that would evolve upward in lockstep with technological
improvements, instead of using cumulative total capacity to set the
limits for the market for this technology. This should be
accompanied by a new economic regime that stimulates
technological evolution and the competitiveness of photovoltaic
facilities in Spain over the medium and long term. In addition, the
support framework for this technology, represented by Royal
Decree 661/2007 of May 25, 2007, which regulates the generation
of electric power under a special regime, which has demonstrated
its effectiveness, should also be adapted rapidly enough to keep pace
with the evolution of technology, it in order to ensure its
effectiveness. Just as insufficient compensation would make the
investments nonviable, excessive compensation could have
significant repercussions on the costs of the electric power system

thereby reducing the excellent medium-term and long-term
perspectives for this technology. Therefore, it is felt that it is
necessary to rationalize compensation and, therefore, the royal
decree that is approved should modify the economic regime
downward, following the expected evolution of the technology, with
a long-term perspective.”

384. As to the 2009 CNE consultation on which Claimant relies, Respondent notes that the
document states both that it is “for informational purposes only” and that “the Government
has the power to determine the application of the fifth additional provision.”*“° According
to Respondent, this consultation “lacks any value in shaping the legitimate expectations of
the Claimant.”**” The Fifth Additional Provision instead contains a clear warning of
change based not only on the development of technology but also on market development
and the functioning of the remuneration system.* In support of this position, Respondent
refers to an InvestSpain presentation on which Claimant relies, which states “[i]n the light

Fifth Additional Provision, “the revision in 2012 does not exclude existing facilities.”*°

Respondent refutes Claimant’s arguments that its legitimate expectations were reinforced
by statements made in an alleged ‘aggressive campaign’ undertaken by Government
personnel to attract foreign investors. Respondent submits that “there was no aggressive
campaign to attract foreign investors, nor was legislation enacted aimed exclusively at

foreign investors.”*!

Respondent refers to the findings of the Charanne tribunal that
information contained in presentations or leaflets carried out by Spain were not sufficiently
specific to give rise to any expectations that the regime would not be modified.* Also, it
submits that Claimant’s argument that RD 661/2007 was an essential part of a campaign
aimed to attract foreign investors is not reasonable, given the general nature of that

regulation, aimed at both domestic and foreign investors.*°

Respondent asserts that the case law of Spain’s Supreme Court supports its contention that
Claimant had no legitimate expectation other than that of a reasonable return. It maintains,
based on Judgments delivered by the Supreme Court in 2006-2007, that the case law
establishes that regulatory changes are “admissible as long as the principle set forth in
Act 54/1997 is respected: a reasonable return.‘ It also refers to three judgments
rendered in December 2009 addressing challenges by energy producers to measures taken
pursuant to RD 661/2007. According to Spain, these three Judgments establish that “there

is no unmodifiable right to the fact that a specific framework of remuneration must be

Respondent asserts that this case law was well known to the renewable energy sector. It
points to reports from within the RE sector that, according to Respondent, reflect an
understanding that the Supreme Court had not required the perpetuation of the existing
situation and had upheld the legality of measures that modified the Special Regime with

respect to existing facilities.4°°

Respondent also relies on the following conclusion from the Award in Charanne regarding

Judgments of Spain’s Supreme Court:

[...] those judgments clearly lay down the principle that domestic
law can modify, in compliance with the LSE, an economic regime,
such as the one provided in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, aimed
at fostering renewable energy production.

Although these decisions by the Spanish courts are not binding on
this Arbitration Tribunal, they are factually relevant to verify that
the investor was unable, at the time of the disputed investment, to
have the reasonable expectation that in the absence of a specific
commitment the regulation was not going to be modified during the
lifespan of the plants.*°7

o

Additionally, Respondent refers to the conclusion by the tribunal in /solux, in light of the
Supreme Court’s jurisprudence, including a ruling of 9 December 2009, that claimant in
that case had more than sufficient knowledge that the remuneration method for its

investment could be “drastically modified, including with a removal of the

regulated tariff.”**

Respondent also points to the testimony of Mr. Voigt that he was aware of Supreme Court
case law prior to Claimant’s investment decision. He testified “J remember that we’ve
discussed a few points, especially in regard of the changes under the RD 661 and if it would
have an impact, and we came to the conclusion that we can still rely on the system of the
RD 1578.”*°? Respondent concludes that “it has been proven not only the relevance of the
Case Law to any prudent investor on March-May 2010, but also that Claimant’s managers

were aware of this Case Law, and relied on it to invest in Spain.”*

Respondent submits that Claimant’s objective expectations must be similar to the
expectations of the RE associations, other relevant investors, regulatory advisors and law
firms who examined the Spanish regulatory framework.**! Respondent lists statements by
participants in the Spanish RE sector that are said to establish that they knew and

Altran Arthur D. Little Report of an April 2010 workshop of RE industry
participants. Respondent maintains that the 25% risk addressed in that Report (which
referred to the risk of a reduction of FITs within 5 years) addressed regulatory risk, not (as
Brattle contends) the risk that a provider would miss a particular quarterly tariff due to

provided pursuant to RD 1578/2008 could eventually be seen as excessive, undercutting
Claimant’s contention that it had a legitimate expectation to the FITs for a 25-year
period. It states that “Spanish Supportive Schemes were enacted in compliance with the
EU Directives and thus, they were subject to the requirements and constant reviews of the
EU regulation on State Aid.”*°° Respondent notes that Mr. Voigt testified that he was
aware of European regulation of state aid.*°’ As State aid is subject to constant review,
Claimant could not have had “the expectation to have a right to future State aid subsidies,

under EU law.”4

Respondent also addresses Claimant’s references to decisions whereby the European
Commission approved certain renewable energy support schemes in EU Member States
other than Spain. According to Respondent, the rates of return in some of those cases
(which appear to have been higher than in Spain) are explained by distinctions between
those factual circumstances and those relevant to the present case. Respondent also
considers that those European Commission decisions indicated warnings that aid levels
could be modified in the future. Thus, Respondent concludes that no prudent investor in
the EU could have concluded that a tariff set by an EU Member State would be immutable

for 25-30 years.*

As additional evidence that Claimant was aware that the regulatory regime could change,
Respondent cites statements made in prospectuses directed at potential investors. For
example, those prospectuses stated that the legal and regulatory framework in the relevant
jurisdictions, “(here, Germany, Spain and/or Italy) may change over the course of the
investment to the detriment of the investment’.“”° The prospectuses warned of possible

n

In Respondent’s view, Claimant’s asserted expectations were also not reasonable because
the adoption of measures aimed at avoiding excess remuneration had been foreseen since
2006.43 Respondent highlights that the regulatory changes to the remuneration scheme
since 2004 were made by the Government to ensure the sustainability of the SEE (as a
macroeconomic control measure to address situations of economic deficit of imbalance)
and to avoid and correct situations of excess remuneration (preventing that the costs fall
only on the consumers).‘”* AMG states that as of Claimant’s investment, the large size of
the tariff deficit was well-known. The unsustainability of the SEE was impending and
foreseeable when Claimant invested.*”> Respondent considers that Claimant was aware or

477

to making its investment which is to be expected of an investor in a highly

regulated sector.*”8

(ii) The Evidence Related to the Disputed Measures

397. As previously noted, Respondent maintains that it took the Disputed Measures in
order to respond to the growing tariff deficit, which had been exacerbated by the economic
downturn (resulting in lower demand for electricity).*” It states that it took measures
to address the tariff deficit as “part of a set of structural macroeconomic control measures
adopted pursuant to recommendations by the European Union and the International

Monetary Fund. These measures have affected all Spanish citizens and businesses,

which have had to bear certain sacrifices and burdens within a highly negative

economic context.”**°

398. In response to Claimant’s contention that the Disputed Measures undermined its legitimate
expectations, Respondent counters that the only essential elements of the remuneration
regime, which have always been maintained, are the methodology of using standard

installations, the principle of a reasonable rate of return and the priority of dispatch.**!

399. As to the First Set of Disputed Measures (setting aside the TVPEE, as to which the Tribunal
has found that it lacks jurisdiction), Respondent states that the cap on hours to which the
FIT would apply (imposed pursuant to RDL 14/2010), corresponded to the operating hours
of the standard facility identified in the 2005-2010 PER and that facilities continued to
receive remuneration (at the market rate) for additional production.**? It states that the
change in inflation index that was made in RDL 2/2013 was a methodological change that
avoided distortions caused by the prior index. Citing documents from 2012 and Supreme
Court Judgments from 2015, Respondent contends that this change was foreseeable to a

prudent and diligent operator.**?

400. Turning to the Second Set of Disputed Measures, Respondent points to the economic
unsustainability of the SEE in 2012 (resulting from an international economic crisis, in the
context of a rise in consumer tariffs, excess remuneration in the RE sector, predictions of
a tariff deficit increase, and Spain’s commitments to the EU to adopt macroeconomic

control measures in the SEE).***

401.

Respondent and its expert (AMG) compare the return received by Claimant under the
Original Regulatory Regime to the return that it has received under the Specific Regime
(which took effect as a result of the Second Set of Disputed Measures). AMG agrees with

Brattle that RD 1578/2008 was designed to generate a return of around 7% after taxes on

PV investments. However, AMG considers that the target of 7% in the Original Regulatory
Regime refers 7% “project return,” not a 7% return on equity.“®° AMG also maintains that
the target rates of return used by Respondent have been designed with reference to
greenfield investors, whereas Claimant is a brownfield investor.**® It states that any
diligent investor in the RE sector in Spain in 2010 would have known that the costs for
construction used to develop the target rate of return did not include premia paid by
brownfield investors.**’ Respondent argues that the RE sector was fully aware that the
financial costs and other costs unrelated to the construction of the PV plants would not be

taken into account when establishing the remuneration to be received by the RE plants.***

402. AMG states that the after-tax rate of return of a PV plant in Spain under the current regime
is “in the region of the 7% after tax return conferred by both RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008.”**° It explains that PV investors enjoy a low effective tax rate, such that a
pre-tax return of 7.398% equates to around a post-tax return of 7%.°° AMG calculates
that the project pre-tax return of Claimant’s two plants (using a weighted average) is in the
range of 8.03-8.11%, which exceeds the governing “reasonable rate of return” of
7.398%.*! AMG also considers that the return under Spain’s current regime is in line with

French and UK benchmarks and exceeds the German reference rate. *°”

Respondent refutes Claimant’s argument that its expectations were breached because a

number of what Claimant characterizes as essential elements were not retained.‘

Respondent maintains that the relevant parameters and methodology used to set
remuneration remained the same after the Disputed Measures. It refers to several reports

and other documents showing that the rates set under the Original Regulatory Regime were

“remuneration standards.”4°4 Respondent emphasizes that it never established the
remuneration according to companies’ financial statements, but rather according to

standard facilities based on market data provided by the RE associations themselves.*?>

404. Although Claimant argues that an essential element of the Original Regulatory Regime was
that subsidies were set according to production, Respondent submits that both production

and investment costs have always been considered in setting remuneration.*”°

405. Respondent also disputes Claimant’s characterization of the Disputed Measures as

retroactive.’°’ It argues that a measure is not retroactive if it does not have the effect of

8

revoking acquired rights and only applies to the future,*°* and that no principle of

international law prevents a State from adopting measures with an immediate effect on
ongoing situations.” The Disputed Measures apply to future facts with respect to legal

situations in progress, but do not affect rights already acquired.*°’ Respondent submits

»501

that “[flor a regulation to be retroactive, it must affect acquired rights. In this case,

however, “Claimant has never had_an ‘acquired right’ to any future remuneration, over

25 years, by means of a fixed and unchangeable FIT, not subject to possible

macroeconomic control measures or SEE reforms. Respondent also notes, as a

relevant fact, that its Supreme Court and the Spanish Council of State have confirmed the

non-retroactive nature of the legislative modifications, given that they apply to the future

without affecting acquired rights.

406. Based on the above, Respondent concludes that Claimant has not satisfied its burden of

proof regarding an alleged breach of legitimate and objective expectations.*™*

407. Respondent points out that prior tribunals have acknowledged that States may introduce
regulatory modifications for a public interest cause through reasonable and proportionate
measures without infringing the ECT.*°° In this case, the measures were enacted to correct
a macroeconomic imbalance, in order to protect consumers and to ensure the sustainability
of the SEE. Therefore, Claimant could not expect that its interests would be protected

unconditionally, even when harming the interests of the Spanish electricity consumers.>°°

408. Respondent submits that its actions were reasonable, since there is an appropriate
correlation between the State’s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve
it. Among other arguments, Respondent considers that the measures adopted affected all
parties involved in the SEE to address the tariff deficit (including all operators in the system
and consumers, as Spanish taxpayers also met the costs of the SEE through financial
contributions from the General State Budget), and that those measures allowed the
stabilisation of the tariff deficit, while maintaining a reasonable profitability to

RE producers.**”

409. Respondent emphasizes that the reduction of the subsidies to the PV sector became
necessary due to their impact on the “spiral[ling] out of control” of the tariff deficit (i.e., the
imbalance between costs and revenues of the electricity system).°”* The tariff deficit grew
because the increase in demand for electricity that had been forecasted was not
realized. Instead, the demand for electricity declined due to the economic crisis. This
deficit in turn contributed to the financial instability of the country since ultimately the

deficit had to be covered by the State budget.°° According to Respondent, the introduction

of measures to guarantee the economic sustainability of the system was predictable before

and during the time the Claimant invested.*!°

410. Respondent also addresses Claimant’s argument that it could have applied other, less
drastic, measures. Further increases of the electricity price charged to consumers were not
practicable because end-users prices in Spain were already among the highest in the
European Union. The measures taken by Respondent were successful in stopping the
increase in the tariff deficit, and even in reducing it progressively, and returned the SEE to
economic and financial stability. Respondent reasserts that the measures that it adopted
have received positive opinions from international organisations such as the IMF and the
European Commission, as well as from private consultancies.*!' In addition, Respondent
notes that Claimant has not disputed the reasonability of macroeconomic control measures
aimed at guaranteeing the sustainability of the RE sector, nor has Claimant substantiated

the viability of the proposed alternative measures it mentions.*!*

411.

Respondent submits that the current regime has resolved a situation of imbalance that
endangered the economic sustainability of the SEE in a reasonable and proportionate

way.5!8

Because the Disputed Measures reflect a valid and rational policy which was
carried out in a reasonable and proportional manner, Respondent submits that it has

complied with the FET objectives and standards established in ECT Article 10(1).>!*

412. Respondent also maintains that there has been no impairment of Claimant’s
investment. The alleged destruction of its investment is neither real nor is it based on actual
data. Instead, it is based on hypothetical calculations. Moreover, Respondent considers
that Claimant’s calculations are contradicted by relevant evidence. For instance,

Respondent refers to the AMG Report to note that according to Fotones’ audited financial

(4) The Tribunal’s Analysis

413.

w

In light of the legal standards that it has identified with respect to the allegation that
Respondent failed to respect Claimant’s legitimate expectations and the claim that the
Disputed Measures were disproportionate and unreasonable, the Tribunal takes stock of

the evidence.

4l

-

To provide context for its analysis, the Tribunal first sets out some general considerations

related to investments in PV plants.

415. PV plants cannot compete with conventional forms of energy production without
substantial public subsidy or other form of incentive. They are capital-intensive, meaning
that most of an investor’s costs are incurred prior to operation (90%, according to
Claimant’s expert). They face a long period for capital recovery.*!® Investments in

PV plants are usually heavily leveraged (in the range of 55-80% leverage).°!”

416. A PV plant typically has an operating life of 25 years or more. In the time period relevant
to this case, there have been technological advances in the PV sector, leading to significant
reductions in the cost of constructing PV plants. However, once a plant is installed using
then-existing technologies, it cannot take advantage of these technological advances in

order to reduce its operating costs.

4l

xn

Respondent’s regulations and regulatory reports indicate that Respondent took account of

these characteristics of PV plants in the design of the Special Regime.

a. Claimant’s Expectations as of the Date of its Investment

Claimant made its investment in Spain in March 2010, when it acquired its interest in
Fotones and engaged in financing transactions in May 2010. Having considered the
evidence relevant to Claimant’s legitimate expectations, the Tribunal concludes that there
were no developments between March 2010 and May 2010 that could have altered in a
material way the legitimate expectations of a PV investor. The Tribunal has therefore
assessed Claimant’s legitimate expectations as of the time when it made its investment,

i.e., March 2010.

‘When Claimant made its investment, LSE Article 30(4) stated that remuneration of a
producer participating in the Special Regime would be based on “reasonable profitability
rates with reference to the cost of money on capital markets.”*'® The Tribunal must decide
whether Claimant’s legitimate expectations were confined to that of a reasonable return
with reference to the cost of money in capital markets, as Respondent contends, or

embraced specific “essential elements,” in particular, a stable FIT, as Claimant contends.

Spain has provided public aid to the renewable energy sector in order to meet its objectives
for renewable energy, which it has set against the backdrop of EU targets. This aid has
included large subsidies to PV plants.*'? Within the Special Regime that was established
pursuant to the 1997 LSE, the key instrument for subsidizing investment in PV facilities

was a premium in the form of a FIT.

In RD 661/2007, Spain changed the mechanism for setting FITs, making the remuneration
more attractive to future investors than was the previous FIT (by de-linking it from market
prices) and thus encouraging investment in renewable energy. In so doing, it sought to

address shortfalls in meeting its renewable energy targets.

When Spain concluded that the policy set in RD 661/2007 had generated more investment

than had been expected, it made further adjustments, first announcing that the FITs under

518 LSE Article 30(4) refers to “reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on capital

markets.” For convenience, the Tribunal, like the Parti

at times uses a shorthand of “reasonable return,” without

 

specific reference to the cost of money in capital markets.

5!9 According to AMG, during the period 2010-2015, subsidies accounted for 87.5% of the revenues of PV plants in
Spain. First AMG Report, p. 68, Graphic 8.

132

RD 661/2007 would not be available to new plants and later, in RD 1578/2008, reducing
the FITs that would apply to new plants. The reduced FITs for new plants took advantage
of technological advances and led to cost reductions that would ultimately benefit

consumers. At the same time, RD 1578/2008 increased the target for PV capacity.

423. The laws and regulations that were in place when Claimant made its investment in
March 2010 did not expressly state that the FIT assigned to a plant would be retained for
25 years. Instead, RD 1578/2008 stated that a FIT assigned to a facility applied “for a
maximum period of twenty-five years.’*?° However, Respondent’s regulations and
associated regulatory reports indicate that the stability of a FIT assigned to a particular
plant was a fundamental aspect of the design of the regulatory regime that was in place

when Claimant invested. In particular:

a. The 2007 CNE Report stated that regulations “must offer sufficient
guarantees to ensure that the economic incentives are stable and
predictable throughout the service life of the facility.”*?! The Report also
noted that transparency and predictability in economic incentives reduce
regulatory uncertainty and reduce financing costs, thereby lowering the

cost to consumers.*2?

b. The 2008 CNE Report stated in section 4.2(b) that “[s]tability and
predictability of economic incentives (tariffs and premiums) reduce
regulatory uncertainty, which encourages investments in new capacity
to address their projects, while minimizing the cost of financing and
thereby reducing the final cost to the consumer.” When it analyzed the
proposed Royal Decree (corresponding to RD 1578/2008), the CNE

stated:

The regulation of the generation facilities under the special
regime established in Royal Decree 661/2007, has tried to
minimize the regulatory risk of this group, providing security

and predictability to economic incentives during the useful life
of the facilities, by establishing transparent mechanisms to
update them annually, and by exempting existing installations
from the four-year review, since the new incentives that are
being set out only affect the new installations.

The guarantees included in this regulation allow for better
financing, with lower project costs and less impact on the
electricity tariff finally paid by the consumer.

c. RD 1578/2008 stated that the mechanism of assigning a FIT to an
individual plant based on its preregistration date will “provide the
necessary legal security to promoters with respect to the return that the
facility will earn once it is put into operation.”>** It provided that
registration in the pre-assignment registry would “create the right to

receive compensation sef’>> for that particular quarter.

424. The regulations and regulatory reports also indicated that adjustments to the FITs (other

than annual adjustments for inflation) would apply only to new facilities. In particular:

a. The 2007 CNE Report called for “regular reviews that only affect
new facilities.”°"°

b. This approach was given effect in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007,
pursuant to which reviews were to be held in 2010 and every four years
thereafter, but the revisions of FITs would not affect installations that
had been authorized before the revision and for up to two years after
the revision.*?”

d. When Respondent concluded in 2007 that progress towards the target for
PV capacity had been more rapid than expected, it issued an order setting
an end-date for applicability of FITs assigned pursuant to RD 661/2007,
but did not reduce the FITs assigned to existing plants. Instead, the
reduced FITs established in RD 1578/2008 did not apply to plants that

e. RD 1578/2008 specified a mechanism for quarterly updates of the FITs

assigned to be assigned to new plants,>*?

such that the “support
framework” could be “adapted rapidly enough to keep pace with the
evolution of technology.”**! These updates did not affect plants to which

a FIT had previously been assigned.

425. Fifth Additional Provision of RD 1578/2008, applicable specifically to PV plants, provided
that compensation would be reviewed during the year 2012 to “modify the economic regime
downward, following the expected evolution of the technology.” Respondent has suggested
that this downward adjustment could have applied to existing plants. Given that existing
PV plants cannot benefit from technological evolution, however, the Tribunal concludes
that a prudent investor operating under RD 1578/2008 could reasonably have understood
the Fifth Additional provision to contemplate “downward modification” only for new
plants. This conclusion is consistent with the position that the CNE indicated in 2009, in
response to an investor query.°*? The preamble of RD 1578/2008 does not detract from

this understanding of the Fifth Additional Provision.

Claimant cites other statements made by Respondent that indicate that the FIT assigned
toa plant would be stable and would not be subject to adjustment other than for

3

inflation.*** These include Respondent’s press release issued upon adoption of

RD 661/2007,°** and various statements made by Respondent and its officials in the

context of promoting investment in renewable energy.**

In the aggregate, these
statements confirm that the stability of remuneration was a key component of the Original
Regulatory Regime, which emphasized by Respondent in communications intended to

attract investments in renewable energy.

In its Statement of Claim, Claimant did not rely on Judgments of the Supreme Court of
Spain to support its claim of legitimate expectations. However, Respondent’s defense has
emphasized the case law of the Supreme Court “as a decisive factual element to configure
the legitimate expectation of any investor.”**° It maintains that those Judgments establish
that “the only limit that must be respected by the Government in regulatory changes is to
grant the RE facilities a reasonable return in terms of the cost of money in the capitals [sic]
market.”>>" Tt also maintains that any prudent investor would be aware of the limits on

legitimate expectations established by the case law.***

The Judgments of the Supreme Court operate in this case as fact, not applicable law, so
Respondent’s assertions about the content of those Judgments and investor awareness of
them are allegations of fact that must be established based on the evidence. Only
Judgments issued prior to Claimant’s investment could inform its legitimate expectations,

so the Tribunal has not taken into account Judgments issued after that date.

The Tribunal considers that a prudent investor should be expected to have a general

awareness of recent decisions of the highest court of the host State that interpret provisions

establish that the FITs would be stable, although they do lend support to conclusions indicated above.

of the regulatory regime on which the investor would rely. The record contains a number
of reports that indicate that participants in the renewable energy sector were following
developments in the Supreme Court. Both Mr. Voigt and Mr. Hopp indicated that they had

at least a general appreciation of the case law prior to Claimant’s investment.>*?

430. The Tribunal approaches with caution the evidence regarding Judgments of the Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court is applying Spanish law, not the ECT. Because each Judgment
addresses specific facts and provisions of law and regulation, the Parties’ selective
quotations from various Judgments are of limited assistance to the Tribunal. In addition,
the Judgments under consideration do not address changes in the remuneration of an

existing plant that are comparable in significance to the abolition of the Special Regime.

431.

At the Hearing, the President of the Tribunal inquired of Respondent: “are there decisions
of the Supreme Court that make clear that, in the view of that court, retroactive changes to
the tariff that applied to particular providers are lawful under Spanish law??*°
Respondent answered by referring to six Judgment that it had introduced as exhibits.**! In
its post-hearing briefing, it asserted that “it was not necessary an identity of facts to apply
the Case Law”** and asked the Tribunal to “read the reasoning of the Case Law and the

99543

understanding of the RE sector regarding this case law, referring the Tribunal to

particular Judgments and reports of industry analysis of Supreme Court case law.

432. Taking into account the evidence before it, including reports of Supreme Court decisions
that were circulating within the renewable energy sector, the Tribunal is not persuaded by
Respondent’s assertion that the case law of the Supreme Court establishes that a prudent

investor could have had no legitimate expectation other than that of a reasonable return.

433. At most, the Tribunal considers that a general awareness of the Judgments would have led
a prudent investor in March 2010 to anticipate the possibility that the Supreme Court would
uphold the legality of modest changes to the remuneration regime applicable to an existing
plant. This conclusion is consistent with the observation regarding Supreme Court
Judgments made by the tribunal in Charanne, cited by Respondent, in circumstances in
which modest changes to remuneration were at issue.*“4 The Tribunal notes that the
tribunal in Jsolux (also cited by Respondent) took into account not only 2009 case law, but

also a 2012 Judgment.*45

43:

-

Respondent also maintains that “economic circumstances are an essential fact that should
shape as well the expectations of the Claimant, in accordance with the regulatory
framework.”**© The Tribunal agrees with this observation. The economic circumstances
invoked by Respondent are the global economic crisis and the tariff deficit in Spain. The
tariff deficit is the result of an imbalance between costs to the system (such as subsidies to
energy producers) and revenue (consumer payments). The tariff deficit in Spain was large
several years prior to the global economic crisis. The Tribunal accepts Respondent’s
contention that the economic crisis led to a decline in demand for electricity, with

consequent increase in the tariff deficit.

435.

an

According to Respondent, the tariff deficit had become “unsustainable” by 2010.*4”
Respondent’s expert (AMG) stated that Claimant decided to invest “under the almost total
certainty of introduction in the short term of Measures in the SES that would reduce the
remuneration paid to RE.’*** Respondent states that other avenues for addressing the tariff
deficit (such as raising prices paid by consumers) had been exhausted and thus were not

available as alternatives to the Disputed Measures.

4 See Y 388 supra.

4 The Tribunal also notes that a judicial finding that a measure meets the requirements of national law does not
preclude a conclusion that the measure violates the State’s treaty obligations.

436. Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s assertions**?

about the implications of the tariff
deficit and the economic crisis for Claimant’s legitimate expectations. According to
Brattle, there was a large tariff deficit (annual and cumulative) both in 2008, when
Respondent adopted RD 1578/2008, and in 2010, when Claimant made its
investment.°~° Brattle states that the economic crisis had hit its peak in late 2008 and that
its implications were clear by 2009.*°! However, Spain increased its renewable energy
targets in 2009 and 2010, rather than decreasing them. Brattle also maintains that
Respondent has exaggerated the effect of the economic conditions on electricity
demand.*** Claimant’s expert also asserts that there were five alternatives means of
addressing the tariff deficit, other than the Disputed Measures. Claimant states that the EU

itself had recommended that Spain increase its environmental tax.

437. Claimant also points to the discrepancy between AMG’s assertion in this proceeding that
there was “almost total certainty” of measures to reduce tariffs and statements made in
2009-2010 by one of the authors of the AMG report (Mr. Greatrex) to the effect that

PV investors could anticipate high returns, e.g., leveraged returns of over 15%.°*?

438. The Tribunal notes that Respondent’s own policy choices determine many of the key
variables that give rise to balance or imbalance between costs and revenues in its electricity
system, including the remuneration paid to producers and the prices paid by
consumers. Obviously, Respondent was aware of the magnitude of the tariff deficit in
2008, when it revised the mechanism for setting FITs for new plants and increased targets
for PV plants in RD 1578/2008. Yet it maintained that regulation up to and beyond the
date of Claimant’s investment in March 2010. It did so despite the fact that, as Claimant’s

expert observed at the Hearing, “[t]he extended nature [of the economic crisis] and the

°°2 Second Brattle Regulatory Report, {| 124-127. Brattle quotes with agreement a February 2009 lecture by
Mr. Javier Péon Torre, who was then a “member of the board of directors of the Spanish regulator,” which describes
as a “myth” the allegation that financial support to renewable energy was a primary cause of the tariff deficit.

implications for Spain were clear by 2009, and the key point is: at that time Spain could
actually reliably project how much it would cost to support renewable energy, because it
had a system that was easy to predict, with inflation updates. And it increased its targets
in 2009 and 2010, in the height of the recession, in part because that was a way of

attracting more investment, and it made sense.”>>4

439. In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence establishes that participants in the renewable energy
sector were aware, as of the date of Claimant’s investment, of the size of the tariff deficit
and of the prospect that Spain would address it.*° It therefore can be said, as Respondent
suggests, that there were “warning signs” that Spain would act in some manner to correct
the tariff deficit, possibly leading to some diminution in the remuneration of existing
plants. However, the reports attributed to participants in the renewable energy sector do
not establish that a prudent PV investor in March 2010 should have expected that
Respondent would decide, as the means to address the tariff deficit, to reduce the FITs of
existing plants and to abolish the Special Regime. If Respondent had contemplated doing
so as of the time of Claimant’s investment, those intentions were not transparent to
investors. The legitimate expectations of investors can only be based on information that

is available to them.

440. The Tribunal takes note of the assertion by Claimant’s expert that Respondent could have
addressed the tariff deficit through changes other than the reduction in remuneration of
existing investors. These observations lend support to Claimant’s contention that there was
no certainty in March 2010 about the manner in which Respondent would address the tariff
deficit. However, the Tribunal expresses no opinion about whether these alternative
measures would have been appropriate policy choices. For purposes of considering the
scope of Claimant’s legitimate expectations, it is sufficient to conclude that a prudent
PV investor as of March 2010 had reason to anticipate some measures by Spain to address
the tariff deficit, possibly giving rise to reduced remuneration to existing investors, but that

the evidence does not establish that a substantial reduction in FITs applied to existing plants

444,

or elimination of the Special Regime was an almost total certainty, as Respondent has

asserted, or even that it was probable.

The Tribunal has also considered the Parties’ positions on European Commission decisions
on State aid, as they bear on an investor’s legitimate expectations. The thrust of
Respondent’s argument is that a prudent PV investor in April 2010 should have realized
there is no right to State aid under EU law and that the aid provided pursuant to
RD 1578/2008 could eventually be seen as excessive, undercutting Claimant’s contention
that it had a legitimate expectation to receive stable FITs for a 25-year period. Claimant,
on the other hand, points to ninety applications to the European Commission for approval
of renewable energy support schemes, all of which were granted. Claimant also compares
the high rates of return in certain of those support schemes to the returns under the Original
Regulatory Regime, suggesting (according to Claimant) that the Original Regulatory
Regime would not be found to run afoul EU requirements. Respondent counters by

distinguishing those other programs from that of Spain.

Each European Commission decision addressed by the Parties is highly fact-specific. Any
observation about how the Original Regulatory Regime might have fared if subjected to
similar analysis would be speculation. There is no basis for the Tribunal to conclude that
an investor should have anticipated, as of March 2010, that the Original Regulatory Regime

would eventually have been found to be inconsistent with EU requirements.

Taking into account the evidence before it (including evidence not summarized above),
such as Respondent’s regulations and regulatory reports, as well as its pronouncements
about those regulations, the case law of Spain’s Supreme Court and the economic
circumstances as of the date of Claimant’s investment, the Tribunal concludes that the
legitimate expectations of a PV investor in March 2010 were not limited to a reasonable

return in light of the cost of money in the capital markets, as determined by Respondent.

The evidence establishes instead that a PV investor in March 2010 had a legitimate
expectation that it would receive a FIT that was stable, once assigned to a PV plant, for the
25-year period specified in RD 1578/2008 (save for inflation adjustment). The stable FIT

was an essential element of the regulatory regime on which Claimant relied when it made

448.

its investment decision, taking into account the capital-intensity, long period of capital

recovery and high leverage that is characteristic of investments in PV plants.

b. The Evidence Regarding the Effect of the Disputed Measures

Having set out its understanding of the essential elements of the regulatory regime that was
in place in March 2010 and the legitimate expectations that arose therefrom, the Tribunal

next examines the evidence regarding each of the two sets of Disputed Measures.

(i) The First Set of Disputed Measures

The Tribunal has identified three measures as the First Set of Disputed
Measures. However, because the Tribunal decided that it lacks jurisdiction to decide
whether the TVPEE violates Article 10(1) of the ECT, it considers here only whether the
cap on hours (pursuant to RDL 14/2010) and the change in the CPI (pursuant to
RDL 2/2013) were consistent with Respondent’s obligation under Article 10(1) to accord

fair and equitable treatment.

The evidence before the Tribunal establishes that, as of March 2010, there were indications
that Spain was considering options for addressing the tariff deficit. A prudent PV investor
could have anticipated that Respondent might make adjustments leading to modest
reductions in the remuneration of existing RE plants, including PV plants operating under
RD 1578/2008.°°° However, Claimant does not maintain that the regime in place when it
invested was immutable, but rather that Respondent had an obligation to retain its essential

or core features.

The Tribunal finds no basis to conclude that the method for indexing FITs to inflation was
— to use Claimant’s own term — a “core feature” of the regulatory regime.**” It cannot be

said that a prudent investor would have placed particular reliance on that element of the

556 Respondent suggested that RD 661/2007 reduced FITs applicable to existing plants under the prior regulation

(RD 7/2006), Rev. Tr. Day 3 (ENG), 53:9 to 55:15. However, Claimant’s

xpert made a convincing case that the

  

changes pursuant to RD 661/2007 actually increased remuneration for most existing plants. Second Brattle Regulatory
Report, {¥[ 68-69.

142

regulatory regime. The Tribunal does not consider that the change in CPI, pursuant to

RDL 2/2013, violated Respondent’s FET obligation.

449. The cap on hours imposed pursuant to RDL 14/2010 was superseded by the Second Set of
Disputed Measures, effective July 2013. Claimant provides limited information about its
consequences (although it does quantify the damages that it associates with this cap). By
contrast, in respect of the cap on hours imposed under the Second Set of Disputed Measures
(as part of the elimination of the entire Special Regime), Claimant provides considerable
detail establishing the loss of the “efficiency premium” that had been available under the
Original Regulatory Regime. On the record before the Tribunal, there is not sufficient
evidence to establish that the cap on hours imposed by RDL 14/2010 was a fundamental
change to the regulatory regime on which Claimant had relied. Accordingly, the Tribunal
concludes that the cap on hours imposed by pursuant to RDL 14/2010 did not violate
Article 10(1) of the ECT.

450. In view of these findings, the Tribunal concludes that, although it appears that the First
Set of Disputed Measures (RDL 14/2010 and RDL 2/2013)*°* reduced Claimant’s revenue
during the limited period while the measures were in effect, they did not change the basic
features of the Original Regulatory Regime (the FIT) and did not undermine Claimant’s
legitimate expectation. Because the First Set of Disputed Measures did not remove the
essential features of the regulatory regime in place when Claimant invested, these measures
also cannot be characterized as disproportionate within the meaning given to that concept
in Charanne.*? The Tribunal concludes that the First Set of Disputed Measures did not

fail to meet Claimant’s legitimate expectations.

451.

Although the First Set of Disputed Measures had an impact on PV investors such as
Claimant, the impact of these measures on investors cannot be described as

disproportionate to the policy objectives of those measures, i.e., the reduction of the tariff

deficit. There is a clear correlation between those objectives and the measures and, in that

sense, the First Set of Disputed Measures cannot be characterized as unreasonable.

45

N

Spain’s adoption of the First Set of Disputed Measures was not inconsistent with its

obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimant’s investment.

453. The Tribunal notes that its conclusion regarding the First Set of Disputed Measures
aligns with the reasoning of other tribunals (including Charanne,* Eiser™®! and
Novenergia I1).>°

(ii) The Second Set of Disputed Measures

4S:

-

By abolishing the Special Regime and replacing it with the Specific Regime, the Second
Set of Disputed Measures eliminated the FITs that had been assigned to Claimant’s plants

based on their dates of registration.

455. The remuneration that Claimant currently receives under the Specific Regime is
considerably lower than the remuneration that it received under RD 1578/2008. Although
the experts disagree on the extent to which the revenue of Claimant’s plants has been
reduced by the Second Set of Disputed Measures, AMG recognizes that Claimant’s
revenue is lower now than it was under RD 1578/2008 (having experienced a

21% reduction in revenue, according to AMG**).

45

an

The evidence also establishes that the target rate of return under the initial period of the
Specific Regime is lower than the target rate of return under the Original Regulatory
Regime. Under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, the target rate of return was
approximately 7%, after taxes and before financing. AMG reaches the conclusion that the
rate of return under the Specific Regime is “around 7% after taxes,” but arrives at this
figure by assuming a low tax rate on remuneration pursuant to the Specific Regime. The

Tribunal finds credible Brattle’s observation that this assumption of a low tax rate could

144

only result from a “tax shield” that results from financing, and thus cannot be applied in a
fair comparison to the 7% target under the Original Regulatory Regime, which was
calculated without financing. When a higher tax rate is applied to the remuneration under
the Specific Regime, Claimant’s expert concludes that the Specific Regime generates a

return (after tax) of 5.9%.

457. The Tribunal also notes that Respondent maintains that Claimant and Brattle overstate the
rate of return that Claimant received under the Original Regulatory Regime because: the
target rate of return set under the Original Regulatory Regime was a project return, not a
return on equity; the target rate of return was set with respect to a greenfield investor, not
a brownfield investor such as Claimant, and Claimant paid an unreasonably high premium
for its plants. In Respondent’s view, once such considerations are taken into account,
Claimant’s rate of return under the Original Regulatory Regime is approximately the same
as the target return under the present-day Specific Regime. On Respondent’s reasoning, it
follows that Claimant’s rate of return under the Specific Regime meets its legitimate

expectation of a reasonable return.

458. Having rejected Respondent’s contention that Claimant’s only legitimate expectation is
that of a reasonable return, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to examine possible ways
of calculating the rate of return applicable to Claimant’s investment. Claimant’s case is
not that it had a legitimate expectation to a particular rate of return. It claims instead that
it had a legitimate expectation to stable remuneration in the form of the FIT set for each
plant pursuant to RD 1578/2008. It is on this basis that the Tribunal has reached its

conclusion on Respondent’s liability.

459. The Specific Regime made changes to the regulatory regime that go beyond a reduction in
the FIT that currently applies to Claimant’s plants. Under RD 1578/2008, Claimant was
entitled to receive the FIT for all energy produced during a particular year, creating what
Claimant’s expert described as an “efficiency reward.” This was of particular benefit for

plants that are more efficient than standard plants, as is the case with Claimant’s plants.°™

5 The Parties’ experts agree on this point, although they disagree on the extent to which Claimant’s plants are more
efficient than standard plants.

145

Under the Specific Regime, by contrast, there is no financial support beyond specified
maximum hours. According to Claimant’s expert, in 2014 and 2015, Claimant’s plants

met the cap on hours around September or October of each year.*©

460. Whereas the Original Regulatory Regime provided stable FITs (subject to inflation
adjustment), there is uncertainty about the remuneration that will apply under the Specific
Regime, because it is subject to periodic revision. For the first period governed by the
Specific Regime, Spain set the “reasonable return” using the average yield on ten-year
bonds in the 120-month period prior to July 2013, to which it applied a margin of 300 basis
points. However, as of 2020, the target rate of return will be based on a different
benchmark, i.e., the average yield on ten-year bonds in the prior 24-month period. As
Brattle noted, Respondent has not been transparent about the spread that it will use in future

periods or about the methodology that it will use to determine that spread.

461.

Respondent repeatedly emphasized that there is continuity between the Original
Regulatory Regime and the present regime because the consistent benchmark has been a
reasonable return in light of the cost of money in the capital market. However, yields on
Spanish bonds were roughly the same in 2013 (when Spain adopted the Specific Regime)
as they were in 2008, in which RD 1578/2008 was adopted. This fact, coupled with the
variable benchmark and uncertainty about the spread that Respondent will use to set future
remuneration under the Specific Regime, demonstrates that, in comparison with the
stability inherent in the Special Regime, Claimant’s remuneration under the Specific

Regime could be even further reduced during the life of Claimant’s plants.

462. Having considered the evidence, the Tribunal concludes that the Second Set of Disputed
Measures changed the basic features of the regulatory regime that was in place when
Claimant made its investment, exceeding the changes that Claimant could have reasonably
anticipated at that time. The Second Set of Disputed Measures was disproportionate in the
sense that the term was used in Charanne, because those measures suddenly and
unexpectedly removed the essential features of the regime in place when Claimant

invested. The Second Set of Disputed Measures did not meet Claimant’s legitimate

146

463.

expectations. Additionally, the Second Set of Disputed Measures was disproportionate in
that the severity of the impact of those measures on the value of Claimant’s investment
exceeded that which a prudent investor could have reasonably anticipated in light of the
stability that inhered in the Original Regulatory Regime, even taking into account Spain’s

need to address its tariff deficit.°%

On the basis of the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that, by enacting the Second Set
of Disputed Measures, Respondent violated its obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT

to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimant’s investment.

B. The Alleged Violations of the Expropriation Provision and of the Umbrella Clause

464.

465.

466.

As previously noted, Claimant contends that its investment was expropriated in violation
of Article 13 of the ECT. One of the allegedly expropriatory measures is the TVPEE, as

to which Respondent has raised an admissibility objection.

Claimant also contends that the Disputed Measures violated the “umbrella clause” of
Article 10(1) of the ECT by failing to honor undertakings entered into with respect to

Claimant’s investments.

Although the elements of a claim under each of these provisions differ from the elements
of an alleged violation of the FET obligation, all of these claims arise from the same
facts. Claimant, which has stated that the loss under each head of damages is the same,>”

stating its position on damages, Respondent has not differentiated among the three grounds

A. The Applicable Legal Standard

(dd) The Parties’ Positions

a. Claimant’s Position
470. Claimant argues that the applicable legal standard derives from Article 13(1) of the ECT,
under which compensation shall “amount to the fair market value of the Investment [and
it] shall also include interest at a commercial rate”>’© Claimant submits that, while this
standard corresponds to compensation in the event of expropriation and the ECT does not
specify a standard for compensation for a breach of the FET standard or the umbrella
clause, “the principle remains the same[:] Spain must restore SolEs Badajoz to the

economic position it would have been in but for Spain’s treaty violations.”°"

47

. Claimant submits that the compensation standard of Article 13(1) of the ECT is consonant
with the standard for reparation set out by the Permanent Court of International Justice in
the Chorzéw Factory case (i.e., that compensation must “wipe out all the consequences of
the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if
that act had not been committed’).*"* Claimant indicates that the ILC Draft Articles on
State Responsibility°”’ and the tribunal’s award in Enron v. Argentina®®® confirm that the

Chorz6w Factory principle covers all violations of a  State’s international

obligations. Therefore, “the amount claimed under each head (indirect expropriation,

breach of the FET standard and breach of the ECT’s umbrella clause) is the same, since
29581

 

in each case it consists in the loss of the value of SolEs Badajoz’s investment in Fotones.

Claimant concludes that, due to the loss it incurred as a result of Respondent’s measures,
Spain “must now make SolEs Badajoz whole by paying the Claimant monetary
compensation equal to the Claimant’s monetary losses that would not have occurred in the

absence of Spain’s unlawful actions.”>*?

b. Respondent’s Position

473.

o

Respondent’s position is that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction and that there is no
merit in Claimant’s claims.°** Since, in Respondent’s view, the Spanish legal and
regulatory regime has always granted a reasonable return to investors, Claimant cannot

have been dispossessed of anything which may give rise to damages.**>

474. Respondent also argues that Claimant does not meet the required burden of proof and its
damages claims should be rejected because they are speculative (e.g., Claimant has not
proven that its plants have lost value and Brattle’s ‘actual’ scenario is based on a false
premise that the current remuneration scheme will remain frozen).**° Respondent supports
its assertion, inter alia, by referring to the Gemplus v. Mexico award in which the Tribunal
found that “[...] the Claimants bear the overall burden of proving the loss founding their
claims for compensation. If that loss is found to be too uncertain or speculative or
otherwise unproven, the Tribunal must reject these claims, even if liability is established

against the Respondent” .**”

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

475.

an

Claimant does not ask the Tribunal to order reparation in the form of restitution. Instead,
it seeks compensation. Whereas Article 13 of the ECT specifies the standard governing
compensation for a breach of that article, the ECT does not specify the manner in which

compensation is to be determined when there has been a breach of Article 10(1).

47

a

The Tribunal considers that compensation for a breach of Article 10(1) is governed by the
customary international law of State responsibility. As stated by the Permanent Court of
Justice, the “essential principle” is that reparation must “as far as possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act.”*** To the same effect is Article 31(1) of the International
Law Commission’s Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally
Wrongful Acts, which provide that a “responsible State is under an obligation to make full
reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.”**° Respondent
therefore has an obligation to compensate Claimant for the reduction in the fair market

value of its investment that was caused by the Disputed Measures.

AT

_

As stated in Article 31(2) of the ILC Draft Articles, the injury for which reparation is due
includes damage “caused by” the State’s internationally wrongful act.°°? The ILC
explained in the Commentary to the Draft Articles that the reference to a “causal link” is
used “to make clear that the subject matter of reparation is, globally, the injury resulting
from and ascribable to the wrongful act, rather than any and all consequences flowing
from an internationally wrongful act.”*' “The notion of a sufficient causal link which is

not too remote is embodied in the general requirement in article 31.”

B. Valuation Method

(dd) The Parties’ Positions

a. Claimant’s Position

479. Claimant states that the damages the Tribunal must award if it finds Spain liable should be

“based on the reduction in the value of net profit flows to equity investors that has resulted
from Spain’s implementation of the Disputed Measures.”*** Claimant argues that it has
lost past and future cash flows due to the measures adopted by Respondent and thus that
the appropriate methodology for measuring damages is the calculation of the present value
of such losses.°?° Claimant considers that the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”)
methodology should be used to quantify the financial consequences of Respondent’s

violations of the ECT.*°°

480. In the words of Claimant’s experts, the DCF method “measures the future stream of

481.

expected cash flows from a project, and ‘discounts’ them by a particular percentage rate

per year to determine a present value.”>?"

Claimant’s position is that the DCF method is “particularly well-adapted to the electricity

sector”>8

and “all the more appropriate under the particular facts of this case.”*°? The
reasons for which Claimant considers the DCF appropriate in light of the facts of the case
include, inter alia, the following: (i) the DCF method is highly suitable when quantifying

the impact of different scenarios which alter cash flows, as it can capture the effect of the

individual changes caused by particular risks; (ii) this case requires the assessment of
the impact of changes to a regulatory system which defined input parameters on future cash
flows;! (iii) SolEs made most of its investment up front based on predictable costs and
revenues, and to the extent that Spain’s “withdrawal of the benefits of RD 1589/2008 [...]
severely reduced the revenue stream that SolEs Badajoz legitimately expected and
rendered it less certain,” Brattle’s DCF model is the appropriate one for calculating the
damages;? and (iv) Spain’s objections to the use of the DCF method were previously

dismissed by the Eiser tribunal, which — along with other tribunals that have found Spain

liable for disputed measures — awarded damages based on the DCF method.°?

Claimant also submits that there is no merit to AMG’s criticism that Brattle’s calculation
of damages produces speculative and inconsistent results. For instance, Claimant argues
that AMG itself relies on notions such as “lifetime project IRRs” (which require the
assessment of future, hypothetical cash flows), that AMG provides no detail as to what
specific aspects of the DCF method it challenges, and that Spain itself used forecasts of
future cash flows over expected plant lifetimes when designing renewable

energy incentives.°*

b. Respondent’s Position

Respondent opposes the use of the DCF method and instead favors an asset-based valuation

(“ABV”) methodology to calculate damages in this case.

Respondent submits that the DCF method should be dismissed in cases such as the present
one where its implementation would be too speculative. The reasons for which
Respondent considers that applying the DCF method in this case would be inappropriate

include, inter alia, the following: (i) this method is based on a simplistic distinction

DCF method in cases such as the present one where it is excessively
speculative.°'* Instead, the best-suited valuation methodology should be based on the costs
of assets, which is more credible and reliable than DCF.°'* An ABV methodology ensures
that investors receive “the repayment of its investments plus an adequate return on the
costs thereof.”°'> Among the advantages of the ABV methodology, Respondent mentions
the following: (i) it is simpler and less speculative than DCF;°'® and (ii) its use is

486. Respondent concludes that, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal should adopt a
methodology which values the costs of the assets to best determine the quantum and “rule

out any value judgement based on a DCF in the present case.”°'®

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

487. Regardless of the particular valuation methodology that is used, the calculation of
damages necessarily involves the use of certain assumptions and estimations. Neither
the ECT nor international law mandates the use of any particular methodology for

determining damages.

488. Having considered the positions of the Parties, the Tribunal concludes that the
DCF methodology is well-suited to the present case, in which the Tribunal has found that
the Second Set of Disputed Measures violated Respondent’s obligation to accord fair and
equitable treatment to Claimant’s investment and diminished the revenue that Claimant
would have received had the Original Regime been maintained. It provides a sound basis
to compare the present value of Claimant’s investment in the absence of the Disputed
Measures to the present value of Claimant’s investment in light of the Disputed
Measures. The DCF method is widely used and has been applied to assess damages in
other proceedings in which Spain’s repeal of the Special Regime has led tribunals to

find liability.°!

489. Respondent and AMG have made a number of specific criticisms of the DCF methodology,
as used by Brattle. The Tribunal considers that these criticisms, and the responses thereto,

are best addressed in the context of the particulars of Brattle’s analysis.

C. Amount of Compensation to which Claimant is Entitled

S

Claimant states that Brattle calculates that the Disputed Measures reduced Claimant’s free
cash flows (that is, the cash flows available for distribution to shareholders or to banks)°”°
by a total of EUR 52.7 million, to which Claimant adds EUR 14.0 million in pre-Award
interest (at the rate of 5.94%, compounded monthly) and a tax gross-up of EUR 29.1
million. In total, calculated as of the date of Brattle’s Second Quantum Report, the Award
would be EUR 95.8 million.©! This amount reflects adjustments made by Claimant to the

compensation originally requested in its Memorial of EUR 97.7 million.” Claimant relies

on: (i) the three-step valuation methodology adopted by its experts from Brattle;°?

(ii) Brattle’s main conclusions, including its criticisms of the valuation methodology

624

adopted by Respondent’s experts; and (iii) Brattle’s alternative claim.°>

(i) Brattle’s Valuation Methodology

491. Brattle calculated the damages to Claimant by:

(1) calculating the value of free cash flows to SolEs Badajoz, as they
would have been in the absence of Spain’s illicit measures
(the “But-For scenario”); (2) calculating the reduced value of free
cash flows to SolEs Badajoz as a result of the implementation of the
Disputed Measures (the “Actual scenario”); and then
(3) calculating the difference between the amounts established in
steps (1) and (2), as of the appropriate valuation date.°®

492. Claimant argues that the appropriate valuation date is based on the ECT’s requirement
that the time for compensation shall be “immediately before the Expropriation or
impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the
investment.”®7 Claimant argues that the applicable valuation date is therefore 30 June

2014 (i.e., when Respondent defined the framework that overhauled the Original

Regulatory Regime).°**

493. Brattle quantified the financial impact of the Disputed Measures on SolEs as follows:

First, in “Step 1” [Impact of the Disputed Measures up to the
valuation date], Brattle evaluates the financial impact of the
Disputed Measures on the cash flows that SolEs Badajoz’s interest
in Fotones would have generated between the connection date of
Badajoz I (12 July 2010) and the Valuation Date [...] by comparing
a “But-For scenario” (without the Disputed Measures) with an
“Actual scenario”, which applies the Disputed Measures.

Then, in “Step 2” [Cash flows that SolEs’ interests would have
generated beyond the valuation date, in the absence of the
Disputed Measures], Brattle establishes a [DCF model] to evaluate
the cash flows that SolEs Badajoz’s interest would have generated
following the Valuation Date, in the absence of the Disputed
Measures, over the remaining operating lifetime of the plants during
which they could operate without significant new capital investment
(the But-For scenario) [This scenario assumes that the FITs
provided under RD 1578/2008 continue to apply, that the plants will
cease operations after 25 years, and that that there is less regulatory
risk than exists under the current regime]. This is compared to the
cash flows forecast taking into account the effect of the Disputed
Measures, i.e. the Actual scenario. After measuring the value of
SolEs Badajoz’s interest as a whole, Brattle deducts the value of
outstanding liabilities to measure the value of SolEs Badajoz’s
equity interest. Brattle also performs a number of reality checks to
confirm the reliability of its valuations[.]

7 ECT, Article 13(1).
©8 Cl, Mem., {[ 604; Cl. Reply, | 624. See also Cl. PHB, {ff 187, 189.

157

— Finally, in “Step 3” [Pre-award interest and tax gross-up],
Brattle computes pre-Award interest and the tax “gross-up” to be
applied to an award in the Claimant's favour{.]°?

494. In Step 2, in order to calculate the cash flows after the valuation date that would have been
generated in the absence of the Disputed Measures, Brattle developed two versions of the
DCF model. For both the Actual and the But-For scenarios, certain assumptions are
common, such as the forecast production levels, operating and maintenance costs and
inflation rates. Production levels were based on historical performance of the two plants

as well as contemporaneous forecasts by SolEs.*!

495. The But-For scenario differs from the Actual scenario in three main ways. First, in the
But-For scenario, Brattle assumed that the FITs provided by RD 1578/2008 would
continue, whereas the Actual scenario was calculated on the basis of the Specific
Regime. Second, the But-For scenario assumed that the plants would cease operating after
25 years (consistent with RD 1578/2008) while the Actual scenario assumes 30 years of
operation (consistent with the Specific Regime). Third, Brattle’s model assumed lower
regulatory risk under the But-For scenario than the risk that exists under the new

regulatory regime.

496. To account for the fact that future cash flows have less value than current cash flows due
to market risk and the time value of money, Brattle’s DCF model discounted future cash
flows to reflect the risks under the But-For scenario and the Actual scenario and thus to
determine their present value.*? This required Brattle to conduct an analysis of the
discount rates for the But-For scenario and the Actual scenario, by: applying the Capital

634

Asset Pricing Model, resulting in a discount rate of 4.84%;°"" quantifying the regulatory

risk that is specific to Spain (meriting a rating of “BB+” under the Actual scenario and of

“A+” under the But-For Scenario); and establishing a ‘liquidity discount’ (of 25% in the

Actual scenario and of 12% in the But-For scenario).°*°

_

In addition, Brattle performed a number of reality checks, which included verifying that:
the value attributed by Brattle to SolEs’ interest in Fotones as at June 2014 was consistent
with the price that SolEs actually paid for that interest in 2010; that the Internal Rate
of Return (“IRR”) for SolEs under Brattle’s But-For scenario was consistent with the IRR
that Claimant anticipated at the time of making its investment; and that Brattle’s DCF
valuation of the plants was consistent with current views about the market value
of concentrated solar power assets.” Contrary to Respondent’s assertions, Claimant

maintains that Brattle’s analysis of SolEs’ IRRs is sound.°*

°

As part of “Step 3”, Brattle calculates the interest due to Claimant. Claimant notes that
ECT Article 13(1) specifically provides that interest be applied to compensation “at a
commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until the
date of payment.” According to Claimant, the expropriation standard should apply to all
of its claims.®° It considers SolEs’ commercial borrowing rate at the time that it made its
original investment (5.94%) as the appropriate rate for pre-Award interest (i.e., the interest
that will have accrued between the valuation date and the date of the Award).™° Claimant
submits that this rate “is an arms’ length, market-driven interest rate [which] represents

SolEs Badajoz’s cost of borrowing for this project.”™'

Claimant further requests the
interest to be compounded on a monthly basis.™? On this basis, Brattle calculates pre-

Award interest of EUR 14 million up until the receipt of the Award, assumed to take place

(ii) Brattle’s Main Conclusions and Criticisms of Respondent’s
Valuation Methodology

499. Brattle concludes that, as a result of Respondent’s measures:

e the measures introduced between 2010 and 2013 reduced the revenues of Fotones
by 12% or EUR 3.63 million between January 2011 and June 2013 and reduced the

e the regime established by RDL 9/2013 of 12 July 2013 and Law 24/2013 of
26 December 2013 (and then clarified in June 2014 by RD 413/2014 and
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014) in combination with Law 15/2012 “reduce[d]

500. Claimant objects to AMG’s ABV methodology as it “inverts the logic of the Claimant’s
claim” ©” Claimant maintains that AMG takes a legal premise — as opposed to a purely
economic approach — as a starting point for its analysis: that investors in the Spanish PV
sector were only entitled to a “reasonable return” that Spain determined from time to time,
rather than the “stable returns provided under the Original Regulatory Regime”, such as
the FITs provided under RD 1578/2008.* Claimant argues that there is no basis for
AMG’s ABV methodology as it only derives calculations from the initial investment and

does not quantify the economic effects of the Disputed Measures.*?

501. Claimant concludes its objection to the ABV method as follows:

Asset valuation is in any event irrelevant [in this case]. [T]he
Claimant’s case is that SolEs Badajoz was entitled to the stable FIT
provided in RD 1578/2008. As a consequence of the Disputed
Measures, it has received (and will continue to receive) much
less. The difference between these two values constitutes the
Claimant’s loss. This loss is unaffected by the value, real or
supposed, of its initial investment.

502. In addition, Claimant considers AMG’s version of the DCF model to be untenable. It
asserts that AMG inverts the regulatory risk that drives the discount rate under the “Actual”
and “But-For” scenarios. That is, AMG understates the damages based on an incorrect
assumption that the Actual scenario should be deemed less risky than the But-For scenario
(thus incorrectly applying a regulatory risk premium of 4.99% under the But-For scenario

).! Claimant relies on

and a 0% regulatory risk premium under the Actual scenario
Brattle’s conclusions that the regulatory risk premium is lower in the But-For scenario and
that “the New Regulatory Regime increased risks”, including those of financial, regulatory
and insolvency nature.®? Claimant points out that Brattle has calculated that AMG’s
assessment of regulatory risk accounts for EUR 43.8 million of the difference between in
damages assessed under AMG’s DCF model and damages under Brattle’s model.** Once
Brattle’s corrections to AMG’s DCF model are applied, AMG’s amount of damages is

raised to a level approaching Brattle’s damages estimate."

503. Claimant disputes the main conclusion that AMG draws using its ABV methodology, i.e.,
the contention that Claimant’s plants currently receive a rate of return in excess of the
reasonable rate of return of 7.398%, because their weighted average return before taxes is

8.7%. Claimant submits that this calculation was not obtained using Claimant’s actual cost

of investment, but it mostly relied on investment and operating costs established by
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 for “standard installations”.°° Moreover, Claimant
points out that, despite AMG’s assertions that Claimant has suffered no damages and is in
fact better off under the current regime, AMG’s DCF model shows substantial pre-tax cash

flow reductions.°°

(iii) Brattle’s “Alternative Claim”

504. Brattle calculated an “Alternative Claim” for damages in the amount of EUR 37 million,
to account for Respondent’s allegations that SolEs was entitled to the return that
Respondent deemed reasonable under RD 1578/2008.°°” To this end, Brattle constructed
an “Alternative But-For Scenario” which assumes that Respondent would have
remunerated producers with an “Alternative Tariff per MWh of production”, based on the
cost and production parameters set forth in Ministerial Order TET/1045/2014

(e.g., including an after-tax target return of 7%, over a 25-year regulatory lifetime).°*

505. Claimant submits that the Alternative Claim allowed Brattle to identify and quantify the
following four harms: (i) that Spain reduced the “reasonable return” of 7% originally
assured under RD 1578/2008 (i.e., Brattle finds that when certain assumptions are applied
to the 7.398% return provided under the current regime, the result is an after-tax of
5.93%);°° (ii) that Spain has appropriated the efficiency gains that had previously been
earned by more efficient plants under RD 1578/2008 (e.g., Brattle finds that the current
regime has reduced the remuneration to single-axis plants —such as Badajoz I and II- more
than it has reduced the remuneration to double-axis plants, and Brattle’s alternative tariff
eliminates this defect); (iii) that Spain unduly and retroactively recovered returns earned
in previous years under the Original Regulatory Regime (Brattle corrects this feature by

constructing the Alternative But-For scenario without minimizing investors’ future returns

based on their past returns);°! and (iv) that Spain’s change in the basis of payment to
producers —-from a FIT per MWh of production to an incentive per MW of installed
capacity— undermined the previous incentive to maximize production (in contrast, Brattle’ s

Alternative But-For scenario preserves the incentive to maximize production).

(iv) The Claim for a Tax Gross-up

an

Claimant seeks a tax “gross-up” to compensate Claimant for the difference between the
income taxes it would have to pay on the award in Germany (at a rate of 31.23%) and the
withholding tax that it would have to have paid on dividends (at a rate of 1.56%) and
interest payments (at a rate of 31.23%) from Fotones, absent the Disputed Measures. On
this basis, Brattle calculates a tax gross-up of EUR 29.1 million (this figure is an adjustment

to the EUR 30.4 million set out in Claimant’s Memorial).

7. Claimant states that a tax gross-up is necessary to compensate Claimant fully for

Respondent’s violations of international law which are “the direct, but-for cause of such

7665

additional taxes Claimant contends that the tax gross-up is an indispensable

component of the damages given that: (i) Article 21 of the ECT does not prevent the

award of a tax gross-up;°°

(ii) the so-called “Monetary Gold” principle invoked by
Respondent is inapposite, since the Tribunal can award the tax gross-up without exercising
jurisdiction or affecting the rights and obligations of Germany; (iii) the acts giving rise
to the tax gross-up are attributable to Respondent under international law; (iv) contrary

to Respondent’s assertion, no tax exemption under EU law would apply to any award in

Finally, Claimant submits that Respondent should be ordered to pay post-Award interest
at the rate of 5.94%, compounded quarterly, on all damages awarded by the Tribunal until

full payment of the Award.°7!

b. Respondent’s Position

Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss all Claimant’s claims for damages. It
considers that Claimant has no right to compensation, as the alleged damages are
speculative.””? Respondent opposes the use of the DCF method to calculate damages in

this case since it considers that it is “excessively speculative”.

In any event, as
summarized below, Respondent submits that the results of the AMG valuations using
the DCF method show that the Disputed Measures have not caused any damage to
Claimant’s investment. Respondent also considers that the valuation date used by

Claimant (30 June 2014) was “arbitrarily chosen.”®?

Concerning the amount of compensation, Respondent relies on: (i) the valuation
methodology adopted by its experts from AMG, which show a positive financial impact to
Claimant of EUR 4.5 million, as well as Claimant’s incorrect determination of interest and
the inadmissibility of the tax gross-up;°”° (ii) AMG’s main conclusions, including

677

criticisms to the valuation methodology adopted by Brattle;°’” and (iii) the reasons for

which it considers that Brattle’s alternative claim is flawed.°”

(i) AMG’s Valuation Methodology

511. AMG?’s approach to damages is based on the following main premises:

[AMG employs an ABV methodology that] is based solely on
reliable data such as Regulatory investment and operating costs{,]
thus eliminating the uncertainty inherent to the DCF method.*”

The Spanish Regulator bestows each plant or installation and
Greenfield investment, a reasonable return of around 7.398% [...]
Claimant [...] is a secondary, financial or Brownfield investor since
its two photovoltaic plants were acquired by the Claimant after
several related transactions, when the plants had already obtained
the main permits necessary and were already under
construction. Therefore, [...] the focus [is shifted] from the
shareholder to the project, making the necessary adjustments [...]

[AMG] calculated the project pre-tax returns of the Claimant’s two
plants on the basis of the characteristics that define the
compensation pursuant to Royal Decree Law 9/2013 and its
Regulatory development, Royal Decree 413/2014 and Ministerial
Order IET 1045/2014 for each type installation. [In its Second
Report, AMG updated its calculation to take into account
remuneration parameters for 2017-2019].

[AMG then performed alternative calculations using the
DCF method which] arrive at diametrically opposite conclusions to
those presented by Brattle. The divergence [...] has its origin in a
very different interpretation of the situation of the SEE in the Actual
and the But for scenarios. Brattle’s But for scenario does not take
into account the effect that the Tariff Deficit would have had on
investments while [AMG’s] takes into account the SEE’s drift
towards bankruptcy had the Measures not been introduced.
Brattle’s Actual scenario assumes that the Regulator shall in the
future substantially cut the remuneration to RE and _ they
discount this cut (which has not occurred{...]). [AMG’s] Actual
scenario reflects the reduction of the Tariff Deficit that is evidencing
itself and interprets this reduction as a sign of stability that
improves the forecast for the Claimant’s investment in regards to
the But for scenario.®°

© First AMG Report, { 163.
80 Td. 913, 4, 14.

165

512. AMG also calculated the financial impact of the measures through a DCF method, to
provide a simulation of the volatility of the DCF results used by Brattle.**! Among other
elements of its analysis, AMG construed its DCF alternative model based on: 20 June 2014
as valuation date (under both scenarios, But-For and Actual);°°? a useful life of 30 years

(both scenarios); a discount rate of 10.30% (But-For scenario) and of 5.40% (Actual

scenario); capital expenses (“CAPEX”) and operating expenses (“OPEX”) based on IET

1045/2014; a CAPEX depreciation of 7% annually; and an illiquidity discount of 25%

(But-For) and of 18% (Actual).°°?

513. On the basis of its DCF calculations, AMG concludes that the net present value (“NPV”)
of cash flows at the date of valuation is EUR 86.3 million for the But-For scenario, while
the Actual scenario provides an increase in NPV to EUR 90.8 million. Therefore, the
current regulatory regime increased the value of Claimant’s investment by EUR 4.5 million
(this is an adjustment to the amount indicated in Respondent’s Counter Memorial of an

alleged positive impact on Claimant’s investment of EUR 7.3 million).°**

514. Moreover, Respondent submits that Brattle’s analysis of SolEs’ IRRs (computed as part of
Brattle’s reality checks) reflect the speculative nature of Claimant’s damages claim. In
this regard, AMG calculated that Brattle’s But-For scenario would lead to an average IRR
of 15.88%, which is disproportionate considering the risk profile of the investment.®° In
contrast, in its second report, AMG ratified its earlier observations and updated its

calculations, concluding the following regarding the IRRs:

[...] In our calculations, we have we have used the CAPEX and
OPEX set out by Ministerial Order IET 1045/2014 for each of the
standard type classes that correspond to the Plants. We compare
the IRRs thus obtained with the IRRs calculated using the actual real

CAPEX incurred by the Claimant — excluding non-remunerable
items, such as the acquisition premia paid by the Claimant. [...]

[T]he weighted average project IRR of both Plants amounts to
8.80% when we use the IET 1045/2014 CAPEX, and to 8.86% when
we use the actual CAPEX incurred in the Plants. Both rates are well
above the RRoR of 7.398%.°"

AMG therefore concludes that, after the Disputed Measures, Claimant’s plants are

obtaining returns that are higher than the benchmark returns.°**

(ii) AMG’s Main Conclusions and Criticisms of Claimant’s
Valuation Methodology
As a result of its analysis, AMG concludes that under the Specific Regime a reasonable
rate of return of more than 7.398% is attained for both of Claimant’s plants (as their
weighted average return before taxes amounts to 8.768%, representing 137 base points
above the reasonable rate of return of 7.398%). In other words, Claimant’s plants are

profitable and Claimant has not suffered damages.”

Respondent objects to Claimant’s chosen valuation date (30 June 2014), as it considers that
it has been “arbitrarily chosen by the Claimant.”®! It submits that the discrepancies
between the results of the Parties’ experts are due to the different parameters used by each
side, which further highlights the “inadmissibility and inconsistency of the DCF
method.”®? Contrary to Brattle, AMG considers that the But-For scenario entails a greater
risk and greater levels of uncertainty to the investment than the Actual scenario, which is

deemed as “stable, more predictable and with lower risk” ©?

520.

In its post-hearing brief, Respondent criticizes further elements of Brattle’s calculation of
damages, including the following: Respondent highlights AMG’s conclusion that about
44% of the future purported damages calculated by Brattle are attributable to prior
measures (such as the generation of the 7% tax and the permanent cap on production
introduced by Royal Decree Law 14/2010);°* it submits that, since Claimant is a
Brownfield investor, it is to expect lower returns for lower risks (given that a reasonable

) 695

rate of return is provided to Greenfield investors, not Brownfield ones. it argues that

Brattle’s financial model does not reflect the historical production of the plants®® and that

Claimant took excessive levels of debt.”

Respondent and its experts disagree with the 5.94% interest rate put forward by Claimant,
which Brattle uses as part of Step 3 in its valuation methodology. Respondent requests the
Tribunal to use the interest rate of the Spanish short-term sovereign bond as the appropriate
pre-Award interest rate, since this rate would be sufficient to cover the risk of non-
payment.®® AMG indicates that the mean average of the yields of Spanish 1-year treasury
bills from June 2014 to the time of reference of the last available rate in December 2016
produces a rate of 0.037%.° Respondent does not propose any compounding of

interest.’

(iii) Brattle’s “Alternative Claim”
Respondent summarizes its objections to Brattle’s “Alternative Claim” as follows:
Brattle present{s] an Alternative Claim based on “the application of

Spain’s originally accepted 7% after-tax reasonable return”, but
“rather than simply verifying that the Claimant’s PV Plants attain

term sovereign debt” without reference to compound or simple interest).

522.

the target Reasonable Rate of Return, Brattle instead creates a
hypothetical FiT system as the basis of their analysis.”

When creating this hypothetical FiT, Brattle uses an imaginary
“marginal plant” that is “far from the reality of the Claimant’s
plants”. They did “not considered the real cost of these PV plants
of the Claimant”, “The Claimant’s Plants are fixed-tilt structure PV
plants and Brattle’s plant is a two-axis tracking installation, which
requires a far more costly CAPEX for build-out”.

Brattle then uses a 20% Effective Discounted Tax Rate when
“grossing-up” the 7% post tax return target to set their pre-tax
returns target, instead of using 7.47% that is the Effective
Discounted Tax Rate of the Plants that can be inferred from
Brattle’s own financial model. Brattle thereby significantly inflates
the pre-tax target return they then use in their Alternative
Claim analysis.”

Respondent considers that Brattle’s Alternative Claim entails “a convoluted methodology,
where a simple exercise would suffice’, and fails to calculate the real project return of

Claimants plants.”

(iv) The Claim for a Tax Gross-up

Respondent objects to the tax gross-up calculated by Claimant, allegedly to compensate it
for the taxes in Germany that Claimant would be required to pay as a result of the
award.”° Respondent argues that the tax gross-up is inadmissible, inter alia, on the
following basis: (i) Article 21 of the ECT prevents the award of a tax gross-up (since it is
a tax measure and, as such, it explicitly falls outside the scope of the ECT);”™* (ii) the so-
called “Monetary Gold” principle prevents the Tribunal to award the tax gross-up since
doing so would entail affecting the rights and obligations of Germany, which is not a party

to the dispute;” (iii) the acts giving rise to the tax gross-up are not attributable to

Respondent under international law;’° (iv) an obligation to pay taxes arising out of the
award would not arise in Germany in view of the participation exemption established by a
EU Directive;””’ and (v) the tax gross-up is not justified since it is “excessively speculative,

uncertain and contingent” .1°°

. Respondent adds that Claimant’s request of a tax gross up is also flawed because it ignores
that any dividends received under the But-For scenario “would have been generated by
profits at the project company level (Fotones) and that these profits would have been
taxable in Spain at the rate of 25% of corporation tax [...] thus offsetting the taxes

purportedly payable by the alternative compensatory award.”"

. Finally, Respondent submits that, if post-Award interest is awarded, the rate should not be
higher than the pre-Award interest, since no punitive post-Award interest is appropriate
(nor does Claimant request post-Award interest at a higher rate than that of

the pre-Award).’!°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis
a. Valuation of the Reduction in Value of Claimant’s Investment

. The Tribunal has previously indicated that it considers a DCF methodology to be
appropriate in this case. It now examines the particular methodology on which Claimant
relies to support its claim for EUR 52.7 million, taking into account the observations made
by Respondent and AMG, as well as the alternative DCF model prepared by AMG. It does
not attempt to address here every point made by the Parties and their respective experts,
but instead focuses on the issues that were most material to the divergence in the two

DCF valuations.

Before turning to analysis of the DCF methodology, the Tribunal notes that AMG’s ABV

model employs assumptions that are inconsistent with the Tribunal’s finding on

~

liability. AMG’s model is premised on the assumption that Claimant is entitled only to a
reasonable rate of return, as determined by Respondent. The Tribunal rejected that
assertion in addressing liability. In addition, Respondent and AMG placed emphasis on
several contentions about Claimant’s investments, e.g., that Claimant paid more than

71!

market prices for its investment that Claimant’s returns should be calculated on a project

level, not at the level of equity, and that Claimant, as a brownfield investor, should expect

lower returns than would be expected by a greenfield investor.’!”

While these points may
have been relevant to Respondent’s legal theory and/or to AMG’s ABV calculations, which
are premised on the calculation of project returns, the Tribunal does not consider them to
be material to the analysis of the DCF methodology that focuses instead on the net present

value of future cash flows.

The Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s contention that the June 2014 valuation date
used by Claimant and Brattle is arbitrary. As Claimant points out, June 2014 was the date
when Respondent issued a ministerial order containing the details of the remuneration
scheme that would be applied under the new regulatory regime. The Tribunal questioned
Mr. Caldwell about the alternatives of a July 2013 valuation date (coinciding with the
adoption of RDL 9/2013, which abrogated RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008) or a present-
day valuation date.7!? Mr. Caldwell’s explanations confirmed that June 2014 was a

reasonable valuation date.

Badajoz I began producing energy no later than August 2010 and Badajoz II began
producing energy in February 2011.7'4 The Tribunal recognizes that a long period of
historical performance of an investment can lend confidence to predictions about how it
would have performed in the future. In the present case, however, the Tribunal considers

that periods of operation of Badajoz I and Badajoz II provide a sufficient basis for the

to acquire PV plants and that Spain's financial support does not extend to acquisition premiums. Resp. PHB,

DCF analysis. In setting the production level to be used in the DCF model, Brattle took
into account, in addition to historical performance, contemporaneous forecasts by Claimant
made in the course of doing business.’!> Brattle set production at the same level in both

the Actual and the But-For scenarios.

529. The Parties’ respective experts agree that the Disputed Measures substantially reduced cash
flows to Claimant. Brattle asserts a reduction of EUR 105 million and AMG asserts a
reduction of EUR 60 million’'®. However, the results of their respective DCF analyses are
far more divergent than are their respective conclusions regarding cash flows. AMG
asserts that the Disputed Measures increased the value of Claimant’s investment by
EUR 4.5 million whereas Brattle concludes that the value of the investment has been

reduced by EUR 52.7 million.7!”

530. This difference of approximately EUR 57 million in the valuations by the Parties’
respective experts is largely a consequence of the way in which each expert derives the
discount rate that is applied to the future stream of cash flows. That discount rate is
constructed by amalgamating various elements, including systematic risk, regulatory risk,

inflation and an illiquidity discount.

531.

The disagreement between the experts that has the largest impact on their divergent
DCF valuations is the assessment of regulatory risk in the two scenarios. Brattle assigns a
significantly higher regulatory risk to the Actual scenario than it assigns to the But-For
scenario. AMG’s assertion, by contrast, is that regulatory risk was high under the Original
Regulatory Regime, due to the unsustainability of the SEE, which meant that a radical
change in the regulatory regime was likely. According to AMG, regulatory risk is lower

in the Actual scenario than in the But-For scenario.

532. The logic underlying AMG’s regulatory risk assessment is at odds with the conclusions of
this Tribunal on liability. The But-For scenario is premised on continued application of

the regulatory regime that was in place prior to the Disputed Measures. The Tribunal has

172

rejected the contention that Claimant should have expected radical changes in that
regime. The stability inherent in the But-For scenario (which assumes that the Original
Regulatory Regime had continued for 25 years) stands in contrast to the Actual Scenario,
which is based on the Specific Regime. Under the Specific Regime, tariffs are subject to
periodic adjustment and there is uncertainty about the methodology that will be used to
make those adjustments.”!* The Tribunal therefore finds Brattle’s assessment of regulatory
tisk to be more convincing than that of AMG. Brattle quantifies this regulatory risk with
reference to the ratings that ratings agencies have assigned to securitized debt instruments
linked to Spain’ tariff deficit.”!” Having considered Brattle’s methodology and taking into
account AMG’s observations on that methodology, the Tribunal is satisfied with Brattle’s

quantification of regulatory risk under the two scenarios.

533. The Parties’ respective experts also hold inverted views in respect of the illiquidity discount
to be applied in the two scenarios. In DCF methodologies, an illiquidity discount is applied
to investments that are less liquid than shares freely traded on a public exchange. The size
of the discount depends on the particular characteristics of the investment. For reasons that
align with its approach to regulatory risk, AMG considers that the Disputed Measures have
increased the liquidity of Claimant’s investment.’ It therefore applies a higher discount
rate in the But-For scenario than it applies in the Actual Scenario. Brattle instead concludes
that the Disputed Measures have reduced the liquidity of Claimant’s investment and
thus applies a higher illiquidity discount rate to the Actual scenario than it applies to the

But-For scenario.””!

534. The Tribunal is persuaded by Brattle’s contention that Claimant’s investment should be
regarded as more liquid under the But-For scenario than under the Actual scenario. This
conclusion, like the Tribunal’s conclusion on regulatory risk, aligns with the Tribunal’s
finding on liability. Under the Actual Scenario, according to Brattle, it would be more

difficult for Claimant to sell its interests in Fotones than would be the case under the But-

For Scenario, which is premised on continuity of the Original Regulatory Regime for
25 years. Brattle has supported its quantification of the illiquidity discount rates that it
applies with two separate kinds of analyses.”?? Taking into account the reports of both

experts, the Tribunal is satisfied by the illiquidity discount rates employed by Brattle.

535. When combined, regulatory risk and the illiquidity discount account for EUR 43.8 million
of the EUR 57.2 million difference in the DCF valuations of the two experts.” The
experts’ respective estimates of inflation rates over the relevant period account for a
difference of EUR 11.8 million in their respective DCF valuations.’ Brattle bases its
estimates of inflation on Spanish inflation swaps, noting that the rates of those swaps reflect
the assessment by market participants of future inflation.’”2> AMG considers that Brattle’s
estimates are too high, leading Brattle to overstate revenues in its But-For scenario
(because FITs under RD 1578/2008 were inflation-indexed).’?° AMG instead estimates
inflation based on an average of three inflation forecasts. Brattle criticizes AMG’s
methodology on two grounds. First, these studies are limited to a 5-year period and,
second, the studies on which AMG relies are from 2017 and 2020, so they do not reflect

the June 2014 valuation date.’

536. Taking into account the positions of the experts, and recognizing that an estimate of
inflation is necessary to a DCF analysis, the Tribunal is satisfied by the inflation estimate

used by Brattle.

537. The Tribunal has also taken into account other differences between the criteria used by the
two experts to construct their respective DCF analyses and the justifications advanced by
the experts. However, because these other differences account for much smaller

divergences in the DCF analyses, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to set out in

this Award the competing analyses relevant to each such point. The Tribunal has reviewed
competing contentions in respect of these other criteria and is satisfied with the DCF
analysis presented by Brattle. As one example, Brattle’s damages calculation is based on
an effective tax rate of 30%, whereas AMG uses an effective tax rate of 25%.78
Respondent claims that Brattle “know full well” that the effective tax rate was “30%-28%-
25%, before 2015, in 2015, and after 2015, respectively,” citing what it represents to be
the nominal tax rates applicable to the most common types of corporate
taxpayers.’*? Brattle recognizes that the tax rate fell after its valuation date but explains,
first, that it uses the tax rate applicable as of its valuation date and, second, that it applies
the same tax rate to both the Actual Scenario and the But-For Scenario. By contrast, AMG
applies the 2014 tax rate to the Actual Scenario and the 2016 tax rate to the But-For
Scenario. As Brattle points out, by using different tax rates for the two scenarios, AMG’s

methodology reduces the damages that result from its DCF analysis.”°

538. Having examined the positions of the experts and the Parties in relation to the effect of the
Disputed Measures on the fair market value of Claimant’s investment, the Tribunal
concludes that Brattle’s DCF analysis provides a sound basis for the Tribunal to determine
the reduction in the fair market value of Claimant’s investment. However, the amount of
damages to be awarded to Claimant must be adjusted to take into account (1) the Tribunal’s
conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction in respect of Claimant’s contention that the TVPEE
violates Article 10(1) of the ECT and (2) the Tribunal’s finding that Spain is not liable as

to the First Set of Disputed Measures.

539. Brattle has indicated the damages that it associates with particular measures in Appendix C
to the First Brattle Quantum Report).”*! One set of calculations assumes (as is the case)
that the Tribunal has not found the TVPEE to be illegal. On this basis, Brattle presents the
damages that it attributes to (i) the limit on production hours, (ii) the change in the inflation

index (which, taken together, correspond to the First Set of Disputed Measures) and (iii) the

”8 Second Brattle Quantum Report, {| 127.

July 2013 measures (corresponding to the Second Set of Disputed Measures). Brattle
calculates that the July 2013 measures reduced the fair market value of Claimant’s

investment by 40.98 million.

540. The Tribunal has taken note of the quantum presentation made by AMG at the Hearing, in
which AMG contended that Brattle does not divide the individual effects of the Measures
in its future damages calculation. In that presentation, AMG stated that the generation tax
(i.e., the TVPEE) and the limit on production hours accounted for 44% of the damages
claimed by SolES, and “only 56 percent” of the claimed damages result from RDL 9/2013
(which abolished the Special Regime and replaced it with the Specific Regime) and
RDL 2/2013 (which changed the inflation index). Respondent made a similar observation
in its post-hearing brief.”** The Tribunal notes that AMG’s presentation at the Hearing
was based on Figure | in Brattle’s First Quantum Report, which depicts in general terms
the “three principal steps” that Brattle undertook in its damages calculation. That figure
does not isolate the damages attributable to the July 2013 measures from earlier measures,
as was done in Appendix C of Brattle’s First Quantum Report. The Tribunal does not find
in AMG’s presentation at the Hearing a basis to question the calculations presented by

Brattle in Appendix C of its First Quantum Report.

S41.

Taking into account the evidence before it, including evidence not specifically addressed
above, the Tribunal finds that Respondent’s breach of its fair and equitable treatment

obligation reduced the fair market value of Claimant’s investment by EUR 40.98 million.

542. In view of this conclusion, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to analyze Brattle’s
“alternative claim.” This alternative valuation was developed in light of Respondent’s
assertion that PV investors were always entitled to a reasonable return. However, the
Tribunal’s conclusions as to liability were not premised on a finding that Article 10(1) of

the ECT entitles Claimant to a particular return.

an

the valuation of the reduction in value of Claimant’s investment.

Professor Sacerdoti joins in the Tribunal’s conclusion regarding the valuation to be
assigned to the reduction in value of Claimant’s investment, taking into account the
evidence available to the Tribunal. However, he regrets that the evidence before the
Tribunal required the Tribunal to choose between Claimant’s valuation, which was based
on a “But-for” scenario with a 25-year duration of the feed-in tariffs set in 2010 under the
Special Regime, and Respondent’s DCF valuation, which the Tribunal did not adopt for
the reasons stated above, pursuant to which the regulatory risk in the but-for scenario was
so high that Claimant’s investment would have increased in value due to the

Disputed Measures.

Professor Sacerdoti considers that the evidence shows that it would have been justified and
was inevitable that Spain would not have let the tariff deficit continue to grow for 25 years
and instead would have acted in some manner to address it. As the Tribunal has observed
at paragraph 440 above “a prudent PV investor as of March 2010 had reason to anticipate
some measures by Spain to address the tariff deficit, possibly giving rise to reduced
remuneration to existing investors” although “the evidence does not establish that a
substantial reduction in FITs applied to existing plants or elimination of the Special
Regime was an almost total certainty, as Respondent has asserted, or even that it was

probable.” He would have welcomed evidence on the basis of which the Tribunal could
have accepted Claimant’s general approach to liability and quantum without also accepting
Claimant’s premise that the Original Regulatory Regime would remain stable for
25 years. On the basis of such evidence the Tribunal might have adjusted the analysis of
the Claimant’s expert to base the calculation of damages (loss of value of the investment
due to the reduction of returns under the new regime) on the difference between this

adjusted But-for scenario (with a shorter time horizon) and the actual scenario, based on

the reduced returns provided under the Disputed Measures.

177

546. Professor Sacerdoti acknowledges, however, that the Tribunal was unable to perform such
complicated calculations on its own motion because neither Party pursued this approach,
not even as a fallback, subordinate or alternative argument, and, specifically, because the

Respondent has not supplied the necessary information.

b. The Proposed Gross-up for Taxes Owed to Germany

547. Claimant’s contention that the Disputed Measures will increase its tax burden accounts
for a sizable portion of the overall damages sought by Claimant (EUR 29.1 million of a
total claim (before pre-Award interest) of EUR 81.8 million).”> As proof of this sum,
Claimant relies on a 7 July 2017 memorandum from German law firm, Taylor Wessing
Partnerschaftgesellschaft mbB (the “Taylor Wessing memorandum’) which was an

exhibit to the Second Brattle Quantum Report, as well as the quantum reports by Brattle.”**

548. The Taylor Wessing memorandum is unsigned. At the Hearing, counsel for Claimant
sought to introduce a signed copy of the memorandum. Respondent objected on the basis
that there were no exceptional circumstances, as required by Procedural Order No. 1. The
President instructed Claimant to make a written request, on which Respondent would be
invited to comment.’*> After hearing from the Parties, the Tribunal rejected Claimant’s
request to submit the signed memorandum, on the basis that there were no exceptional

circumstances justifying the late submission.”*°

549. Claimant invokes the Commentaries of the ILC’s Draft Articles on the Responsibility of
States for Wrongful Acts to support its assertion that “causation and remoteness are not to
be understood as a bar” to the tax gross-up claim.”*7 However, the ILC’s commentary is
more nuanced than Claimant has suggested. The Commentaries indicate that causality in
fact is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for reparation and call attention to other

considerations, including foreseeability, proximity and the question whether State organs

deliberately caused a particular harm.’** Criteria such as these can only be applied on a
case by case basis. Although Claimant states that tribunals in other cases have

“accommodated the impact of taxation in order to make the claimant whole,” it has not

identified a prior award that grosses-up an investor for taxes on an award that are due to its

home State.”°°

550. There is reason to question the general proposition that a respondent State that is found
liable for an FET violation should be required to compensate a claimant for increased taxes
that claimant will owe its home State. Even assuming that such losses might be in some
circumstances compensable (which the Tribunal does not decide), the evidence in support
of that loss and of the responsibility of the respondent State for it should be well-

substantiated. It is Claimant’s burden to prove the claimed loss of EUR 29.1 million.

551. Taylor Wessing states that its analysis is based on “the applicable German income tax
law.””° The memorandum disclaims knowledge of the taxation of Fotones, which is a
Spanish company.”*! As to the taxation of interest payments made by Fotones to Claimant,
the memorandum states, “[w]e cannot assess whether the interest would have been
effectively taxed in Spain” and that “German tax treatment depends on the Spanish
taxation”.” Claimant did not provide to the Tribunal evidence regarding Spain’s tax
treatment of Claimant or of Claimant’s investment. Brattle does not hold itself out as
having expertise in tax law (German or Spanish). When asked at the Hearing whether
Brattle had calculated the EUR 29 million tax gross-up, Mr. Caldwell responded, “No, it’s
based off the Taylor Wessing conclusions. We are simply implementing the Taylor

Wessing opinion.”™

552. As one of its objections to the tax gross-up, Respondent asserts that Brattle’s calculation
of Claimant’s taxes ignores the fact that dividends received by Claimant would have been
generated by profits earned by Fotones, which would have been taxed by Spain at the rate

of 25%.™4

553. Without solid evidence about the way in which Spanish taxes would affect Claimant’s
overall tax burden under the two scenarios on which Claimant bases its claim for a tax
gross-up (that is, with or without the Disputed Measures), the Tribunal has an incomplete
picture of the tax consequences for Claimant of the Disputed Measures. The Tribunal
concludes that Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence to support an award of

damages based on the alleged increase in its tax burden.

554. Having found that Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence to support its claim for a
tax gross-up in the amount of EUR 29.1 million, the Tribunal has no need to address the

other objections to the tax gross-up raised by Respondent.

c. Pre-Award interest

555. As the Parties have recognized, the ECT does not expressly address interest due on awards
based on a breach of the FET obligation. The Tribunal is not obligated to apply to this
Award the provision of the ECT that addresses the interest to be applied to an award based
on a breach of Article 13 (expropriation). It takes into account that provision (invoked by

Claimant) as well as the widely divergent views of the Parties, noted above.

556. The Tribunal also takes into consideration the testimony of Mr. Caldwell. At the Hearing,
he confirmed, as stated in Brattle’s Quantum Reports, that counsel had instructed Brattle
that the Spanish sovereign borrowing rate could not be what the ECT meant when it
referred to a “commercial rate.” Brattle reflected that guidance in its use of the 5.94% rate
for pre-Award interest.’4° Respondent’s counsel asked Mr. Caldwell about Brattle’s use

of Respondent’s borrowing rate to calculate interest in other arbitral proceedings, as well

™4 Resp, PHB, { 201.

180

as an article by Brattle co-authored by Mr. Caldwell”™® that recommends the use of a risk-
free rate. Mr. Caldwell responded that “Jeft to my own devices, as it were, I will gravitate

towards the Respondent’s borrowing costs, as this article indicates.”™"

557. Claimant’s counsel then asked Mr. Caldwell about the relevant maturity to be used to set
the rate applicable to pre-Award interest, assuming “that your counsel’s view is wrong, and
that one should use the Respondent’s borrowing rate.” Mr. Caldwell stated that “the

obvious interest rate” is that of the ten-year Spanish bond.”4°

558. Taking into account the Parties’ positions as to the rate of interest and the compounding of
interest, as well as the evidence before it, the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to
apply the interest rate of 1.74%, which corresponds to the mean average of the yields on
Spanish ten-year Treasury Bills from the date of valuation (June 2014) to the date of
reference of the last available rate (November 2016), as determined by Spain’s National

Statistics Institute (INE).””°

559. The Tribunal also considers that this rate (compounded quarterly) should also apply to
post-Award interest. Respondent is under an obligation to comply with this Award. In the
circumstances of this case, the Tribunal sees no need to set the rate applicable to post-
Award interest higher than the rate that applies prior to the Award. Interest at a rate of
1.74%, compounded quarterly, sufficiently incentivizes Respondent to make prompt

payment to Claimant.

IX. COSTS

A. Claimant’s Cost Submission

560. Claimant requests that the Tribunal order the Respondent to bear the entirety of the
costs and expenses of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal,
ICSID’s costs, and Claimant’s legal and expert fees totaling EUR 2,918,769.12 plus
USD 525,000.00, broken down as follows:

Fees of Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe EUR 1,470,329.70
Disbursements of Orrick Herrington

& Sutcliffe EUR 45,377.43
Fees of Pérez-Llorca EUR 590,493.39
Disbursements of Pérez-Llorca EUR 85,816.97
Fees of The Brattle Group EUR 694,844.00
Disbursements of The Brattle Group EUR 11,082.63
Fees of Taylor Wessing Tax Expert EUR 20,825.00
Amounts paid to ICSID USD 525,000.007°°
Total (EUR) EUR 2,918,769.12
Total (USD) USD 525,000.00

561. Claimant argues that the above costs are reasonable, particularly in light of the duration
and scope of the proceedings. In Claimant’s view, the Tribunal has broad discretion with
respect to the allocation of costs and it should exercise such discretion to make an award

on costs in its favour.

562. Claimant submits that, as a consequence of Respondent’s breaches of the ECT, “Spain is
obliged as a matter of international law to restore the plaintiff to its ex-ante status” which
encompasses Respondent’s obligation to bear the entirety of the arbitration costs and

expenses.”°! In addition, Claimant considers that Respondent’s conduct throughout the

750 Claimant notes that this amount includes a USD 25,000.00 lodging fee that it paid to ICSID for the registration of

proceedings provides additional grounds for holding it responsible for the entirety of the

costs and expenses of this arbitration.

563. Claimant further requests that the Tribunal order Respondent to pay interest at the rate of
5.94% on these amounts until full payment of the Award to be compounded quarterly,

running from the date of the Award.

B. Respondent’s Cost Submission

564. Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimant to bear the entirety of the
costs and expenses of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal,
ICSID’s costs, and the fees of the legal representatives of Spain, their experts and advisors,

as well as any other cost or expense that has been incurred.

565. The costs incurred by Respondent in this proceeding total EUR 1,451,176.39, broken down

as follows:
Advance on Costs paid to ICSID EUR 437,619.11
Expert Reports EUR 423,500.00
Translations EUR 26,077.65

photocopying in Madrid and Paris) EUR 48,419.92

Courier EUR 2,344.75

Travelling Expenses EUR 29,324.96

Legal fees EUR 483.890.00
Total (EUR) EUR 1,451,176.39

566. Respondent further requests that the Tribunal order Claimant to pay a reasonable interest
rate on this amount from the date on which those costs are incurred and the date of their

actual payment.

C. The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs

567. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

568. This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including

attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

569. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount (in USD) to:

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Judge Joan Donoghue USD 162,752.36
Professor Giorgio Sacerdoti USD 101,621.06
Sir David Williams USD 66,262.67
Mrs. Anna Joubin-Bret USD 48,000.00
Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov USD 33,000.00
ICSID’s administrative fees USD 148,000.00
Direct expenses estimated)’ USD 154,376.06
Total USD 714,012.15

752 This amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying). The
ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account once all invoices are
received and the account is final.

184

570. The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.’°?

571. In the main, Claimant has prevailed in this case. The Tribunal rejected Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections, save for its objection in respect of the TVPEE. The Tribunal
found that the Second Set of Disputed Measures violated the ECT, but did not find that the
First Set of Disputed Measures violated the ECT. As a consequence of these conclusions
on liability, the Tribunal awarded Claimant EUR 40.98 million in respect of the loss in the
value of Claimant’s investment, rather than EUR 52.7 million, which was Claimant’s

claim. The Tribunal also rejected Claimant’s claim of EUR 29.1 million as a tax gross-up.

57:

N

In light of the Tribunal’s conclusions as to jurisdiction, liability and quantum, the damages
awarded by the Tribunal (prior to the addition of pre-award interest) are EUR 40.98

million, in comparison to EUR 95.8 million claimed by Claimant.

573. The Tribunal considers that each Party conducted itself professionally during the course of

these proceedings.

574. Having considered all of these factors, and in exercise of the discretion vested in it by
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal decides that each Party should bear
its own costs and expenses and that Respondent should bear 100% of the cost of the

proceedings.

575.

an

Accordingly, the Tribunal orders Respondent to pay to Claimant USD 357,006.075 for the

expended portion of Claimant’s advances to ICSID.”*+

753 The remaining balance will be reimbursed by ICSID to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced
to ICSID.

754 As noted at {| 570 supra, the costs of this proceeding were paid out of advances made by the Parties following the
Tribunal’s constitution. Accordingly, the Tribunal has excluded from this calculation the USD 25,000.00
non-refundable fee paid by Claimant to ICSID for the registration of this case.
