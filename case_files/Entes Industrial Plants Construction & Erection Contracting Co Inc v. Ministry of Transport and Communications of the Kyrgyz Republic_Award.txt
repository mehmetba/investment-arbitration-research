1. INTRODUCTION

1. This arbitration arose out of a Contract concluded on 30 August
1999 between ENTES Industrial Plants Construction & Erection
Contracting Co. Inc., acting as the Contractor, and Claimant in the
present proceedings, on the one hand and the Ministry of Transport
and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic, acting as the
Employer, and Respondent in these proceedings, on the other hand.

2. The Contract concerned the Second Road Rehabilitation Project
Bishkek - Osh Road Civil works. It required that the Contractor
rehabilitate two road sections of the Bishkek-Osh Road in the
Kyrgyz Republic. The total Contract Price was US$43’839’882 plus
20% VAT in the amount of US$8’767°976.40.!_ The project was
funded by a loan of the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of
Japan.

3. The contractual Time for Completion was 1065 days with 3
December 2002 as completion date. The works were seriously
delayed and completed only on 12 October 2005, 1043 days later
than provided in the Contract. During the performance of the
works, the Contractor made 5 extensions of time (EOT) requests
which were partially granted.

4. At the end of the Project, in the Statement at Completion, the
Contractor claimed for the cost of the prolongation in an amount of
US$22982'039.25.2, In his Determination of 18 May 2006, the
Engineer decided that all 1043 days were “excusable”; he found that
out of these only 150 days were “compensable” and granted
US$1’161’870.19.

5. In the Statement at Completion, the Contractor also claimed
additional compensation for a number of specific incidents which
the Engineer granted partially.

6. The Contractor expressed dissatisfaction with the Engineer’s
Determination and requested an Engineer’s Decision. This decision
was issued on 16 October 2006 and confirmed the Engineer’s
Determination.

7. The arbitration was commenced by a Notice of Arbitration dated 15
January 2009. The Notice of Arbitration was communicated to the
arbitrators on 31 July 2009. The Respondent sent Preliminary
Comments on 21 August 2009. After consultations with the Parties

about a draft Procedural Calendar and Outline Directions, including
also financial conditions sent on 14 December 2009, the
constitution of the Tribunal was completed and the directions
issued on 22 December 2009.

The time limits set out in the procedural calendar had to be
extended at several occasions, due to extensions requested by the
Claimant, change in Government and suspension of powers of
Counsel on the Respondent’s side. Following the submission of the
Statement of Claim on 15 March 2010 and the Statement of Defence
on 31 March 2011, accompanied by large volumes of documentary
evidence, expert reports and witness statements, the Tribunal held a
Procedural Consultation by telephone on 27 April 2011 and gave
further directions, concerning written submissions and an
evidentiary hearing.

After a further Procedural Consultation by telephone on 6
September 2011, an evidentiary hearing was held from 18 to 21
October 2011 in Bishkek.

The Parties submitted further expert reports and Post-Hearing Briefs
on 20 February 2012, followed by subsequent correspondence and
claims for arbitration costs submitted in February 2015.

The Tribunal deliberated in person at the end of the hearing in
Bishkek and by correspondence. It adopted this award
unanimously.

The Tribunal and in particular the Presiding Arbitrator regret that,
due to a number of unusual events during the course of the
proceedings, the extraordinary factual complexity especially of the
principal claim for Prolongation Costs and other circumstances
delaying its work, this Final Award is rendered later than the
Tribunal had hoped.

3. THE FACTS OF THE DISPUTE

3.1 The Project and the Contract

In the beginning of the nineteen-nineties (1990’s), the Government
of Kyrgyzstan decided to rehabilitate the Bishkek-Osh Road (the
“Project”). This road is some 620 km long and traverses the Tien
Chan Mountains. It connects Bishkek and Osh, the two largest
cities in the Kyrgyz Republic.

The funding of the Project was provided by a loan agreement
between the Government of Kyrgyzstan and the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund of Japan.

Proceeding by way of public tender, the Respondent awarded the
implementation of the Project to the Claimant. The contract for this
implementation was concluded on 30 August 1999 (the “Contract”),
with the Employer acting through its Project Implementation Unit
(PIU).

The Contract, produced as Exhibit C-1, consists of a number of
documents, listed in the Form of Agreement, and of which the most
important documents for the purposes of the Arbitration are:

(ij) The Letter of Acceptance and Minutes of Contract
Negotiations;

(ii) The bid by the Contractor;

(iii) Conditions of Particular Application (CPA);

(iv) General Conditions of Contract (GCC);

(v) Special Specifications;

(vi) General Specifications;

(vii) Special Requirements; and

(viii) The Priced Bill of Quantities.

The Special Specifications described the location of the Works as
follows:

“The Works are located roughly south-west of Bishkek in a
mountainous area of the Tien Shan range with elevations ranging
from about 1000 m to 2200 m. The terrain is mountainous and
much of the road alignment is tortuous having numerous tight
curves and steep gradients.”

The rehabilitation and improvement work of the road included the
carriageway, shoulders, slope stability, drainage system, structures

> Special Specifications, clause 1.2.1 (Exhibit C-1, p. 664).

35.

* Ibid.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 13 of 177

and road furniture as well as the construction of new alignments in
some sections.4 This scope of work required the repair of many of
the existing bridges and widening them to accommodate the full
width of the road. The road rehabilitation included provision and
installation of new kilometre posts and traffic signs as well as the
installation of road safety features such as road markings, steel
guard rails and concrete parapets.5 The Works also included the
rehabilitation of two short tunnels.

The Works were divided into Section A (km 248-325) and Section B
(km 361-412).®

The Contract provides that the “law is that in force in the Kyrgyz
Republic”? and the settlement of disputes by UNCITRAL arbitration
in Bishkek.®

The GCC are a reproduction of the FIDIC Civil Engineering
Conditions. Japan Overseas Consultants Co. Ltd was appointed as
the Engineer,? acting in the role which these conditions confer on
the Engineer. The duties and authority of the Engineer and the
Engineer’s Representative are defined in particular in Clause 2.1
CPA.

The Parties concluded four Addenda, two on 15 and 23 May 2003
respectively and two on 15 December 2003, dealing with a variety of
subjects, including extensions of time and additional payments.

3.2 Difficulties during the Performance of the Works

During the performance of the Works a number of difficulties arose
which caused delay and additional costs. The Contractor claimed
for extensions of time to compensate these delays and for additional
costs. Some of these claims were recognised and accepted by the
Engineer and the Employer; others were not and form part of the
issues in this arbitration.

The difficulties on which the Contractor relied in his claims
concerned a wide variety of causes, ranging from design changes,
additional works and late instructions, shortages of materials, in
particular petroleum products, inclement weather in particular
harsh winters and political unrest, in particular the “Tulip
Revolution” in March - April 2005.

36. The principal claim in this respect is that for the costs of
prolongation, discussed in detail below in chapter 8. In addition,
there are a number of specific events on which the Claimant relies
in this arbitration. They include the following:

37. Damage caused in the context of political unrest, specifically a claim
for US$ 39’490 for damage to the Contractor's equipment and plant,
specifically a grader. Other claims concerned road and emergency
taxes, VAT, disputes with sub-contractors and delayed payments.
The claims relating to these issues will be considered separately
under the heading of the respective claim.

3.3 The Time for Completion, Delay and Time Extensions

38. The Engineer issued the Notice to Proceed on 25 December 19991°
and work started on 3 January 2000. The work programme was
submitted to the Employer and the Engineer on 19 January 2000,
and was approved by the Engineer on 22 January 2000.1!

39. The contractual Time for Completion was 1’065 days!?2 with the
completion date being 3 December 2002.

40. The Project suffered delay and the Works were completed only on 12
October 2005, i.e. an overall delay of 17043 days. The Contractor
applied for altogether five extensions of the time for completion (EOT
claims) and was granted some such extensions consisting overall of
637 days, bringing the completion date to 28 September 2005. They
may be summarised as follows:

41. EOT 1 was requested on 25 July 2007 and concerned delays during
the period between 3 January 2000 and 30 June 2002 for which the
Contractor invoked Clause 44.1 GCC.!3 On 17 September 2002, the
Engineer granted the Contractor an extension of 83 days.!4+

42. EOT 2 was requested in early 2003!5 and concerned the period
between 1 July 2002 and 3 December 2002. On 28 April 2003, the
Contractor terminated the Contract. This was followed by
negotiations in May 2003 which led to Addendum N° 1, concluded
on 15 May 2003 which, inter alia, granted an extension of the time

'S The Claimant states in C-SoC that the EOT was made on 8 April 2008, referring to Exhibit C-8; however, the
correspondence produced as part of this exhibit seem to indicate that the EOT was submitted at an earlier date,
possibly on 12 February 2003..

   

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 15 of 177

for completion by 152 days, bringing the revised completion date to
15 August 2004.16

43. EOT 3 was requested on 31 October 2003.!7 It concerned the period
between 1 April 2003 and 15 October 2003. The request was dealt
with in Addendum N° 4, which granted the Contractor an extension
of 180 days!8 and brought the contractual completion dated to 20
November 2004.

44. EOT 4 was requested on 8 September 2004!9 and concerned the
period between 15 October 2003 and 12 August 2004. On 27
December 2004, the Engineer granted 94 days, bringing the
contractual completion date to 23 May 2005.70

45. EOT 5 was requested on 23 June 2005.2! It concerned the period

question whether the submission was timely remained controversial.

THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

The arbitration proceedings were initiated by the Claimant’s Notice
of Arbitration, sent to the Respondent on 15 January 2009. The
Arbitral Tribunal was formed as described above in Section 2.3 of
this Award.

During the course of the Tribunal’s constitution, the Arbitrators
received the Notice of Arbitration on 31 July 2009. They then
invited the Respondent to comment. The Respondent did so in the
form of Preliminary Comments to the Claimant’s Notice of
Arbitration submitted on 21 August 2009.

In consultation with the Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal established on
22 December 2009 the Procedural Calendar and _ Directions,
providing for the following steps:

A Statement of Claim, scheduled for 15 February 2010 and a
Statement of Defence, scheduled for 15 June 2010; each of these
submissions had to be accompanied by documentary evidence,
nomination of any witnesses together with a summary of the
testimony on alleged facts as well as any expert reports. The
Procedural Calendar provided for a procedural consultation after
this first exchange of written submissions, at which the need for
further written submissions and the arrangements for the
evidentiary hearing would be discussed. The Tribunal reserved the
possibility of appointing a secretary and a technical expert, subject
to prior consultation about the person chosen and the financial
conditions. In the same document, the financial conditions of the
Tribunal’s activity were set out (see below Section 8 the Costs of the
Arbitration).

By letters dated 22 January 2010 and 2 February 2010, the
Claimant requested a one-month extension of the time for
submitting its Detailed Statement of Claim. The Tribunal granted
the request and updated the Procedural Calendar and Directions on
10 February 2010. In this Update 1, the Tribunal also extended the
time for the Respondent's Statement of Defence to 16 August 2010.

On 15 March 2010, the Claimant filed its Statement of Claim,
accompanied by two folders of exhibits, an Expert Reports by Mr
William Kennedy and Mr Bryn Wiseman of Hill International in 8
volumes including a large number of documents and Witness
Statements of Mr Murat Ozkoseoglu, Mr Ahmet Alp and Mr Nuri
Asman together with further exhibits.

On 14 April 2010 the Respondent’s counsel wrote to the Tribunal
and, referring to events in Kyrgyzstan, explained “Current events are

terrible, as practically all population suffers”. After providing
further details about the events in the country, she added that the
Interim Government had announced a six months period during
which “a new Constitution would be passed, parliamentary elections
would be held and a new Government would be designated.
Accordingly, the new Minister of Transport will be designated”.
Since the Minister who had issued the power of attorney to her law
firm “was dismissed”, Counsel explained that these powers are
“invalid at present time" and her firm was not authorised to
represent the Respondent. She requested “to postpone the
proceedings for a period not less than 6 months, at least until the
formation of new Government and obtaining of authorities (power of
attorney) on representation of interests of the Respondent”.

The Tribunal expressed its sympathy with the Kyrgyz people and
invited further information about the Respondent’s representation.

Respondent’s counsel explained on 6 May 2010 that it had
addressed itself to the acting Minister of Transport and
Communications with the "request to consider the issue of
confirmation of our authorities to continue representation of
interests of the Respondent in the arbitration".

The Respondent’s counsel provided further explanations by letters
dated 18 and 27 May 2010, stating that their authorization had not
yet been confirmed.

In a number of subsequent letters the Respondent’s counsel
informed the Arbitral Tribunal that, despite its interventions, no
powers to act on behalf of the Ministry had been conferred to it.

On 1 July 2010, the Partner Law Firm informed the Tribunal that it
had received an “interim response from the Ministry of Transport”.
Attached to the Letter of the Partner Law Firm was a letter that had
been addressed on 28 June 2010 to the Partner Law Firm by the
Secretary of State of the Ministry of Transport and Communications
of the Kyrgyz Republic. Based on this letter, the Partner Law Firm
informed the Tribunal that its “authorization is still in process of the
coordination”. It announced that the question of its authorization
will be “decided after the formation of the Government KR, i.e. not
earlier than October 2010”.

On 22 October 2010, the Tribunal wrote to the Partner Law Firm,
summarised the correspondence concerning the Respondent’s
representation and continued:

“October has come, the elections have taken place and no further
information from the Respondent or the Partner Law Firm has
been received by the Arbitral Tribunal.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 19 of 177

From earlier communications the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that
the Claimant wishes to proceed with the arbitration.

The Arbitral Tribunal now invites the Partner Law Firm to inform
it by Monday 1st November 2010

@) whether its power of attorney to act for the Kyrgyz Republic
in the present arbitration has been restored; or

(ii) if this has not been the case, whether, apart from or in
place of the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Transport
and Communications, there is any other authority acting on
behalf of the Kyrgyz Republic in the present arbitration.

Upon receipt of this response or if no response is received by the
1st November 2010 the Claimant is invited to inform the Tribunal
how it wishes to proceed further in the arbitration.”

On 28 October 2010 the Partner Law Firm informed the Arbitral
Tribunal that its powers had not been restored. It explained that
the election results had not been declared yet and no new
government had been formed. It added: the Ministry “can not
independently solve the issue on hiring of ‘Partner’ Law Firm for
representation of its interest in arbitration ...”.

The Tribunal invited the Claimant to state how it wished to proceed.
After further correspondence, the Claimant communicated to the
Tribunal the Ministry’s precise address for communication. On 20
December 2010 the Claimant informed the Tribunal that Mr Erkin
Isakov who had been Head of the Project Implementation Unit
remained Minister of Transportation and Communication.

The Tribunal then addressed itself on 23 December 2010 to the
Parties, including Mr Erkin Isakov, Minister of Transport and
Communication of the Kyrgyz Republic, summarising the procedure
in the arbitration and granted the Respondent a last extension until
31 January 2011 for filing the Statement of Defence as set out in
the Procedural Calendar and Directions. The Tribunal also
consulted the Parties about dates for a procedural consultation after
the filing of the Statement of Defence.

In response the Partner Law Firm informed the Tribunal on 30
December 2010 that its powers to represent the Ministry in this
arbitration had been restored. In the same letter, the Respondent’s
counsel requested an extension of time for the submission of the
Statement of Defence until 28 April 2011.

The Claimant objected to the requested extension. After further
correspondence, the Arbitral Tribunal extended the time limit for the

submission of the Respondent’s Statement of Defence until 31
March 2011.

On 31 March 2011, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence,
together with one folder of documentary evidence. It named Mr
Zhumaliev Nurbek Omurbekovich as witness, without further
indication about the subject matter of its testimony.

The Tribunal then convened a Procedural Consultation by telephone
on 27 April 2011 in order “to provide the Parties and the Tribunal
with an opportunity, after the first exchange of written pleadings, to
consider the scope of the dispute and to focus further on
proceedings”. In addition to the members of the Tribunal, the
following persons participated in this consultation: On the
Claimant’s side as Counsel: Professor Ziya Akinci, Dr Cemille Demir
Gokyayla, Ms Fatma Huseyin and Mr Sercan Kulaksizogullari and
from Entes: Mr Ahmet Alp, Mr Murat Ozkoseoglu and Mr Nuri
Asman; on the Respondent’s side as Counsel: Ms Mirgul
Smanalieva, Ms Begaim Kaibyldaeva and Mr Vitaliy Khabarov.

In preparation of the consultation, the Arbitral Tribunal had
prepared a note with Observations and Questions for Consideration.
In that note, the Tribunal had identified issues and questions which
arose from a preliminary examination of the case, as it presented
itself after the first exchange of written submissions.

At the Procedural Consultation it was agreed that the Claimant
would be authorised to make Submissions on Legal Grounds and
the Respondent a Complementary Submission. It was also agreed
that the Claimant would present the documents attached to the
expert report of Hill International in a form that can be referenced
and consulted. The Respondent was invited to present a witness
statement by Mr Omurbekovoch and was given the opportunity of a
response to the expert report presented by the Claimant.

The Tribunal also discussed with the Parties their availability for an
evidentiary hearing. Since the Respondent was not available before
September 2011 and the Claimant not before October 2011, the
hearing was fixed for the time from 18 to 21 October 2011.
Differences arose with respect to the venue of the hearing, in
particular relating to concerns about the attendance of the
Claimant’s witnesses. The decision on the venue was reserved.

The Tribunal submitted to the Parties Summary Minutes of the
Procedural Consultation in draft form on 4 May 2011. After having
received and considered the Parties’ comments on this draft, the
Tribunal sent the final version signed by the Presiding Arbitrator
with its letter of 6 July 2011.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 21 of 177

As agreed at the Procedural Consultation, the Respondent sent on 3
May 2011 the Kyrgyz Civil Code in Russian and in an “unofficial”
English translation to the Claimant and the members of the
Tribunal. The Claimant contested the accuracy of this English
translation on 17 May 2011, stating that the “English versions of
the Civil Code (both part 1 and part 2) are not effective and do not
contain all the amendments”; attached to this letter were a number
of articles from the Civil Code in Russian and the contested version
of the Respondent’s translation. The Claimant requested that the
Parties be informed of the Articles of the Code “which may be
examined/referred, so that the applicable version and correct
translation is presented”. The Respondent replied on 24 May 2011,
explaining that it had highlighted in the English translation those
passages of the Civil Code on which it had relied in its Statement of
Defence. The passages where the Claimant found the translation
incorrect concerned other provisions of the Code.

On 31 May 2011, the Claimant submitted its Submission on Legal
Grounds as well as the documents attached to the Expert Report of
Hill International. The latter consisted of four files (volumes 3 to 6)
replacing the corresponding files of the previous submission.

On 15 June 2011, the Respondent requested an extension of time
until 25 August 2011 to submit its response to the Claimant’s
Expert Report. The Claimant objected to this request.

On 29 June 2011, the Respondent submitted the written statement
of Mr. Nurbek Omurbekovich Zhumaliev.

On 30 June 2011, the Respondent requested the Arbitral Tribunal
to grant an extension until 30 July 2011 to produce its
Complementary Submission.

On 1 July 2011, the Claimant made an unsolicited submission,
including a revised expert report by Mr Wiseman and a letter by
him, dated 28 June 2011 addressing certain aspects of his report of
10 March 2010 that had been filed with the Statement of Claim.
The submission also included a “Supplementary Evidence Pack
Cover”.

The Arbitral Tribunal granted the Respondent’s requests for time
extension on 11 July 2011 and fixed the time for the Respondent’s
Complementary Submission at 30 July 2011 and for the Reply
Expert Opinion at 25 August 2011.

In its letter of 11 July 2011, the Tribunal proposed to appoint Mr
Dimitri Iafaev as a Secretary to the Tribunal. It provided
information about the qualification of Mr Iafaev and a biographical
note. The Tribunal stated that Mr Iafaev’s work would be billed at

the rate of CHF 300 per hour. The Parties replied by letters of 20
and 29 July 2011, informing the Tribunal that they had no objection
to this appointment. On 29 July 2011, the Tribunal informed the
Parties that it had appointed Mr lafaev as Secretary to the Tribunal.

On 29 July 2011, the Respondent filed its Complementary
Submission, described as “Rejoinder of the Respondent”, together
with further exhibits.

On 24 August 2011, the Respondent submitted the Reply Expert
Opinion of Mr John Marshall (delay expert) and the Reply Expert
Opinion of Mr George Taft (quantum expert).

The Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties held a further Procedural
Consultation by telephone on 6 September 2011 in order to
determine steps that remained to be taken in preparation of the
hearing and to consider the organisation of the hearing. In addition
to the full Tribunal, the following persons attended the consultation:
On the Claimant’s side Professor Ziya Akinci, Dr Cemile Demir
Godkyayla, Ms Fatma Husseyin and Mr Mete Sonbahar, as counsel;
on the Respondent’s side, Mr Nurbek Zumaliev, Ms Mirgul
Smanalieva, Ms Begaim Kaibyldaeva and Mr Vitaliy Khabarov as
counsel.

At the Procedural Consultation, it was agreed that the Parties may
submit further expert reports, but that these had to be limited to
points that arose from prior opposing reports. The Parties also were
invited:

..to make arrangements for consultations between their experts with the

objective of clarifying the experts’ respective positions and the
assumptions made in their reports, for providing information which
the opponent expert identified as missing, for eliminating
contradictions and, to the extent possible, for reducing differences in
opinion.”

Further points addressed at the Procedural Consultation concerned
the organisation of the hearing. The Parties explained that they
wished to hear all witnesses which their opponent had named. The
Tribunal explained that it intended to take the lead in questioning
the witnesses and experts but that the Parties also would be given
an opportunity to question the witnesses and experts.

Draft Summary Minutes of the Procedural Consultation were sent to
the Parties on 10 September 2011 for comments. The corrected
final version was sent on 26 September 2011.

On 27 September 2011, the Claimant submitted written rebuttal
report by Mr William Kennedy and Mr Bryn G. Wiseman.

Considering the concerns raised by the Claimant about its witnesses
travelling to Bishkek, the Tribunal invited the Parties on 1 October
2011 to examine jointly possible arrangements which could be taken
to ensure the presence of the Claimant’s witnesses at the hearing.
The Parties informed the Tribunal on 5 and 6 October 2011 that
they could not agree on any such arrangement. Thereupon the
Tribunal informed the Parties on 10 October 2011, that the hearing
would take place in Bishkek and that the Claimant’s witnesses
would be heard by video-conferencing.

In the letter of 10 October 2011, the Tribunal communicated the
proposed agenda for the hearing.

The Tribunal also informed the Parties that, as anticipated in the
Procedural Calendar and Directions, it wished to have at the hearing
the assistance of a technical expert. It informed the Parties that it
had retained Mr Alexander Hamann in this function and had invited
him to examine the file and attend the hearing. For any further
work beyond his presence at the hearing, it would consult the
Parties.

On 11 October 2011, the Respondent submitted the comments
made by Mr John J. Marshall and Mr George Taft on points arising
from the rebuttal report of the Claimant’s experts.

The Hearing was held from 18 to 21 October 2011 at the hotel Hyatt
Regency in Bishkek. It was attended by the full Tribunal, together
with its Secretary and Mr Alexander Hamann, the Tribunal’s expert.
On the Claimant’s side, attended Professor Ziya Akinci, Dr Cemille
Demir Gokyayla, Mr Metehan Caglar Sonbahar, as counsel, Mr Bryn
Wiseman, Mr Ekrem Kaya, Mr William Kennedy, Mr Nurbek Sabirov
and Mr Magomed Saaduev, as experts and Mr Nurjan Jumagulera,
as interpreter; on the Respondent’s side attended Mr Kulanychbek
Mamaev, as Party Representative, Ms Mirgul Smanalieva, Ms Nina
Vilkova, Mr Vitaliy Khabarov and Ms Natalia Pak, as counsel, Mr
Georges Taft and Mr John Marshall as experts, Mr Nurbek
Jumaliev, as witness, Ms Aigerim Bershiaeva, Ms Begaim
Kaibyldaeva and Ms Guliaim Kolbaeva, as interpreters.

The Claimant’s witnesses, Mr Ahmet Alp, Mr Nuri Asman and Mr
Murat Ozkoseoglu, were connected from Istanbul by video-link.

The hearing was recorded by Ms Gail Mallaghan of Briault
Reporting. The verbatim transcript of this recording was sent to the
Tribunal and the Parties on 7 November 2011.

The Parties were given the opportunity to address the Tribunal in
Opening Statements. Thereafter, the Tribunal examined with the

21

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 24 of 177

Parties their respective positions with respect to the issues which
have to be decided and the evidence to be considered.

99. The Claimant clarified that its claim had to be considered in the
context of the Engineer’s Decision pursuant to Clause 67.1, issued
on 16 October 200629 and the Notice of Intent to Commence
Arbitration, dated 22 December 2006. The Engineer’s Decision had
been based on the Engineer’s Determination on the Statement at
Completion — Part B, dated 18 May 2006, including in particular
Table 2 setting out the Engineer’s Determination concerning the
delay related claims.

100. On 20 and 21 October 2011, while the Tribunal examined other
issues with the Parties, the Parties’ experts and the Tribunal’s
expert, at the invitation of the Tribunal and with the agreement of
the Parties, withdrew from the Hearing and examined jointly the
issues raised by the time-related claim, in particular the questions
of:

(i) how the decision of the Engineer in Table 2 had to be understood
with respect to each of the claims for which he granted an extension
of time but no compensation or less compensation than claimed, in
particular what was the cause for which the Engineer awarded an
extension of time;

(ii) which of the decisions for which the Engineer granted an extension
of time also should lead to compensation for the Contractor’s costs
caused by the delay; and

(iii) what compensation should be awarded for these compensable
delays.

101. At the end of this joint expert examination, the Tribunal’s Expert
reported to the Tribunal the conclusions reached by the experts and
the points on which they disagreed. This report was summarised in
a table (based on Table 2 attached to the Engineer’s Determination),
prepared by the Tribunal’s expert and distributed to the Parties.
The Parties and their experts were given the opportunity to comment
on these explanations and to provide additional explanations and
testimony.

102. During the course of the Hearings the Parties produced new
documents, numbered HC 1 to HR 6. The table prepared by the
Tribunal’s expert was numbered HT 7.

103. With respect to further proceedings after the hearing, the Parties

were given the opportunity to present by 30 November 2011
Additional Expert Reports on the identification of the delays (as

compensable or not) and on quantum.®° To this effect, the Parties’
experts were invited, to the extent the position of their opponent
may require clarification, to contact each other prior to the
submission of their reports and to cooperate so that each expert
could address the relevant issues with a full understanding of the
case. In this respect the Parties’ quantum experts had already
established contact immediately after the Hearing, agreeing on a
meeting at which the Claimant’s expert would provide access to the
data and documentation on which he relied in preparing his
quantification. The Tribunal clarified that these contacts did not
preclude the Respondent and its expert from concluding that the
evidence produced is insufficient to support the claim made by the
Claimant.

It was also agreed that, if their reports require the submission of
new documents, these documents would be disclosed beforehand to
the other expert and then submitted in the arbitration jointly by the
experts.

As the final step in the arbitration it was agreed at the hearing that,
following the submission of the expert reports, Final Written
Statements, closing the submissions of the Parties, would be
submitted by 31 January 2012.

The Tribunal announced that, following these submissions, it would
complete its deliberations. During these deliberations it may receive
the assistance of its expert.3!_ However, the Tribunal stated that it
did not intend to request a written report from its expert and
intended to decide the case on the basis of the argument and
evidence provided by the Parties. If the Tribunal, contrary to that
expectation, would conclude that a written report from its expert
were necessary, it would make such a report available to the Parties
for comment.

During the course of the hearing, the Respondent drew the attention
of the Tribunal to Article 29 of the Kyrgyz Arbitration Act. The
Tribunal invited the Respondent to inform the Tribunal and the
Claimant whether the award which the Tribunal would issue may be
delivered to the Parties by courier or equivalent means or whether it
has to be announced orally at a hearing. If oral announcement is
required, the Tribunal requested to be informed whether this
announcement can be made by video-conference.

At the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal enquired with the Parties

whether there were any points of complaint which the Tribunal
could address. The Parties stated that this was not the case and

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 26 of 177

expressed their satisfaction with the manner in which the Hearing
had been conducted.

A draft of the Summary Minutes of the Hearing was sent to the
Parties on 27 October 2011. Following proposed modifications from
the Parties, the final version of the Summary Minutes was sent to
the Parties on 23 December 2011.

At the request of the Respondent the Tribunal extended until 19
December 2011 the time for the submission of Additional Expert
Reports on the identification of the delays (as compensable or not)
and on quantum.

The Additional Expert Reports on delay and on quantum were
indeed submitted by each of the Parties on 19 December 2011
together with a Joint Expert Report by the Respondent’s and the
Claimant’s quantum experts.32

On 21 December 2011, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal stating
(a) that it had noted reference to new documents in the submissions
of the Respondent’s delay and quantum experts, (b) that Mr
Marshall, the Respondent’s delay expert, had submitted a totally
new analysis and (c) that Mr Taft, the Respondent’s quantum expert,
had submitted a separate report in addition to the joint report. The
Claimant requested the Tribunal:

to remove the documents submitted by the Respondent’s Delay and
Quantum Experts from the record;

to remove from the record and disregard the new analysis of Mr
Marshall;

to disregard Mr Taft’s Quantum Report submitted on 19 December
2011; and

to confirm that the Parties are not allowed to submit any further
documents with the final submission.

The Tribunal invited both Parties on 23 December 2011 to identify
by 28 December 2011 which new documents were produced with
the expert reports. It invited the Respondent to specify by that date
for which of their conclusions Mr Marshall and Mr Taft relied on
such new documents.

Both Parties replied on 28 December 2011. The Claimant submitted
a list of the new documents presented by the Respondent’s expert,
Mr Marshall, and the documents submitted by Mr Wiseman in
response to them. The Respondent replied that the conclusions of

* Wiseman IV by the Claimant; Marshall III and Taft III by the Respondent; Mr Kennedy’s new report took the
form of his entries in the Joint Expert Report.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 27 of 177

its experts, Mr Marshall and Mr Taft, did not directly rely on the
“new documents”.

In its letter of 23 December 2011, the Tribunal reminded the Parties
of its request for information concerning the requirement of Article
29 of the Kyrgyz Arbitration Act concerning oral announcement of
the award. On 28 December 2011, the Respondent stated that, in
the interest of saving costs, it had no objection against the
announcement of the award via video conference with the
subsequent delivery of the award via courier. The Claimant wrote
on 2 January 2012 that the announcement of the award by video
conference with the subsequent delivery of the award by courier was
acceptable under Kyrgyz law.

By email of 18 January 2012 the Claimant communicated to the
Tribunal a written declaration from its quantum expert Mr Kennedy,
stating that he had noted errors in his part of the Joint Report of 19
December 2011. He joined a “Final Report” in which these
corrections were marked. The Respondent objected to this
submission on 21 January 2012 considering it as “inadmissible”.
The Claimant replied on 23 January 2012 indicating that Mr
Kennedy’s “Final Report” was only a “correction of Mr Kennedy’s
part in the Joint Report dated 19 December 2011”.

In its letter of 21 January 2012 the Claimant reiterated the
conclusions in its letter of 21 December 2011 and requested an
extension of the time for the Post-Hearing Submissions.

On 25 January 2012, the Tribunal decided on the pending
applications as follows:

1. The new documents produced together with the Respondent’s
expert reports, as well as Appendix 2 of Mr Marshall’s report of 29
November 2011 and Mr Taft’s Quantum Report submitted on 19
December 2011 are admitted in the proceedings. The Tribunal
reserves its decision concerning their relevance for the outcome of
the dispute.

2. No further documents may be produced without the Arbitral
Tribunal’s express prior written authorisation.

3. The time for the submission of the Post-Hearing Briefs is extended
to 20 February 2012.

The Parties filed simultaneous Post-Hearing Briefs on 20 February
2012.

These submissions by the Tribunal closed the proceedings.

Without prior authorisation or request, the Respondent wrote on 20
March 2012, presenting “general comments to the Final Submission

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 28 of 177

of the Claimant”. It argued that the Claimant had disregarded the
directions of the Tribunal and had presented a new argument. The
Respondent then went on to discuss parts of the Claimant’s Post-
Hearing Submission, with the objective of refuting the position
presented in this submission.

Attached to the Respondent’s letter was a document dated
20/01/2012 and entitled “Addendum 1 - Adjustments to G Taft
report dated 19/12/2011”; part of this Addendum is a “Table of
Adjustments”. The Respondent explained that this Addendum had
been sent to its Counsel on 20 January 2012 but did not state
whether it had been communicated to the Claimant and its experts
prior to 20 March 2012.

The Respondent’s letter of 20 March 2012 concluded by stating:

“We believe that Arbitrators should render the award on the basis
of those arguments and materials which were presented by the
parties at the hearing and in addition to that on the basis of
expert conclusions and opinions admitted by the Arbitral Tribunal.
At this stage the parties have not been granted the right to offer
new considerations in respect of expert opinions of the other party
and to specify the position set forth at the hearing (including
specification of calculations, etc.). The whole matter is confined to
the hearing and summarised position of the parties in their
submissions.”

The Claimant protested on 29 March 2012 against this submission
and requested that it be disregarded. Nevertheless, the Claimant
discussed some of the points that the Respondent had raised on 20
March 2010.

No further communications on the substance of the dispute were
made by any of the Parties.

The Tribunal had made it clear at the October 2011 hearing and
confirmed in the Summary Minutes that the Final Written
Statements were “closing the submissions of the Parties”. The
Tribunal also had organised a procedure by which the Parties’
experts met, prepared a joint report on 19 December 2011. By its
decision of 25 January 2012, the Tribunal allowed subsequent
corrections and additional documents. The Parties had sufficient
time to take these reports and documents into consideration when
preparing their Final Written Statements, filed on 20 February 2012.
As stated clearly at the hearing, this final submission was not

limited to legal argument; it extended to the facts and to the
presentations of the experts.33

In these circumstances the submissions, both of the Respondent on
20 March and of the Claimant on 29 March 2012, were made
without authorisation after the proceedings had been closed. As
such they are inadmissible. However, the Tribunal has considered
them in order to determine whether any of the statements made in
them would have changed its conclusion if they had been admitted.
It assured itself that such consideration did not impair the Parties’
right to be heard.

The submissions on the costs of the arbitration and the Parties’
quantification of their claims in this respect were submitted on 3
and 6 February 2015. Each Party was given an opportunity to
comment on its opponent’s cost claim and did so on 20 February
2015.

The Tribunal has examined the Parties’ argument and evidence. It
has deliberated at various stages of the proceedings in person and
by correspondence and thus reached the unanimous decisions in
the present award. It did not seek any further advice from its expert

At the end of the proceedings the Tribunal rendered account of the
costs of the proceedings by a Procedural Order on Costs, delivered
on 26 September 2015.

The Tribunal invited the Parties to consider the arrangements
required for announcing this award by video-conference. The
Claimant’s counsel proposed to make the necessary arrangements.
In the absence of any objections from the Respondent, the Tribunal
accepted this proposal and convened the meeting by video-
conference for 29 September 2015. All participants confirmed that
they would make arrangements ensuring their participation.

completely disagrees with the claims raised against it by the
Claimant in the Statement of Claim. The Respondent holds that
the Claimant's claims set forth in the Statement of Claim are
unfounded and should be dismissed on the grounds listed below
in this Statement of Defence.”34

6. ISSUES OF JURISDICTION

6.1 The Arbitration Agreement

139. The agreement to arbitrate is contained in Clause 67.3 GCC which
reads as follows:

“Any dispute in respect of which:

(a) _ the decision, if any, of the Engineer has not become
final and binding pursuant to Sub-clause 67.1, and

(b) amicable settlement has not been reached within the
period stated in Sub-clause 67.2,

shall be finally settled, unless otherwise specified in the Contract,
under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International
Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed
under such Rules. The said arbitrator/s shall have full power to
open up, review and revise any decision, opinion, instruction,
determination, certification or valuation of the Engineer related to
the dispute.

Neither party shall be limited in the proceedings before such
arbitrator/s to the evidence or arguments put before the Engineer
for the purpose of obtaining his said decision pursuant to Sub-
Clause 67.1. No such decision shall disqualify the Engineer from
being called as a witness and giving evidence before the
arbitrator/s on any matter whatsoever relevant to the dispute.

Arbitration may be commenced prior to or after completion of the
Works, provided that the obligations of the Employer, the Engineer
and the Contractor shall not be altered by reason of the
arbitration being conducted during the progress of the Works.”

140. Clause 67.3 CPA modified this provision by replacing the reference
to “the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International
Chamber of Commerce” by the “UNCITRAL arbitration rules” and
adding that the “arbitration shall take place in Bishkek”.

141. There is no dispute between the Parties that this arbitration
agreement is valid and binding and applicable in the present case.

142. The Contract was concluded in 1999. Therefore it is the 1976
version of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, in force at the time of
the conclusion of the Contract, which is applicable in the present
arbitration.

6.2 Issues concerning the Composition of the Arbitral Tribunal

In the Statement of Defence the Respondent also complained about
the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal, in particular to the
nationality of the arbitrators. It referred to a letter it had addressed
to the PCA in the context of the designation of the Appointing
Authority and the nomination of an arbitrator on behalf of the
Respondent. In its letter of 21 April 2009 the Respondent wrote:

“Besides we feel that the arbitrator on the part of the Claimant
and the arbitrator on the part of the Respondent should not be
selected from the citizens of Turkey or Kyrgyzstan.”35

The UNCITRAL Rules provide that, when making its appointment,
the Appointing Authority

“... shall have regard to such considerations as are likely to
secure the appointment of an independent and impartial
arbitrator and shall take into account as well the advisability of
appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than the
nationalities of the parties”.

The provision does not apply to the choice of an arbitrator by the
Parties. This provision has been respected by the Appointing
Authority when appointing the arbitrator on behalf of the
Respondent. The Respondent has not pointed to any rule in the law
of Kyrgyzstan, governing the arbitration, or the UNCITRAL Rules
which contains a nationality requirement with respect to the
arbitrators appointed by the parties.

It must be noted that later in the arbitration, the Respondent has
not further pursued its criticism of the composition of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal concludes that its composition is in full conformity
with the applicable arbitration law and the UNCITRAL Rules.

6.3 The scope of the arbitration agreement and its application to
certain claims

. The principal difference between the Parties with respect to

jurisdiction concerns the question whether the arbitration
agreement applies to three of the claims brought by the Claimant.
In this respect, the Respondent argues that the claims concerning

(i) the damage caused to the Grader;
(ii) the debts of the Nominated Subcontractor JASU;
and

* Exhibit R4.

33

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 36 of 177

(iii) damages arising out of the sub-contract with the Interakt
company

are not covered by the arbitration clause.

149

150.

151.

152.

153.

154.

. Article 21 (3) or the UNCITRAL Rules requires that a “plea that the
arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later
than in the statement of defence ...”. The Respondent’s objection to
jurisdiction has been raised in the Statement of Defence, at
paragraphs 99, 109 and 111. Therefore, it has been made timely
and is admissible according to the UNCITRAL Rules.

In support of its objection to jurisdiction with respect to the named
claims the Respondent argues that the claims concern “relations
arising between the Claimant and third parties which are not a
party to the Contract”.

The Respondent’s argument was developed at the hearing in the
Respondent’s opening statement?’ and was discussed at that
occasion.“ The matter was also addressed in the Respondent’s
Final Submission.

The Claimant argues that the claims are not directed against third
parties but concern the liability of the Respondent for events
involving third parties. Indeed, as it was considered at the hearing,
the manner in which the claims are presented does not concern the
question whether the third parties are liable to the Contractor, but
whether the Contractor is entitled to claim from the Respondent
under the Contract.39

This is a matter which must be determined with respect to each of
the three claims. The Tribunal will therefore address the matter
separately when considering each of these claims.

6.4 Limits resulting from the procedure prescribed in Clause 67
cc

In addition to the limits to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction resulting from
the arbitration agreement, the Tribunal must also consider those
limits which result from the procedures prescribed by the
arbitration agreement itself: as stated above, the present dispute is
brought under Clause 67 of the Conditions of Contract, as modified
by Clause 67.3 CPA. The former clause provides for a series of steps
which must be followed before an arbitration may commence and

34

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 37 of 177

which limit the recourse to arbitration to disputes that have
progressed through these steps in a timely manner.

155. In particular these clauses require that any “matter in dispute shall,
in the first place, be referred in writing to the Engineer”. Clause
67.1 continues by providing in the relevant parts the following:

“If either the Employer or the Contractor be dissatisfied with any
decision of the Engineer, or if the Engineer fails to give notice of
his decision [in time] then either the Employer or the Contractor
may [within the specified time] give notice to the other party, [...]
of his intention to commence arbitration. [...] no arbitration in
respect thereof may be commenced unless such notice is given.

If the Engineer has given notice of his decision as to a matter in
dispute to the Employer and the Contractor and no notice of
intention to commence arbitration as to such dispute has been
given by either the Employer or the Contractor on or before the
seventieth day after the day on which the parties received notice
as to such decision from the Engineer, the said decision shall
become final and binding upon the Employer and the Contractor.”

156. Clause 67.3 makes it clear that arbitration is available only for
disputes in respect of which the decision of the Engineer has not
become final and binding.

157. Before considering any claim made in this arbitration, the Tribunal
must therefore examine whether the claim has been brought before
the Engineer for a decision under Clause 67 and, if the Engineer has
given his decision, whether the Employer or the Contractor has
expressed his dissatisfaction and gave notice of his intention to
commence arbitration.

158. During the course of the performance of the works, the Contractor
announced its intention to claim on a number of occasions. In the
Statement at Completion of 17 March 2006, the Contractor claimed
a total of US$25°054’966.78,*° including, in part B of the statement,
8 claims for the total amount of US$24’532’304.24.41 The Engineer
considered these claims and issued on 18 May 2006 his
Determination,*? stating that “he determines and certifies a sum of
US$1’187’035.20 as the entitlement of the Contractor under Part B
of the Statement at Completion”.

159. The Contractor wrote to the Engineer on 7 June 2006, contesting
some of the explanations in the Engineer’s Determination and

requesting reconsideration of the Determination.4s The Engineer
replied on 15 June 2006, provided additional explanations for its
Determination but did not modify it.44

Thereupon, the Contractor requested an Engineer’s decision
pursuant to Clause 67.1 on 20 June 2006;*5 in a letter of 16 August
2006, the Contractor provided additional details and raised a
number of questions.4© The Engineer responded to the Contractor’s
letter of 20 June 2006 by stating on 12 September 2006 that he
believed “that the Engineer’s Representative’s Determination and
Certification is accurate, reasonable and impartial”.+7

The Engineer’s decision was then issued on 16 October 2006.48 To
the question whether the Contractor was entitled to the sum
claimed in the Statement at Completion, the Engineer replied: “The
Contractor is payable the amount certified by the Engineer”. In
other words, the Engineer refused to revise the Determination and
rejected the Contractor’s request to this effect.

On 22 December 2006, the Contractor wrote to the Employer with
copy to the Engineer a letter showing as it subject: “Notice of
Intention to Commence Arbitration under Clause 67.1 of the
Conditions of Contract”. In the text of the letter, the Contractor
stated:

“Please refer to the Clause 67.1 Engineer’s Decision dated 12
September 2006 and its details dated 16 October 2006 on the
Statement at Completion.

The Contractor is dissatisfied with the Engineer’s Decision under
Clause 67.1 of the Conditions of Contract and hereby notifies the
Employer of his intention to commence Arbitration pursuant to
Clause 67.1 of the Conditions of Contract.”49

On 15 January 2009, the Claimant addressed its Notice of
Arbitration to the Respondent. The Notice started as follows:

“Reference is made to our Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration
dated 22-12-2006. As the Claimant, we have decided to take the
following disputes/claims to International Arbitration according to
Clause 67 of the Conditions of Contract”.

* Exhibit C-18.

167.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 39 of 177

This was followed by the brief description of six claims with a total of
US$18’521’845 plus a claim for interest up to 31 December 2008 for
US$3’219°466.90. The six claims described in the Notice of
Arbitration included some but not all of the claims which the
Contractor had presented in part B of the Statement at Completion
and which were dealt with in the Engineer’s Determination. The
Notice ended by the Claimant stating that it “reserves the right to
amend the claims during the course of the arbitration”.

In the Statement of Claim of 15 March 2010, the Claimant
developed its position concerning the claims included in the Notice
of Arbitration; in addition to these claims, further claims were added
from part B of the Statement at Completion. The Claimant
confirmed that the “subject matter of this arbitration is the
Engineer’s Determination-Part B of the Statement at Completion
dated May 18, 2006”.5°

The scope of the arbitration was further clarified by the Claimant at
the Hearing and recorded in the Summary Minutes as follows:

“5. The Claimant clarified that its claim had to be considered in
the context of the Clause 67.1 Engineer’s Decision on the
Statement at Completion, issued on 16 October 2006 and the
Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration, dated 22 December
2006. The Engineer’s Decision had been based on the Engineer’s
Determination on the Statement at Completion - Part B, dated 18
May 2006, including in particular Table 2 setting out the
Engineer’s Determination concerning the delay related claims.”

The scope of this arbitration, therefore, is clearly circumscribed: it
concerns those parts of the Engineer’s Determination of 18 May
2006 which were contested by the Contractor. The Tribunal
examined for each of the claims made in this arbitration whether it
falls within this scope. In particular, it examined, on a claim by
claim basis, whether each claim was properly pursued following the
procedure of Clause 67 of the Conditions of Contract.

7. TIME BAR AND TIMELY NOTICE

The Respondent argues that the claims made in this arbitration are
time-barred under the applicable law and that, in any event, the
Claimant having failed to give timely notice, is precluded from
pursuing the claims.

7.1 Time bar under the law of the Kyrgyz Republic

The Respondent relies on Articles 212 and 216 (2) CC and concludes
that the claims made by the Claimant in this arbitration are time
barred.5!

The Parties are not in complete agreement with respect to the
accuracy of the English translation of the Code®? and with the
applicability of these provisions since a modification occurred in
August 2009. The disagreement is not material in relation to the
dispute here.

Both Parties agree that the applicable period is three years.53

In defence against the Respondent’s time bar argument, the
Claimant invoked Article 215 CC which provides in its paragraphs
(3) and (4) exceptions.54 The Respondent argues that these
provisions are applicable only in cases where extraordinary
circumstances have prevented a claimant to act within the period of
limitation. This does indeed seem to be the correct interpretation of
the quoted article. It appears doubtful that, in the present case, the
Claimant may rely on such extraordinary circumstances.

However, before considering whether the Claimant may be excused
for having failed to meet the three year period of limitation, it must
be determined when, in the present case, this period started to run
and whether, by the time the arbitration commenced, the period had
expired.

The Parties agree that the start of the period is determined by Article
216 (2) KCC which reads in translation:

“The duration of the term of statute of limitation starts from the
date when the person learns or should have learned of the

5! R-SoD, paragraph 39 and R-PHB, Section 2.

* See above paragraph 82.

* C-Legal Grounds, paragraph 123; R-SoD, paragraph 39.
* See C-Legal Grounds, p. 44.

38

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 41 of 177

violation of his right. The Code and other laws may establish
exceptions to this rule.”

175. The question therefore is which are the rights invoked by the
Claimant in this arbitration and when the Claimant learned or
should have learned that these rights had been violated.

176. The Claimant seeks compensation for a number of losses or
additional costs, i.e. those resulting from the prolongation of the
works and the losses caused by the events forming the basis of the
other claims. In order to receive such compensation, the Contractor
must apply to the Engineer who must render a determination. This
determination must be a fair decision, respecting the rights of the
Contractor and the Employer in a balanced manner.®5

177. Under the terms of the present contract claims for additional
payments such as those which are submitted in this arbitration, are
determined by the Engineer. Clause 53.1 GCC, which will be
considered in further details below, states quite clearly that a
“condition precedent to any entitlement to additional costs” is the
“submission of the proper notices and detailed particulars” under
that clause. If the Engineer makes a determination as requested by
the Contractor, the Contractor is made whole and suffers no
damage, provided the Employer complies with the Engineer’s
Decision. It is therefore the failure of the Engineer to grant the
requested additional payment and to make the requested
determination, if it is wrongful, which causes the violation of the
Contractor’s rights.

178. As the Claimant clarified at the hearing, it is this determination
which it attacks in this arbitration. Its complaint is that the
Engineer wrongly denied the requested compensation.

179. The Tribunal concludes that violation of the Contractor’s rights of
which the Claimant complains occurred in the form of the
Engineer’s Determination. This Determination was notified to the
Contractor on 18 May 2006. The Notice of Arbitration was filed on
15 January 2009 and thus before the expiration of the period of
limitation. The claims included in the Notice of Arbitration are not
time barred under the Kyrgyz Civil Code.

7.2 Time bar under the Contract - Notice Requirements

180. The Respondent also argues that the claims must be dismissed
because the Contractor failed to give timely notice and therefore lost
the right to make the claims under the Contract.

% See in particular Clause 2.6 GCC.

39

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 42 of 177

181. Clause 53.1 GCC, on which the Respondent relies in this respect,
provides as follows:

“Notwithstanding any other provision of the Contract, if the
Contractor intends to claim any additional payment pursuant to
any Clause of these Conditions or otherwise, he shall give notice
of his intention to the Engineer, with a copy of the Employer,
within 28 days after the event giving rise to the claim has first
arisen.

Submission of the proper notices and detailed particulars within
the time limits specified in this sub-clause and elsewhere in these
conditions shall be a condition precedent to any entitlement to
additional costs or to an extension of time under the Contract.”

182. It is undisputed that the claim for compensation of the prolongation
cost (and of some other losses) was made not at the time when the
cause for the prolongation arose and the Contractor claimed for the
five EOTs. This claim was made only in the Statement at Completion
of 17 March 2003, more than 28 days after the events causing the
delay had occurred and after the works had been completed.

183. The Respondent concludes that, because of this failure of the
Contractor to comply in due time with this notice requirement, the
Contractor is deprived of “the opportunity to claim’.

184. The Claimant relies on Clause 53.4 GCC which provides:

“If the Contractor fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
Clause in respect to any claim which he seeks to make, his
entitlement to payment in respect thereof shall not exceed such
amount as the Engineer or any arbitrator or arbitrators appointed
pursuant to Sub-Clause 67 assessing the claim considers to be
verified by contemporary records (whether or not such record
were brought to the Engineer’s notices as required by Sub-
Clauses 53.2 and 53.3).”

185. This clause clearly addresses the situation in which the Contractor,
as in the present case, failed to comply with notice provision in
clause 53. It makes it quite clear that claims filed after the
expiration of the 28 days’ notice period are not excluded. They are
simply subject to a restriction with respect to the evidence on which
the Contractor may rely in order to support its claim: the claim
must be established on the basis of contemporary records.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 43 of 177

The Tribunal concludes that, despite the Contractor’s failure to give
notice of its claims within the 28 days period and then to
substantiate the claimed losses, the Claimant may seek
compensation for the events to which the claims relate. However,
the claims may be awarded only to the extent to which they are
established on the basis of contemporary records.

8. THE CLAIM FOR PROLONGATION COSTS

8.1 The claim and its history

187. The Claimant seeks an award for the costs resulting from the
prolongation of the works. The amounts claimed and the manner in
which they were calculated have varied over time. In its latest
submission, the Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant quantifies this
clam at US$24’195975.18; it presents two _ alternative
quantifications of US$22’334’204.28 and US$20’549.536.88. The
claim makes allowance for US$1’161’870.19 certified by the
Engineer and paid by the Employer. In all three quantifications,
this amount is deducted already.

188. The Respondent denies the claim, arguing that it was late,
insufficiently substantiated and unfounded.5’ It also points out
that the Engineer considered the claim for prolongation costs and
assessed these costs. The costs so assessed were paid by the
Respondent.®® According to the Respondent, the Contractor is not
entitled to any additional payments.

189. The Claim is presented by reference to five requests for extension of
time (EOT requests) which the Contractor had presented during the
course of the Project. In these EOT requests, the Contractor
identified the duration of the extension requested; it also stated its
intention to claim prolongation costs, but did not quantify these
costs.59 The EOT requests were granted in part: the Engineer issued.
decisions with respect to EOT 1, 4 and 5; with respect to EOT 2 and
3, the Parties agreed on extensions by Addenda 1 and 4 to the
Contract. In this manner the Contract Period was extended by 637
days.©

190. In the Statement at Completion of 17 March 2006 the Contractor
claimed for the costs incurred from the original completion date of 3
December 2002 to the effective completion on 12 December 2005, a
total of 17043 days. He counted the costs on a month by month
basis for “Personnel Costs”, “General Expenditures”, “Machinery
Costs” and “Financial Costs”, producing a total of
US$22’928'039.25. These costs were further broken down and
partly evidenced by Summaries of Personnel Cost Records for
Turkish and for Local Personnel, Overhead Costs, lists of Machinery

on Site and their monthly costs together with machinery rental
documents.®!

The Engineer adopted a different approach: In his Determination of
18 May 2006 the Engineer determined the “excusable” delay, i.e. the
period for which the Contractor was granted an extension of time.
Within the overall period of excusable delay, the Engineer
distinguished between “compensable” and “non-compensable”.
Prolongation costs were granted only for the “compensable” delay.

When examining the days of delay, the Engineer proceeded by
reference to each EOT request and determined the delay that had
been claimed for the periods covered by these requests. The
Engineer granted 1043 days as excusable, the number of delay days
suffered by the Project and claimed by the Contractor. The increase
of the number of days for which an extension of time was granted
(i.e. days of the excusable delay) was due primarily to the fact that
the Engineer took into account 318 days of “Winter Break” and
some “Lost Days”, as they shall be discussed below.

Within the total of 1043 days of excusable delay, the Engineer
identified only 153 days as compensable delay, while 890 days were
excusable but non-compensable.®2 For the quantification of these
153 days of compensable delay, the Engineer considered the
different heads of cost which the Contractor had quantified in the
EOT requests but proceeded in a different manner, as shall be
discussed in further details below. The Engineer arrived at
US$131’511.84 for personnel costs and US$1’030’358.35 for
“Machinery Costs” and a total of US$1’161’870.19.63

In the correspondence following the Engineer’s Determination the
Contractor®* questioned the Determination and, when the Engineer
did not change his opinion requested an Engineer’s Decision
according to Clause 67.1 CC.® After further correspondence in
which the Contractor provided additional information,®© the
Engineer replied on 12 September 2006 and gave his Decision on
16 October 2006.°

In the Notice of Arbitration of 15 January 2009 the Claimant
referred to the extension of the completion date and the five EOTs; it

completion as quantified in the Statement at Completion and
complained that “the Engineer did not certify the costs related to the
approved EOT’s’.£9 The claimed amount for this item was
US$17°777°607.36.

196. In the Statement of Claim the Claimant referred to the extensions of
time that had been granted and stated that it “does not claim any
additional extension of time” but “claims for the additional
payment”.7° It presented the additional payments by reference to
the EOT requests, described as “Interim Claims” for a total of 672
days and added claims for the delay due to the Winter Suspension
Period of 136 days and an additional 150 days Winter Suspension
Period attributed to the Joint Responsibility of the Employer and the
Contractor.7!

197. At the hearing in Bishkek the Claimant confirmed that its claim for
Prolongation Costs had to be considered by reference to the
Engineer’s Decision of 16 October 2006 and the Engineer’s
Determination of 18 May 2006. The Claimant clarified at the
Hearing that it accepted the duration of the time extension which
the Engineer had granted/confirmed in the Determination so that
there was no longer a need for the delay analysis of Mr Wiseman,
the Claimant’s delay expert.72 The dispute therefore was reduced (i)
to the compensability of certain delays, i.e. the question whether
some or all of the delays which the Engineer had classified as non-
compensable in reality were compensable, and (ii) the quantification
of the costs caused by all those delays which the Engineer or the
Tribunal had determined as compensable.

198. Following the October 2011 hearing the Parties’ delay experts
updated their reports and the Parties’ quantum experts consulted
with each other, as it had been agreed at the hearing and recorded
in the Summary Minutes. Mr Kennedy, quantum expert for the
Claimant, and Mr Taft, quantum expert for the Respondent met on 7
and 8 December 2011 and then prepared a Joint Report, dated 19
December 2011, in the format of a Scott Schedule in which they set
out their respective positions on the relevant issues of
quantification.

199. Mr Kennedy, the Claimant’s quantum expert submitted a final
report on 18 January 2012, in which he complemented and
corrected some of the positions expressed in the Joint Expert Report
and some of the numbers used in the quantification. An Addendum

Respondent only on 20 March 2012. This submission has been
addressed above at the end of Section 4.

200. Concerning the position which the Claimant expressed at the
hearing about the Engineer’s Determination of the duration of the
excusable delay, the Respondent argued that, by expressing this
position, the Claimant “abandoned its claims for payment of the
extension of time under the Contract in the amount of 808 days”.73
The Claimant responded by stating that it merely “clarified” its
position.”4

201. The Tribunal has considered the position of the Claimant as
expressed at the hearing. It noted that, with respect to the duration
of excusable delay, the Claimant now relies solely on the
Determination by the Engineer. This constitutes a clarification
which simplifies the proceedings for both Parties and for the
Tribunal. The Claimant continues to claim for the costs of
compensable delay. The substance of the claim remained the same.

202. In any event, even if one were to consider the modification in the
Claimant’s position as an amendment to its claim, it was a useful
amendment which simplified the proceedings. Such amendments
are admissible under Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.
The Respondent had the possibility at the hearing and in its post
hearing submission several months after the hearing to comment
the Claimant’s position and the Respondent’s experts had ample
opportunity to comment this position as clarified at the hearing. To
the extent this were required, the Tribunal accepts the amendment.

203. The Respondent also raised objections based on time bar and notice
requirements. These have been considered above in Section 7 and
need not be repeated here. To the extent to which notice issues
arise specifically concerning certain aspects of claim for
prolongation costs, they shall be addressed in their respective
context.

8.2 Compensable delay

8.2.1 The principle of compensability

204. In the Statement at Completion the claim for prolongation costs was
based on the assumption that the Contractor was entitled to the full
costs of the extended contract period. The Engineer contested this
assumption. He accepted that 1’043 days delay in the completion of
the works were “excusable”, i.e. the Contractor was not responsible
for the delay and was granted an extension of the Time for

*° R-PHB, paragraph 3.1.3.
™ C-PHB, paragraph 3.

45

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 48 of 177

Completion according to Clause 44.1 GCC. To the extent to which
such an extension is granted, the Contractor’s failure to complete
within the stipulated time is not subject to the sanction according to
Clause 47.1 GCC and the Employer may not claim liquidated
damages.

205. However, the extension of the Time for Completion, in and of itself,
does not justify any other claim. In particular, it does not oblige the
Employer to make any additional payments to the Contractor. The
Engineer has pointed this out clearly to the Contractor;75 and the
Respondent has insisted on this principle in the arbitration.7¢

206. This principle is stated clearly in a provision which in the CPA was
added to Clause 44.1:

“The granting of an extension of time for completion shall not
entitle the Contractor to any additional payment. Where, in the
opinion of the Contractor, additional costs have been incurred in
connection with or in consequence of the cause or the event for
which extension of time for completion has been granted, such
costs shall be documented and claimed separately, in accordance
with the provision of Clause 53.”

207. In other words, claims for additional payments must be related to
the “cause or event for which extension of time for completion has
been granted”. If such a cause entitles the Contractor to
compensation, the additional costs “incurred in connection with or
in consequence of’ this cause also may be claimed. But the
Contractor has to demonstrate such a causal relationship with the
events that entitle the Contractor to compensation.

208. The Engineer used the concept of “compensable delay”. He
distinguished among the days of excusable delay those which were
“compensable” and those which were “non-compensable”; only for
the former category the Engineer accepted that the Contractor could
claim for the costs of the delay. The latter were defined by him as
follows:

“.. delays for which neither party is at fault: act of God,
epidemics, etc. as set forth in the delay clause. Time extension is
the only remedy for such delays.”’7

209. The Claimant also accepts that, in order for the delay to be
compensable, there must be a “legal ground either under the
Contract or the local law, i.e. Kyrgyz law”.78

* See for instance his letter of 15 June 2006, Exhibit R-11.

46

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 49 of 177

210. In the Tribunal’s opinion this distinction is necessary: the
Respondent can be required to make additional payments for
excusable delay only if the Claimant shows a legal basis which
justifies such a claim for additional payment.

211. The distinction between compensable and non-compensable delay is
now uncontested in this arbitration. The Claimant accepts that, in
order to claim costs for a given period of delay, it must demonstrate
not only that the delay was “excusable” but also that it is
“compensable”; and it sets out to demonstrate the legal basis for
such compensation.79

212. The question concerning “excusable” delay and its duration has
been resolved and needs no longer be addressed: the Engineer has
fixed the number of days of excusable delay in the Determination.”
The Employer has not contested this determination and has not
required that it be submitted to arbitration. The Contractor has
accepted at the hearing that his claim be assessed by reference to
the number of excusable delay days fixed by the Engineer in Table 2
of the Determination. The issue of compensability therefore is
reduced to the question whether, beyond the 153 days of
compensable delay certified by the Engineer, any other days of
excusable delay are compensable.

213. Two basic grounds to justify compensation of delay or prolongation
costs have been identified: the Contract and the law of Kyrgyzstan.
The scope and limits of these grounds must be examined one by
one.

8.2.2 Delay in issuing drawings and instructions — Clause 6.4
GCC

 

214. The Contract contains a number of provisions which entitle the
Contractor to additional payment and which are relevant for the
claims made in this arbitration. The first of these provisions
concerns delay in the Engineer’s issuing of drawings or instructions
necessary for the Contractor’s work. It is contained in Clause 6.4
on which the Claimant relied expressly.*' The clause reads as
follows:

“If, by reason of any failure or inability of the Engineer to issue,
within a time reasonable in all the circumstances, any drawings

 

78 C-PHB, paragraph 23. The Claimant also raises the question of a “lack of concurrent critical delay on the part
of the Contractor”, a question which shall be considered below in the context of the Winter Breaks.

” See in particular Claimant’s Submission on Legal Grounds, p. 5 et seq.

® Exhibit C-2, Table 2.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 50 of 177

or instructions for which notice has been given by the Contractor
in accordance with Sub-Clause 63, the Contractor suffers delay
and/or incurs costs then the Engineer shall, after due
consultation with the Employer and the Contractor, determine:

(a) any extension of time to which the Contractor is entitled
under Clause 44, and

(b) the amount of such costs, which shall be added to the
Contract Price,

and shall notify the Contractor accordingly, with a copy to the
Employer.”

215. This clause applies in all those cases in which the Engineer has
accepted delay in issuing drawings or instructions and granted
extensions of time. Clause 6.3," to which Clause 6.4 refers,
requires that the Contractor give notice to the Engineer about the
risk of delay or disruption if drawings or instructions are not issued
in time. In cases where the Engineer has extended the time under
Clause 6.4 GCC, it may be assumed that such notice has been
given, unless the Engineer has expressly stated that this was not
the case.

216. Since Clause 6.4 applies to both extension of time and additional
costs, an uncontested extension of time has as the necessary
consequence that, as a matter of principle, any additional cost must
also be compensated - provided, of course, that they have been
properly substantiated and the causal link with the grounds for
entitlement has been established.

217. The Tribunal therefore accepts that, in all those cases where the
Engineer has accepted that the late drawings or instructions have
caused excusable delay, the related prolongation costs are
compensable. This is indeed the manner in which the Engineer has
proceeded: “design delays” or similarly described excusable delays in
Table 2 of the Engineer’s Determination were all included in the
category of “compensable delay”.

8.2.3 Special Risks — Clause 65 GCC

218. Another contractual provision which entitles the Contractor to
additional payments is Clause 65 GCC, concerning Special Risks, as
defined in Clause 20.4 CPA. The relevant parts of Clause 65.5 GCC
provide compensation in the following terms:

® Clause 6.4 makes reference to « Sub-Clause 63 ». This must be a typographical error: Clause 63 deals with
termination. The notice requirement is set out in Clause 6.3. The Tribunal therefore reads the reference to “Sub-
Clause 63” as referring to Sub-Clause 6.3.

“Save to the extent that the Contractor is entitled to payment
under any other provision of the Contract, the Employer shall
repay to the Contractor any costs of the execution of the Works
(...) which are howsoever attributable to or consequent on or the
result of or in any way whatsoever connected with the said
special risks, ... but the Contractor shall, as soon as any such
cost comes to his knowledge, forthwith notify the Engineer
thereof. The Engineer shall, after due consultation with the
Employer and the Contractor, determine the amount of the
Contractor’s costs in respect thereof which shall be added to the
Contract Price and shall notify the Contractor accordingly, with a
copy to the Employer.”

The special risks are defined in Clause 65.2 GCC which refers to
Clause 20.4 GCC. This latter provision has been replaced by Clause
20.4 CPA. The relevant passage is 20.4 (a) (ii) CPA which identifies
“rebellion, revolution, insurrection, or military or usurped power, or
civil war”, Clause 65.2 (b) clarifying that these events must “relate to
the country in which the Works are to be executed”.

At the hearing the Respondent argued that the costs for which the
Contractor may claim compensation under Clause 65.5 GCC are
“any costs but not for prolongation or delay, for delay of their
works”.83. The Tribunal sees no basis for excluding prolongation
costs from those which must be reimbursed to the Contractor under
Clause 65.5 GCC. This clause defines the costs in the broadest
possible manner: “which are howsoever attributable to or
consequent on or the result of or in any way whatsoever connected
with the said special risks”. The Tribunal accepts that this
definition of compensable costs includes those caused by the
prolongation of the works.

The question whether a specific event qualifies as “special risk” in
the sense of Clause 20.4 CPA and 65.5 GCC and whether the notice
provision specific to Clause 65.5 GCC has been respected must be
considered in the context of the specific claim in which these
provisions are invoked.

8.2.4 Additional works

Under the Contract the Contractor is paid for the work performed in
the agreed manner and the agreed time. If the Contractor is
required to perform additional work, he also must be paid for this
additional work. Since the Contractor is paid at unit rates set out in
the Bill of Quantities (BOQ), such additional work does not cause
any difficulty insofar as it is paid through the BOQ rates and prices.

49

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 52 of 177

Details are set out in Clause 51 GCC under the heading
“Alterations, Additions and Omissions”. All of this is uncontested.

223. The controversy in the present case arises from the Contractor’s
claim for prolongation costs caused by the additional works. The
Engineer denied the Contractor’s claims for prolongation costs on
this basis and justified the denial on the following grounds:

“... where an increased amount of work justifies an extension of
time, the Engineer has to consider whether the increased amount
has rendered the Contract rate inapplicable. The nature of the
work does not have to change, but if the overheads during the
extended period exceed the overheads covered by the additional
volume of work, the rate for the work is no longer applicable and
should be adjusted.

The Contractor did not take the above stated actions [notice
according to Clause 52.2 GCC concerning the fixing of “a suitable
rate or price”|, therefore no additional cost for extended period
due to additional works was approved.”8+

224. In other words, the Engineer accepted, as a matter of principle, that
costs caused by delay resulting from additional works had to be
compensated; but he was of the opinion that this had to be done
through the adjustment of the contractual rates and prices and that
the Contractor had failed to observe the notice periods for
requesting such adjustments. For the Engineer, it is therefore not a
question of whether prolongation costs caused by additional works
are compensable but only a question of the method in which this is
done. This question of method will be discussed below in the
context of the quantification of the prolongation costs.85

225. The experts of both sides, too, are of the view that prolongation
costs caused by additional works are compensable. At the hearing,
Mr Hamann reported that the experts agreed that additional works
were compensable;* the Experts Consultation Table also showed
additional works as being compensable. Mr Marshall confirmed this
in his Final Report:

“I would expect that additional works would usually be
considered ‘compensable’ in that clause 52.2 of the Conditions
allows the contractor to claim extra payment or a varied rate in
specified circumstances provide notice had been given.”®7

50

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 53 of 177

226. The Respondent does not question that, as a matter of principle,
additional works and prolongation costs resulting from them are
compensable; it merely supports the Engineer’s position, according
to whom, these costs must be quantified according to Clause 52.2
Gc.

227. The Tribunal concludes that under the Contract, additional works
must be paid. Normally, additional works or variations are paid
through the rates and the prices of the BOQ; where necessary these
rates and prices may be adjusted according to Clauses 52.1 and
52.2 GCC. If, as the result of additional work, the Contractor has
incurred additional costs which cannot be priced adequately in this
manner, they may be claimed under the additional Clause 44.1 CPA.
The method of compensation shall be considered and determined
below.

8.2.5 Grounds for the compensation of prolongation costs under
the law of Kyrgyzstan

228. The Claimant also relies on the law of Kyrgyzstan in support of its
claims. In particular, it invokes two provisions of the Kyrgyz Civil
Code (KCC). One of these provisions, Article 368, is taken from
Chapter 20 of the Code which deals with Liability for Breach of
Obligations in general; the other, Article 638, is contained in
Chapter 30 which concerns specifically the Work Contract.

“Article 368 Obligor’s Delay

1. The obligor who delayed performance, shall be liable to the
obligee for losses caused by the delay as well as for the incidental
impossibility of performance occurred during the delay.

2.

Article 638 Customer’s Assistance

1. The customer shall render assistance to the contractor
during the performance of the work in cases, volume and
procedure provided by the work contract.

In case of non-fulfilment of this obligation by the customer the
contractor may demand the indemnification of losses inflicted,
including additional expenses, caused by the idleness of shifting
of terms of the performance of work or by the increase of the price
indicated in the contract.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 54 of 177

229. These provisions confirm the conclusions that result from the above
analysis of the obligations under the Contract: where the Employer
has undertaken to perform, directly or through the Engineer, certain
functions, for instance delivering drawings or instructions, he is
liable for any damage resulting from delay in performing these
functions.

230. The Engineer had the same understanding of the Employer’s liability
when defining “compensable delays” in the following manner:

“,..[delays] due to some act or omission of the Employer, for
example lack of site access. In such cases the Contractor is
entitled to damages for extra cost incurred unless there is a valid
contract clause barring such recovery.”®9

231. In his Determination, the Engineer applied these principles by
granting prolongation costs to the Contractor where he determined
“adequate cause for awarding compensation to the Contractor” and
identified such cause as “failures of the Employer in fulfilling his
contractual obligations”. He included in causes which entitle the
Contractor to compensation

“delays caused by late approval of designs, untimely relocation of

Utilities and late issuance of commencement order”;

232. The Claimant followed a similar understanding of compensability
and sought to demonstrate for each period for which it sought
compensation a legal basis for the Respondent's liability.”!

233. The Respondent does not deny in principle the obligations flowing
from the quoted provisions of the KCC. It does, however, contest
specific obligations, such as those relating to design.” These will
have to be considered in the context of the specific claims to which
they relate.

8.3 Principles of Quantification of the Prolongation Costs

234. The quantification of the compensable delay costs, as it was argued
in this arbitration, gives rise to a number of questions of principle,
resulting from different positions taken by the Parties and, in
particular, by their respective experts. These positions developed
and crystallised as the proceedings progressed, through successive

expert reports, the discussions at the hearing and the updated
reports thereafter, in particular the Joint Expert Report.

235. Before examining the specific claims made in the five EOT requests
on which the Claimant relies in this arbitration, the Tribunal will,
therefore, have to consider these issues of principle. The issues
were discussed primarily in the reports of the Parties’ experts and by
these experts at the hearing. In their Post Hearing Submissions, the
Parties primarily relied on these explanations and discussions by
their experts. The Tribunal, therefore, refers largely to the
explanations of the experts as reflecting also the position of the
Parties having appointed them, unless the Parties have taken a
different position.

8.3.1 The records

236. When considering the timeliness of the claims, the Tribunal found
that the Contractor had failed to give notice for its intention to claim
for prolongation costs. As a result, Clause 53.4 of the GCC applies
and the claim must “be verified by contemporary records”.

237. During the performance of the work, detailed records were kept by
the Contractor. Much of the information from these records was
included in the Monthly Reports submitted by the Contractor.%
These reports and the material attached to them were made
available to the Engineer and the Employer. Therefore, the reports
are the principal element of the contemporary records.

238. The material contained in these Monthly Reports also served the
Engineer to keep his own records. It became apparent at the
Hearing that the Engineer was well documented and had «very
precise figures». These enabled him to identify the value of all those
items of Plant & Machinery for which he did not use Daywork
rates.24 He also had precise information about the personnel: “he
has very precise figures, he can tell us there were 173 foremen and
30 draggers, he knows exactly how many things were at site”.95
Indeed, on the basis of the “record kept in [the Engineer’s] file which
is base material for the monthly Progress Report”, the Engineer was
able to quantify the compensable costs for personnel and for
machinery.9©

239. An additional source of contemporary records is the Contractor’s
accounts. These accounts were subsequently audited and formed
the basis of the Contractor’s audited accounts from which the

Contractor took the data on which much of the claim calculation is
based. The Claimant provided with its submission and with the
reports of its experts documents from these records and tables
summarising their content. At the hearing the Claimant provided
additional information, “including a hard copy of a printout of Entes’
project accounts showing general expenditures costs. These data
were very voluminous. It was therefore agreed at the hearing that
the information would be made available to the Respondent in
electronic form on a memory stick. The communication of data and
records occurred at the hearing and continued after the hearing, in
particular in the meetings of the experts and their work on the Joint
Expert Report.97

240. This exchange of information based on the contemporaneous data
and records and the analysis of this data absorbed much of the time
of the Respondent’s expert time after the hearing and enabled him
to produce “large and complex spreadsheets”, which aimed at
“providing the Tribunal as much information as possible”.98 Mr
Taft, too, speaks of the “significant amount of information and
assessment that has been undertaken since receipt of the progress
records and the hard copy of project accounting records at the
Hearing.”99

241. The Tribunal is satisfied that the information and records thus
provided to the experts and used by them in their evaluation of the
claims qualifies as “contemporary records” in the sense of Clause
53.4 GCC. This information and these records provided a solid
basis for the analysis of the claims, in particular the quantification
of the prolongation costs. The Tribunal has borne in mind that any
deficiency in these records had to be construed against the Claimant
and that the claims were admissible only to the extent to which they
could be based on contemporary records.

8.3.2 Methods of quantification

242. The prolongation costs were first quantified in the Contractor’s
Statement at Completion. In this quantification the Contractor
assumed that he was entitled to the compensation for the total of
his prolongation costs, without distinguishing between compensable
and non-compensable costs. The claim consisted in the addition of
the costs which the Contractor claimed to have incurred during the
period after the contractual completion date. The summary sheet of
the claim showed, on a month by month basis, (i) personnel costs,
(ii) general expenditures, (iii) machinery costs and (iii) financial
costs. This summary sheet is backed up by detail on the costs in

°T See e.g. Taft III, section 1.3

each of these categories. The total adds up to US$22’928'039.25,
the amount claimed for prolongation costs.!0°

243. The Engineer introduced the distinction between compensable and
non-compensable. He identified the number of days which he
considered as compensable by reference to each of the five EOT.
However, he did not determine the compensation per month, year or
EOT separately but collectively for the total of 153 days of
compensable delay, relying on the contractual Daywork rates and
the cost information which the Contractor had provided. The total
compensation for these 153 days was US$17187 million. It is
therefore not possible to know how much the Engineer awarded per
day of compensable delay at the different stages of the project; only
the average daily compensation, in the order of US$8’000, is
known.!01 102

244. The Parties’ experts recognised that the costs of the delay vary
during the course of the performance of the work, depending in
particular on the resources engaged in the relevant activities. They
agree that the delay costs should be quantified not by considering
the compensable delay as a whole but separately for the periods to
which each of the five EOT claims applies and, within these periods,
separately for each of the periods during which the specific
compensable delay occurred. The experts quantify the delay costs
for each of these separate delay periods.

245. The Tribunal agrees with this approach and therefore considers the
delay costs separately for each period within an EOT for which
compensable delay has been identified.

246. Apart from the agreement on this basic element and with respect to
the use of Daywork rates, which shall be discussed next, the experts
disagree on most other elements of their quantification. The
disagreement concerns in particular the approach to be used in
identifying the relevant costs, as it shall be discussed thereafter, i.e.
the question whether all of the project costs are to be considered
during the relevant period or, as proposed by Mr Taft’s “bottom up
approach”, only the sections of the work and the resources which
can be shown to have been specifically affected by the delay at the
time when the delay occurred.

8.3.3 The use of rates

In the Determination, the Engineer adopted a method for
quantifying the costs of compensable delay that differed from that
used by the Contractor in the Statement at Completion. He did so
not on the basis of the Contractor’s costs but used the contractual
Daywork Rates.!°3_ These are contained in the Bill of Quantities of
the Contract and specifically in Bill 13 for “Dayworks: 1 Labor” and
“Dayworks: 3 Constructional Plant”.

The Engineer applied these Daywork rates for quantifying the delay
costs of personnel and to all cases where he “managed to find a rate
for a particular item of plant”.1°* For those items where he did not
find a rate, he used the Contractor’s list of “Monthly cost of
Machinery and Equipment on Site’ together with Statement at
Completion” and applied the values from this list to the items on the
“List of Machinery on Site according to Monthly Reports”.105

With respect to overheads, the Engineer explained that “Daywork
rates include the overheads”; where monthly rates did not, the
Engineer adjusted these rates to make allowance for overheads. 1!
For this reason, the Engineer did not allow overheads as a separate
item in his quantification of the claim.

The Contractor did not accept this approach and in the arbitration
the Claimant and its experts continued to quantify the claim on the
basis of the Contractor’s costs and not by reference to Daywork
rates.

Mr Taft, the Respondent’s quantum expert, took the same position.
He explained in his Final Report:

“... in my opinion, the use of the rates and prices set out in the
Contract should be reserved for those delays that have been
caused by works instructed under a Variation ...”.1°7

The Tribunal notes that the Daywork rates in the contract are part
of the Contractor’s pricing. Therefore, they are applicable when the
Contractor is paid for work not otherwise priced in the Contract.
They are not applicable in those cases where the costs must be
determined. Therefore, the Tribunal agrees that Daywork rates are
not the correct manner of quantifying the costs of delay. The actual
costs must be used. The question concerning the quantification of

delay costs caused by variations has been discussed separately
above. 108

253. When calculating the costs of delay, the Claimant’s experts followed
an approach which determined the delay costs on a monthly and
daily basis. They applied the daily costs so determined to the
relevant number of days of compensable delay and referred to the
daily costs so determined as “rates”. However, the rates so
determined are different from the Daywork rates in the Contract.
They are calculated by reference to the Contractor’s costs during a
certain period. This approach to quantification, the development of
the rate, was summarized as follows:

“... the rate at which [the Claimant’s expert] calculated on the
basis of [information available to him] is for most of the project
[US$] 30°000 per day, in some periods it goes up to 35’000,
towards the end it goes down to 13’000.”109

254. Mr Taft, the Respondent’s expert, adopting the “bottom-up”
approach, does not proceed by calculating a daily rate for the
Contractor’s costs but a total of the costs attributable to given
compensable delay. Nevertheless, in order to provide a comparison
with the Claimant’s expert, Mr Taft also shows daily rates.

255. Having accepted the approach by which the costs of delay during a
period are applied to the number of days of compensable delay, the
Tribunal also refers to these daily costs in terms of “rates”. It points
out, however, that the rates so determined are derived from the
Contractor’s costs and are different from the contractual Daywork
rates.

8.3.4 The “Bottom-up” method: restricting the claim to directly
impacted resources

256. The most important difference between the Parties and their experts
concerns the question whether, during a period of critical
compensable delay, the costs of all the Contractor’s resources on
site must be considered or only those which can be shown to have
been impacted by the cause of delay on which the entitlement to
compensation is based. Mr Taft, who insisted that this latter
approach should be applied, described it as “bottom-up approach”,
distinguishing it from the “top-down approach”, the expression by
which he described the method of quantification used by the
Claimant’s experts.110

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 60 of 177

257. Mr Kennedy, the Claimant’s expert, explained his approach in the
following manner: he determined, on a month by month basis, the
personnel costs, general expenditures and machinery costs. For
each claim which Mr Wiseman, the Claimant’s delay expert, had
identified as compensable, he took

“... the entire period in which the delay occurred and derived the
total cost thereof |... and then] divided the above total by the
number of months and then by the number of days per month (30
4) to ascertain an average daily figure.”!!!

258. He applied this average daily figure, sometimes also referred to daily
rate, to the number of compensable days of delay for that claim.
This approach continued to be applied by Mr Kennedy, with some
refinements, throughout the arbitration until his Final Report. This
approach is based on the assumption that the agreed critical delay
affected all resources on site.

259. Mr Taft explained his “bottom-up” approach as follows:

“.. is the only way by which individual delays at specific
locations can be properly assessed because one has to (in my
opinion) start with the each [sic] specific delay event and establish
what resources were impacted by it.”!!?

260. He also explained that

“... it is important to consider whether Entes’ time-related costs
that form part of its claim are Project-wide time-related costs, or
whether they attach to a particular part or section of the Project. It
is clear that many of the delay issues impact a specific part of the
Project, and even if such delays affect the Project critical path, if
any individual delay impacts only a particular section or sub-
section of the Project then any P&M resources that are dedicated
to another section or subsection of the Project will not be impacted
by that specific delay; why would they be? I have therefore tried
to apportion the P&M costs into the sub-sections of the Project so
that a realistic assessment can be made of the impact of
individual delays on the P&M resources.”!18

261. Mr Kennedy replied to these explanations as follows:
“I do not agree with Mr Taft’s logic on this issue. All of the
awarded 1043 days are for the project as a whole [...] The

extensions of time do not relate to sections or parts of the works

'! Mr Kennedy’s First Report, paragraphs28.1 to 28.5
'? Final Quantum Report by Mr Taft, paragraph 2.2.1.
"3 Joint Expert Report, note 5, Taft; he applied the same method with respect to personnel, see note 8.

58

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 61 of 177

but to the whole project and therefore in my view those entire
time-related costs should be applied to all of the works in the
periods in which they occur. To treat this time-related portion of
the P&M costs any other way would be to deny they are in fact
time-related and not section related.”!!+

262. On this basis, Mr Kennedy calculated monthly and daily rates which
he applied to the periods of compensable delay. The rate, as applied
in his Final Report, varied between US$32’763.48 per day for EOT 1
and US$13’697.94 for one of the periods in EOT 5. He multiplied
that rate with the number of days of compensable delay during the
period considered. Mr Taft’s method does not lead directly to daily
rates for a given period, since he differentiates between sub-sections
affected. Nevertheless, starting from the total amount assessed as
delay costs for a particular cause in one of the EOT periods, he
calculated what the daily rates would be. These vary between
US$8’631.71 in EOT 1 to a daily rate between US$1’520.13 and
US$3’904.22 in EOT 5.115

263. The Tribunal considered that the delay which the Engineer identified
is delay that affected the Project as a whole and delayed the
completion date and thus is critical delay. Some of this critical
delay was identified by the Engineer as compensable. In this
arbitration, the Claimant contests the Engineer’s decision to treat
some of the critical delay as non-compensable; but again, only
critical delay is in issue.

264. As a result of such critical delay, the resources engaged on the
Project are required for a longer period. Due to the delay, the
Contractor performs over a longer period the work for which he
planned (and priced) 17065 days. The Engineer accepted 1’043 days
of critical delay. As a result, the Contractor’s resources were
required for almost twice as long. It is the costs of these additional
days, to the extent to which they are compensable, that have to be
quantified and not just those which were directly impacted at a
specific moment.

265. It may be that, when a critical delay affects a particular section only,
the other sections continue working or resources engaged on a
delayed section may be shifted to other activities. Indeed, the issue
was discussed from this perspective at the hearing in the context of
the claim concerning Additional Works during the EOT 5 period. Mr
Taft refers to this discussion and relies on it in support of his
position.!!6 That work was performed at the end of the project on a
section that had been completed and was already “under traffic” and

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 62 of 177

some of the equipment was shifted for performing the additional
work.!17_ In such a situation, it may well be that only specific
sections which remain to be completed will have to be considered.
Indeed, as will be seen when the quantification of compensable
delay in EOT 5 is discussed, the daily rate applied is much lower
than during earlier periods.

In all these cases the delay requires that the Contractor remains
longer on site. Its resources are therefore engaged for a longer
period. Even if during the specific delay on the critical activities
some activities continue to be performed, sooner or later the other
sections also will be affected (during their performance or at their
end); otherwise the delay would not be critical. In this manner all of
the resources on the site are affected by delays to the completion
date of the Project.

The Tribunal concludes that during a given period of delay, the
resources engaged on all activities or sections of the work must be
considered when calculating the prolongation costs and not just
those on the activities immediately affected by the delay.

8.3.5 Allocation in time

For the reasons explained above, the duration of each of the periods
of delay has been determined by the Engineer and is not in issue
any longer. What remains to be determined is the precise period
during which each of the delays occurred.

As pointed out above, the Contractor’s costs varied over time. In
order to determine correctly the costs affected, it is important to
identify the relevant period to which a given period of compensable
delay must be allocated.

The periods during which the delay occurred have been quantified
on the Claimant’s side by Mr Wiseman, to whom Mr Kennedy refers,
and on the Respondent’s side by Mr Marshall to which Mr Taft
refers. The experts do not always agree on the duration of that
period nor do they always agree on the position of the delay period
on the time line of the project, i.e. when exactly the delay period
occurred.

The Respondent’s experts, due to the “bottom-up approach” applied
by them, seek to identify the specific activities affected by the
identified cause and the duration for which they were affected. On
occasions, they conclude that the delay is shorter than what the
Engineer had determined. The conclusion cannot be admitted since
the Engineer’s determination of the excusable delay has not been

"7 Testimony Asman, Tr 369.

60

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 63 of 177

brought to arbitration by the Employer and the Contractor accepted
during the arbitration the durations of delay determined by the
Engineer.

272. In each EOT the Contractor specified the relevant period for the EOT
request as a whole and, with respect to some delays, a specific
period during which individual delay events were effective. When
the Engineer, in his response to an EOT or in his Determination,
fixed the period of critical delay allocated to a specific cause, he
often also gave indications with respect to the period during which
the delay occurred.

273. In each case in which it had to quantify prolongation costs resulting
from critical delay, the Tribunal considered the relevant periods
identified by the experts of both sides. Given the difference in
method and the Tribunal’s decision, in favour of that adopted by the
Claimant’s expert, the Tribunal’s allocation of delay to a specific
period generally coincides with that of Mr Wiseman and Mr
Kennedy.

274. In a number of occasions the period identified by the Contractor or
the Engineer is longer than the period of critical delay awarded by
the Engineer. In these circumstances, the Claimant’s experts refer
to the relevant period and determine the average daily cost during
this period. This average daily cost is then applied, like a rate, to
the number of compensable days in question.

275. The Tribunal adopted the same method.

8.4 Cost categories

276. In the Statement at Completion, the Contractor quantified the delay
costs on the basis of four cost categories, viz. (i) Personnel Costs
(subdivided in “Turkish Personnel” and “Local Personnel”), (ii)
General Expenditures, (iii) Machinery Costs and (iv) Financial Costs.
The Engineer started with the same categories but, because of his
method of quantifying the claim, reduced the categories of
quantified costs to costs for personnel and machinery. In the
arbitration, the Claimant, through the report of Mr Kennedy,
presented the claim again on the basis of these four categories, the
costs being taken from the Claimant’s audited accounts.!18

277. In subsequent submissions and at the hearing, the Parties’ experts
dealt with the quantification of the delay claims by reference to
these categories, except that “Financial Costs” were no longer
considered in the context of the delay costs. The terminology used

''8 Kennedy I, paragraph 24 et seq.

61

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 64 of 177

for some of these costs, in particular that for the General
Expenditures, varied occasionally. The Tribunal will examine the
claim for prolongation costs by reference to these categories.

8.4.1 Personnel Costs

278. In the Statement at Completion the Contractor presented tables
showing for the time after the contractual completion date of 3
December 2002, on a month by month basis, the summary of its
personnel cost records and based the personnel cost component of
the claim on this summary.!!9 The Engineer stated in his
Determination that he requested “returns of labors” but did not
obtain them. Therefore he decided to quantify these costs on the
basis of his own records. He “used his record kept in his file which
is base material for the monthly Progress Report and applied
Daywork rate submitted in the bid to the working days of each
category of personnel”.!2° The Claimant objected to this method of
quantification. The Tribunal has accepted that records of actual
costs are to be preferred over rates such as the Daywork rates used
by the Engineer.

279. In the arbitration, the Claimant’s experts presented the local and
Turkish personnel costs on the basis of the Contractor’s audited
accounts. Attachments to Mr Kennedy’s first report contain tables
with a month by month breakdown of these personnel costs.!2!_ The
numbers in these tables are used in the final quantification of the
delay costs as contained in Mr Kennedy’s Final Report.!22

280. The Respondent and its experts were provided with the data backing
up these tables, in the form of very voluminous files of the
Contractor’s Monthly Reports of personnel and machinery, in the
form of “a memory stick with 600Mb of information” consisting of
these reports.!23 The Respondent’s quantum expert confirmed that
this “has enabled us to review the Turkish and Local personnel on
the site on a month-by-month basis”.

281. Mr Taft states that “timesheets, payroll information etc have not
been provided so I have not been able to check the monthly costs
claimed by Entes/assessed by Mr Kennedy”.!24 However, the
monthly records, as explained above, were taken from the
Contractor’s audited accounts. Mr Taft does not give any indication
which would raise doubts that the records are correct.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 65 of 177

282. Mr Taft used the monthly personnel accounts to apportion the
personnel costs between “site wide, sectional or non-prelim”. On the
basis of this allocation, Mr Taft then proceeded “to split Mr
Kennedy’s monthly costs into Section A, Section B, Site Wide and
Non-prelims for Turkish and Local staff’.!25 He used this allocation
for the purpose of his “bottom-up” method. The Tribunal has found
that this method is not adequate for the quantification of the
Project-wide delay which entitles the Contract to compensation of its
additional costs.

283. The Tribunal therefore accepts that the Contractor’s personnel costs
have been properly documented and must be assessed on the basis
of the records in the Monthly Reports. It uses the numbers in
Appendix A to Mr Kennedy’s Final Report.

8.4.2 Plant and Machinery Costs

284. The Statement at Completion also contained a “List of Machinery on
Site According to Monthly Reports”, showing for each month from
December 2002 to October 2005 the number of each item of
machinery. Another table showed the monthly costs of the
machinery in the list and further documents supported the value
shown in the table for the principle items of machinery.’ On this
basis, the Contractor calculated the monthly machinery costs for
this period, reaching a total of US$16’635’952.50.'””

285. The Engineer examined the monthly costs of machinery which the
Contractor had indicated and compared them to “the Contractor’s
submitted rates quoted from other countries”; he found that only a
few items of such other rates were lower than those indicated by the
Contractor in the table with the monthly machinery costs.
Nevertheless, the Engineer did not use these monthly machinery
costs but relied on the Daywork rates in the Contract. Only where
no Daywork rates were available, did the Engineer use the monthly
costs in the Contractor’s table, increasing them by 27.5% “to absorb
overheads (General Expenditures and Financial Costs) ...”. The
resulting rates were applied by the Engineer to a number of
compensable days of delay and the Engineer’s estimate of the
“number of days/machine that worked each month”.

286. Table 3, attached to the Engineer’s Determination, shows for the
claimed items of machinery the “Entes SaC Rate $/month’, i.e. the
monthly costs identified in the aforementioned table in the

°5 Taft II, Appendix B, p. 3.

Statement at Completion and an “Adjusted SaC (Entes Rate)”, i.e.
the corresponding cost based daily rate with the 27.5% mark-up.
For those items of machinery for which the Engineer had identified a
Daywork rate, that rate also was identified in Table 3. In nearly all
cases, the Daywork rates are below the rates based on the
Contractor’s cost based rates. In most cases, the difference is
substantial. For instance, for the Caterpillars D9N and D9R the
Daywork rates are US$40 while the cost based rates are US$510;
similarly the relationship between the rates for the Caterpillar D8N
is 40 to 425, the Dynapac F14 is 40 to 340, the Mercedes Jeep is 8
to 63, the Tractor 8 to 63. While the difference is less striking with
respect to some other items (e.g. the Komatsu bulldozer is 40 to
255, the Komazu loader is 40 to 212 and the Dynapac CC42 DD 40
to 76; and for some of the items identified as “Russian” the Daywork
rate comes close to the Contractor’s cost based rate), it is evident
from Table 3 that the Daywork rates used by the Engineer for
quantifying the Contractor’s machinery costs are far from reflecting
the costs identified by the Contractor and verified by the Engineer.

The Tribunal has accepted that for the quantification of the claim for
prolongation costs, the Daywork rates are not a suitable basis. This
is all the more the case when the Daywork rates are far from
expressing the costs for which the Contractor is entitled to be
compensated.

In the arbitration, the Mr Kennedy presented in his first report
tables showing, on a monthly basis over the period from January
2000 to October 2005, the items of machinery present on site and,
on that basis, the machinery rates for each month during this
period.!28 He explained that these rates had been calculated by the
Contractor from actual rates charged by equipment lessors, the
Employer, the Road and Maintenance Department, the Employer,
Subcontractors as well as actual rates “that the Contractor has paid
in other countries since he could not timely remove his own
equipment from Kyrgyzstan” and the “value of similar equipment”
calculated “proportionately”.129

Mr Kennedy concluded that the rates in these tables “were the rates
in common use in Kyrgyzstan between all the relevant players in the
market and were the costs the Contractor was actually charged for
hired P&M or which he received for his own P&M”.1!30

Prompted by comments in Mr Taft’s report, Mr Kennedy made
corrections in the monthly machinery costs.!3! The revised

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 67 of 177

numbers were used by Mr Kennedy in his final quantification of the
prolongation costs.132

Mr Taft questioned the Contractor’s and Mr _ Kennedy’s
quantification of the machinery costs on a number of grounds. One
of these grounds concerns the “bottom-up” approach of Mr Taft who
takes the position that “compensability must start with the actual
individual delays (number of days in individual situations /locations)
and what resources were specifically caused to be on the Project
longer. If any P&M was forced to be standing idle waiting for work it
could become a time-related resource and a valid part of this
claim.”!33 According to this position “P&M is only valid as part of a
prolongation claim if it is shown to be time-related and impacted by
the specific delay forming the subject of this claim”.!54

The Tribunal has rejected this position. For the reason explained,
the Tribunal is of the view that all of the P&M on site during the
delay period must be considered, whether at that particular point in
time a particular item of equipment, is idle in the workshop or
working.

Mr Taft also took a different approach to the quantification of the
machinery cost: Mr Taft accepts the rates in the tables used by Mr
Kennedy; but he describes them as “market rates”. In order to
extract the actual costs of the Contractor, Mr Taft makes a number
of deductions. He concludes that, in his opinion, “the likely costs
will be between 40% and 90% of the ‘market rates’ so I have allowed
an average of 65% of the rates allowed in Entes’ claim for non-winter
periods”.135

Mr Taft’s reductions in part are based on the statement that in his
experience “the actual costs of plant owned by a contractor are less
than the equivalent costs of hiring such plant from external
suppliers”.156 He disagrees with Mr Kennedy’s assumption that
“external equipment hire rates are appropriate for plant owned by
the Contractor”. He points out in particular that hire rates must be
expected to include an element of profit and concludes that, using
hire rates as the basis for quantifying the Contractor’s costs and
applying them even to the Contractor’s own P&M would mean that
compensation would include a profit element. Referring to Clause
1.1(g) (i) GC Mr Taft points out that such a profit element may not
be included in calculations based on cost. Indeed, this provision
defines costs as follows:

«ee,

‘cost’ means all expenditure properly incurred or to be incurred,
whether on or off the Site, including overhead and other charges
properly allocable thereto but does not include any allowance for
profit.”

295. The Tribunal noted that the Engineer accepted the valuation of the
Contractor’s P&M cost and used the resulting rates in all cases for
which no Daywork rates were available.!37 Indeed, the Engineer was
best placed to verify the Contractor’s statement that these rates
reflected the market conditions in Kyrgyzstan. The Tribunal has
considered Mr Taft’s objections to the use of these rates, in
particular his opinion that the Contractor’s “likely cost will be
between 40% and 90% of the ‘market rates”. This opinion has not
been substantiated by any evidence. In any event, even if Mr Taft’s
opinion were correct and the Contractor’s costs would be so much
cheaper than the market rates, he would suffer a substantial loss
from having to keep his P&M on site rather than renting it out. The
Tribunal therefore accepts the rates used by the Contractor and the
Claimant’s experts. However, it must make one exception.

296. Mr Taft rightly points out that the rates used by the Contractor,
being market rates, must include an element of overheads and
profit. With respect to the profit element, Mr Taft referred to Clause
1.1(g) (ij) GC which excludes profit from the definition of cost.
Insofar as the Contractor used rented equipment, the overheads and
profit of the lessor included in the rent are part of the Contractor’s
costs and must be compensated. The situation is different with
respect to the Contractor’s own P&M. Using market rates for
compensating the Contractor for his P&M costs would allow the
contractor to recover the overhead and profit element in these rates.
The Tribunal therefore decides that, to the extent the Contractor
used his own P&M, a deduction must be made to exclude any profit
margin which may be included in the leased or market rates.

297. Concerning the overhead element in the market rates, the Claimant
seeks, as a separate item in the quantification of the prolongation
costs, compensation for general overheads. The Tribunal has
considered this item of the claim and found it admissible; it awards
it in a separate quantification.!5° To the extent to which leased or
market rates also include an item for general overheads, this item
too, must be excluded when quantifying the Contractor’s own P&M
so as to avoid double compensation.

The Tribunal, therefore, must determine the relative value of the
P&M owned by the Contractor and the allowance for overheads and
profit included in the leased or market rates.

Concerning the Contractor’s own P&M, the evidence produced
shows that some of the P&M on which the quantification is based
was owned by the Contractor and some was leased. This is
evidenced by a large number of contracts and other documents
attached to the Statement at Completion showing the rental and
other details of the P&M on site.!89 The Engineer had at his
disposal a “List of Machinery on Site according to Monthly Reports”
and a “Schedule (II) Major Items of Construction Plan submitted
with Bid wherein year of manufacture, new of leased, owned or
leased, and estimated CIF value are included”.!4° On the basis of
the available documentation, the Engineer produced Table 3 of his
Determination, which indicates for some items but by far not all,
either “owned” or “leased”.!4!_ Mr Kennedy’s first report contains
tables showing on a monthly basis the items of machinery on site,
identifying these items by type, value, number of items per type and
distinguishing between “Entes” and Rental”.!42. There is therefore
contemporary evidence which would have allowed the Parties and
their experts to identify the proportion of leased and owned P&M.

Mr Taft, as mentioned above, insists on the difference between
“externally hired plant” and “plant owned by the Contractor”.!43 He
opines that the market and external hire rates include a margin for
overheads and profit for the plant hire company in the “region of
10%”.144 Mr Taft then states:

“Given the 10% for profit that I consider should be excluded from
‘market rates’, without further details from Entes, in my opinion
the likely costs will be between 40% and 90% of the ‘market rates’
so I have allowed an average of 65% (i.e. a deduction of 35%) of
the rates allowed in Entes’ claim for non-winter periods”. 145

The evidence produced would have allowed Mr Taft to identify the
items of P&M owned by the Contractor, to which the exclusion of
10% had to be applied. The detailed tables produced by Mr
Kennedy would have permitted to identify these items one by one
and calculate their value.!4¢ He has not done so. The percentages

of “the likely costs” are unsubstantiated and obviously lead to a
deduction exceeding that for overheads and profit.

In the absence of any other information provided by Mr Taft, the
Parties and the other experts, the Tribunal must fix the proportion
of the Contractor’s owned P&M. It does so on the basis of Mr
Kennedy’s corrected “List of Machinery on Site according to Monthly
Reports”, attached to his last report. This List shows over the period
from January 2000 to April 2004 a total of items/month of 15’784 of
which 13’368 are identified as “Entes” and 2’419 as “Rental”. The
proportion of owned items of Machinery is therefore 84.7%. The
Tribunal accepts that this proportion, calculated on the basis of
items of equipment, also represents the proportion in the value of
the equipment.

It follows that 84.7% of the P&M for which the Contractor claims
prolongations costs were owned by the Contractor; their valuation at
market or rental rates includes overheads and profit which must be
excluded.

Mr Taft estimated the margin for “overhead and profit for the plant
hire company” was “in the region of 10”.!47 This estimate remained
uncontested. In particular Mr Kennedy defends the use of rates
applied by the Contractor by opining that they are “in common use
in Kyrgyzstan”;!48 but he does not respond to Mr Taft’s argument
that market rates include a profit element which is excluded under
the Contract.

The total value of P&M in the Contractor’s claim, as quantified in Mr
Kennedy’s latest table, is US$ 37’°527’009.149 According to the above
determination 84.7% thereof are the Contractor’s own P&M, i.e.
US$31’785’377; this amount contains US$3’178’538 for overhead
and profit, corresponding over the total of the 27108 days on average
to US$1’508 per day.

In quantifying the P&M component of the prolongation costs, the
Tribunal therefore relied on the P&M rates in the Statement at
Completion, as corrected by Mr Kennedy and applied by him in his
Final Report and deducted from these rates US$1’508 per day.

8.4.3 General Expenditures /Preliminaries

The Contractor’s claim for delay costs, as presented in the
Statement at Completion, included an item described as “General

47 Taft IIL, paragraph 3.1.4.
48 Joint Expert Report, p. 2.
4° Kennedy IV

68

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 71 of 177

Expenditures” in a total amount of US$ 4’499’851.03 and “Financial
Costs” in a total of US$449959.04. The Engineer used a different
approach in his Determination to the quantification of these costs.
He quantified compensable delays on the basis of Daywork rates
and stated that General Expenditures and Financial Costs were
“included as overheads in Daywork Rate”.15°

308. In support of the claim in the Statement of Claim, Mr Kennedy dealt
with these cost items under the heading of General Expenditures,
but also used the term Preliminaries. He produced tables!5! in
which the “Kyrgyzstan Site General Expenditures” were presented
on a monthly basis from January 2000 to December 2005,
distinguishing between:

Toktogul Site Direct General Expenditures;
Toktogul Site Indirect General Expenditures;
Karakul Site Indirect General Expenditures; and
Bishkek Office Direct General Expenditures.

309. He explained that the costs in these tables were taken from the
Contractor’s audited accounts. !52

310. Mr Taft objected that he had not been able to verify whether the
claimed costs had actually been incurred.!53 He questioned Mr
Kennedy’s terminology in particular with respect to the distinction
between “site direct” and “site indirect”.154 Mr Taft also required
that the claimed preliminaries had to be allocated to sections of the
Project affected by the compensable event;!55 and that the costs
were properly allocated to the different cost categories. 15°

311. Concerning the evidence for the costs, print outs of the supporting
documents were provided to Mr Taft as he confirmed in his final
report:

“With regards to general expenditure, I received a copy of a
printout of Entes’ Project Accounts at the Hearing and I have had
the headings translated from Turkish to English so that I could
check the monthly totals for “indirect” and “Direct” expenses. Iam
now in a position to confirm that the monthly totals in Mr
Kennedy’s Report for General Expenditures (his Appendix A1/ 17)
are the correct totals from Entes’ Accounts printout. ”!57

312. Mr Taft did, however, raise doubts as to the allocation of cost to
different categories. In particular, he pointed out that he was not
able “to see ‘behind’ these accounts to determine what is precisely
included and how the currency has been converted”.15§ He
confirmed that he had been able to see “the individual monthly costs
for each sub-category of General Expenses”. He did not agree “that
all the sub-items claimed were in fact time-related site overhead
expenses that should form part of a claim for prolongation costs.”!59
In order to develop this objection, Mr Taft analysed the different
General Expenses cost items and determined those which he
accepted as time related and thus eligible for a claim as
compensation costs and those items with respect to which he
contested, fully or in part, that they were time-related.1©° He
presented the results of this exercise in Appendices B1 and B2 of
his Final Report in the form of a spread sheet which shows the
rating, between O and 100%, and the resulting cost difference
between the amounts claimed as General Expenses. Appendix B1
shows a difference between the amount claimed and Mr Taft’s
assessment of 35.1%.

313. For many of the items so identified as not time-related nothing or
only insignificant amounts are claimedI. They can be disregarded
for the decision of the Tribunal. The items for which the difference
between the claim and Mr Taft’s assessment is significant are:

e Machine Repairs/Maintenance 50% allowed by Mr Taft;

e Transportation 50% allowed by Mr Taft;

e Transportation of workers 50% allowed by Mr Taft;
and

e Food 50% allowed by Mr Taft.

314. Mr Taft explained his choice with respect to these items that

“... for transportation and food, I have assessed these to be 50%
time-related site overheads because the transport could be of
plant, materials or workers (not just site supervision staff) in
which case these costs could vary as a function of volume of
volume of work not simply time. On food, the costs seem to be
very high and could therefore be for workers as well as site
supervision staff; therefore these costs cold also vary as a
function of work volume rather than time only.”!°!

315. Mr Kennedy replied:

“In principle I agree with Mr Taft’s approach. However, Mr Taft
has reduced the machine repairs and maintenance to 50%. I
believe these machines within the General Items are for
Engineers’ cars, buses, etc. and as such are in my view 100%
time related. Similarly transportation is in my view entirely time
related. Hospitability and entertainment are other items I
regularly allow as time related since only those costs incurred in
the overrun period are claimed as ongoing expenditures
necessitated by the prolongation of the project.” 16?

316. Mr Kennedy explained with respect to terminology and classification
of cost items that the allocation “with Turkish contractors does not
necessarily follow protocols which Mr Taft has experienced
previously”; he provided a table that showed the allocation applied
in the present case. 163

317. The Tribunal notes that it is not contested that the Site General
Expenditures must be included in the costs of compensable delay:
the Engineer included them by using Daywork Rates; the Parties’
experts, having rejected the quantification on the basis of Daywork
Rates, accept as a matter of principle that they must be included in
the compensable costs. The Tribunal shares this view; these costs
are typical of the costs which a contractor must bear when the
works are delayed. The questions that remain concern the exact
amount of these costs and the classification as General
Expenditures.

318. The Tribunal has rejected Mr Taft’s position according to which
delay costs can only be compensated if a link is shown to the
specific compensable delay event. Since the delay affected the
completion of the entire project, all costs of delay must be included
in the quantification of the costs caused by compensable delay.
This also applies to the General Expenditures. The allocation of
these expenditures to certain parts of the works, as attempted by Mr
Taft, therefore is not relevant for determining the General
Expenditures during a given period of compensable delay.

319. With respect to the classification of the various items of costs, the
Tribunal noted that differences may exist as to the category in which
a certain cost item should be recorded. What is relevant are the
criteria for the decision which the Tribunal has to make. In this
respect, the decisive question is whether a particular item of cost
incurred during a period of compensable delay falls into a category
of costs which the Contractor had to support as a result to the
delay. The objections which Mr Taft had raised in this respect may

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 74 of 177

have their origin, at least in part, in his bottom-up approach. In
that approach, it may be of importance whether a certain cost item
relates to a specific activity which is delayed. In the case of a
general delay of the project as a whole, this allocation loses its
importance. In such a situation it is immaterial whether the costs
for food concern site supervision staff or productive workers, or
both. The two categories of personnel are affected by the delay and
the costs for both must be compensated. The question whether this
is done as part of General Expenditures or as part of personnel
costs is, at best, of secondary importance.

In view of these considerations, the Tribunal accepts the
quantification of the General Expenditures as contained in Mr
Kennedy’s Final Report.

8.4.4 General or Head Office Overheads

The Claimant seeks, as part of the claim for EOT No 5, payment of
an amount of US$ 2’6267138.40 for its Head Office Overhead.
Details of this claim were presented in Mr Kennedy’s First Report.
Mr Kennedy listed but did not quantify a number of cost items of a
general nature that he considered in addition to the “directly
incurred costs of delay”’.!6+ He also stated that he had taken from
the audited accounts the percentage of head office overheads for the
years 2000 to 2005 and indicated them as follows:

2000 5.00 %;
2001 4.32%;
2002 5.71%;
2003 10.37%;
2004 2.81%; and
2005 5.78%.

He calculated the average rate over this period as 5.66%.!® In his
second report, Mr Kennedy provided a table showing the amounts of
various items of overhead costs for each of the six years.1®° He also
corrected the value for 2004, increasing it from 2.81% to 7.34%, 167
This increase brought the average rate to 6.42%,!©8 adding that this
percentage was his “experience of such matters what I would expect
within the industry”.!©9

Mr Kennedy also provided a list of 25 “tenders returned or declined
by the Contractor during the Years from 2003 to 2005”, implying
that, if its resources had not been tied up in Kyrgyzstan on the
present Project, the Claimant could have concluded other contracts
which would have made contributions to the company’s overheads
and thus preserved an overhead rate at the level of the average just
mentioned. With his second report, Mr Kennedy provided a list of
21 projects showing details concerning each of the projects,
including their value, ranging from US$10 million to US$250
million.!7°

In order to calculate the amount of overhead contribution to which,
in his opinion, the Claimant is entitled, Mr Kennedy relied on Mr
Wiseman’s determination concerning the responsibility of the overall
time extension of 1’043 days which the Engineer had granted.
According to Mr Wiseman, 808 days thereof were the responsibility
of the Employer, of which 672 days for delays in the five EOT claims
and 136 for winter shutdown periods; an additional period of 136
days were allocated to delay attributed to joint responsibility.17!

On the basis of these assumptions Mr Kennedy calculated the loss
of overhead contribution by using the Emden formula, a method
recommended by a reputed English publication.!72_ According to
this formula the daily general overhead cost is obtained by dividing
the contract sum (US$41’768’448) by the contract period (1’965
days) and multiplied by the overhead percentage determined.!73 On
this basis Mr Kennedy applied a daily rate of US$2’517.87.174

The principle that general overhead costs may be claimed and that
they may be calculated by using the Emden formula is not really
contested. Mr Taft’s objections concern essentially the failing
evidence for (i) the Claimant’s overhead costs during the years in
question!75 and for (ii) the “missed tenders”.!76 Relying on the
amount of overhead costs in 2004 prior to the correction of this
value by Mr Kennedy, Mr Taft opines that the percentage for this
year would be more representative and proposes a value of 2.39%.,
leading to a daily rate of US$937.33.177

Mr Taft also raises the “potential duplication of costs between
prolongation costs and the Claimant’s head office overheads

claim”!78 and questions whether, in the absence of the delays for
which extensions were granted, the Contractor would have finished
in time.!79 Finally, Mr Taft points out that the period must be
determined which “might have caused a lost contribution to Entes’
overheads”; he objects to the manner in which Mr Kennedy treated
non-compensable periods and periods of joint responsibility.18°

The Tribunal has examined the costs listed in the table presented by
Mr Kennedy with his second report. Subject to the possible
duplication, which shall be considered below, it is uncontested that
these costs can be taken as general overheads. The Tribunal has no
reason to question Mr Kennedy’s statement that the costs in that
table were taken from the Claimant’s audited accounts. On this
basis the average rate for the Claimant’s general overheads during
the relevant period would be 6.42%, corresponding to US$2’517.87
per day.!8! In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers this daily
rate as adequately documented and proven.

Concerning Mr Taft’s argument about possible overlap, the Tribunal
noted that indeed there are a number of items which appear both in
the table showing the Claimant’s general overheads for the years
2000 to 2005 and in the project specific General Expenditures or
Preliminaries. Mr Taft listed the cost items which he considered
relevant as follows:

Portage and transportation;

Maintenance and repair of machines inventory stock;
Vehicles fuel expenses;

Vehicles maintenance repair expenses; and

Vehicles depreciation. !82

These items appear with the same or very similar descriptions both
in the table with the General Overheads!8? and in the Direct General
Expenditures.!84 The Tribunal has not seen a satisfactory answer
from Mr Kennedy to the argument of possible overlap. It accepts,
therefore, that a substantial part of the listed items in the General
Overheads are duplicative of the costs which are taken into account
under the heading of General Expenditures. Therefore, the Tribunal
makes a deduction from the General Overheads rate which it
accepted above in principle.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 77 of 177

331. In the list presented as Attachment 9 to Mr Kennedy’s Reply Report,
the value for the cost items listed compared to the Contractor’s total
overheads during the years 2000 to 2005 varies between around 5
and 8 %. Assuming that a major part of these items are already
included in the project General Expenditures, the Tribunal reduces
the daily rate for General Overheads from US$2’517.87 to US$2’350
which corresponds to an overhead rate of some 6%.

332. Mr Taft explained:

“For the purposes of this assessment I cannot reach a firm
position on the quantum of the head office overheads on the basis
of the information provided. In my opinion, whilst it is possible
that Entes overheads could be as high as 5 — 6% I know of many
contractors which are able to operate at much lower levels of
overhead in the region of 2 — 3 %.”!85

333. Mr Kennedy commented the rate of 2.39% proposed by Mr Taft by
stating:

“I have never in my long experience of successful international
contractors seen Head Office overheads at a level of 2.39% as
suggested by Mr Taft. Anywhere from 5% to 10% is what I have
encountered and this fluctuates depending upon international and
domestic economies, etc. Therefor, 6.42% would in my view be
within the compass of my expectations. ”!8®

334. It follows that the overhead rate of about 6% accepted by the
Tribunal is within the range considered by both experts.

335. As to Mr Taft’s objection concerning the “missed contracts” or
“missed tenders”, the Tribunal notes that the matter is speculative
by its very nature. A claim for lost contribution is based on the
assumption that, in the absence of the delay, the contractor would
have been able to use its resources for work on other projects. In
the ordinary course of business, where a contractor regularly
achieves general overhead rates in a given ratio, this assumption
may be taken as supported, without there being a need for
establishing proof for contracts that would have been concluded in
the absence of the delay on the project in question. The Tribunal
therefore accepts the assumption made with respect to “missed
contracts”.

336. In view of these considerations, the Tribunal accepts for General or
Head Office Overheads the daily rate of US$2’350.

75

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 78 of 177

337. The Claimant and Mr Kennedy apply this rate to the full period of
excusable delay of 17043 days, allowing only for the possibility of a
deduction of 50% with respect to the period of “delay of joint
responsibility”.!87 The Tribunal is of the view that general overheads
are part of the Contractor’s prolongation costs. The Claimant is
entitled to be paid for such costs only to the extent to which it
demonstrates entitlement to compensation. It follows that general
overhead costs are allowed only for days of delay which the Tribunal
finds to be compensable.

8.4.5 Prolongation costs in cases where the delay is caused by
variations

338. As explained above,!88 prolongation costs due to additional works
are compensable. The difference between the Parties and their
experts concerns the manner in which these costs are compensated.

339. In the claim for prolongation costs, as presented in the Statement at
Completion, the Contractor quantified the claimed costs globally for
the entire period of prolongation beyond the original contract period.
In other words, during the initial phase the Contractor did not
address specifically the quantification of each of the causes for delay
on which he relied.

340. An analysis of the different causes for delay identifying the number
of days attributable to each of the causes was first introduced by the
Engineer in his Determination. In Table 2 attached to this
determination, the Engineer identified for each EOT claim the
causes for delay which he considered and attributed to each of them
a number of days, distinguishing between compensable and non-
compensable. Delay attributed to variations was classified as non-
compensable; the Engineer stated that “varied works do not qualify
for time related financial compensation”. The Engineer explained
that the Contractor is compensated for the varied work by the
contractual rates and prices. If he seeks additional compensation,
the Contractor must give notice under Clause 6.4 and Clause 52.2
GCC “of his intention to vary a rate or price”. The Engineer added:

“... where an increased amount of work justifies an extension of
time, the Engineer has to consider whether the increased amount
has rendered the Contract rate inapplicable. The nature of the
work does not have to change, but if the overheads during the
extended period exceed the overheads covered by the additional

'87 Joint Expert Report, p. 6.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 79 of 177

volume of work, the rate for the work is no longer applicable and
should be adjusted. ”!89

341. This position of the Engineer is contested by the Claimant. It raises
two issues: first, have the contractual notice requirements been
respected and, if not, what are the consequences; and second, if the
Contractor is entitled to claim compensation, does the compensation
take the form of a modified or new rate for the varied work or is it
calculated in the same manner as the compensation for
prolongation costs on other grounds.

342. Concerning the first of these issues, the notice requirement, Clause
6.4 GCC concerns claims for delay resulting from the Engineer’s
failure or inability to issue in due time “any drawing or instruction”.
This is not the issue here, where the effect of variations on the
duration of the works is the basis of the claim.

343. Clause 52.2 GCC, the other provision on which the Engineer relied,
concerns the rates to be applied to varied work. The second
paragraph of this clause requires the Contractor to give notice “of
his intention to claim extra payment or a varied rate or price”.
However, this requirement applies in the context of the valuation of
varied work on the basis of contractual rates or prices or their
modification. The passage states expressly that “no varied work ...
shall be valued under Sub-Clause 52.1 or under this Sub-Clause
unless” the specified notice requirement is met. However, the claim
which the Contractor is making here does not concern the valuation
of the variations at contractual or other rates. It concerns the
question whether the variation caused delay and whether this delay
entitles the Contractor to compensation of the resulting costs. The
claim for prolongation costs is of a nature different from that
concerning the valuation of the variation itself. The notice
requirements in this respect are those of claims in general, as they
have been considered above. The claims for prolongation costs
caused by variations are not precluded by Sub-Clause 52.2 and are
admissible, subject to the condition that can be verified by
contemporary records.

344. The second objection of the Engineer concerns the valuation of the
claims for the Contractor’s prolongation costs. The Engineer’s
position rests on the assumption that the Contractor is fully
compensated for a variation by the application of the contractual
rates and prices and possibly modified or newly fixed rates and
prices. This is clearly wrong. The rates and prices are fixed for the
actual performance of the works, including variations. Site
overheads are paid for under a separate bill, named “General items”.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 80 of 177

At the hearing the question was discussed whether the
quantification of the variations included an amount for these
general items. At the end of this discussion, all experts agreed that
the quantification included “only the work items” and not the
General Items.19°

In other words, the rates and prices which were applied for the
valuation of the variations did not include any payment for site
overheads and general overheads. When a variation causes delay
which prolongs the contract period, the Contractor has to bear
additional costs for site overheads and general overheads. These
costs are not included in the rates and prices; indeed, it would be
quite irrational to do so, because the prolongation costs do not
depend on the work itself but on the time of its performance.
Depending on the time when the variation is performed, no delay at
all may be caused and hence no prolongation costs.

The Engineer seems to have understood the issue at least in part.
In the quoted passage, he recognises that the timing of the
performance may affect the “overheads during the extended period”;
but he seemed to have believed that the consequences can be settled
simply by adjusting the rate, which obviously is not the case.

Mr Taft recognises that the prolongation caused by variations does
cause additional costs but, in one of the alternatives which he
considers, he is of the opinion that the prolongation caused by
variations should be treated differently from all other prolongations.
While such other prolongations should be assessed on the basis of
costs, the valuation of prolongation caused by variations should be
based on Clause 52 “which refers to the Contract BQ”.!9! He refers
to “General Items (Preliminaries) set out in the Contract BQ” and to
“rates for certain types of plant/machinery and labour”. By
reference to Bill 01 General Provisions, Mr Taft assigned to each
item a percentage to reflect the extent to which he considered it time
related. In this manner he reduced the total of US$5’620’568.79 of
this bill to US$3’636’225.61 and divided this reduced amount by the
original contract period of 1’065 days, producing a daily rate of
US$3’414.30. Mr Taft used this rate for an alternative
quantification of the prolongation costs for additional works in EOT
3 and EOT 5.192

However, as a principal method of valuation, for these prolongation
costs based on variations, Mr Taft did not use the rate derived from
the BQ. Instead he used the monthly costs during the period
indicated as relevant by Mr Marshall, according to the method

78

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 81 of 177

discussed above. This method required that specifically P&M costs
be shown to be “time related and impacted by the specific delays
forming the subject of this claim”,!9° an approach which the
Tribunal has rejected. On this basis, Mr Taft reached a daily rate
higher than that derived from the BOQ and which he indicated as
US$4’967.67 for EOT 3 and a rate varying between US$1’520.13
and US$2’664.99 for EOT 5.194

349. Mr Kennedy treats the prolongation costs caused by variations in
the same manner as any other prolongation cost, except that he
makes an allowance described as “abatement”. For this purpose Mr
Kennedy considers that, in the cases where the prolongation was
caused by additional works, the Contractor used productively the
resources engaged in these additional works and was paid for them
under the Contract. Mr Kennedy looks “at any value earned by P&M
in the relevant period(s)”, noting the Contractor was paid for this
additional work at contract rates. He sees, in this payment,
remuneration for the use of P&M which otherwise would have been
idle during the critical delay periods.

350. In order to calculate the “abatement”, Mr Kennedy considers the
total value of variations ordered and paid, identifying the P&M part
in this amount and removing purely time related costs, Mr Kennedy
calculated a daily rate of US$831 which he deducted from the P&M
costs to make allowance for the value earned during the
prolongation period through the payment for the variations.1!95

351. The Tribunal finds that prolongation caused by variations causes
costs which are not covered by the rates and prices used for the
valuation of the variations themselves. This has been established
clearly at the hearing, as just pointed out. These costs do not
consist simply in the prolongation of the General Items, as the
alternative quantification of Mr Taft assumes. They include in
particular the cost for P&M which must remain for a longer period
on site to produce the same work for the same remuneration.
Therefore, the Tribunal does not accept, as explained above, the
position of Mr Taft that the prolongation costs should be limited to
the specific section of the work directly affected. All of the costs
during the relevant prolongation period must be considered.
However, allowance must be made for the compensation which the
Contractor received through the payments for the variation. The
Tribunal accepts therefore that, as a matter of principle, the
allowance for the compensation earned through the variation

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 82 of 177

payments (the “abatement”, as described by Mr Kennedy) must be
made.

352. As to the quantum of the abatement, the Respondent’s experts have
contested the principle by relying on the “bottom up” method, but
not specifically the calculation presented by Mr Kennedy. The
Tribunal, therefore, accepts the approach to the quantification of the
“abatement” by Mr Kennedy,!9° subject to some modifications. Mr
Kennedy identified the total of Additional Works executed and paid
under the Contract at US$2’496’064. He assumes that 45% of this
amount is the P&M component of these payments for additional
works. He deducts an amount for the part of P&M which was
“purely time related and not capable of earning any value (such as
engineer’s cars, workers transport, generators, etc.), which the
experts agree at 22.6% of the P&M”. He divides the resulting
amount by 1043, the number of days in the extended period. The
result is the amount which, according to Mr Kennedy, the
Contractor earned on average per day by the contractual payments
for the additional work.

353. While accepting, in principle, Mr Kennedy’s calculation, the Tribunal
does not see the justification of considering only the P&M value: the
costs which Mr Kennedy and the Tribunal use for quantifying the
prolongation costs are not limited to the Contractor’s P&M costs,
they also include “Actual Prelims”, “Personnel (Turkish)” and
“Personnel (Local)”. While the “Prelims”, entitled also “General
Provisions”, are a separate lump sum item in the BOQ, which is not
paid through the rates and prices for the work actually performed,
the personnel costs were remunerated by the payments for the
additional work. Therefore the Tribunal takes account not only of
the P&M value paid through the additional works but also the
personnel value.

354. The total costs of the Contractor, as recorded in Mr Kennedy’s
corrected table is US$58’660’497. “Actual Prelims” (US$10’119’259)
form 17.25% of this total. The remaining 82.75%, consisting of
P&M and Turkish and local Personnel, represent the part of the
Contractor’s costs for which he earned revenue through the
payments for additional work. It is this percentage which must be
applied to the actual revenue from additional work (US$2’496’064),
producing the sum of US$2’065’493. The Tribunal sees no
justification for deducting from this sum another 22.6% for P&M not
earning value. The calculated amount is the total revenue earned
by the Contractor for the resources on site during periods of critical
delay and for which prolongation costs are claimed.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 83 of 177

The Tribunal therefore bases the calculation of the “abatement” on
the total amount of US$2’065’493 and divides it by 1'043, the
number of days in the extended period, producing an average daily
abatement of US$1’980 to be applied to those daily costs for which
compensation is awarded as prolongation costs attributed to delay
due to additional work.

8.4.6 Summary: the Tribunal’s approach to quantifying the
prolongation costs

For the reasons set out in the preceding sections, the Tribunal
examines the claim for prolongation costs by reference to each EOT
and the grounds for time extension accepted by the Engineer in
each of them. It determines for each of the grounds which the
Engineer classified as non-compensable, whether this classification
is justified or must be changed to compensable.

For each of the delay periods which the Engineer had classified as
compensable or for which the Tribunal reached this conclusion, the
prolongation costs are then determined by reference to the
Contractor’s costs during the relevant period, quantified as
described above. In this respect, the Tribunal takes as starting
point the position of the Parties’ experts as recorded in the Joint
Expert Report, as subsequently corrected in the case of Mr Kennedy,
considering also any relevant subsequent corrections, the Parties’
Post-Hearing Briefs as well as the Parties’ other submissions and
expert reports.

8.5 Costs related to EOT 1

8.5.1 The claim, its components and evolution

The Claimant seeks prolongation costs with respect to its Extension
of Time Claim No 1 for three causes of delay considered by the
Engineer in its Determination:

e US$ 1'638’173.83 (alternatively 1’477’293.55) for 50 days of
Design Delay;

e US$ 1'049’697.00 (alternatively 947'590.71) for 33 days of
Additional Works Delay; and

e US$ 3’111’729.88 for 107 days of Winter Break.197

The Claimant makes allowance separately for the amount certified
by the Engineer and paid by the Employer which included
compensation for 50 days of Design Delay in an amount not
specified for this cause of delay.

The Respondent denies that the Claimant is entitled to any
additional payment.!% In the Rejoinder the Respondent also argued
that it had no obligation to provide any design to the Claimant.!99

The claim was first presented in the “Interim Extension of Time
Claim” of 25 July 2002 in which the Contractor sought an extension
of time by 469 days, reserving its “right to submit financial claims
related to the delays caused to the completion of the project due to
reasons beyond his control”. The causes of the delay on which the
Contractor relied were:

e Changes in designs, requirements to do design and produce
drawings and lack of design information which has caused
delays to the completion of Works;

e Changes in Alignment and other Works which resulted in
increase in the quantities of Works and thus caused the delays
due to additional works instructed to the Contractor;

e Unforeseeable crisis in the supply of petroleum products;

e Exceptionally adverse climatic conditions; and

e Serious delays in payments to the Contractor against his
approved Monthly Payment Certificates.20°

Following correspondence and meetings, the Engineer, in its
decision of 17 September 2002, granted 83 days, of which 50 days

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 85 of 177

for design delays and 33 days for delay due to additional works. In
this decision, the Engineer reported that the “methodology of
determination was explained to the Contractor and the Employer in
meetings of 16/09/02 and on 17/09/02 held in JOC office in
Bishkek. In the absence of a logical clarification by the Contractor
as to why the Engineer determination of the EOT should be varied,
the Engineer confirms his determination of the Contractor’s
entitlement of EOT for the Interim Claim to be 83 days”.201

363. The Contractor sought compensation for the delay presented in EOT
1 as part of the Costs due to Extension of time included in the
Statement at Completion. In his Determination of 18 May 2005, the
Engineer:

¢ granted 50 days of compensable delay due to « design delay ».?”
Since the quantum of the compensation was stated only for the
total of the compensable delay, the amount certified by the
Engineer for this specific period cannot be determined with
precision. It can be estimated at some US$4007000;7 and

e 33 days and 107 days as excusable but non-compensable for
Additional Works and Winter Break, respectively.”™

364. Table 2 at the Engineer’s Determination also includes 29 days as
“Excusable Delay” for “adverse climatic conditions”, but does not
allocate these days to the compensable or non-compensable delay.
The experts agree that this “appears to be an erroneous entry”.”” In

any event, no claim is made with respect to these 29 days.

365. The Claimant accepts the duration of the delay attributed to each of
the three causes for which the Engineer granted an extension of
time and the number of days accepted by the Engineer. The dispute
therefore concerns (i) the costs attributed to the 50 days of
compensable “design delay and the entitlement to and the quantum
of the compensation for (ii) 33 days for additional works and (iii) 107
days for Winter Break.

8.5.2 The 50 days of design delay

366. In the EOT 1 claim, the Contractor relied on “changes in design,
requirement to do design and produce drawings and lack of design
information which has caused delays to the completion of Works”
and quantified this delay as 174 days.2°© Contrary to the
Respondent’s argument, design information had to be provided by

the Employer through the Engineer.2°7 The Engineer did not contest
that such an obligation existed and accepted that delay occurred.
He quantified it “taking 21 days as average expected duration for a
single case of approval”. On this basis, he quantified the delay
caused by the design related issues at 50 days.208

In his Determination, the Engineer accepted that this delay was
compensable. The Engineer explained:

“There were numerous design changes during this period, which
affected the progress of work and made the Contractor to suffer
additional cost due to delays in approval.”2°9

The Engineer’s decision was not contested by the Employer. In this
respect the decision it has become binding. Objections to the
compensability of this period of delay raised by the Respondent in
the arbitration?!° are in contradiction with this clear statement of
the Engineer which remained uncontested at the time. In any event,
the Respondent quotes the Report of its own experts stating that “Mr
Marshall holds that the Engineer made a right decision in specifying
50 days as a compensable delay”.?!!

The Experts agree both with the number of days and with the
conclusion that the delay is compensable.?!2 The Tribunal confirms
this conclusion and finds that the design delay is compensable.

The remaining difference concerns the valuation of the costs caused.
by this delay.

The Engineer did not value specifically the 50 days in EOT 1; the
experts were unable to determine the costs allowed by the Engineer
for this period.2!3 Based on the Engineer’s overall valuation for the
entire period of 153 days of compensable delay, in the order of US$
1°16 million, the costs for the 50 days in EOT 1, as explained above,
proportionately are around US$400’000.

At the hearing the experts agreed that the correct valuation of the
costs resulting from the 50 days of delay is higher than this
amount;?!4 but the experts did not agree on the correct valuation.
In their post-hearing consultations and submissions, the experts

presented the following values: Mr Kennedy: US$ 1’477’293.55 and
Mr Taft US$431’585.64.215

373. In his final report of 18 January 2012, Mr Kennedy refers to Mr
Wiseman’s report of 19 December 2011 and increases the
quantification to US$1’638’173.83. In Addendum 1 of 20 January
2012 to Mr Taft’s Report, the quantification is reduced to US$
425’067.27. Based on the valuation of Mr Kennedy, the Claimant
seeks US$1’638'173.83; alternatively US$ 17477’293.55.216

374. Applying the method of quantification and the applicable values, the
Tribunal must first determine the reference period during which the
compensable delay occurred and which will have to be considered
for the quantification of the costs of this delay.

375. Mr Kennedy, the Claimant’s quantum expert, initially situated the
delay for EOT 1 at the time immediately after the contractual
completion date, i.e. from 3 December 2002 to 11 June 2003,?!7 as
identified in the Engineer’s Determination for EOT 1.218 This is the
period by reference to which the design delay claim is quantified by
him in the Joint Expert Report. Following this report, Mr Kennedy
reconsidered the reference period. Based on analysis in his earlier
reports, Mr Wiseman situated the period during which the design
driven delay occurred from 1 March to 15 December 2000 and
1 April to 31 May 2001.719 It is by reference to this modified period
that Mr Kennedy recalculated the delay costs: applying a daily rate
of US$32’763.48 to the 50 days of delay he reached a total of
US$17638'173.83.220

376. Mr Taft, relying on Mr Marshall’s calculations, took as reference a
period of 50 days from 1 March until 19 April 2000.22! By the
adjustments proposed in his Addendum, Mr Marshall sought to
correct some errors identified by him.?22

377. When determining the correct reference period, the Tribunal
considered that generally design must precede the construction so
that delay related to the design is likely to affect the Project at an
early phase. However, the design driven delay occurred over a
prolonged period. The reports of Mr Wiseman rely on a large
number of examples where design driven delay occurred during the

first year of the work and beyond.223 Indeed, the Engineer, when
considering this item of the claim, in the passage quoted above,
explained that there “were numerous design changes during this
period which affected the progress of work”; he also referred to
delays in approvals.224

378. Mr Marshall identified the delays which occurred to the “clause 14
programme” and identified substantial delays in different sub-
sections and considered sub-section 5 as the most relevant. With
respect to this sub-section he stated that the “design for the bulk of
the volume was not released until 22 September 2000”.225

379. All of this shows that, in the circumstances considered here, the
delay was not restricted to the initial period from 1 March to 19
April 2000, as assumed by the Respondent’s experts; it was spread
over a longer period. The only other quantification of this period is
that by Mr Wiseman, who concluded that the design delay affected
the project during the period starting 1 March to 15 December 2000
and 1 April to 31 May 2001. The Tribunal accepts this as the
reference period.

380. The Contractors costs during this period have been quantified by Mr
Kennedy on average at US$ 32’763.48 per day. The Tribunal has
accepted the basis for this quantification, except that the daily rate
of the P&M costs claimed by the Contractor must be reduced by
US$1’508. Therefore, the rate to which the Claimant is entitled for
the 50 days of design delay is US$31’255.48. The costs attributable
to the 50 days of compensable design driven delay therefore
amount to US$1’562’774.

8.5.3 The 33 days of delay due to additional works

 

381. The delays for which the Contractor claimed in EOT 1 included
“Changes in Alignment and other Works which resulted increase
[sic] in the quantities of Works and thus caused the delays due to
additional works instructed to the Contractor”.22© In its decision of
17 September 2002 the Engineer took position as follows:

“The claim for delay due to additional works by the Contractor
comprised 195 days for earthworks and 100 days for
bridgeworks. The Engineer determined that these two events to be
not located on a single critical path. The Engineer assessed the
Contractor’s entitlement for the additional earthworks to be 33

days, taking into account of quantities of works agreed during
contract negotiations ...”227

382. In the Statement at Completion the Contractor referred to the delays
relied on in the EOTs and the extension of the completion date to
claim the prolongation costs.228 The Engineer denied the claim,
classifying the 33 days of extension as non-compensable.

383. The Tribunal has found that delays caused by additional works are
compensable.?29

384. With respect to the quantification, Mr Kennedy identifies the
reference period as from March 2000 to June 20012°° and calculates
the average daily costs during this period as US$32’640. After
deducting US$831 as “abatement”,23! a daily rate of US$31’809 was
reached. On that basis, Mr Kennedy calculates the claim at
US$1'049’697. Mr Taft does not provide any quantification of this
claim, stating that he understands the claim “to be agreed as not
compensable at the start of the Hearing on 19 October 2011”.252
The Tribunal is not aware of any such agreement, which would have
been contrary to the Experts Consultation Table which shows the
claim as being compensable. The Claimant continued to pursue the
claim in its Post Hearing Brief and the Respondent did not rely on
an agreement to treat the delay as non-compensable. The Tribunal
proceeds with the quantification of this claim.

385. For the reasons explained above when considering the quantification
of the claim for prolongation costs, the Tribunal accepts Mr
Kennedy’s quantification, subject to (i) the reduction of the P&M
costs to exclude overheads and profit with respect to the
Contractor’s own P&M and (ii) in cases where the claim concerns
additional work, an abatement of US$ US$1’980, instead of US$831,
as quantified by Mr Kennedy. On this basis, the Tribunal reduces
the daily rate calculated by Mr Kennedy by US$1’508 and US$ 17149
to US$ 297152. The costs attributable to the 33 days of
compensable delay attributed to additional work therefore amounts
to US$ 9627016.

386. The total amount awarded in relation to EOT 1 is US$2’524’790.

8.6 Costs relating to EOT 2

387. The Claimant seeks prolongation costs with respect to its Extension
of Time Claim No 2 for 61 days of Additional Works delay in an
amount of US$2’150’380.54 (alternatively US$1’210’889.65).233 The
Respondent denies the Claim, relying on the Engineer’s decision.?54

388. In EOT claim No 2 of 20 March 2003, the Contractor listed a
number of causes to which the delay was attributed and claimed an
overall extension of time. These causes included “Additional Works
(Variations & New Design)” and “Additional Work (Landslides)”;
these claims (described as “additional works and quantities”) were
quantified as 61 days. The claim stated expressly that the
Contractor “also reserves his rights to submit financial claims
related to the delays caused to the completion of the project due to
reasons beyond his control”.295

389. The total number of days claimed under EOT 2 varies in the
documents produced: at one page the total is indicated as 144 days,
at another page the claims add up to 148 days. In a letter of 26
March 2003, responding to queries of the Engineer of 11 March
2003, the Contractor identifies the duration claimed for each of the
causes relied on in EOT 2 as follows:

e 63 days attributed to “the Employer’s failure to relocate the
utilities”;

e 61 days attributed to “additional works instructed to the
Contractor”;

e 17 days attributed to “the approval of epoxy material”; and

e 11 days attributed to “exceptionally adverse weather conditions”.

390. These numbers, adding up to 152 days, are confirmed in a
subsequent letter of 8 April 2003. However, the number of days
claimed for additional works is consistently 61 days.236

391. It appears that in 28 April 2003, the Contractor terminated the
Contract. The following negotiations were concluded on 15 May
2003 by the conclusion of Addendum No 1 to the Contract which

Contract, and also taking into consideration the delays in the
commencement of Works in relevant actions, hereby accepts:

a) To grant to the Contractor the 152 days of EOT requested
under EOT No. 2.

b) To revise the relevant articles in Appendix to Bid of the

Contract, regarding the Article 47.1 as follows ...”

The remaining provisions of this Addendum concern payment and
related matters.

Shortly thereafter and “further to Addendum No 1”, on 23 May
2003, the Parties concluded Addendum No 2 which contains the
following provisions:

“Bearing in mind the good will of the Contractor and the
successful completion of the Project, the Contractor agrees not to
claim any compensation for the cost incurred by him during the
negotiations period and the works suspension periods which is
between 17/05/2003 - 23/05/2003.

The Contractor shall not claim any additional extension of time for
adverse climatic conditions that may take place during the 152
days granted by the Employer subject to the employer giving his
decision by 224 of June 2003 for the land slides that happened
throughout the project.

The Contractor has agreed to revoke the notification of termination
of his employment under the conditions of Contract dated 28 April
2003. The above notification has become invalid upon singing of
this Addendum #2.”

As in the case of other EOT claims, the Contractor included this
time extension in the claim for prolongation costs presented as part
of the Statement at Completion. In his Determination, the Engineer
addressed this claim together with EOT 3 and stated the following:

“EOT 2 and EOT 3 were not granted by the Engineer following
contractual procedures. These were granted as part of
negotiations between the two contracted parties as part of
Addenda to Contract. The Engineer witnessed these Addenda,
however, he was not a negotiating party.

The Engineer determines to award zero compensable days
against EOT 2 for the following reasons:

Relocation of utilities 63 days

89

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 92 of 177

EOT No 2 for 152 days was granted by the Employer as part of
Addendum No 1 to Contract. This does not mean that such time is
compensable. The Engineer always maintained that the
Contractor’s claim was not reasonable and the delays due to
relocation of utilities did not lie on the critical path of the
Contractor’s activities and hence did not impact on the
Contractor’s resources utilisation. ...”237

395. A similar explanation is given with respect to the 17 days attributed
to the late approval of epoxy material. In this respect, the Engineer
stated that he “always maintained that the Contractor’s claim was
not reasonable and the delay due to epoxy was the Contractor’s
fault”.238 There are no explanations with respect to the other causes
to which the Contractor had attributed the delay, in particular the
61 days claimed for additional works are not discussed.
Nevertheless, Table 2, in which the Engineer recorded his
conclusions about the extension of time, records all 152 days of
extension, as quantified above, including 61 days for additional
works; 7 days for Work suspension by the Contractor are added,
bringing the total to 159 days.

396. The Claimant argues that the 61 days recorded as additional work
must be compensable on the grounds which have been considered
above and which the Tribunal has accepted. However, this
extension is not the result of an assessment by the Engineer and
therefore cannot be taken at face value. The fact that the Employer
agreed to an extension of time which was calculated by reference to
a claim that included this period, in itself is not conclusive. The
agreement on this extension was reached as a settlement covering a
number of contested issues and may not be taken ipso facto as an
acceptance by the Employer that the Contractor suffered 61 days
critical delay due to additional works.

397. It is true that in the Addendum, the Contractor renounced only to
specifically identified claims; the prolongation costs related to EOT 2
were not included. One may conclude from this fact that in
Addendum No 1 the Contractor did not renounce the claims for
financial compensation which he reserved when submitting EOT 2.
While this may have kept alive any claims for compensation which
the Contractor may have had, it does not suffice to establish that
during the time indicated and for the reasons alleged by the
Claimant, the Contractor suffered 61 days of critical delay. In the
absence of any assessment by the Engineer, the Claimant would
have to establish in this arbitration the reality of the delay and its
criticality.

90

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 93 of 177

398. The Tribunal has examined the evidence produced by the Claimant
in this respect and was unable to conclude that 61 days of critical
delay occurred due to additional works. Mr Wiseman, the
Claimant’s delay expert himself was unable to provide this evidence.
He refers to “the undisputed period of 61 days”;289 but, in the
circumstances, this is not the required evidence: the 61 days are
part of the background of a settlement to which the Employer
agreed but there is no agreement establishing that they constitute
critical delay. And it is only if it were established that 61 days
critical delay were caused by additional works that the Tribunal
could consider awarding the related prolongation costs. In this
respect, Mr Wiseman stated candidly:

“Neither the Contractor’s Interim Claim No 2, nor the Engineer’s
responses contain sufficient details on which I could base a
review of cause and effect. In the absence of such details, I have
only undertaken a limited review of the facts available upon
which I provide a conditional opinion. I invite the tribunal to
consider whether or not a more detailed review is required of
these matters and await further instructions on this matter.”24°

399. It is obviously not for the Tribunal to give instructions to Mr
Wiseman how to conduct his analysis. What becomes clear from
this report of the Claimant’s expert is that the evidence available to
him is insufficient to establish that during the EOT 2 period, 61
days of critical delay occurred due to the additional works on which
the Claimant relies. The Tribunal takes this as the demonstration
that this claim cannot be “verified by contemporary records”, as
required by Clause 53.5 GC and has not been established.

400. The claim for prolongation costs based on EOT 2 is rejected.
8.7 Costs relating to EOT 3

8.7.1 The claim and its history

401. The Claimant seeks prolongation costs with respect to its Extension
of Time Claim No 3 for four causes of delay:

¢ US$491’898.11 (alternatively US$310’224.81) for 15 days delay
attributed to the relocation of utilities;

° US$ 5’010’393.30 (alternatively US$3’148'622.40 or
US$3’275’357.25) for 165 days delay attributed to additional
works;

¢ US$2’805132.47 for 119 days delay attributed to Winter Breaks;
and

¢ US$1’091’895.53 (alternatively US$1’385’670.81) for 35 or 67
days delay attributed to Lost Days.™"!

402. The Claimant makes allowance for the compensation certified by the
Engineer and paid by the Employer for costs of 15 days of delay
attributed to the relocation of utilities at an amount below that
claimed.

403. The Respondent relies on the Engineer’s decision and denies that
any payment beyond the amount certified and paid is due.?42

404. EOT 3 claim was presented to the Engineer with copy to the
Employer on 31 October 2003. The claim covers the period from 1
April to 15 October 2003 and a subsequent Winter Period. The
causes of delay and their quantification were presented as follows:

e 41 working days attributed to “Lost ‘Working Days”;

150 working days attributed to Design issues-instructions
(Section 9 and others);

15 working days attributed to “Relocation of utilities in the
vicinity of road”; and

180 working days attributed to “Additional Works”.

405. The claim document added:

“The Contractor accepts that the above delays have run
concurrently. Therefore the net effect of above delays is 180
working days.”

406. The Contractor expressly reserved “his right to submit financial
claims related to the delays caused to the completion of the project
due to reasons beyond his control”.”*

407. One and a half months after the filing of this claim, on 15 December
2003, the Parties concluded Addenda No 3 and No 4 to the Contract.
The former regulated a number of payment issues and matters
concerning the “Winter Maintenance Period”. In Addendum No 4,
the Parties recorded the desire of the Employer to add various
“safety-related and structural works” and the Contractor’s proposal
concerning the performance of these works, as they were set out in a
list attached to the Addendum entitled “Proposed Essential Works”.

92

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 95 of 177

The Addendum sets out the terms for the performance of these
works and contains the following provision:

“6. The Employer agrees and grants an Extension of Time of
180 days against the Contractor’s EOT Claim No 3 for the
completion of the Project. The Contractor shall not only complete
the items in the original scope of works but also complete the
‘PROPOSED ESSENTIAL WORKS” within the times stated above;
however the Contractor will try to complete all the Works as soon
as possible.”

408. No mention is made of the financial consequences of the extension
of time granted; but clause 10 of the addendum provides that “all
other terms and conditions in the original Contract and Addendum
Nos 1, 2 and 3 to the Contract already signed between the Employer
and the Contractor shall remain effective and unchanged”.

409. The financial costs related to the EOT 3 claim were claimed in the
Statement at Completion. The Engineer’s Determination contains
the sentence quoted above according to which “EOT 2 and EOT 3
were not granted by the Engineer following contractual procedures”
but in the Addenda.?44 However, contrary to what he did with
respect to EOT 2, where he declared two of the claim items as “not
reasonable”, he took position with respect to at least one item of the
EOT 3 claim: he accepted 15 days delay attributed to Relocation of
utilities as compensable. With respect to the remainder of the delay
claimed in EOT 3, 165 days for Additional works, the Engineer
classified them in Table 2 as excusable but non-compensable. He
did not explain whether this classification was reached because of
the Engineer’s belief that the prolongation costs of additional works,
in principle, are paid through the rates and prices in the Contract or
whether he was of the view that delay was not critical and therefore,
as a matter of principle, did not justify and compensation of
prolongation costs. Table 2 also classified as non-compensable 119
day for the winter break from 5 December 2003 to 2 April 2004, and
67 days as “Lost days (rested on Sundays and public holidays
during the claim period of EOT 1 to EOT 4)”.

410. At the hearing, the experts considered the Engineer’s decision
concerning the 180 days of excusable delay, allocating 15 days of
compensable delay to the relocation of utilities and 165 days to
additional works. Mr Wiseman opined that, in his belief, “the
engineer has made the 165 and 15 fit the 180”.245 In other words,
“take the 180 days which are agreed and allocate them to these two

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 96 of 177

causes”.246 This may well be the case. The Tribunal therefore
considers these two items of the claim together.

8.7.2 The 180 days attributable to Addendum No 4

EOT 4 claim was for a number of causes; but the Contractor
recognised their concurrency and claimed only for a total of 180
days. This claim was accepted in full by Addendum No 4.

The Tribunal considered first whether Addendum No 4, when
granting the 180 extension requested by the Contractor in EOT 3,
settled the consequences of this delay in their entirety or whether
the prolongation costs remained still open. The Contractor had
reserved the prolongation costs when making the EOT claim. These
costs and the reservation of the cost claim are not mentioned in the
addendum. Mr Ozkoseoglu testified that during the negotiations
relating to the EOTs, “the subject of compensability was never
raised”.247 The text of Addendum No 3 and the passages quoted
above show that, when the Parties wished to exclude claims, they
did so expressly. A particularly important consideration relates to
the Engineer’s decision to classify one component of this claim as
“compensable”, including the cost of 15 days of delay attributed to
relocation of utilities in the amount certified and paid by the
Engineer. This certification and payment are clear evidence against
the assumption that all claims relating to EOT 3 had been finally
settled by Addendum No 4. The Claimant nevertheless must
establish entitlement and quantum.

Contrary to EOT claims 1, 4 and 5, the extensions granted pursuant
to EOT claims 2 and 3 were not made on the basis of the Engineer’s
determination but by agreement of the Parties. As explained in the
context of the claim for EOT claim 2, the Tribunal therefore does not
take the time shown in the Engineer’s Table 2 as establishing in a
conclusive manner that, with respect to these two claims, the
Contractor suffered critical delay during the periods indicated in
that table. Criticality and cause remain to be established.

When considering the Engineer’s position concerning EOT 3 one
notes two substantial differences in comparison with EOT 2: first,
the Engineer did not make any reservation as to the reasonableness
of the Contractor’s claim. Second, the Engineer classified 15 days
as compensable and included this in his overall valuation; in other
words it treated this period as part of the critical delay which the
Contractor suffered. With respect to this decision, the Engineer

94

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 97 of 177

cannot rely on Addendum No 4 as an agreement by the Parties. It is
his own decision; the Parties had not considered this matter.

415. Since the Engineer made a decision about part of the EOT 3 claim, it
would seem likely that he also examined the remaining 165 days of
this claim. The absence of any doubts expressed by the Engineer
may be an indication that he considered this delay as critical. The
experts have examined the evidence produced and concluded that
these days related to the delay in 2003 caused by the design issues
which were resolved by Addendum No 1 of 15 May 2001 and No 2 of
23 May 2003. Prior to this addendum, the Contractor had
performed some of the design which the Employer had to provide.
Addenda No 1 and No 2 provided payment for this design and
awarded additional payment for further design work which the
Contractor accepted to perform. Mr Wiseman explained at the
hearing:

“The delay arises within 2003 specifically as a result of the
design delays which arise from addendum 1, which covers the
additional design work that the Claimant was required to assist
with developing the design?*® for both road alignment and slope
stabilisation ...”

416. In his final report, Mr Wiseman specified the period as being
situated between 17 April and 15 October 2003.“° Mr Marshall
accepted that the delay was

“a design delay in 2003 of an unknown period which occurred
between, I think, 1 April and December 2003”.25°

417. He confirmed it shortly thereafter:

“The 165 that the engineer was compensable /recte: non-
compensable], that was design delay. The 15 days was utility
delay.”251

418. After the hearing, Mr Marshall confirmed that this had been his
opinion but he “retracted” it “as the evidence points the other way”.
He then attributed the delay to “additional/varied work”. The
evidence he relies on is the fact that the Engineer treated the delay
as non-compensable. This is because, according to the Engineer,
delay caused by varied work are non-compensable and delay
resulting from design delay was compensable.252

95

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 98 of 177

419. Mr Wiseman accepts the full period of 165 days as critical.253 Mr
Marshall finds it probable that the additional works affecting the
earthworks progress (which he considers to be the cause for the
delay) “would have caused some critical delay”.25+ Mr Taft opines
that the “Additional Works delay of 165 days identified as not
compensable by the Engineer has been reviewed by Mr Marshall and
is considered to have impacted section 9 and is therefore to have
been critical to Section B and probably to the Project.”255

420. The Tribunal has considered these opinions which coincide
inasmuch as they at least prove that some critical delay occurred in
2003. It has also considered that, following the agreement settling
the difference about the design issues, the Contractor had to provide
additional design work which preceded the related construction and
present this design work in EOT 3 as one of the principal causes for
the delay. The Tribunal is satisfied that this delay was critical and
in the order of 165 days. It does not consider the explanation which
Mr Marshall gave for his change of mind to be convincing. It may
well be that, when in December 2003 the Parties, and in May 2006
the Engineer, considered the delay and accepted a total of 180 days
and, as far as the Engineer is concerned, 165 days of “additional
works”, some delay attributable to the additional works was also
taken into account. Since there is no indication that a detailed
delay analysis was performed, the Tribunal is not concerned by the
apparent lack of precision in the terminology and the attribution by
the Parties.

421. The Tribunal concludes that 165 days of critical delay occurred in
2003 due to the delay in design as described in EOT 3 and therefore
attributable to the Employer. Indeed, the experts of both Parties
accept that this delay is compensable.

422. With respect to the 15 days attributed to Relocation of utilities, the
Tribunal considered the description in the EOT claim document:

“Under the Conditions of Contract including the Minutes of
Negotiations the Employer is responsible for the relocation of all
utilities in the vicinity of the working area. However, during the
course of the Works between the Claimant Period, the Contractor
suffered additional delays due to the late relocation/ dismantling
of the supports at Km 407+000. ...”

423. This explanation has not been contested. It demonstrates that the
cause clearly concerns the failure of the Employer to make the site

°55 Taft IIL, p. 18, reference omitted.

96

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 99 of 177

available without obstacles for the Contractor. The resulting critical
delay is attributable to the Employer and the related costs must be
quantified accordingly.

424. Mr Taft quantifies costs of the 15 days delay by reference to the
period from 1 April to 15 October 2003.25 On the basis of
contemporaneous correspondence between the Contractor and the
Engineer, Mr Wiseman situates the delay between 2 and 16 April
2003.257 Mr Kennedy quantifies this delay at an average daily cost
of US$32’793.21, producing a total of US$491’898.11. For the
reasons explained above, the Tribunal accepts this quantification,
subject to the deduction of US$1’508 for the element of overhead
and profit in the rates used by Mr Kennedy and which must be
extracted with respect to the Contractor’s own P&M. Consequently,
the daily rate is reduced to US$31’285.21, producing for the 15 days
a total of US$469’278.15. The claim for the prolongation costs
attributed to the Relocation of utilities is awarded at
US$469°278.15.

425. As to the 165 days of delay described by the Engineer as Additional
Works, Mr Taft situates them in the period from 1 April to 15
October 2003.258 Mr Wiseman situates them in the period from 17
April to 15 October 2003.259 Mr Kennedy quantifies the costs of this
delay at the daily rate of US$31’197.02 and deducts US$831 per day
as “abatement” in the quantification of delay attributed to
variations. The Tribunal has attributed these costs to design delay
and therefore does not make this deduction; instead it deducts
US$1’508 with respect to overheads and profit in the rates for the
Contractor’s own P&M. The rate applied therefore is US$ 29°689.02
and the total for the 165 days is US$ 4’898’688.30.

426. The total amount of prolongation costs attributable to the 180 days
related to Addendum No 4 is US$5’367’966.45. The claim for the
Winter Break and the Lost Days in relation to EOT 3 will be
considered separately below.

¢ US$1’779°678.30 (alternatively US$1’410’095.19) for 94 days of
delay, attributed to the late issuing of the order to commence the
slope stabilisation work; and

e US$1’347°950.00 for 92 days of Winter Break.

428. The Claimant makes allowance for 75 days compensable delay
attributed by the Engineer in his Determination to “Late issuance of
commencement order for slope stabilisation works”.

429. The Respondent “upholds the Decision of the Engineer in respect of
delays within EOT 4”; the Engineer having included 75 days of
compensable delay in his Determination. The Respondent also
relies on Mr Marshall’s opinion and states that the 75 days “cannot
be the reason which influenced on completion of works”.26°

430. In EOT 4 of 8 September 2004, the Contractor had claimed a total of
368 working days of delay attributed to the following reasons:

e 102 working days attributed to late processing of Addendum No
4;

220 working days attributed to “late instructions of the Engineer
to proceed with the works required to be carried out as per
Addendum No 4’;

169 working days attributed to additional works instructed
under Addendum No 4;

83 working days attributed to the “Employer’s failure to resolve
issues related to Slope Stability Works;

e 25 working days attributed to late approval of materials; and

e 119 working days attributed to “Bitumen Supplies”.

431. Recognising that these delays “have run concurrently”, the
Contractor claimed 368 as the “net effect” of the delays.?®!

432. In its letter of 27 December 2004, the Engineer accepted 94 days for
the claim which the Contractor had attributed to “delays caused due
to late instructions of the Engineer to proceed with the works
required to be carried out as per Addendum No 4”. In the table
summarising the decision the Engineer specified that he reached the
number 94 by “adding 12 lost days to 82”.262 The Engineer justified
this decision as follows:

“The commencement order was issued for VO 14 ‘Slope
stabilisation works’ and VO 23 ‘Access Roads’ on June 16 and
May 6, 2004 respectively. Since the JBIC’s approval was given on

March 26, 2004, the work could have been commenced
immediately thereafter. The Contractor lost days during these
periods due to delay of the Employer’s consent to the issuance of
commencement order by the Engineer.

The Contractor suffered delay for VO 14 for 82 days (converted to
94 calendar days based on the site report.)

The delay of VO 23 occurred concurrently with VO 14 and is
absorbed in the said 82 days. So, the delay of VO 23 is not
counted, ”263

Later in the letter, the Engineer specified that “82 days of EOT given
for VO14 spans over the months of April, May and June 2004”; but
he continued that he “determined to grant 94 calendar days for their
claim period from December 16, 2003 to August 12, 2004”.264

In concluding the letter, the Engineer confirmed “that days shall be
counted on calendar days basis and the Contractor is instructed to
submit their claim on calendar day basis from now on in accordance

with the conditions of the Contract”.””

In the Statement at Completion, the claim for prolongation costs
was referred to EOT 4 and covered the entire period exceeding the
original completion date.

The Engineer fixed in his Determination a total of 186 days of
excusable delay with respect to EOT 4, attributing 94 days to “Late
issuance of commencement order for slope stabilisation works” and
92 days to “Winter break (15/12/04 to 16/03/05)”; the former
category included the 75 days of compensable delay mentioned
already. The latter claim will be considered separately below in the
context of the claim for the Winter Breaks.

8.8.2 Assessment of the claim concerning the late
commencement order for slope stabilisation

Mr Asman explained in his witness statement that there were
certain locations of the road where the designed slope inclinations
were not safe and caused landslides. Mr Asman’s testimony
continues by stating that despite the Contractor’s warning and
proposals,

263 Exhibit C-11, p. 2.
26 Exhibit C-11, p. 3.
265 Exhibit C-11, p. 4.

99

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 102 of 177

“... the Engineer did not accept these and insisted on steep
slopes, with less earthworks quantities. But in the end, after all
landslides, they decided to stabilise some of the dangerous
slopes. After long discussions and exchanged letters, the
Employer was persuaded to approve these additional works and
these were included as additional works to the project scope
under Variation order No. 14 as part of Addendum No. 4.
Employer’s long approval process caused serious delays to the
works. Decisions on the details of the slope stabilisation work i.e.
locations and slope inclinations, took also long time and caused
further delays to the works. ”266

438. The Engineer accepted that the delay caused by these events was
excusable and, in his Determination, he also accepted that 75 days
were compensable. Neither the Contractor nor the Employer
objected to this decision within the contractual period which thus
has become binding. The dispute concerns the quantification of the
compensation for this period and the compensability of the
remaining 19 days.

439. As explained above, by its letter of 27 December 2004, in response
to the EOT 4 claim, the Engineer had awarded 94 days, of which 82
days were for delay caused to the implementation of VO 14
concerning slope stabilisation and 12 days for “lost days”. The
duration of 82 days was calculated by reference to the period from
26 March to 16 June 2014, i.e. between the Engineer’s approval and
the commencement order given by the Employer. In the
Determination, the Engineer confirmed the number of 94 days of
excusable delay but allocated these days differently: (i) he reduced
the time due to the Employer’s delay in issuing the commencement
order from 82 to 75 and (ii) he modified the 12 “lost days” to 19 days
allocated to the Winter Break.

440. In the Determination, the Engineer recorded the relevant Winter
Break as lasting from 5 December 2003 to 2 April 2004.26” This is
uncontested. It explains the reduction of the number of days of
compensable delay from 82 to 75: in his letter of 27 December 2004
the Engineer wrote that approval by the Engineer had been given on
26 March 2004 and that “the work could have commenced
immediately thereafter”. However, 26 March 2004 was still in the
Winter Break. Work could have started only at the end of this break
on 2 April 2004. Therefore the Contractor lost only 75 days as a
result of the delay in the commencement order.

441. The 7 days difference between 82 and 75 days are absorbed in the
Winter Break and thus should not be considered separately.

442. The remaining 12 days cannot be allocated to the delay in the
commencement order because, in the Engineer’s calculation, this
delay lasted from 26 March to 2 April 2004, i.e. 82 days. This
period must be deemed to be “lost days”, as the Engineer had
explained in his letter of 27 December 2004.

443. Consequently, the delay is allocated to the following causes:

e 75 days to the delay in the commencement order;

e 7 days absorbed in the period of the Winter Break and need not
be considered further; and

e 12 days to be treated as “lost days”.

444. According to the Engineer’s calculation, the 75 days compensable
delay occurred during the period starting 2 April 2004, the end of
the Winter Break, to 16 June 2004, the commencement order.
According to Mr Kennedy’s table attached to his Final Report, the
monthly costs in April, May and June amount to US$1’722’880.268
The daily rate is therefore US$ 18932.75. Allowing for the
Contractor’s own P&M, it must be reduced by US$1’508 to
US$17’424.75. Applied to the 75 days of compensable delay, the
amount awarded is US$1’306’856.25.

445. The claims for the 12 days treated as Lost Days shall be considered
separately below.

447. The Claimant makes allowance for the payment certified and
received for 13 days delay attributed to design revisions.

448. The Respondent denies the claim, contesting that no additional
payment is due.

449. In his EOT 5 claim of 23 June 2005,?°9 the Contractor sought time
extension by a total of 287 “working days”. He attributed the delay
to the following causes, accepting that the delays had run
concurrently:

e 52 days attributed to Lost Working Days;

100 days attributed to “additional works instructed”;

19 days attributed to “delays due to revisions and obstructions
related to the Works”;

230 days attributed to “delays incurred due to Bitumen
Supplies”; and

66 days attributed to “Suspension of Works for reasons related to
Clause 20.4 of the Conditions of Contract”.27°

450. Here, as in the other EOT claims, the Contractor expressly “reserved
his right to submit financial claims”.*”

451. In his response of 13 July 2005, the Engineer awarded an extension
for a total of 128 days, composed of:

e 21 days for Lost Working Days;
e 76 days for additional works;

e 13 days for Design Revision;

e 7 days for Political Unrest; and

¢ 11 days for Unavailability of Bitumen.””

452. Following the Contractor’s Statement at Completion, the Engineer
fixed in his Determination the same number of days as excusable
delay, except for the “Lost days (rested on Sundays & public
holidays and adverse climatic days after the claim period of EOT 4)”
for which the Engineer granted 35 days, compared to the earlier
award of 21 days. The Engineer treated all of these delays as non-
compensable, except the 13 days for design revision which he
considered compensable.

8.9.2 Compensability

The Engineer had determined that 13 days are compensable as
“Design Revision”. Neither the Contractor nor the Employer gave
notice of arbitration against this aspect of the decision which thus
has become final and binding, according to Clause 67.1 GC. The
quantification of the claim will be considered below.

With respect to the 76 days for additional works, the Engineer
decided that they were excusable but not compensable.

The Employer did not give notice of arbitration against this
determination. The Claimant gave notice against it but, during the
arbitration, accepted the determination of the duration of the delay
attributable to additional works. The issue that remains to be
decided in this respect is whether this period of delay is
compensable and, if so, in what amount.

In the Determination, the Engineer decided that no compensation
had to be paid for delay attributable to additional works (he used
the term “varied works”), since (i) the Contractor did not give timely
notice and (ii) he was compensated through the rates paid for the
additional work performed. This is also the position adopted by the
Respondent.?73 The Tribunal has considered this position and, for
the reasons explained above, concluded that delay attributable to
additional work is compensable, but that in the quantification of the
related prolongation costs, allowance must be made for the payment
received by the Contractor. This decision applies here, too. It did,
however, give rise to a debate about the extent of the compensable
delay which shall be discussed below in the context of the
quantification of this claim.

In support of the claim for the costs of 7 days delay attributed to
“political unrest in 2005”, the Contractor in EOT 5 referred to the
“Event that occurred in the Country of the Employer and its related
affects [sic], including the Suspension of Works related to Clause
20.4 of the Conditions of Contract” and claimed 66 days of
extension.274 In the Statement of Claim, the Claimant explained
that the “Event” referred to the “Tulip Revolution” in the spring of
2005.275 Mr Asman described the situation in his witness
statement:

“27. After the first round of parliament elections were held on
27% February 2005, the opposition started to complain of
widespread violations.

28. On 1st March, we heard that some hundreds of protestors
occupied Dzalal Abad Oblast Governorship building. One of them
was allocated as the Governor of the oblast. Karakul, where our
main camp and majority of the plants and equipments were
located is a city of Dzalal Abad Oblast. On 14% March, one day
after second round of elections in Toktogul, protestors blocked the
traffic on Bishkek-Osh Road. Our only connection to Bishkek for
supply purposes was cut. Due to the violence in Dzalal Abad, we
were unable to provide diesel as well. KGB Chief of Karakul said
that we as expatriates were in danger and in order to protect us
better, he instructed me to get all Turkish personnel to stay at
camp instead of their rented apartments and not to get out after
6.00 p.m. until the situation normalises. ...

29. The protestors in Osh and Dzalal Abad started their route to
Bishkek on 224 March, and Karakul was on their way. Some of
our personnel were very concerned and they were asking me why
we were waiting but not go to Bishkek and fly to Turkey. I knew
that the target of the protestors was Bishkek and to stay in
Karakul with a low profile would be better than going to Bishkek
to leave the country. We did so. The protesters passed through
Karakul in busses and cars....

30. Situation was unsafe for a long time all along the country.
On 13 of April, some of our staff coming from Bishkek to Karakul
was threatened by protestors who clocked the road at Torken (km
301) and our staff had to turn back to Toktogul office. That week,
some unknown protestors cut the electrical cables feeding our
batching plant and stole the cables.

31. We started our activities on 5 May as the situation got
relatively normal.”276

14 April 2005, the Contractor informed the Engineer that:

Km. 298 and Km.299 by a crowed [sic] of over 150 protesting locals
and were threatened and denied through passage, as a result our
staff returned back to Toktogul Site office.”?7”

459. In his response of 13 July 2005 to the Contractor’s EOT 5 claim of

23 June 2005, the Engineer understood what was meant by the
“Event” and wrote:

“The Contractor claimed 66 days (gross claim days) delay caused
to him having to suspend his works due to allegedly unfavourable
security conditions prevailed from 01/03/2005 to 05/05/2005.
Based on the Engineer’s assessment of information made
available by the Contractor and information collected by the
Engineer from other sources, the engineer determined that there
was no direct imposition of suspension on the Contractor’s
activities caused by the Political Unrest. However, we are aware
that the Contractor adopted a self imposed suspension of works.
We assess that it was probably justifiable for the Contractor to
suspend his activities from 22/03/2005 to 29/03/2005 as a
precautionary measure and perhaps for another week (i.e. until
05/04/2005) for confirmation of normalcy. We also have taken
into account an isolated incident of road blockage occurred within
Section A on 18/04/2005. However, there is no evidence of direct
causal impact on any construction activity.

Based on the above, we award 7 EOT days (out of 23 gross days
after filtering out days overlapped with days awarded for above
item 1 to 4,”278

In his Determination, the Engineer confirmed the award of 7 days
and classified them as non-compensable. The Contractor takes the
position that this delay is compensable and should be included in
the prolongations costs.

The Claimant relies on Clause 20.4 CPA.279 The Engineer did not
expressly mention this or any other contract provision when
granting the time extension and confirming it in the Determination.
However, from the circumstances, the only possible basis for the
Engineer’s decision is Clause 20.4 CPA in combination with Clause
65.5GCC. The Respondent does not contest that the events on
which the Contractor relied indeed qualify as Employer’s risk, as
defined in Clause 20.4 CPA.

In these circumstances, and view of the written and oral evidence,
the Tribunal accepts that the 7 day critical delay described by the
Engineer as “political unrest” qualifies as Employer’s risk and is
therefore compensable.

The Respondent objects to compensation being awarded to the
Claimant and invokes the notice provision specific to Clause 65.5
GCC. The Respondent argues that the Contractor “did not indicate
any specific amount”.28° The relevant passage in Clause 65.5 GCC

provides that “the Contractor shall, as soon as any such cost comes
to his knowledge, forthwith notify the Engineer thereof”.

464. During the period the events occurred, in March and April 2005, the
Contractor wrote at repeated occasions to the Engineer, referring
specifically to “the event under Clause 20.4 of the Conditions of
Contract” and announcing his “intention to claim additional costs,
damages, losses ...”28! On 29 April 2005, the Contractor wrote
again under the reference to Clause 20.4 and informed the Engineer
of his “decision to re-commence the Site operation and Works with
effect from May, 05, 2005”. He announced a “claim for additional
costs under Clause 53.1 as soon as we complete the
quantification”.282 The costs for this, as for all other delays, were
claimed in the Statement at Completion, submitted on 17 March
2006.

465. Clause 65.5 GCC does not prescribe any specific period during
which the cost claimed under this provision must be quantified and
does not state that, after a certain period, the Contractor’s claim is
forfeited. The Tribunal notes that the causes for delay were
interlinked and that eventually the Contractor decided to quantify
the related costs in a combined manner. This was possible only
once the works were completed and was done as part of the
Statement at Completion. Since the Contractor had made it quite
clear from the time when the events occurred that it intended to
claim for the delay costs due to the case of an Employer’s risk, the
Tribunal accepts that the claim is not forfeited in application of the
notice provision in Clause 65.5 GCC. It admits the claim for
compensation.

466. Finally, the Engineer had awarded an extension of time of 11 days
for unavailability of bitumen. The Contractor considers this delay
as compensable. In EOT 5, the Contactor had claimed 230 days of
“delays incurred due to Bitumen Supplies”.283 In that claim, the
Contractor explained that he had faced “difficulties ... in receiving
the supplies of bitumen due to reasons beyond his control”.

467. The Engineer refused to grant any extension for difficulties in the
supply of bitumen as required for the original scope of work; delay
in this supply was the Contractor’s risk. However, the Engineer
accepted that the order for Essential Additional Work required 50
tons of additional bitumen, which was confirmed only in June 2004.
He “assigned 125 gross days from 13/08/2004 to 15/12/2004 for
supplying of the additional 50 tons of bitumen. After filtering out

days overlapped with awarded days for above items 1 to 5” he
awarded 11 days extension.284 The Claimant confirmed at the
hearing that it only claimed for the delay that occurred due to the
late availability of bitumen required for the additional works.285

The Claimant’s expert pointed out that the delay in the availability
of the additional bitumen is closely related to the delay attributed to
additional works in EOT 3 and to the slope stabilisation works in
EOT 4. He opined that, if the delays were counted in these claims,

“... this event relating to the unavailability of bitumen [falls] within
that period impacted by preceding events and thus does not
attract additional compensation over that already
compensated. ”286

The Claimant followed this position and stated the following:

“Accordingly, if the Tribunal decides that Claim 3 — Additional
Works (165 days) and Claim 4 - Late Issuance of commencement
order for Slope Stabilisation Works (75 days) are compensable for
11 days unavailability of bitumen this does not attract any
compensation....”287

The Claimant asks for compensation of these 11 days only if the 165
and 75 days are found not to be compensable.

The consequences of the additional works to which the bitumen
claim relates were claimed and decided under EOT 4. The Tribunal
has found that the delay for which the extension was granted is
compensable. It does not accept any further compensation for this
event. The Claimant’s withdrawal of the bitumen claim therefore is
fully justified. No compensation is granted for this part of the claim.

In conclusion, the Tribunal decides that on account of events
invoked in EOT 5, the following number of days are compensable:

e Design revision 13 days;

e Additional works 76 days;

e Political unrest in 2005 7 days; and
e¢ Unavailability of bitumen 0 days

The claim for Lost Working Days will be considered separately.

8.9.3 Quantification of 76 days for Additional Works

There was extensive debate at the hearing about the question of the
loss caused by the 76 days granted by the Engineer for additional
work. In his decision of 13 July 2005, the Engineer wrote in this
respect:

“4, Additional Works (reason 3 of the claim)

The Contractor claimed 100 days (gross claim days) delay caused
to him having to do additional works instructed during the claim
period EOT 5. After filtering out overlapped days with days
accounted in above items 1 to 3, 76 days are awarded.”88

In EOT 5, the Contractor had identified the additional work as
follows:

“1. Additional drainage works at 362+800 LHS hillside (cracked
areas), 66 days

2. Additional culvert at km 382-781, 22 days

3. Additional culvert at km 384+465, 12 days.”289

It is clear from the witness evidence and the analysis of the Experts
that this additional work was performed at Sections 5 and 6 during
the time between August and December 2004. By that time, the
work at these sections had been completed and the Contractor was
working on Sections 8 and 9.29° This is expressly confirmed by the
Claimant:

“... the delay was due to the additional drainage and culvert
works at section 5&6. At that time, in 2003, Section 5&6 were
taken over and the remaining work was at Sections 8&9.”?9!

As a matter of principle, work on sections that have been completed
and taken over is unlikely to cause prolongation costs. The
Respondent’s delay expert, Mr Marshall concluded:

“In conclusion, in my view whilst the 76 days extension of time
was probably ‘compensable’ contrary to what was stated by the
Engineer, I consider it very unlikely that any critical delay was
caused to completion of the Works.”?9?

The explanation regarding why work on a completed section caused
critical delay to the works was that, in order to perform the

additional work at the completed Sections 5 and 6, resources had to
be moved from Sections 8 and 9, perform the additional work there
and then return to their previous location, thus delaying the work in
the section where they should have been engaged. Mr Asman
explained the situation at the hearing:

8 Tr 359 — 361.

“MR ASMAN: ...although these two culverts, we see that only as
culvert works, but at these sections I remember that we have
completed all the pavement work. I mean, asphalt was paved
there and light planning, everything was there, including the road
signs, so they were finished but these culverts were instructed
after that. We needed to excavate the already paved roads and
construct these culverts. Because this road is under traffic, you
have to do it halfway. For example, you have to do the first right-
hand side, finish it, backfill it and then move to the left-hand side.
It takes some time, more than usual, since it is under traffic.

Also you have to pave this after the culvert is constructed. You
have to make sub-base, base and asphalt course, binder course
and bearing [recte: wearing?] course. We have to mobilise our
resources which were dealing with the works in section 8 and 9 to
execute these paving works, to pave the locations at these
culverts.

THE CHAIRMAN: What delay costs did you suffer which were not
covered by the rates and prices you were paid under the BOQ?

MR ASMAN: As these are completed sections [i.e. sections 5 and
6], there would be no delay there. Since there was a delay we are
talking about, 76 days, this delay must be related to the
outstanding works which were in sections 8 and 9 and that
totally must be compensable.

THE CHAIRMAN: How would the works at section 8 and 9 be
affected?

MR ASMAN: As I explained, we have to mobilise, we have to stop
at some parts our works where we were paving binder and
bearing [recte: wearing] also we were paving asphalt. We have to
come back to these locations and make asphalt over these
culverts. So, we had to stop some works going on in sections 8
and 9 and come back, mobilise our resources to these locations
and cover these pavements. This goes late to the outstanding
works because of the allocation of resources. ”?9

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 112 of 177

This explanation has not been contradicted by any witnesses or
documentary evidence. The Claimant confirms these explanations
in its Post-Hearing Brief?9+ and the Respondent does not contest it.
Mr Wiseman quotes extensively from the testimony at the hearing
and concludes that the 76 days of critical delay certified by the
Engineer occurred during the period starting 13 August to 17
December 2004.295 Mr Marshall states that the “minor works in
sub-sections 5 and 6 cannot possibly have delayed completion of the
works in sub-sections 8 and 9 which was almost exclusively
paving...”.29© He does not consider the testimony of Mr Asman. Mr
Marshall’s statement that paving works were ongoing in Sections 8
and 9 indeed confirms the case of the Claimant: moving the paving
machine and related equipment to Sections 5 and 6 must have
caused delay to the works in Sections 8 and 9 from where this
equipment was temporarily removed.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the critical delay, which the
Engineer quantified as 76 days, was caused to Sections 8 and 9 of
the works by the removal of the resources needed for the additional
work in Sections 5 and 6 of the road, which by that time had been
completed and were open to traffic.

With respect to the P&M that was removed temporarily from
sections 8 and 9 to Sections 5 and 6, the Contractor suffered loss
only during the time required for the moves. For the remainder,
these resources were employed productively in their new location
and remunerated accordingly. The loss occurred with respect to the
productive resources that were scheduled to work on Sections 8 and
9 and were not removed to work on Sections 5 and 6. Those
resources which depended for their work on the presence of the
removed P&M must have remained idle or at least underemployed
until the work could resume upon the return of the transferred
resources or they performed work for which the removed resources
were not necessary. These are the prolongation costs that must be
compensated.

The situation is basically the same as that considered above in the
context of the quantification of prolongation costs in cases of
variations: some of the resources affected by the critical delay are
not idle or underperforming but are employed productively. The
Tribunal has made allowance for this productive employment by
deducting what Mr Kennedy described as “abatement”. Mr Kennedy
calculated the amount of this abatement by reference to the total
amount paid to the Contractor for additional work and derived from
this total an average daily rate. Given the description which Mr

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 113 of 177

Asman made of the work that had to be performed in sections 5 and
6, the remuneration earned for the culvert and drainage work
considered here may have been above the daily “abatement” rate;
but this is in the nature of an average rate: in other claims, the
remuneration earned by the additional work may have been below
the abatement operated in the quantification of the claim. The
Tribunal, therefore, is satisfied that the specific situation of the
present claim is adequately taken into account by quantifying the
critical delay as the other claims for prolongation costs caused by
additional work.

483. Mr Wiseman situated the time during which this delay occurred in
the period from 13 August to 17 December 2004;797 the period
which the Contractor had identified in the EOT claim. Mr Taft
identified three shorter periods within this overall period. Since
Tribunal has not accepted the “bottom-up” method of Mr Taft, it
does not rely on the periods used by the latter and quantifies the
claim by reference to the periods indicated by Mr Wiseman. The
average costs during this period have been quantified by Mr
Kennedy at US$ 16’998.78. Applying the reduction for overhead
and profit in the Contractor’s own P&M (US$1’508) and the
“abatement” for revenue earned through the additional works as
quantified by the Tribunal (US$1’980), the daily rate of US$
13’510.78 is obtained, and for the 76 days of critical delay for
additional work the total of US$ 17026’819.28 is awarded.

8.9.4 Quantification of the Prolongation Costs relating to Design

Revision and Political Unrest

484. The Tribunal has decided that, in addition to the 76 days for
Additional Works, the Claimant is entitled compensation for
prolongation costs attributed to 13 days of delay attributed to
Design Revision and 7 days of delay attributed to Political Unrest.

485. The delay due to Design Revision occurred, according to Mr
Kennedy’s quantification during the period starting 25 September to
7 October 2004.98 Mr Taft situates 13 days within this period and,
adopting the analysis of Mr Marshall, 2 days in August of that
year.299 The Tribunal has not accepted the method of quantification
of Mr Taft. It bases the entire quantification on the period starting
25 September to 7 October 2004.

486. The average daily costs during this period, in the corrected
quantification of Mr Kennedy which the Tribunal accepts, are
US$16’255.45. Applying the reduction for overhead and profit in

the Contractor’s own P&M (US$1’508), the average monthly costs
relevant for this claim are US$14’747.45. Therefore, the Claimant is
entitled to US$191°716.85 as prolongation costs for 13 days
attributed to Design Revision.

487. The 7 days delay attributed to Political Unrest is situated by Mr
Kennedy from 22 to 29 March 2005, and by Mr Taft, from 3 to 5
April 2005. The Tribunal noted that the unrest continued from
March to April 2005. Therefore it based the quantification on the
costs during these two months, i.e. 424’636 + 498’270 = 922’906
producing an average daily cost of US$15’129.61. Reduced by the
deduction for overhead and profit in the Contractor’s own P&M, the
daily rate is 13’621.61. The compensation to which the Claimant is
entitled for the 7 days for Political Unrest therefore is US$
95’351.27.

488. The total amount awarded for prolongation costs related to EOT 5
is US$1’313°887.40.

8.10 Winter Breaks

489. The Claimant seeks compensation for the delay caused by three
Winter Breaks, i.e. the time during which the works had to be
suspended during the three additional winters after the contractual
completion date. The claims are quantified as follows:

e For the Winter Break from 15 December 2002 to 1 April 2003:
107 days at US$3’111’729.88;

e For the Winter Break from 5 December 2003 to 2 April 2004: 119
days at US$2’805132.47; and

e For the Winter Break from 15 December 2004 to 16 March 2005:
92 days at US$1’347950.

490. To this claim must be added 7 days from EOT 4 which the Tribunal
has classified as Winter Break above in Section 8.8.2.

491. The Respondent denies that any payment on this account is due.

8.10.1 Compensability of the Winter Breaks

492. The Minutes of Contract Negotiations with Entes Company of 3
August 1999,3°0 which form part of the Contract,°°! in paragraph 15
provide the following:

*® Contract Bundle and Exhibit R-13.
*! Form of Agreement, paragraph 2 (a).

“The Contractor will hand over the road to the Maintenance
Department for winter maintenance free of any obstacle that may
hamper normal traffic flow. The approximate period will be
between 15% December and 15% March each year. The
Contractor also agreed to provide two graders to help the
Maintenance Department during this mentioned period without
additional costs.”

493. It is undisputed that during the winter maintenance period the
Contractor had to suspend construction. In this respect, the
Claimant relies on Item 4 of the General Information which provided
that:

“Whilst maintenance responsibility for a road section rests with
the Employer the contractor will not be permitted to execute works
on that section. 30?

494. Mr Marshall opined that some work could have been performed
despite this suspension, a point which will be considered below in
the context of the quantification of the claim.

495. It is undisputed that this requirement of suspension of the work
during the winter maintenance period also applied during the three
years after the contractual completion date.

496. The Contractor argues that the three maintenance periods after
December 2002 are additional and that the costs during these
additional periods must be compensated. He writes:

“The original completion time was 3 December 2002 and the
Claimant was supposed to stay on site fort two WSP/WMP?°3’s.
Accordingly, when the Claimant prepared its price for the works,
it calculated the costs of the two WSP/WPM’s. Due to the
Employer’s acts and omissions, the Claimant stayed three
WSP/WMP’s more than planned. The contract prices/rates were
not changed, even the actual completion dates was three years
later than the original completion date. The Claimant prepared
his tender in 1999 on the basis that the work was to be completed
by December 2002. However, due to the delay caused by the
Respondent the actual completion date was October 2008.

The Claimant maintains that WSP are fully compensable. The
Claimant’s position can be summarised as follow, if excusable
delay brings the Claimant into the WSP, the Claimant is entitled to
the costs of the whole WSP.”3°4

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 116 of 177

497. The Claimant also relied on Clause 40 GCC305 which provides that,
upon instruction of the Engineer, the Contractor shall suspend the
progress of the works. Clause 40.2 provides that the Engineer shall
determine:

“(b) the amount, which shall be added to the Contract Price, in
respect of the cost incurred by the Contractor by reason of such
suspension...”

498. However, this provision does not apply in certain specified cases,
including when the suspension is “otherwise provided in the
Contract”.

499. The Respondent argues that the Winter Suspension Periods had
been provided in the Contract by the provision quoted above.
Referring to this provision, the Respondent wrote:

“Hence, when signing the Contract the Claimant understood and
agreed that it had to bear on its own the costs for each winter
period within the terms of validity of the Contract.”3°6

500. The Respondent relies on the provision of Clause 40.1 which
excludes compensation of suspension costs where the suspension is
provided in the Contract and refers to the quoted passage in the
Minutes of Contract Negotiations. It argues:

“... the Parties had agreed upon that the winter period ‘should be
between 15 December and 15 March of each year’.

The Contract does not indicate specific years which include
WSP/PTM. On the contrary, the Contract states that WSP/PTM
shall be between 15 December and 15 March of each year. Hence,
the period of each year during which the Contract is in effect is
concerned.

Thus, each suspension of works for a period of WSP/PTM
irrespective of whether it occurred during the initial term of the
Contract or during the extended terms of the Contract took place
under the Contract. Consequently, the provisions of Clause 40.2
of the Contract may not be applicable in this case. ”3°7

501. The Tribunal agrees with this statement of the Respondent insofar
as the requirement of winter maintenance applies to the entire
period of construction, even after the expiration of the contractual

period. It is therefore wrong for the Claimant to argue that the
“Works were suspended by the Engineer for the WSP/WMP beyond
the original completion date” and that this suspension was not
“otherwise provided for in the Contract”.3°° The requirement for
Winter Breaks was a contractual requirement; and the Contractor
complied with it and did indeed suspend the construction during
the additional winter periods.

502. Therefore, Clause 40 GCC is not a proper basis for the claim for
prolongation cost caused by the Winter Breaks. The Tribunal must
examine the other grounds for compensation invoked by the
Claimant when seeking compensation for the costs incurred during
the additional winter periods.

503. In this respect the Engineer, in a statement on which the
Respondent also relies, took a more nuanced position than that of
the Respondent. In a letter subsequent to the Determination in
which he provided additional reasons for his decision, he wrote the
following:

“The Contractor must have been aware of the winter of the Kyrgyz
Republic when the contract was extended. He could have taken
into account this period and managed the equipment
allocation/rotation to the best of his interest. Otherwise, he should
have agreed with the Employer in the addendum with regard to
the treatment of the suspended winter period. As we stated in
Item 1 above, granting of EOT is not an automatic confirmation of
the Contractor’s entitlement to financial compensation. It must be
understood that EOT is granted not only for causes created by the
failure of the Employer but also for causes neither the Contractor
nor the Employer is responsible. In the latter case, both contracted
parties may suffer losses where neither party is responsible to
compensate the other’s losses. This in keeping with the generally
accepted principle that no party to a contract is responsible for the
other party’s losses caused by circumstances outside the first
party’s control, unless so agreed. If no party is responsible, nor
gains undue benefit, the costs lie where they fall.”3°9

504. In this statement three different situations must be distinguished: at
the beginning of this passage, the Engineer considers the quantum
of the costs and the question whether the costs could have been
reduced. This does not address the question whether the
Contractor is entitled to compensation. The Engineer then
considered specifically the situation resulting from the fact that
some of the EOT was granted not by a decision of the Engineer but
by agreement of the Parties in Addenda. The effect of the Addenda

115

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 118 of 177

on the claim for prolongation costs has been considered already in
the context of the relevant EOT. However, a specific issue arises
under Addendum No. 3; this shall be considered separately below.

505. The third situation considered by the Engineer concerns the
distinction made in relation to the causes of the losses and
responsibility of the parties. This is indeed the correct approach:
the Contractor argued that delay that occurred before the winter set
in prevented him from completing the works before he had to
suspend for the Winter Maintenance Break. The question therefore
is one of causation: what caused the delay which brought the works
into the winter period?

506. The situation is clear with respect to circumstances with respect to
which the Employer owes compensation to the Contractor. If the
Contractor shows that these circumstances cause the prolongation
of the work to the point that the Contractor had to face an
additional Winter Maintenance Period, this additional period has to
be included in the prolongation costs. The issue is one of causation
and must be considered as such.

507. Insofar the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent: the matter is not
governed by Clause 40 GCC; the winter suspension is regulated in
the Contract and there is no need for a suspension order by the
Engineer. However, this does not exclude compensation for the
relevant costs. What has to be examined is the causation for these
costs, the question whether works were extended into the winter
period as the result of compensable delay.

508. For the same reason the Parties’ argument relating to Article 630
KCC*"” is not determining. Article 630, paragraph 6 on which the
Claimant relied affords to a contractor the right to an increase in the
contract price in the following terms:

“In the event of a considerable increase in the cost of materials
and equipment to be provided by the contractor and of services
rendered by third persons to it after the contract was entered into,
the contractor shall have the right to demand that the established
price (estimate) be increased and, should the customer refuse to
comply with its demand cancel the contract in accordance with
Article 412 of this Code.”

509. In the claim for prolongation costs during the Winter Breaks, the
Claimant does not seek compensation for increased costs of

materials. It seeks compensation for the cost of equipment and
personnel during these breaks. That may or may not be considered

*! C__Submission on Legal Grounds, paragraph 119 and R-Rejoinder, paragraph 41.

116

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 119 of 177

an increase of cost as contemplated by Article 360(6) KCC. The
Tribunal need not decide the issue since that provision affords to a
contractor the right to demand an increase in the price; but if the
employer does not agree to such an increase, the remedy for the
contractor is the right to terminate the contract. The Claimant has
not even attempted to demonstrate that the circumstances of
“material change in circumstances”, as required by Article 412 KCC
have been met and does not request termination or contract
adjustment according to this provision. In any event, an
amendment of the contract, which a court may grant “in exceptional
cases” under Article 412(4) KCC, would seek to restore the balance
of the contract, taking into consideration the interest of both parties.
The compensation which the Claimant seeks here is the payment of
its additional costs; it does not make allowance for the interests of
the Respondent. Such claims require a clear basis as it has been
explained above in the context of the decision with respect to
compensability.

510. It follows, that, if it wishes to obtain compensation for the costs of
the Winter Breaks, the Claimant must establish that these costs
have been caused by one or the other of the grounds which entitle it
to claim, as they have been examined above. As stated above, the
issue is one of causation.

511. Mr Marshall, the Respondent’s delay expert, stated quite clearly this
issue of causation:

“In my view, if the Claimant was critically delayed by a matter for
which it was entitled to an extension of time and that matter was
also one for which the Contract provisions gave an entitlement to
additional payment (i.e. a ‘compensable delay’), and as a result
completion was delayed beyond a period of neutral delay (such
as a period of exceptionally adverse climatic conditions) then the
neutral delay would also become ‘compensable’.

However, the above would not apply if the preceding delay was a
‘neutral’ delay (i.e. entitlement to time but not to money). That is
because, in my view, the additional costs arising from the
subsequent ‘neutral’ delay have to be considered as having been
caused by the preceding delay. Therefore, if the cause was a
matter for which no compensation was allowable, then that must
also extend to the subsequent delay”.3!!

512. This is indeed the correct view, as it had emerged already at the

hearing in the discussion between the experts: the decisive question
is the responsibility for what was called the “driving delay”, i.e. the

delay which drove the performance of the work into the Winter
Break. As summarised by the Tribunal in the context of the similar
issue of lost days:

“... the experts agree you have to know whether the driving day
[recte: delay] was compensable or not in order to determine
whether the lost day is also compensable. ”3!?

The Claimant does not really contest this conclusion. It simply
argues that it has proven that “all driving events (delay in design,
additional works) are compensable”.3!3 The question whether this
affirmation is correct is indeed what the Tribunal will have to
address now.

In considering this question, the Claimant raised the question of the
burden of proof.3!4 The Claimant argued that it was the Respondent
who bore this burden. In support of this position, the Claimant
relied on Article 365(2) KCC which concerns the consequences of a
person failing to perform an obligation. If that failure is established,
the provision allows exemptions from liability and stipulates the
grounds for such exemptions. It is for the party invoking such
exemptions to prove these grounds.

This is not the issue here. The question of compensability of the
driving delay has been decided by the Tribunal in the previous
sections. This decision was based on the Tribunal’s examination of
each of the periods of excusable delay considered by the Engineer.
The Tribunal noted that all of these periods were critical which
means that they were driving delays. The Tribunal also noted that
collectively these delays extended the completion of the works to the
actual completion date, which means that in the Engineer’s
Determination there were no other critical or driving delays. In
particular, the Engineer did not identify any concurrent critical
delays caused by the Contractor.315

Mr Marshall asserts that there were concurrent delays caused by
the Contractor. In support of this assertion, Mr Marshall relies on a
contractual completion date of 20 June 2002 and argues that the
5.5 months until 3 December 2002 must be treated as float and
disregarded for the purpose of calculation of compensable delay.3!©
However, this is not what the Engineer has done. He identified the
“Original Contract Period” as running from 3 January 2000 to 3
December 2002. Moreover, when attempting to demonstrate “that

the Claimant would have been on site during the winter 2002/3
irrespective of the Respondent’s delays”, Mr Marshall relies on the
date when the Claimant requested its first EOT on 25 July 2002.3!7
However, this date is irrelevant for determining when the Claimant’s
works were affected by the delay: what matters is the time when the
delays affected the Contractor’s work. As explained above, both the
design delays and the additional works affected the work during a
period starting in March 2000 and ending in June 2001. The
demonstrations of Mr Marshall for the subsequent periods are
similarly unreliable.

For these reasons, the Tribunal bases its assessment on the critical
delays identified by the Engineer as the driving delays. It has
decided above which of these delays were compensable and which
not.

The issue to be considered now is to determine whether the Winter
Breaks were caused by compensable delays or not. This must be
done separately for each of the three Winter Breaks. Since it is the
Claimant that seeks payment for these delays it is the Claimant
which must prove this causation.

The contractual completion date was 3 December 2002. The first
Winter Break thereafter, as confirmed by the Engineer in his
Determination lasted 107 days from 15 December 2002 to 1 April
2003. The preceding critical delays identified by the Engineer were
50 days for design delay and 33 days for additional works. These
delays occurred at various times during the period from 1 March
2000 to June 2001. All of these 83 days were found to be
compensable.3!8 There were no non-compensable delays identified
by the Engineer prior to the first Winter Break.3!9

Since in the only delays in the Engineer’s presentation were found
by the Tribunal to be compensable, the following delay during the
Winter Break 2002/2003 also must be compensable. The Tribunal
holds that the 107 days of this additional Winter Break are
compensable.

The second Winter Break after the contractual completion date was
identified by the Engineer as lasting for 119 days from 5 December
2003 to 2 April 2004. Before the start of this break the Contractor
presented EOT 2 and EOT 3.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 122 of 177

With respect to EOT 2 the Engineer had accepted 159 days as
excusable but found that they were non-compensable. The
Claimant sought to reverse this determination and claimed
compensation for this period. Tribunal denied the claim.
Consequently all 159 days of EOT 2 are non-compensable.

EOT 3 concerned, in addition to the 119 days of Winter Break and
67 Lost Days which will be considered separately, time extension of
180 days agreed in Addendum No. 4. The Engineer determined that
15 days for the relocation of utilities were compensable while 165
days for additional works were not. The Tribunal found that all 180
days were compensable.

The delays to which the EOT 2 request refers must have been prior
to 26 March 2003, the date on which the Contractor confirmed the
request.320 Those of EOT 3 occurred during the period from April
and October 2003.32! By the end of the first Winter Break the
Project had accumulated, according to Table 2 of the Engineer’s
Determination, 190 days of delay. The Tribunal found this delay
compensable and therefore does not consider it for the calculation of
subsequent prolongation costs.

The delays that must now be considered are the 159 non-
compensable days of EOT 2 and the 180 compensable days of EOT
3. The former occurred prior to March 2003, i.e. before any of the
compensable EOT 3 delays could exercise an effect on the
performance of the works. Therefore, the delay which drove the
work into the second additional Winter Break was that of the 159
days of non-compensable delay. It follows that the 119 days of the
second additional Winter Break were caused by the non-
compensable delays and, therefore, are non-compensable.

The third Winter Break after the contractual completion date, as
confirmed by the Engineer’s Determination, lasted for 92 days from
15 December 2004 to 16 March 2005. By the start of this break,
the Contractor had presented EOT 4 on 9 September 2004 for which
the Engineer granted an extension of 75 days compensable delay
attributed to the delay in the commencement order; the Tribunal
confirmed this compensability and quantified the costs by reference
to the period between April and June 2004. In addition the
Engineer granted 19 days extension which he classified as non-
compensable and which the Tribunal attributed to Lost Days (12
days) and Winter Break (7 days).

If one considers the period between the second and the third
additional Winter Break, the driving delay were the compensable 75

*° Exhibit C- 8.
*! See above section 8.7.2.

120

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 123 of 177

days; the delay of the third Winter Break therefore must also be
compensated. The same conclusion would be reached if one took
account of the earlier delays which had not yet been brought to bear
in the calculation. In the period prior to the second additional
Winter Break the Tribunal had identified both a period of non-
compensable delay (in EOT 2) and of compensable delay (in EOT 3).
The former has been taken into account in the decision concerning
the second additional Winter Break; the latter was disregarded in
this decision and may still be considered with the effect it had on
the delay causing the Project to be driven into the third additional
Winter Break.

528. For both these reasons, the 92 days of the third additional Winter
Break must be treated as compensable.

8.10.2 Quantification

529. The Claimant quantified the prolongation costs attributed to the
additional Winter Breaks in the same manner as the other
prolongation costs, i.e. by reference to the total resources on site
during the relevant period, as corrected by Mr Kennedy in his final
report.

530. The objections of Mr Taft to the quantification of the Winter Break
costs are different from those of the other prolongation costs, as the
“bottom-up” method does not apply here: the Winter Break costs are
quantified on the assumption that the Contractor could not work.
However, Mr Taft proposes that this assumption be corrected by
reference to “specific machines working”. He also points out that
“there is evidence of plant being de-mobilised at the end of the
winter periods and which therefore could reasonably be assumed to
be in a position to have demobilised at the start of the Winter period
in question.”322

531. In support of the first of these objections, Mr Taft refers to a letter
from the Contractor to the Engineer of 11 November 2001, the
content of which he summarises as follows: the letter “stated that
some works would be ongoing - and that a specific list of plant
would be maintained throughout the winter period - thus reducing
the amount of plant that must have been standing during this
period”.523 Mr Taft states that in Appendix B4.1 to his Final Report
he “made adjustments to the plant resources/costs for these winter
periods”, but he accepts that “prolongation costs in this winter
period have not been claimed”.

121

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 124 of 177

532. With respect to the subsequent winter periods there was some
reference at the hearing to payment certificates IPC 29324 and IPC
34825 as evidence for continuing work during the winter periods of
2003/2004 and 2004/2005. As Mr Kennedy demonstrated, the
certificates cover periods and activities which do not prove that work
was performed in these winter periods.22° The point was not
pursued subsequently.

533. In the absence of any other evidence for the allegedly “working
plant”, the Tribunal cannot make reductions in the costs claimed for
subsequent winter periods.

534. Concerning the second argument of Mr Taft, the Tribunal noted that
indeed at the end of the winter period 2003/2004 and, to a lesser
extent, at the end of the winter period 2004/2005, a sharp drop in
P&M costs occurred. This development with respect to the P&M
costs is all the more surprising since during these two periods, as
shown in the graph at Appendix C1 of Mr Taft’s Final Report, the
number of machinery on site dropped significantly while the costs
remained unchanged compared to the pre-winter period.327

535. The Claimant contests Mr Taft’s argument and states that (a) the
Employer was aware “of the exact nature and amount of resources
on site and any duty to mitigate would sensibly fall equally upon
him”; (b) the Engineer would not allow any removal of plant; (c) once
the winter arrived “it was logistically impossible to remove plant over
this extended mountainous area until the end of the WSP”; (d)
removal of plant to Turkey and returning it was impractical and (not
realistic) 328

536. The Tribunal has considered these arguments in the context only of
the claim for Winter Break 2004/2005, since the claim for the
previous winter has been dismissed as not compensable:

e As to (a): it is the Claimant who seeks compensation for the
resources that stayed on site over the winter; it is for the
Claimant to show that it was necessary to keep the resources on
site; it is irrelevant whether the Employer was aware of the
presence on site of these resources, since at that time the
Contractor had simply reserved his claim for financial
consequences but had not announced that he intended to claim
for the costs of the resources which stayed on site during the
winter. The Tribunal does not accept that, in these

circumstances, the Employer should bear all or part of the costs
of P&M which could have been removed from site on the ground
that the Employer should have asked for their removal.

As to (b): the Claimant relies on a single letter by the Engineer,
dated 28 November 2003 and produced in Appendix 3 of Mr
Marshall’s Final Report.329 In that letter the Engineer complains
that machinery was removed from site without his consent. He
does not object to the removal as such and does order that the
machinery be returned. The letter is no evidence that the
Engineer objected to the removal of P&M that was no longer
required. In any event, the letter concerns machinery removed
before the winter 2003/2004 which is not in issue here.

As to (c): The Contractor can be expected to use proper planning
and remove before winter sets in, P&M that is no longer needed
rather than keeping it on site and removing it only at the end of
the winter. In any event, in order for this argument to be
persuasive, the Claimant would have had to show that it was the
actual winter conditions which prevented the removal, rather
than making the argument in the abstract, stating that “Winter
did arrive”.

As to (d): the argument is irrelevant since the objection of Mr Taft
is not that the Contractor should have removed the P&M
temporarily for the Winter Break and return it thereafter; the
argument applies only to P&M which was removed at the end of
the winter. Mr Taft assumes that, if the P&M was not needed at
the end of the winter and was removed then, it could just as well
have been removed at its beginning.

537. The Tribunal concludes that none of the replies presented by the
Claimant are convincing. It accepts Mr Taft’s argument and
quantifies the costs of the Winter Break 2004/2005 by reference to
the P&M costs in the period immediately thereafter.

538. On the basis of these considerations, the Tribunal quantifies the
prolongation costs attributed to the compensable additional Winter
Breaks as follows:

539. Concerning the First Winter Break after the end of the original
contract period (2002/2003): 107 days were found to be
compensable. They were quantified in Mr Kennedy’s final and
corrected tables at the rate of US$29’081.59 per day. For the reason
explained, this rate must be reduced to exclude overheads and profit
with respect to the Contractor’s own P&M costs by US$1’508 per
day. The daily rate to be applied to the 107 days therefore is US$
27°573.59. The amount due is US$2’950’374.13.

540. The Second Winter Break (2003/2004) is non-compensable.

541. With respect to the third Winter Break (2004/2005), 92 days were
found compensable. Mr Kennedy quantified the prolongation costs
attributable to these days at the rate of US$14’651.63 per day. This
quantification is based on monthly P&M costsUS$336’786 which
dropped after the end of the winter to US$264’916, a difference of
US$ 71’870 or US$ 2’318.39 per day. The daily rate must further be
reduced by US$1’508 concerning overhead and profit for the
Contractor’s P&M, bringing it to US$10’825.24. At this rate the 92
days are quantified as US$995’922.08.

542. Consequently, the prolongation costs attributable to the
compensable Winter Breaks are awarded at US$3’946’296.21.

8.11 Lost Days

543. The Claimant seeks compensation for 35 or 67 “Lost Days Delay” in
respect of EOT 3, in the amount of US$1’091’895.53, alternatively
US$1’385’670.81; and for 35 such days in respect to EOT 5, in the
amount of US$531’833.76, alternatively US$460’050.37. The
Claimant explains that:

“Lost Working Days simply represent those days which the
Contractor could not work but which fall within the extended
period beyond the original date for completion and arising as a
result of excusable delay”.#°

544. The Engineer had included in Table 2 of his Determination such
Lost Days: 67 days with respect to EOT 3 and 35 days with respect
to EOT 5. He treated these days as excusable but non-
compensable.33!

545. The Respondent stated that it “upholds the position of the Engineer
in respect of non-compensability of 67 days” and the 35 days,
concerning EOT 3 and EOT 5, respectively.°52. It argues that the
Contract required the Contractor “would not work on weekends” and
does not provide that “suspension of works because of weekends or
public holidays shall be compensated”.333

546. The basis of this claim has been discussed at the hearing, where it
was noted that the reason why lost days may have to be considered
is that the delays were counted in working days and not in calendar

days.334 The time extensions claimed by the Contractor and those
granted by the Engineer were calculated as working days and did
not account for the non-working days (Sundays, public holidays,
adverse climatic conditions).

547. The original contract period was calculated as 1065 calendar days,
which meant that the Contractor had to make allowance for a
number of non-working days during this period as part of his own
risk. He was not entitled to any extension for Sundays and public
holidays during this period and not to any compensation for the
costs occurring on these days. When, during this period, delays
occurred, the delay was counted by working days; the non-working
days were disregarded since they were days on which the Contractor
could not have worked and thus could not have been delayed. When
the Engineer then calculated the time extension which he granted to
the Contractor, he relied on the delay calculated in working days
and added them to the contract period. This meant that he granted
the working days as if they were calendar days. In so doing he
granted an extension in which the number of working days granted
to the Contractor was reduced by the number of non-working days
which occurred during the extended period. This number of non-
working days, “embedded” within a period which should have been a
period of working days, are the Lost Days for which the Contractor
is claiming.

548. The situation was explained by the Contractor:

“... the Contractor has lost 52 working days within the period of
Extension of Time granted by the Engineer against the
Contractor’s Interim EOT/04. The Contractor is thus entitled to
additional 52 days of Extension of Time solely due to the fact that
he was unable to avail the Extension of time granted by the
Engineer against his Interim EOT/04. This is a fair and clear
entitlement of the Contractor irrespective of the fact that he
disputes the Engineer’s determination on EOT/o4 under the
relevant Conditions of Contract.”335

549. In his response of 13 July 2005, the Engineer explained that a “total
of 27 lost days (holidays, Sundays, and Saturdays the Contractor
honoured as rest days)” had been accounted for; the Engineer added
a further 21 days under the heading of “Lost working days”.336

550. In his Determination, the Engineer made the method of calculating

time extensions quite clear by stating:

Tr 336.
5 ROT 5 request, Exhibit C-13, p. 8.
6 Exhibit C-14.

551.

552.

553.

554.

“Note: The duration of time extension granted does not include
Sundays, public holidays and winter break.”337

This explains why the Engineer, in the same Determination,
considered these non-working days separately and _ granted
altogether 102 days on this account, thus recognising that the
extensions which he granted on other accounts did not fully
quantify the additional time to which the Contractor was entitled.
In other words, the manner in which the Engineer quantified the
extensions of time which he granted was such that the non-working
days had to be granted separately.

It follows that the claim for Lost Days is not an independent claim
for suspension on weekends or other non-working days. Rather, it
forms part of the claims for prolongation costs on other grounds and
relates to the quantification of these other claims. It simply
corrects, as the Engineer has done, the insufficient extension
resulting from the fact that the Engineer determined the extension
to which the Contractor was entitled on the basis of working days
and grated the extension as calendar days. The claim enters into
the calculation of the extension on calendar days, the non-working
days that had been left out when the extension was calculated.338

It may have been simpler if the Engineer, rather than counting the
extension in working days, had counted them in calendar days.
Since the Engineer did not do so and, in the circumstances of this
case, the Tribunal had to follow the allocation of the Engineer in
order to determine compensability and quantification, the Lost Days
must also be considered.

However, in doing so, a distinction must be made depending on the
basis for the extension. Lost Days are compensable only to the
extent to which they related to delays which are compensable.
Although in their conclave at the hearing the experts could not agree
on a specific allocation of compensable and non-compensable days,
they did agree on the principle. As the Tribunal’s expert, Mr
Hamann concluded:

“We could not actually decide whether they were compensable or
not, because in our opinion they wold only be compensable if the
work on these days had to be done due to a shifting on an event
also compensable. ”339

This demonstrates a similarity between the approach to the Lost
Days claim and that for Winter Breaks. Indeed, Mr Marshall deals
with both these claims in the same chapter of his Final Report.34°

It might be considered as inherent in the logic of the Lost Days
claim to consider entitlement and quantum by reference to the time
when the time extension becomes effective. However, since the
extension in working days is determined at the time when the delay
occurred, it appears preferable to also determine the Lost Days on
this basis. This latter approach amounts to determining the
extension on the basis of the working days and the associated non-
working days. The Tribunal considers this approach the most
suitable one.

In order to allocate the Lost Days determined by the Engineer
between compensable and non-compensable, the Tribunal assumes
that these days are distributed evenly over the relevant period. On
the basis of the proportion between compensable and non-
compensable days for that period, the Tribunal allocates the Lost
Days to one or the other category.

The first Lost Days claim relates to 67 days in EOT 3 and, according
to the identification of the Engineer, concerns “rested on Sundays
and public holidays during the claim periods of EOT 1 to EOT 4”.841
The Claimant seeks compensation only for 35 days.342 To this must
be added the 12 days in EOT 4 which the Tribunal allocated to Lost
Days, bringing the total to 47 days. The total number of delay days
during these four periods (not counting Lost Days and the 7 days
absorbed in the EOT 4 Winter Break) is: 190 + 159 + 299 + 167 =
815 days. Of these 815 days, the Tribunal found 537 days
compensable, corresponding to 65.89 %. This percentage applied to
47 Lost Days in this period leads to 31 days of compensable delay.
The applicable daily rate for this period as calculated by Mr Kennedy
is US$31’197.02; deducting US$1’508 concerning overhead and
profit for the Contractor’s P&M brings the applicable daily rate to
US$29°689.02. The prolongation costs for the 31 days therefore
amount to US$ 920°360.24.

The second Lost Days claim is made for 35 days in EOT 5 and,
according to the Engineer, concerns “rested on Sundays & Public
holidays and adverse climatic days after claim period of EOT 4”.843
The total number of delay days during this period, not counting the
Lost Days is 107 of which 96 were found to be compensable. The
proportion of compensable days is therefore 89.7% or 31 days. Mr

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 130 of 177

Kennedy calculates two different rates for this period: one rate is
US$14’510.96 and must be reduced to US$ 13’002.96; the other is
US$16’221.69 and must be reduced to US$14’713.69. In Mr
Kennedy’s calculation, the former rate applies to 21 days
(corresponding to 60% of the period) the other to 14 days (40%).
Dividing the 31 compensable days in the same proportion, 19 and
12 days are obtained. The prolongations costs for the two periods
thus are:

19 days x US$13002.96 = US$247'056.24; and
12 days x US$14’713.69 = US$176’564.28.

560. The total prolongation costs for the 31 compensable Lost Days

561.

related to EOT 5 therefore are of US$423’620.52.

The Tribunal therefore awards US$1’343’980.76 for prolongation
costs on account of 62 Lost Days.

8.12 Head Office Overheads

562. The Claimant seeks US$2’6267138.40 for Head Office Overheads.344

The Respondent denies the claim.

563. The Tribunal has examined already the compensability of Head

Office Overheads. It has concluded that these costs are
compensable at the daily rate of US$2’350.345 This rate is applicable
only to days which the Tribunal has found to be compensable.

564. The total of compensable days is summarised as _ follows

e EOT2 0
e EOT3 180
e EOT4 75
e EOTS 96
e Winter Breaks 199

565. At the rate of US$2’350 per day, the Head Office Overheads for 716

days of compensable delay are at US$1’633’250.

8.13 Summary of awarded prolongation costs

. On the basis of the explanations above, the Tribunal concluded that

the Claimant is entitled to compensation of its prolongation costs
under the following heads:

(i) For EOT 1: US$2’524’790;

(ii) For EOT 2: that part of the claim is dismissed;
(iii) For EOT 3: US$5’367966.45;

(iv) For EOT 4: US$1’306’856.25;

(v) For EOT 5: US$1’313’887.40;

(vi) For the costs of Winter Breaks: US$3’946’296.21;
(vii) For the costs of Lost Days: US$1’343’980.76; and
(viii) For Head Office Overheads: US$1’633’250.

The total compensation for the Claimant’s Prolongation Costs is
US$17’437'027.07. Against this amount, must be credited the sum
already certified by the Engineer and paid by the Employer of
US$1’161870.19. The sum due on account of the prolongation
costs therefore is US$16’275’156.88.

9. THE CLAIM FOR INTERESTS ON LATE PAYMENTS

568. The Claimant seeks payment of US$151’889.38 as interest on
amounts that were paid late. The Respondent denies any
entitlement.

569. The claim concerns payment delays in the initial period of the
Contract up to the effective date of Addendum 1, i.e. 15 May
2003.34

9.1 The dispute

570. Clause 60.8 CPA is entitled “Time of Payment and Interest”. It
provides the following:

“The amount due to the Contractor under any Interim Payment
Certificate issued by the Engineer pursuant to this Clause 60, or
to any other term of the Contract shall, subject always to the
provisions of Clause 47, be paid by the Employer to the Contractor
within 56 days after the Contractor’s monthly statement has been
submitted to the Engineer for certification or, in the case of the
Final Certificate pursuant to sub-Clause 60.13, within 84 days
after the agreed final statement and written discharge have been
submitted to the Engineer for certification. In the event of the
failure of the Employer to make payment within the times stated,
the Employer shall pay to the Contractor interest compounded
monthly at the rates stated in the Appendix to Tender upon all
sums unpaid from the date at which the same should have been
paid, in the currencies in which the payments are due.”

571. The Minutes of Contract Negotiations, forming part of the Letter of
Acceptance, provide the following:

“Budget in excess of the Loan Agreement will be compensated by
using local funds. The local portion will be paid throught the
Kyrgyzautobank in Kyrgyz Soms using the exchange rate of
National Bank on the payment date in accordance with the
contract payment conditions. Payment delays in the local portion
shall not exceed three months.”

572. The Employer’s payments of the local portion, in some cases were
made more than 56 days and 90 days after the submission of the
monthly statements. The Contractor complained in a letter of 10
November 2002, stating that the Employer’s payments had exceeded

the agreed payment terms. The Contractor argued that these delays
caused serious problems in respect to its payments to the suppliers
and subcontractors, receivables having accumulated to an amount
of US$ 634’523.347 The Employer responded by bringing the matter
to the Engineer’s Representative, requesting, on 14 November 2002,
an Engineer’s Decision according to Clause 67 CC.348 The
Engineer’s Representative declined to rule on the request and
referred the Employer to the Engineer to whom the Employer
addressed the same request on 19 November 2002.349

573. The Engineer wrote on 25 November 2002, with the reference
“Engineer’s Decision on Interpretation of Minutes of Contract
Negotiations regarding Delayed Payment of Local Portion”.25° In that
letter, the Engineer stated that he “believe[d] it is natural to consider
that the delay admissible under the present situation is considered
as three months (not 90 days) from the elapse of 56 days, against
the original condition of contract that the delay starts immediately
from the elapse of 56 days”. The Engineer added “that this does not
not [sic] necessarily mean that the Employer may pay at the end of
56 days plus three months (not 90 days), because it is the duty of
the Employer to pay without any delay and it is not the right of the
Employer to delay”. The Engineer concluded by “suggest[ing] that
both the Employer and the Contractor are requested to discuss and
agree on the period in disputes applicable to the payment from
December 4, 2002 onward, ...”.

574. On 23 January 2003, the Contractor wrote to the Employer under
the reference “Notice of Intention to Commence Arbitration under
Clause 67.1 of the Conditions of Contract”, expressing his
dissatisfaction with the decision.35!

575. As suggested and requested by the Engineer, the Parties did indeed
discuss this and on 15 May 2003 agreed Addendum 1, which settled
a number of issues including the payment terms. It referred to
Clause 60.8 CPA and provided a 56 days payment term for “all the
forthcoming Interim Payment Certificates”. The Amendment also
contained the following clause:

“The Contractor also agrees not to commence proceedings of
Arbitration regarding the Engineer’s decision under Clause 67.1
dated November 25, 2002, provided that the Employer shall fufill
all other conditions of this Addendum.”

576. In the Statement at Completion, the Contractor claimed
US$300’741.13, stating that the “Employer has failed to make
payments to the Contractor within the times stated in Clause 60.8
of the Conditions of Particular Application”. In the Determination of
18 May 2006, the Engineer referred to his Decision of 25 November
2002 according to which, prior to Addendum 1, “interest should be
applied to ‘after 90 + 56 days”. He accepted US$25’165.01 and
rejected the balance of the claim.

577. In the Notice of Arbitration of 15 January 2009, the Contractor
claimed for the balance in the amount of 275’576.12.

9.2 Time bar

578. The Respondent argues that the claim is time barred. It considers
that the “reference point” for the three year period under the KCC is
23 January 2003 “when the Claimant sent the notification of its
intention to initiate arbitration proceedings against the Engineer’s
Decision of 25 November 2003”. On this basis the claim would be
time barred on 23 January 2003.*”

579. The Tribunal has considered this objection and noted that the 25
November 2002 “Decision” expressed a view of the Engineer about
the interpretation of the two clauses dealing with the time for
payment. It did not decide and reject a claim by the Contractor but
rather expressed contradicting positions by expressing a “belief”
about the calculation of the payment period while, at the same time,
emphasising “the duty of the Employer to pay without any delay”,
leaving doubts about the treatment of a claim by the Contractor for
delay interest if such claim should be made. The Tribunal also
considered that a few months after the Claimant sent the Notice of
its intention to initiate arbitration, the Parties concluded
Amendment 1 by which they deferred and rendered conditional the
time when the Contractor could resort to arbitration. The Tribunal
concludes that the Claimant’s 23 January 2003 notification is not
the proper starting point for calculating the period of limitation.

580. As explained above in Section 7.1, the period of limitation started
running when, following the submission of the Statement at
Completion, the Engineer’s Determination was notified to the
Contractor on 18 May 2006. The claim then was included in the
Notice for Arbitration of 15 January 2009, before the expiration of
the three year period under Kyrgyz law. The claim is therefore not
time barred.

9.3 The Claimant’s entitlement

When discussing the entitlement of the Claimant to delay interest,
the Parties essentially revert to the arguments that had been made
before the Engineer issued in 2006 its determination.

The Claimant argues that the last sentence in in clause of the
Minutes of Contract Negotiations “does not change the contractual
payment period. This is a statement from the Employer and by this
statement, the Employer undertook and warranted that the
‘Payment delays in the local portion shall not exceed three months”
(emphasis in the Claimant’s quotation).353

At the hearing, Mr Ozkoseoglu explained that, in the Claimant’s
understanding, the clause means “that the maximum amount of
delayed duration shall not exceed three months”. The Tribunal
summarised Mr Ozkoseoglu’s position as _ follows: “Your
interpretation is that they have 56 days, beyond 56 days they have
to pay interest. They say irrespective of interest, in any event they
will not delay more than three months.”354

The Respondent argued that the two periods must be added. It
described the three months period in the Minutes of Contract
Negotiations as “a grace period” and considered that the “duration
specified in paragraph 60.8 of the CPA is general, it also includes
payment of the local portion plus the duration of the three
months”.355

The Tribunal considered that Clause 60.8 CPA constitutes a general
clause fixing the time for payment at 56 days. Clause 6 of the
Minutes of Contract Negotiations deals specifically with the payment
delays with respect to the local portion. The question on which the
Parties differ is whether this latter provision affects the contractual
payment period and, if it does, whether it derogates from the period
of 56 days or adds an additional period.

The wording of Clause 60.8 is clear. It requires the Employer to pay
interim certificates within 56 days and, if he fails to make timely
payment, to pay interest. Clause 6 is not quite as clear. However,
when the clause states that “payment delays shall not exceed three
months”, it expresses a clear intention that delays within this period
are admissible. Therefore, the Tribunal does not agree with the
Claimant. It considers that no sanction in the form of interest on
outstanding local payments may be applied during the three month
period.

53 SoC, paragraph 2911
4 Trp. 151 and 152.
5 Tr p. 153 and 154.

133

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 136 of 177

587. Remains the question as to whether the three month period must be
added to the general period of 56 days according to Clause 60.8 or
whether it replaces this period. Clause 6 makes it clear that it
applies to payments “using local funds” and that such payments are
made in the specific situation where payments are made “in excess
of the Loan Agreement”. The clause uses the term “budget” which,
in the context of the clause, the Tribunal reads as “payments due to
be made”. Since Clause 6 provides a special payment regime for
amounts not covered by the Loan Agreement, it must be read as
derogating from those provisions which are applicable generally.

588. With respect to “payment delays”, Clause 6 does not state that the
Employer has an additional period of three months; the Clause
clearly states that, for payments of “the local portion”, the payment
delay shall not exceed three months. The Tribunal sees no
indication that the Parties intended Clause 6 to provide for an
additional period for payments and for a cumulative application of
the two periods. The Tribunal concludes that the period within
which local payments had to be made is three months.

589. Clause 60.8 CPA provides for interest in case payments are made
after the expiration of the stipulated payment period. Clause 6
replaces the payment period of 56 days by a period applicable
especially for local payments. It does not deal with the sanction in
case of payment after the stipulated period. The general provision
on interest in Clause 60.8 therefore also applies to payments in local
funds after the three month periods.

590. The Tribunal concludes that payments in local funds made after the
expiration of three months bear interest at the rates stipulated in
Clause 60.8 CPA.

9.4 Quantification

591. The Claimant has presented differing calculations of the amount
claimed. Eventually, Mr Kennedy revised the figures originally
quoted and quantified the claim in his Reply Report by reference to
three alternative payment periods: 56 days, 90 days and, for the
period after 13 May 2003, 56 + 90 days.35© The amount of delay
interest for payments exceeding 90 days is US$84’671. He
confirmed the amount in the Joint Expert Report, subject to a
deduction for the amount originally certified by the Engineer.°57

“°° Kennedy Reply Report, paragraph 2.58.3.

134

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 137 of 177

592. Mr Taft, the Respondent’s expert, examined the valuation by Mr
Kennedy and the amounts put forward and saw no “significant
difference between our respective assessments”. He concluded:
“subject to the Tribunal’s decision on whether the Claimant’s or
Respondent’s position is correct, I can support Mr Kennedy’s revised
figures (subject to a reduction by the amount certified under the
Engineer’s Determination of US$25’165.01)”.358

593. In view of this concordance in the quantification by the Parties’
respective experts, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent must

pay to the Claimant US$84’671 minus US$25’165.01, ie. the
rounded amount of US$59’506 as interest on delayed payments.

10. THE CLAIM FOR GUARDRAILS

594. The Claimant seeks payment of US$ 202’304.20 for the installation
of guardrails in quantities exceeding those for which the Engineer
certified payment. The works in question also are referred to as
“Road Furniture”, “road fences” and “road construction”. The
Respondent denies the claim, arguing that it had not agreed to any
additional installations.

10.1 The dispute

595. The Bill of Quantities prescribes in Bill “O8 Road Furniture” for each
of the 9 sections an Item 8.5 - 3 with the following work: “Provide
and place new concrete parapets” at a rate of US$13 per meter. It
does not contain an item for Guardrails or other forms of safety
barriers.*”

596. Further to a Protocol of 5 September 2002, the Employer instructed
the Engineer on 26 December 2002 that 32.8 km “safety barriers” be
installed at the rate of US$13. The instruction specified the
conditions of this installation and provided that, if more safety
barriers would be installed, “a new unit rate will be applied in

consultation with the contractor”.*°

597. The Engineer transmitted the letter to the Contractor on 27
December 2002 and repeated the instructions in the following
terms:

“According to the above referenced letter, please proceed with the
procurement, fabrication and installation of safety barriers with
the conditions stated below:

« According to the approval of the Employer total length of safety
barriers of three types (Steel guardrails Standard, Steel
Guardrails with shock absorbers and concrete parapets) will be
32.8 km. Payment for installation of above mentioned barriers
will be made on permanent contract price - $13.00USD/mt.

e The contractor’s proposal of installation of solely steel
guardrails at all sections without any concrete parapet is not
acceptable for the Employer. However, if installation of more
safety barriers of any type is required, a new unit rate will be
considered upon consultation between Employer and _ the
Contractor.

+ Confirmed by testimony by Mr Asman at Tr 119.
* Exhibit C-85.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 139 of 177

¢ The location of these safety barriers will be according to the
survey done and submitted to the Engineer by the Contactor.
(Letter No: TL/YPN/ 865 dated 05/04/2002)

e The contractor will be responsible for any delay connected with
supply and installation of safety barriers. "3°!

598. The Contractor proceeded with the delivery and installation of
guardrails. On 22 August 2005, the Contractor wrote to the
Engineer that on 14 August 2005, the length of installed guardrails
and concrete parapets reached 32,776m and added:

“If any additional guardrail works are going to be executed, our
rate for these additional guardrails is 7OUSD/m.”

599. This statement was followed in the letter by a table showing the
quantities of additional guardrails and their locations with a total of
27149m. The letter concluded by stating:

“Please inform us within 1 week of this letter if the Employer and
the Engineer agree to the additional 2’149m of guardrails by the
Engineer at the rate given above. If the Employer does not reply to
this letter within a week, the remaining guardrails installation
works shall be considered to be excluded from the scope of
works,”362

600. The Engineer responded on 24 August 2005, referring to a list
showing a total of 32.8 km of safety barriers, which had been
prepared by the Contractor and on which the instructions of 27
December 2002 had relied. He continued by stating that, based on
further instructions of the Employer, a revised list for safety barriers
for Section A and Section B of the road had been prepared in
consultation with the Contractor. The Engineer presented a table of
the steel guardrails and concrete parapets approved for installation
showing a total of 32,776kms. Referring to the Contractors
statement that, after having installed 32,776km, 2’149m of steel
guardrails remained to be installed, the Engineer stated:

“Therefore, either your account of installed length is incorrect or
you have installed barriers in locations not in approved lists.
Please clarify whether your account of installed guarded length is
correct and if so provide the Engineer with details of authorization
for you to depart from the approved list.

Subject to your substantiation that you received due authorization
for departing from the approved list, as you have correctly pointed
out in your letter (ref a), the Contractor should negotiate with the

Employer for a new rate for additional length you claimed to have
installed departing from the list.

Notwithstanding the above substantiation and agreement of new
unit rate, you are requested without delay to fulfil your obligation
to install safety barriers as per the approved list.”3®

601. The Contractor responded on 2 September 2005, attaching a list,
“prepared and signed by the topographers of the Contactor and the
Engineer on 22/04/2004” showing the length of guardrails in
Section A of the road as “jointly measured”. The list shows a total
installed guardrail length of 13’407.09m in Section A compared to
10’°877m as per the approved list. The difference was explained in a
message, also attached to the letter, which Mr Olmez, foreman of the
Guardrail Installation Team, had sent to Mr Asman on 29 August
2005. It stated:

“When we had started installation of guardrails in Section A we
were instructed by Mr Avazbek Chalakaev from JOC to install the
guardrails in such a way that end terminals should not be within
the km intervals given in the approved list, but outside. Therefore
almost at every location, more guardrails were installed than the
list.

Besides, at about 9 to 10 locations close guardrail groups were
combined which was also instructed by JOC. Furthermore,
guardrails were installed on the bridges although these were not
covered by the list. As a result of also this, installation quantities
increased in comparison with the list.”364

602. The Contractor’s letter concluded by stating:

“Consequently, we shall require the payment of the additional
quantities which have been already installed according to the
instructions of your site staff and any other additional quantities,
which are necessary to be installed for the safety of the road
users.

All the quantities in addition to the approved list will be installed
on the understanding that these additional quantities will be paid
to us according to our new rate.

Please be notified that we are commencing to install these
additional quantities as of 2.4 September 2005, unless we are
instructed otherwise by you.”3®

138

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 141 of 177

603. The Engineer announced on 5 September 2005, that he was
undertaking a “review of guardrail installation list attached to your
letter and assess the validity of reasons you have given for the
additional length of guardrails”. The Engineer also announced that
he would “recommend a basis for negotiations between the
Employer and the Contractor for a new unit rate”.366

604. The letter did not express any objection to the continuation of the
guardrail installation announced by the Contractor. The Tribunal
invited the Respondent to provide any evidence at the hearing as to
whether there had been any such objection. Failing such evidence,
it would conclude that there was no objection.” No such evidence
was produced at the hearing or thereafter.

605. The Engineer reverted to the matter in his letter of 31 October 2005.
The letter does not object to the Contractor proceeding with the
installation of guardrails but explains the Engineer’s position
concerning the measurement of the length of installed guardrails for
which the Contractor is to be paid. The Engineer explained that, in
calculating this length, he excluded “all ‘terminal’ length, guardrails
installed on bridges (ref a) and for guardrails installed on Sargata
bridge approaches.” Applying this approach to measuring the
length of guardrails, the Engineer concluded that the length of
guardrails remained below 32.8km and that, therefore, “there is no
need for a new unit rate”.368

606. The claim was included in the Statement at Completion (under the
heading “Road Furniture”). In his Determination, the Engineer
rejected the claim, arguing that he had “dealt with this matter in
detail and asked the Contractor to substantiate his claim”. He
added that, in his view, the Contractor had failed to substantiate his
claim and was not entitled to any payment beyond that certified.°°

607. The Contractor then included the claim in the Notice of Arbitration
for the same amount as that in the Statement at Completion,
US$202’304.20.

10.2 The issues

608. The Claimant relies on the Employer’s and the Engineers
instructions of 26 and 27 December 2002, relating to the location
where guardrails had to be installed.

139

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 142 of 177

609. The Respondent denies that additional quantities and the new rate
had been validly agreed.

610. The issues which must be decided therefore concern the question
whether the length of Guardrails installed exceeds 32.8km and
whether any such exceeding length was instructed by the Engineer.

611. If it is found that the length of Guardrails instructed and installed
exceeds 32.8km, what is the rate to be applied to the exceeding
length?

612. Since the claim was presented in the Statement at Completion and,
following the Engineer’s determination, in the Notice of Arbitration,
the Respondent’s general defence based on time bar is rejected for
the reasons explained above in chapter 7.1.

10.3 The difference about the method of measurement

613. The Contractor and the Engineer differed about the quantity of
Guardrails installed. When comparing the statements of the
Contractor and of the Engineer about these quantities, one notes a
difference in the method of measuring the length of guardrails
installed. This difference must be considered first so that the
information provided by either of them can be properly compared.

614. The Contractor measured the length of installed guardrails by
reference to the total length installed while the Engineer certified
only what he called the “guarded length of guard rails”,37° excluding
in particular the terminals at each end of an installed section.

615. In his witness statement, Mr Asman reported an explanation given
by the Engineer for its position concerning the measurement:

“The Engineer came up with an argument that the guarded length
of the guardrails should be paid and this was less than the total
length of the guardrails installed. He intended not to count the two
end sections of the guardrails, which was never raised before and
not acceptable at all.”371

616. In his letter of 31 October 2005, the Engineer explained the
distinction between, on the one hand, “guarded length” of the
Guardrails and, on the other hand, “terminals”, to which he also
referred to as “anchorage zone”. The Respondent’s expert described
this latter part of the guardrails as “end terminals” or “sloping

sections”;372 they are those parts at the end of each section of the
guardrails which gradually descent into the ground. Mr Alp
explained at the hearing that these end terminals are around 50m
on each side of a section of installed guardrails.373

The Engineer justified the exclusion of the end terminals by stating
that “terminals do not guard veering vehicles”.°74 The Engineer does
not provide any further justification for this exclusion; nor did the
Respondent.

The Tribunal considered that, from the perspective of safety design,
relying on the “guarded length” of guardrails may well have a useful
function. However, when measuring installed material for the
purpose of paying the Contractor for materials provided and work
performed, the material that was actually installed must be
considered.

Both the Claimant’s and the Respondent’s expert have adopted the
same view. Mr Kennedy wrote in the Joint Report:

“The experts agree that the length of guardrails should be
measured on the actual length, irrespective of height thereof,
terminals and slopings should be included.”375

Mr Taft confirmed this in the Joint Report,37° relying on the
explanations in his first report where he had provided the following
explanation:

“I note that Mr Kennedy states that guardrails are measured for
the actual length irrespective of height by reference to extracts of
a method of measurement included at Appendix A1/8 of his
report. The attachments to Mr Kennedy’s report appear to be
extracted from CESMM [Civil Engineering Standard Method of
Measurement]. I cannot see a reference within the Contract that
the Bills of Quantities are measured on the basis of CESMM
however I do note that within the ‘General specifications’ part of
the Contract, item 8.5.3 refers to the measurement and payment
of guardrails which states ‘guardrails shall be measured by the
linear metre ..... On this basis, I consider that the length
measured and applied to the rates should be measured on the
actual length irrespective of height (and therefore terminals and
sloping sections should be included). ...”977

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 144 of 177

621. On this basis the Tribunal concludes that the length of installed
guardrails must not be measured, as the Engineer has done, by
reference to the “guarded length” but by reference to the full length
of guardrails installed.

10.4 The length of Guardrails installed

622. The Contractor provided the following information about the length
of guardrails and concrete parapets:

i) On 22 August 2005, the Contractor wrote that as of 14 August
2005, the quantity of installed guardrails and concrete parapets
had reached 32’776m. The Contractor specified the type and
location of additional guardrails that remained to be installed,
showing a total of 27149m.

ii)

In the letter of 2 September 2005, the Contractor refers to a joint
measurement of the length of guardrails in Section A and
produced copy of a list with measurement, dated 22 June 2005
and bearing two signatures which the Contractor identified as
“topographers of the Contractor and the Engineer”. The
Contractor stated that “the total installed guardrails length is
13’407.09m whereas this should be 10’877m according to the
approved list”.378 The difference is 2’530.09m.

iii) In his letter of 19 December 2005, the Contractor specified the
“actual installed quantities of safety barriers” as 35’108.19m; he
compared it to a limit of 32’776.13m beyond which he said the
rate for “excess quantities” would apply. For the difference of
2’332.06m the Contractor claimed application of the rate of
US$70.379

In the Statement at Completion of 17 March 2006, the Contactor
claimed that he installed 32’776.13m at the rate of US$13; and
2’890.06m “excessive quantity”3®° for which he sought payment
at a rate of US$70 per meter and a total of US$.202’304.20.38!
The “excessive quantity” so claimed is composed of:

e Additional guardrail

(as per the letter of 19 December 2005) 2’332.06
e Reinstated guardrail 368.00
e New concrete parapets 190.00382

The Engineer wrote on 14 December 2005 that, based on his own
assessment, 22’667m of guardrail were installed.285 He seems to
have certified 32’776.13m at the rate of US$13.384 As explained
above, based on his own method of measurement, the Engineer
denied the claim for the additional length claimed by the Contractor.

The Engineer did not provide any measurement on the method
applied by the Contractor which the Tribunal found relevant.

The Parties’ experts have not made their own measurements of the
guardrails.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal must rely on the data provided
by the Claimant to the extent to which the Respondent or the
Engineer were given an opportunity to verify these data. The claim
is based on the quantities presented in the Contractor’s Statement
at Completion and is broken down as shown above.

The Contractor’s letter of 19 December 2005 expressly requested the
Engineer to review his assessment of the guardrail installed. There
is no evidence that the Engineer contradicted the measurement on
the basis of the method which the Tribunal accepted, or provided a
different quantity. The same applies with respect to the Statement
at Completion; the quantities relevant to the present claim, applying
the correct method of measurement, were not contested.

When calculating the additional guardrail quantities, the Tribunal
must bear in mind, as pointed out by Mr Taft,385 that up to 32’800m
the rate of 13US$ in the Bill of Quantities applied. The additional
quantities for which a new rate had to be agreed are those above
32’800m as specified in the December 2002 instructions and not
32’778.13, the quantity certified by the Engineer and described by
the Claimant in the Statement at Completion as “excessive quantity”
for which a new rate had to be applied.

Therefore, 21.87m must be paid at US$13 and 2’310.22m at the
new rate.

10.5 The rate to be applied for the additional quantities

630. The Claimant seeks payment for the entire “excessive quantity”, in
the length of 2’890.06m with payment at the rate of US$70.

631. Respondent objects to the Claim on the grounds that “the Claimant
did not furnish any proofs that it had agreed with the Respondent
the installation of additional safety fences”.8© It also stated that the
new rate for additional guardrails had not been agreed.387

632. The Tribunal has concluded that the Engineer’s method of
measurement was not correct. The quantity of safety barriers was
higher than what the Engineer certified. Even though the
Contractor had informed the Engineer on 22 August 2005 that the
quantity of 32’776m had been reached,°8§ the Engineer gave
instructions to continue installing safety barriers:

“Notwithstanding the above substantiation and agreement of new
unit rate, you are requested without delay to fulfil your obligation
to install safety barriers as per the approved list.”389

633. The Employer’s instructions of 26 December 2002 clearly foresaw
the possibility that the quantities to be installed could exceed
32.8km. The “excess” which did occur is due to the difference in the
method of measurement. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the
full quantities installed must be paid.

634. What remains to be decided is the rate at which these quantities
must be paid.

635. The Claimant seeks payment at the rate of US$70 for all quantities
exceeding 32’776m. It relies on its letter of 22 August 2005 in
which it announced this rate for all installations above this limit.
This letter stated, as quoted above, the rate which the Contractor
intended to apply to the additional quantities specified in the letter.
It concluded by stating:

“Please inform us within 1 week of this letter if the Employer and
the Engineer agree to do the additional 2’149m of guardrails
proposed by the Engineer at the rate given above. If the Engineer
does not reply to this letter within a week, the remaining guardrail
installation works shall be considered to be excluded from the
scope of works.”

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 147 of 177

In his reply of 24 August 2005 the Engineer, as explained above,
contested the Contractor’s statement about the length of the
guardrail installation. As to the rate, the Engineer pointed out that
the rate had to be negotiated with the Employer. The letter
concluded by the Engineer giving the following instruction:

“Notwithstanding the above substantiation and agreement of the
new unit rate, you are required without delay to fulfil your
obligation to install safety barriers as per the approved list.”39°

The Tribunal concludes that, at that time, there was no agreed rate
with respect to the additional quantities of guardrails; but the
Engineer nevertheless instructed the Contractor to proceed.
Therefore, a reasonable rate had to be agreed according to the
instructions given in December 2002 by the Employer and the
Engineer.

After the Engineer had instructed the Contractor to proceed with the
installation of additional guardrail, neither the Engineer nor the
Employer fixed a new rate for the additional guardrail; nor did they
agree to the rate which the Contractor had proposed. Indeed the
Engineer expressly refused to propose or fix a new rate, stating that
“there is no need for a new unit rate”.99!

The Contractor indeed installed additional quantities on the clear
instructions of the Engineer. Both the Employer and the Engineer
had undertaken to agree to a new rate. Thereby, they expressed the
view that the rate contained in the Contract for concrete parapets
was not applicable to the guardrails which the Contractor was
instructed to install and that, above 32.8km, the rate for such
parapets was not applicable.

Therefore, a “suitable rate” had to be agreed upon between the
Engineer and the Contractor according to Clause 52.1 GCC. The
CPA provides a modification to Clause 52.1; but this modification
concerns multiple currencies and is not relevant here. Therefore,
the Engineer had to agree with the Contractor on a new rate for the
guardrails, as this had been confirmed in the instructions of
December 2002.

The difference between the Contractor and the Engineer that
resulted from the Engineer’s refusal to even consider the need for
fixing a new rate constitutes a dispute which can be brought before
the Arbitral Tribunal according to Clause 67 GCC, as the Contractor
has done.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 148 of 177

According to Clause 67.3, the Tribunal has:

“... full power to open up, review and revise any decision, opinion,
instruction, determination, certification or valuation of the
Engineer related to the dispute”.

The Tribunal therefore has power to revise the Engineer’s decision
by which he refused to fix a new rate for guardrails in a length above
32.8km. In so doing, the Tribunal may replace the Engineer’s
decision by what it considers the correct decision which the
Engineer should have taken. This includes fixing the “suitable rate”
for guardrails.

It follows that the Contract contains a detail mechanism which
allows the Tribunal to fix the rate which the Engineer failed to agree
with the Contractor. This rate takes the position of a contractual
rate.

Contrary to what the Respondent argued,°9? Article 665 KCC is not
applicable here. This provision applies to situations where, without
instructions from the employer, the contractor faces circumstances
which require additional work. Here the Contractor was instructed
to perform additional work. Moreover, Article 665 reserves different
regulations in the contract. As just explained, the new rate which
the Tribunal may have to fix for the defaulting Engineer takes the
position of a contractual rate.

Concerning the “suitable rate” for the additional guardrails, the
Tribunal noted that, in the correspondence during course of 2005,
the Contractor claimed US$70 per meter. On this basis, the
Contractor quantified his claim for US$202’304.20. However, no
support was provided for the calculation of this rate.

At the hearing, Mr Asman tried to explain the difference between the
rate of US$13 in the Bill of Quantities and the rate of US$70 in the
claim for additional guardrail. He referred to the time that elapsed
between the bid and the time when the guardrail were delivered and
installed. He also mentioned that the guardrails had to be imported
from Turkey; but he did not provide any calculation to support the
claimed rate and his explanations were not of a nature to justify a
rate anywhere near the US$70 claimed.393

Instead of supporting the US$70 rate, the Contractor produced with
the Statement of Claim, Mr Kennedy’s first expert report which
contains the following passage:

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 149 of 177

“T am instructed that the purchase price in Turkey for guardrails
was US$12.00 per metre and that the transportation costs were a
further US$3.50 per metre and deriving a total of US$15.50 per
metre and to which is added approximately 35% for labour totals
approximating US$20.00 per metre.”394

Mr Kennedy considered a rate of US$20 as reasonable and
confirmed this in the Joint Report.395 Mr Taft agreed that US$20
per metre is a “reasonable rate” for guardrails.39°

The Tribunal has no information which would justify a valuation
different from that of the experts of both Parties. It accepts that the
rate for additional guardrail be US$20 per meter.

The Claim as quantified by the Claimant’s expert also includes
368m of “guardrails dismantled and re-instated due to patchwork
in Section A”. The Engineer had accepted as a matter of principle
that the Contractor was “entitled to be compensated for removal, re-
installation and for new components used as replacement to
damaged/un-recovered components”; but qualified this acceptance
by adding that this “entitlement is only for the locations where
pavement/embankment settlement was not your liability”.”397

The Claimant produced a list with precise indication of the locations
of the work for which it claimed.398 This list shows a “length to be
paid” as 368m. This list has not been contested by the Respondent.
Since the Engineer accepted as a matter of principle that the
Contractor was entitled to compensation and none of the locations
for which the Claimant seeks compensation was contested, the
Tribunal accepts the claimed length of 368m.

The Claimant’s expert quantifies this claim at US$ 2Oper metre.399
However, he does not explain how he reached this rate. Obviously,
dismantling and _ re-installing existing guardrails cannot be
quantified in the same manner as purchasing guardrails in Turkey,
transporting them to the site and installing them.

Mr Taft contests the use of the US$20 rate by Mr Kennedy for this
claim. He allows US$5 for dismantling and US$5 for re-installing
them, i.e. a total of 1OUS$.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 150 of 177

The Tribunal noted that in Mr Kennedy’s calculation of the
additional guardrails, some 4.5US$ was allowed as the cost of the
labour for installing the guardrails. The 5US$ allowed by Mr Taft
each for dismantling and re-installing thus appears as reasonable.
The Tribunal accepts that the work be valued at US$10 per metre.

Finally, the Claimant seeks payment for 190m of new concrete
parapets. In support, it relies on a Work Record Sheet, dated 20
December 2005 and signed by the Contractor and the Engineer.
The sheet requires the Contractor to “Provide and place new
concrete parapets” for total of 190m at identified locations. It has
not been contested that these parapets were placed and have to be
paid for.

By December 2005 the length of safety barriers had exceeded the
32.8m limit. A new rate had to be applied. Mr Kennedy applied the
rate of US$20;40° Mr Taft accepts that this is a “reasonable rate”.401
The Tribunal has no reason to disagree. It accepts that 190m of
new parapet be paid at US$20.

In conclusion, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant is entitled to
the following payment:
21.87m at US$13 284.31
2’310.22m at US$20 46’204.40
368.00m at US$10 3’680.00

11. THE CLAIM FOR VALUE ADDED TAX

The Claimant seeks US$185’748.62 as reimbursement of VAT paid
on small purchases in the Kyrgyz Republic.

The Respondent denies the claim, arguing that the contractual VAT
exemption concerned only payments made by the Employer to the
Contractor. Moreover, the Respondent argues that the Claimant
failed to follow proper procedures for claiming VAT reimbursement.

The Contract provides in Clause 73.2 CPA for an express exemption
for “Value Added Tax on payments from the Employer to the
Contractor”. The present claim does not concern VAT on such
payments. The Respondent argues that Clause 73.2 does not apply
to the VAT reimbursement sought here by the Claimant.4°2

The Claimant argues that, in addition to the VAT exemption on
payments by the Employer to the Contractor, it did not have to pay
VAT on purchases for major items in the Kyrgyz Republic.4° At the
hearing, Dr Gokyayla explained that “the Minister of Finance
provided Entes with a document demonstrating that Entes had VAT
exemption”;#04 adding that “for a big item like bitumen, gas, oil et
cetera, this VAT exemption document worked and Entes did not pay
VAT”.405 Mr Ozkoseoglu explained:

“So, if we were to procure 500’000 tonnes of diesel, that would
take one paper permit from the Ministry of Finance, and the
Ministry of Transport to Ministry of Finance and then this
transaction would take place.”406

In his witness statement, Mr Alp summarised the situation as
follows:

“As ENTES we were exempt from VAT during the course of the
project and we did not pay for VAT for most of the purchases we
made for the Project. It was easy to do this for big quantity
purchases but it was not practical or easy for small purchases
because we had to get the exemption documents each time. For
example, we purchase 500 $ worth of stationary for JOC from a
local shop. Of course the shop does not know anything about our
VAT exemption and charges us the VAT. The total of these VAT’s

paid were submitted to the Engineer at the end of the project but
the Engineer did not certify them.”407

The purchases to which the claim relates were for minor items, such
as purchases made for the Engineer like “tyres for their cars, office
supplies” or “food supplies for the site office and other things”-4°8 In
the words of Mr Ozkoseoglu:

“So, if we were to pay tomatoes, potatoes, office supplies, that
would mean that each individual item would mean a permit from
the Ministry of Transport to the Ministry of Finance, so we could
not do this.”409

In the Statement at Completion of 17 March 2006, the Contractor
included a claim item in the above mentioned amount for VAT
receivables, explaining the following:

“The Contractor was exempt from VAT in Kyrgyz Republic. The
amount of VAT that the Contractor has actually paid and has
become a receivable from Employer is attached.”4!9

The attachment referred to in this passage shows simply the total
amount of VAT paid in each of the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 in
som and the corresponding US Dollar amount.#!!

The Claimant explains that, following a request by the Engineer in a
letter of 11 April 2006,*!2 it submitted on 17 April 2006, “2 folders of
VAT receipts in substantiation of its claim to the Engineer”.4!3 The
Contractor’s letter of 17 April 2006 consists of a list of 9 items of
documentation communicated to the Engineer; one of which is
entitled “VAT receipts - 2 FOLDERS”.*!4 The Claimant states that,
these folders contained its evidence for the quantum of this claim
and that it has not kept any copies.

The Engineer addressed the claim in its Determination of 18 May
2006, stating:

“The Engineer cannot verify the validity of the claim from the
documents submitted by the Contractor. It must be pointed out
that VAT payments might have been inadvertently compensated
as part of Special Material price escalation (due to uncertainty

whether procurement price includes VAT or not). It is also
necessary for the Contractor to substantiate why he did not use
his VAT exemption status to exclude VAT for purchases he made
for the project in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan.”415

The claim was then included in the Notice of Dissatisfaction of 22
December 2006 and in the Notice of Arbitration of 15 January 2009.
For the reasons explained above in chapter 7.1, the Respondent’s
general defence based on time bar therefore must be rejected.

The only contractual provision on which the Claimant relies in
support of this claim is Clause 73.2 CPA.41© The quoted passage
above shows that this clause provides VAT exemption for payments
by the Employer to the Contractor and not for a claim for VAT paid
on purchases from third parties.

The Employer arranged a procedure through which the Contractor
benefitted from VAT exemption with respect to purchases from third
parties. But the Contractor did not use this procedure in order to
obtain VAT exemption for the smaller purchases which form the
basis for the present claim. It may well be that this procedure was
not suited for such smaller purchases.

The Tribunal notes, however, that, throughout the performance of
the work, the Claimant did not raise the matter with the Engineer or
the Employer, in order to find an alternative and more practicable
approach. Mr Ozkoseoglu was expressly asked whether the
Contractor made “an application or a request to the engineer or to
the employer to change the procedure so that it is workable for the
small items”. The Contractor did not do so.4!7 The first time that
the Contractor claimed for the VAT on the small purchases was in
the Statement at Completion.4!8

At the hearing, the Claimant argued that the Contractor had
intended to use the VAT payments made on small purchases as a
credit in the final settlement with the tax authorities.4!9 In the Post
Hearing Brief, the Claimant developed this basis for the claim: “The
Claimant maintains that there would have been the possibility to set
off the claims the Government had against the Claimant with the
amount of VAT paid on the small amounts accounts.”429 The
Claimant also explained:

“The legal ground of this claim is the Employer’s obligation to
cooperate and to eliminate the obstacles of the project. Article 671
of Kyrgyz CC provides for the cooperation of the parties under
construction work contracts and the Employer’s duties to
eliminate the obstacle whenever they occur.

The Claimant maintains that as part of its obligations to cooperate
and eliminate the obstacles the Employer Ministry could and
should have made the necessary arrangements with the Claimant
to set off its tax debt (such as income tax) to the Kyrgyz Finance
Ministry.”4?!

Mr Ozkoseoglu stated the Contractor communicated directly with
the tax authority:

“In return they asked for an authorisation letter from the Ministry
of Transport, and that letter came through the engineer’s
approval, which never came.”422

As the testimony progressed, the account of the steps taken became
less and less precise. In the end the Tribunal summarised the
explanations in the following terms:

“The only time when you requested the engineer or the employer
to certify that you paid this VAT so that you could set it off against
your tax obligations was in the statement at completion?

Mr OZKOSEOGLU: That is correct, sir.”423

Now, the above examination of the relevant passages of the
Statement at Completion has shown that there is no reference to a
certification for the purpose of enabling the Contractor to set off the
VAT paid against the outstanding claims from the tax authorities.
Quite to the contrary, the Contractor claimed the VAT not for set off
against such claims from the tax authorities but sought certification
from the Engineer for payment by the Employer.

The Tribunal concludes that there is no evidence that the Contractor
made an attempt to recover the VAT payments by way of set off
against other tax claims and that he was prevented from doing so by
the Engineer’s denial of the claim in the Statement at Completion.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal need not examine whether the
Contractor was entitled to such a set off and, if so, whether the
amount of such a set off was that claimed in the arbitration. The

12. THE CLAIM FOR ROAD AND EMERGENCY TAX

The Claimant seeks reimbursement of US$39’969.47 on account of
road and emergency tax paid to the Kyrgyzstan Republic.

The Respondent accepts, as a matter of principle, that the Claimant
is entitled to the reimbursement of payments made on account of
this tax; but it requires evidence to show that such payments were
made and the amount of the payments.

The Claimant relies on item 14 of the Minutes of Contract
negotiations:

“The local taxes of 0.8 % (road tax) and 1.5 % (emergency tax) are
not included in the unit rates amounting to approximately US
896’000.-. This amount will be reimbursed from the local portion
to the Contractor if the taxes are paid to the government.”

It is undisputed that, during the course of the performance of the
work, the Contractor included in his payment application amounts
for road and emergency tax and that these amounts were certified
and paid by the Employer. The amount in this claim concerns,
according to the Claimant, Certificate N° 35 with respect to which
the Engineer deducted the sum of US$39’969.47.424

The claim was presented in the Statement at Completion under the
heading of Works Executed and described as follows: “Road tax and
emergency tax amounts deducted in Certificate No. 35 are included
in this certificate”.425

In his Determination, the Engineer responded by stating that he had

“... dealt with this subject in detail in the past and required the
Contractor to substantiate his claim. He has not substantiated his
claim.” 426

The claim was included in the Notice of Dissatisfaction and in the
Notice of Arbitration. For the reasons explained above in chapter
7.1, the Respondent’s general defence based on time bar therefore
must be rejected.

At the hearing the Respondent stated:

“Respondent is ready to make the payment for the road tax and
emergency tax if they will give us the receipts that they paid,
because otherwise they will not be able to release money from the
Ministry. It is obligatory if they are paying they should keep their
receipts” 427

The Claimant responded the following day:

“Claimant looked at his remaining documents but we were
informed that the originals of the documents proving that these
taxes were paid were delivered as an attachment of each IPC
[Interim Payment Certificate] to the employer or to the engineer.”428

The Tribunal invited the Claimant to identify the IPC with which the
supporting documentation had been submitted. Dr Gokyayla
announced that she would consult with the client on this.4?9

In its Final Submission, the Respondent referred to this exchange
and confirmed its willingness to pay as follows:

“... the Respondent agreed to pay to the Claimant the road and
emergency tax, provided that the Claimant would fulfil the
requirement of the Arbitral Tribunal and submit the documents
proving that the Claimant had effected respective payments to the
state” 430

The Claimant also relied on the quoted statement as an acceptance
of liability. It did not provide any additional evidence for the
payment of the tax, nor did it identify the IPC to which the relevant
payment documentation was attached. It merely stated that “the
Engineer has not challenged that the Claimant paid this tax to the
Kyrgyz authorities”.43!

The Tribunal considered the information according to which these
two categories of taxes were levied on all businesses in Kyrgyzstan
and were assessed on the profit or revenue of the business.*82. Mr
Asman explained that the Contractor “was paying [the tax] to the
related tax department and we were putting these receipts in our
certificates for repayment”.485 Indeed, the IPCs which have been
produced during the course of the arbitration contain a standard

entry for “provision of Emergency Tax” and “Provision of Road
Tax” 434

692. The Certificates produced do not show any indication that
documents evidencing the tax payments in question were attached.
In any event, the Respondent rightly points out that it would be
surprising that the Contractor passed the originals of supporting
documentation for the tax payments to the Employer or the
Engineer with the IPC without keeping at least a copy of this
documentation:

“According to the laws of Kyrgyz Republic, they were to keep
accounting books and they could not pass the originals of the
documents to the employer. ”435

693. The Tribunal also considered the letter of the Engineer of 20 June
2008 in which he addressed the issue of these tax payments. In
this letter, the Engineer does indeed state that the:

“... certificates have included tax amount in excess of the total
due. We requested you to submit original invoices/receipts of
tax payments and cumulative amount in tabular form. However,
you have not responded to our letters”.

694. The letter continued by calculating the tax due and the tax
reimbursed and concluded that up to Interim Certificate N° 33, the
Contractor had received an “apparent net overpayment” of
US$917162.90. The letter concluded by the following passage:

“Please be notified that we will adjust this over-reimbursement in
your next interim payment certificate as an interim measure. A
final tally of reimbursements will be made at the final certification
stage at which time you will be required to submit us with
‘Certified true copies’ of tax receipts.

In the meantime, you may apply for refunding (or offset against
other taxes you may owe) of the above amount from tax
authorities producing your tax receipts and a letter from the
Employer certifying the above account.”436

695. There is no evidence to show that the Contractor protested against
the statement in this letter, pointing out to the Engineer that he was
wrong and that the originals of the tax receipts or other evidence
had been produced.

in effect he paid more to the tax authorities on account of road and
emergency tax than was actually reimbursed to him by the
Employer.

The claim is dismissed.

13. THE CLAIM FOR CONTRACTOR’S EQUIPMENT DAMAGED
DURING THE POLITICAL UNREST

698. The Contractor claims US$39’490 for damage to the Contractor's
equipment during political unrest in April 2005. The identified
damage concerns “electrical feeding cables of batching plant”.

699. In addition to the general objection based on jurisdiction and time
bar, the Respondent denies the claim in particular in arguing that
the Claimant failed to establish a causal link between the unrest
and the damage claimed.

700. In a letter dated 14 May 2005, the Contractor referred to the
“current situation which exists in the Employer’s Country”. He
explained that on the day before his “Turkish staff was stopped ...
by a crowd of over 150 protesting locals and were threatened and
denied through passage ...”. The letter continues to state:

“During the week, some unknown protestors cut the electric cable
feeding our batching plant and stole the cables. Consequently we
could not operate the plant.”437

701. The Contractor also produced with a letter of 22 April 2005 two
police certificates, one confirming that on 5 April 2005 the “electrical
cables of batching plant” had been cut and stolen, the other
confirming the incident of 13 April 2005 with 150 “local
protesters”.488

702. In the Statement at Completion, the Contractor claimed the above
mentioned amount for “damage to the Contractor’s equipment
during political unrest and revolution in Kyrgyzstan in April 2005”.
The attached quantification of the claim consisted of a number of
items of which the smallest was that for the cables (US$490). The
principal items were described as “Damaged Parts of the Batching
Plant” (US$15’000), “Damaged Precast Elements” (US$5’000),
“Installation Workmanship” and “Repair Workmanship”
(US$16’000).

703. In his Determination of 18 May 2005, the Engineer denied the
claim, giving the following reason:

“The Engineer awards zero amount because the damage due to
unrest was not the fault of the Employer. The Engineer based his

determination on Sub-clause 54.2 of GCC ‘Employer not liable for

damages”.

The claim was not included in the Notice of Dissatisfaction of 22
December 2006 nor in the Notice of arbitration of 15 January 2006.
In the arbitration, the claim was first presented in the Statement of
Claim of 15 March 2010.

The Tribunal concludes that more than three years elapsed since
the Engineer’s determination of 18 May 2005. For the reasons
explained above in chapter 7.1, the claim is time barred.

In any event, the Tribunal notes that, even if it had not been time
barred, the claim would have failed for lack of a legal basis and for
insufficient quantification.

In order to present a legal basis for this claim, the Claimant refers to
Clause 54.2 and 65.1 to 65.3 GCC and 20.4 CPA.*” These clauses
provide some exemptions of liability for the Contractor. Only Clause
65.3 GCC provides a basis under which the Contractor is “entitled
to payment”. However, the payment provided in this clause is for
damage and destruction to the Permanent Works and to “materials
and Plant”. Plant is defined in Clause 1.1 (f) (iv) as “machinery,
apparatus and the like intended to form or forming part of the
Permanent Works”. It is distinguished from the “Contractor’s
Equipment”. The batching plant and cable for its operation form
part of the Contractor’s equipment; damage to them does not entitle
the Contractor to any payment.

Moreover, there are serious reasons supporting the Respondent’s
objections concerning the link of causation between the events of
unrest on which the Claimant relies and the claimed damage. The
Claimant makes no attempt to link theft of cable with the unrest
which occurred only 8 days later and to show that this theft was not
just an ordinary criminal act, rather than a Special Risk according
to Clause 65 GCC. Similarly, it is difficult to see how the theft of
cable worth US$490 led to the other items forming part of the
Claimant’s calculation.

For all these reasons the claim must be dismissed.

14. INTERAKT CASE

The Claimant seeks payment of US$379.519,65 as damages for
having had to pay to Interakt, its subcontractor for drainage works,
this sum due to “decisions of the Courts of Kyrgyzstan”. The
Claimant attributes these decisions to “incorrect information

submitted by the Employer to the Court Officials”.44!

The Claimant explains that the works performed by Interakt were
defective and rejected by the Engineer. According to the Claimant, it
was eventually paid for these works, but only after it had redone the
work of Interakt at its own expense.*42 Therefore, it refused to pay
Interakt but, as a result of the court decisions, had to make the
claimed payments to Interakt.

The Claimant relies on Article 9 KCC, providing that a person
intending to cause harm and committing abuse of rights shall pay
damages.

In support of the quantification of the amount claimed, the Claimant
submits a number of documents apparently in Russian without
translation. The Claimant’s expert stated: “I cannot understand
such documents and I am therefore unable to comment”.*43

The Respondent objects that the claim falls outside the scope of the
arbitration clause and therefore the present Tribunal has no
jurisdiction.*4+ On the merits the Respondent states that it did not
intervene voluntarily but was made a party to the court case.445 It
denies that its representative made false statements and argues
that, if the Claimant was of the view that the court decision was the
result of false statements, the Claimant should have appealed the
decision and pursued the person who had made the statement.*46©

Concerning the question of jurisdiction, Clause 67.1 gives a very
wide scope to the arbitration clause. It applies to any “dispute of
any kind whatsoever” which “arises between the Employer and the
Contractor in connection with, or arising out of, the Contract or the
execution of the works”. The present claim concerns the
performance of a part of the work and allegedly wrongful payment
for this part to a subcontractor as a result of the conduct of the

Employer. The dispute is in “in connection with” the execution of
the works. The Tribunal has jurisdiction.

The Tribunal points out, however, that its jurisdiction does not
concern the question as to whether the courts of the Kyrgyz
Republic have correctly decided the dispute between Entes and
Interakt. This tribunal merely has to decide whether the
Respondent wrongfully intervened in the relations between the
Contractor and one of his subcontractors and caused damage to the
Contractor in the amount claimed.

The claim was included in the Statement at Completion and was
denied in the Engineer’s Determination on the grounds that it did
“not fall within the jurisdiction of the Engineer’s Decision”.*47

However, the claim was included neither in the Notice of
Dissatisfaction nor in the Notice of Arbitration. It was raised only in
the Statement of Claim of 15 March 2010, more than three years
after the claim had been denied by the Engineer’s determination.
The claim is time barred.

In any event, even if it would not have been time barred, it would
have had to be rejected. The Contractor has failed to show that the
decision of the courts in Kyrgyztan were wrong to order the
Claimant to make the payments and, if they had been wrong, that
this was caused by the Respondent.

The Contractor has failed to produce any documents concerning the
court proceedings. The only documents which are in the record are
English translations of two court orders of 15 January and 2
February 2004 and a decision of 15 January 2004. The decision
seems to be the last step in a long sequence of decisions: after
decisions by the “Arbitration court of Bishkek” and a “Decree of the
Appellate Instance” of this court in 2002 in favour of Interakt, the
Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz Republic revoked the decisions and
referred the case to the “Bishkek municipal court” which, by a
decision of 5 November 2003, seemed to have admitted the claim of
Interakt in an amount of US$169’267.25.

The decision produced is made by “the Presidium of the Biskek
Municipal Court” and dated 15 January 2004.** It seems to be a
decision on appeal against the decision of 5 November 2003. In the
decision on appeal, the court examined in some detail the relations
between the Contractor and its subcontractor and the obligations in
case of defective work and the payment conditions under the
subcontract of the Entes with Interakt.

As to the role of Mr Isakov, the representative of the Employer in these
proceedings, Mr Alp stated in his witness statement:

“the Head of PIU, Mr. Erkin Isakov actually went to court and
testified that the subcontractor was right and the Contractor was
wrong and these amounts should be paid to the Subcontractor.
We lost 3 cases because of this faulty witness, Head of PIU”.449

722. Mr Murat Ozkoseoglu gave the following explanations regarding said
testimony:

“Even the Employer's Representative (P IV) gave false testimony in
the local courts, denying the evident fact that a Subcontractor had
failed to execute works to the satisfaction of the Engineer, and as
a result of this false testimony the Contractor was forced to pay
for Works that had been rejected by the Engineer’ .4°°

723. At the hearing, the Tribunal enquired whether there was any evidence
of what Mr Isakov said. The Claimant explained that the only evidence
was a passage in the court decision and Mr Alp’s witness statement,
just quoted. However, Mr Alp admitted that he was not present in the
court proceedings. He was informed by the Contractor’s lawyer who
had told him the following:

“The court case was about the executed quantities and we had
the reports from the engineer as well. Their report was that they
had done the job and Mr Isakov confirmed that he had done that
amount, but where we had the engineer’s amounts were less.”45!

724. The relevant passage in the court decision is in the following terms:

“A representative of the Ministry of Transport and
Communications of the KR as the third party without independent
claims has clarified in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute
that the NCW-OO Contract for the reconstruction of the 36
Bishkek-Osh road of 30 August 1999 between the Ministry of
Transport and Communications and the Turkish firm "Entes"
provided for no protocol of conditional acceptance of works under
the section was [sic]. Article 48.1. of the Contract provides for the
Acceptance certificate between the customer and the contractor
upon completion of all works for the reconstruction of the Bishkek-
Osh road. In respect of the section of works performed by the
subcontractor "Interact" the payment for the works was effected in

full after inspection and approval of the work of the Japanese
company by the "Engineer and acceptance by the Contractor” .*5?

725. The passage states that the Employer paid the Contractor after the
work had been inspected and approved by the Engineer. Compared to
the circumstances as described by the Claimant, the Tribunal cannot
see any false testimony in the reported statement; nor does it see a
wrongful influence on the court and its decision. The Claimant has
failed to show the alleged wrongful interference. If it were not time

15. DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE ROAD GRADER CASE

The Claimant seeks payment of US$123’936.54. The claim is related
to a lease agreement for a grader concluded between the Contractor
and Bishkek-Osh Road department. The grader was burnt and
destroyed completely on 2 September 2002.53 The Department
claimed against the Contractor for the value of the Grader and
prevailed.454 The Contractor did not pay the amount and the
Department seized some of the Contractor’s equipment. Eventually,
the Contractor paid the amount now claimed and, after some difficulty,
recovered the equipment seized.

Concerning the quantum of this claim, the joint report of the experts
states:

“Neither expert is able to verify the amount of US$123’936.54 as
we cannot understand the supporting documents. ”455

The Respondent denies that this dispute is covered by the arbitration
clause. It argues that the lessor, the Bishkek-Osh Road Department is
a different entity. In any event, the Respondent argues that the matter
has been decided by the courts of the Kyrgyz Republic and the
Claimant may not reopen the case in the arbitration.

The claim was presented in the Statement at Completion. In his
Determination, the Engineer takes the following position:

“The Engineer understands that this matter has been settled
between the parties separately. Notwithstanding amicability of
the settlement between the parties, the engineer assess this is a
private matter outside the Contract and should be dealt by the
two parties within a court of law as a private matter of [ifP] a
dispute exists. ”456

The claim was not included in the Notice of Dissatisfaction nor in the
Notice of Arbitration. It was introduced in the arbitration only by the
Statement of Claim of 15 March 2010. For the reasons explained
above, the claim is time barred.

In any event, even if the claim had not been time barred, it would have
to be dismissed:

The Tribunal has jurisdiction, to the extent to which the claim
concerns matters “between the Employer and the Contractor in
connection with, or arising out of, the Contract or the execution of the
works”, as provided by Clause 67 GCC.

However, the claim has been decided by the courts of the Kyrgyz
Republic. The Claimant has not argued that these courts were
wrongfully seized and that it raised the arbitration defence in the court
proceedings. Therefore, the decision of the Kyrgyz courts are binding.

The claim must be dismissed.

16. THE CLAIM FOR THE DEBTS OF THE NOMINATED
SUBCONTRACTOR JASU

The Claimant seeks payment of US$40’639.23 for losses that arose
from the subcontract with JASU, a nominated subcontractor for
bridgework at Sargata. JASU performed poorly and the contract was
terminated. By the time it was terminated, the Contractor had made
payments exceeding the value of the work performed by JASU. The
Claimant holds the Respondent liable for the resulting loss. The
Claimant’s expert is “unable to verify the figure claimed”.457

The Respondent contests jurisdiction and denies liability for the
Claimant’s subcontractors.

The claim was presented in the Statement at Completion. In his
Determination, the Engineer stated that he did not “approve this due
to lack of substantiation”.

The claim was included in the Notice of Dissatisfaction and in the
Notice of Arbitration. It is not time barred.

The Tribunal considered that as a matter of principle, the Contractor is
responsible for his subcontractors and cannot claim from the
Employer losses caused by their poor performance.

The matter may be different to some extent in the case of nominated
subcontractors. This may be the case in particular in cases where the
employer imposes on a contractor a nominated subcontractor who is
not capable to perform the work properly. In the present case, JASU
may have not been fully qualified for the work which it had to perform,
a matter on which the Tribunal need not make any finding.

However, the damage for which the Claimant seeks compensation
relates to the amounts by which JASU was overpaid. In the absence of
verifiable data, the Tribunal cannot make a finding whether JASU was
indeed overpaid; again the matter need not be decided.

If indeed JASU was paid more than it had earned by its work and the
Contractor was unable to recover the overpayment, this falls in the
area of the Contractor’s own responsibility. Even in the case of a
nominated subcontractor, the main contractor is responsible for the
proper management of the subcontractors.

744. In the present case the Contractor made payments which exceeded the
value of the work performed by JASU. The Contractor may have had
good reason for doing so; but this is his risk. The Contractor has not
shown that it was required by the Employer to make such
overpayments.

745. The Tribunal concludes that the Contractor bore the risk for the
overpayment and cannot recover the overpaid amounts from the
Employer.

746. The claim must be dismissed.

17. INTEREST

The Claimant seeks interest on the amounts claimed “for the period
between outstanding date and the date of the payment of the amounts
claimed, and a fine.” In the Statement of Claim it relied on Article 360
KCC.458 In the Final Submission, the Claimant relied on Kyrgyz law
and referred to the Submission on Legal Grounds.*59

In the Submission on Legal Grounds the Claimant explained first the
position under the Contract, stating that it “maintains that Sub-clause
60.8 of the CPA which provides for the contractual interest shall be
applied to the interest on the Claimant’s claim in this arbitration”.+©° It
explained that the rate applicable rate was LIBOR plus 2%. After
having discussed the contractual provisions and stating that “under
the principle of freedom of contract the contractual rates should be
applied, the Claimant went on to state that, nevertheless, it “would like
to explain the interest under Article 360”.46! The relief sought in this
submission requested that the “interest rate pursuant to contract or
the legal interest rate under Kyrgyz Law (whichever is higher)” be
applied, plus “a fine”.

With respect to the starting date for the interest calculation, the
Claimant relied on the “outstanding date”.462 In the Submission on
Legal Grounds, the Claimant referred to the provisions of Clause 60.8
CPA. It took the Statement at Completion as the reference date and
stated that interest “accrued from the 57 day following this
statement. The Statement at Completion having been submitted on 17
March 2006, the Claimant presented 13 May 2006 as starting date for
interest.463

In the Statement of Defence the Respondent confirmed the terms of
Article 360 KCC concerning the requirement of paying interest in case
of delay and an additional penalty of 5% in case the payment relates to
“entrepreneurial activity”. It denied argued that the Claimant’s claims
were unfounded and therefore had to be dismissed as unfounded. The
Respondent concluded: “Since the Respondent has no overdue debts
towards the Claimant the provisions of Article 360 of the CC KR may
not be applicable to the Respondent”.+6+

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 171 of 177

The Respondent did not consider the case in which the Tribunal would
find that some amounts were due to the Claimant; nor did it address
the contractual basis of the interest claim.

In its Final Submission the confirmed this position by referring to the
explanations in the Statement of Defence.46>

In Article 360 KCC the law of Kyrgyzstan provides for the payment of
interest on debts in default, including a 5% penalty on debts.
However, as the Claimant rightly pointed out, the parties to a contract
may make different arrangements for the payment of interest and
“ander the principle of freedom to contract the contractual rates
should be applied”.+6¢

The Tribunal therefore turns to Clause 60.8 CPA, entitled “Time of
Payment and Interest”. The relevant passage has been quoted above in
Section 9.1. It provides for payment “within 56 days after the
Contractor’s monthly statement has been submitted to the Engineer
for certification”. Clause 60.10 requires the Engineer to certify
payment of amounts in the Statement at Completion in accordance
with Clause 60.2, the provision dealing with monthly payment. The
Tribunal concludes that the 56 days payment period applies to
payment pursuant to the Statement at Completion, as argued by the
Claimant.

The interest payments under Clause 60.8 are “compounded monthly at
the rates stated in the Appendix to Tender upon all sums unpaid from
the date upon which the same should have been paid, in the
currencies in which the payments are due”.

With respect to Clause 60.8 the “Appendix to Bid” provides as “Rate of
interest upon unpaid sums”:

“2 percent above the official rate of commercial payments in
interest for daily borrowing as published by the National Bank of
the Kyrgyz Republic for local currency; for other currencies refer to
the table below.”

The table shows “LIBOR + 2%”. This is indeed the rate to which the
Claimant referred when explaining the contractual interest rate.+°7 The
provision quoted does not specify which LIBOR rate is applicable; and
the Claimant does not do so either. Since Clause 60.8 provides for
monthly compounding, the Tribunal concludes that the appropriate
interest rate is the monthly LIBOR rate plus 2%.

758. The claims considered in this arbitration and awarded have been
submitted in the Statement at Completion. To the extent to which the
where justified, they had to be paid within 56 days. As from the 57
day, i.e. 13 May 2007, the Employer is in default according to Clause
60.8 CPA and must pay interest at the contractual rate of LIBOR one
month plus 2%.

759. This contractual interest provision replaces the legal regime under
Kyrgyz law, as the Claimant rightly pointed out.468 The fine of
additional 5%, as provided by Article 360 (3) KCC, does not apply.

18. THE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION AND THEIR
ALLOCATION

Under Article 38 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the “arbitral
tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award”. These costs
include in particular the arbitrators’ costs and expenses, cost and
expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal and the costs for
legal representation and assistance. Article 40 then provides for the
allocation of these costs.

18.1 The Arbitral Tribunal’s fees and expenses

In the Procedural Calendar and Directions, the Arbitral Tribunal
assessed the volume of work required for dealing with the case and the
corresponding fees at US$420'000 and the required costs at
US$30'000. The Tribunal invited the Parties to pay in equal shares
and at successive stages of the arbitration the amount of US$450’000.
The Respondent failed to pay its share and the Claimant alone paid
the full amount of the deposit.

As can be seen from this award, the issues that had to be decided were
complex and required extensive work from the Tribunal. The Presiding
Arbitrator spent in total 410 hours; the other arbitrators spent time of
acomparable importance. Despite a scope of work which exceeded the
estimated amount of work, the Tribunal decided not to increase the
fees beyond the original estimate.

The Tribunal therefore fixed the fees at US$420’000, of which US$
126000 for each of the co-arbitrators and US$168’000 to the Presiding
Arbitrator.

The cost and expenses of the Tribunal consisted primarily of the costs
of the hearing in Bishkek, including travel, accommodation, transcript,
shipment of documents, the cost and fees of the Tribunal’s expert and
its administrative secretary. These costs and expenses have been
accounted for in a separate procedural order and amount to a total of
US$175’000.

This amount falls short of the deposited amount by US$ 145’000. The

Tribunal ordered the payment of this amount by the Parties in equal
shares.

18.2 The Parties’ costs

At the invitation of the Tribunal the Parties submitted their claims for
costs and fees engaged in this arbitration.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 174 of 177

In its submission of 6 February 2015 the Claimant sought in total an
amount of US$1’335’068.37, consisting of the following positions, all
expressed in US Dollars converted at the exchange rate prevailing at
the day of the respective invoices:

(i) 450’000 deposit paid to the Arbitral Tribunal;

(ii) 170°061.47 fees of its Turkish counsel (Akinci Law Firm), not
including a 5% success fee;

(iii) | 11’413.80 fees of its Kyrgyz lawyers (Kalikova & Associates);

(iv) 600 fees for Onik Financial Law Company;

(v) 169’451.58 Expert Report of Navigant Consulting;

(vi) 505’609.37 Expert report of Hill International;

(vii) 4’403.32 travel expenses of the experts;

(viii) 5’302.77 travel expenses of counsel;

(ix) | 2’385.00 accommodation of the experts;

(x) 8’540.69 accommodation of counsel;

(xi) | 2’500 charges for the teleconference during the hearing;

(xii) 4’800.37 courier service (DHL).

The Respondent objected that the submission was not supported by
“primary documentation” and stated that only those costs of the
Claimant may be accepted that were supported by such
documentation.*®?

In its submission of 3 February 2015 the Respondent claimed a total
amount of US$ 487’238 for expenses incurred during the course of the
arbitration, composed of the following positions, expressed in the US$
equivalent:

(i) 130’000 for legal advisors (Partner LLC and Professor Vilkova
N.G.);

(ii) 3137000 for expert reports and attendance at the hearing (EC
Harris);

(iii) | 2’642 expenses at the hearing;

(iv) 41'596 taxes.

The Respondent argued that it had spent US$165’000 and US$26’000,
included in the above claim, on fees to its experts, responding to the
initial claim by the Claimant. Since the initial case of the Claimant was
modified at the hearing, these initial expenses had become
“redundant”. Therefore, it should be reimbursed for these fees,
irrespective of the outcome of the case.*7° In the cost submission of
3 February 2015, the Respondent confirmed this request.

In its response of 20 February 2015 the Claimant did not object to the
claim for arbitration costs by the Respondent. It did, however, contest

the Respondent’s argument that the two amounts presented as
redundant expert costs should be awarded in any event. In particular
it pointed out that the initial report of Mr Wiseman to which the
Respondent’s experts had responded, was not withdrawn so that there
is no basis for awarding in any event the costs for responding to this
initial report.

18.3 The allocation of the costs of the arbitration

Article 40 (1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides that the
costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful
party.

In the present case, the Claimant obtained approximately two thirds of
the amounts claimed. From a purely financial point of view, this might
lead to a cost decision in which the Respondent must bear two thirds
of the arbitration costs.

However, the situation presents itself differently if one considers the
claims individually. Apart from the claim for prolongation costs, the
Claimant presented eight individual claims of which six were rejected
and two were admitted partially. The claim for prolongation costs, by
far the most important one, was composed of claims for the five EOTs,
for Winter Breaks, Lost Days and Head Office Overheads. One of these
claim components was rejected and all the others were accepted only
in reduced amounts.

The Tribunal also takes into consideration that the Claimant
substantially modified its position at the hearing, which rendered
“redundant” some of the earlier submissions and expert reports of
both Parties. Such changes in a party’s position are not unusual in
arbitration proceedings and may well be considered reactions to the
evolution of the case. In the present instance, the change in the
Claimant’s position brought some simplification for the case as it had
to be addressed both by the Respondent and the Tribunal.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal is sympathetic to the argument raised by
the Respondent according to which the costs for its experts could have
been less had their assignment been from the outset to respond to the
Claimant’s case as it was eventually made.

In view of these considerations, the Tribunal reduces the share of the
costs to be borne by the Respondent and decides that the Parties shall
bear the cost of the arbitration in equal shares.

Consequently, the Parties shall bear their own costs and each of the

Parties shall bear one half of the costs and fees of the Arbitral
Tribunal.

173

778.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1-3 Filed 09/26/18 Page 176 of 177

Since the Claimant has advanced the full amount of the deposit for the
Arbitral Tribunal in an amount of US$ 450’000, the Respondent shall
pay to the Claimant one half of this amount, i.e. US$225’000.
Concerning the additional amount requested by the Tribunal in the
Procedural Order concerning the Tribunal’s costs not covered by the
deposit, the Parties were ordered to pay this amount in equal shares. If
one of the Parties pays the share of the other, it shall be entitled to
recover that share from the other.
