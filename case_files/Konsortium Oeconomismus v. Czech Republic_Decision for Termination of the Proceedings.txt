3.6 Further proceedings

96, A calendar on the merits, if necessary, will be drawn up with the Parties in due course,

By communication dated 28 October 2011, Claimant provided its comments on
Respondent’s letter of 6 September 2011,

Claimant failed to submit its Statement of Claim on or before 1 November 2011.

By letter dated 2 November 2011, Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal terminate

the present arbitral proceedings pursuant to Article 30(1) of the 2010 UNCITRAL

Arbitration Rules for the following reasons: ‘

. Claimant was notified by the Arbitral Tribunal that it if failed to submit its
Statement of Claim within the deadline set by the Arbitral Tribunal, the arbitral

proceedings could be terminated, Claimant failed to submit its Statement of
Claim by the imparted deadline;

. Claimant did not request an extension of time or explain its failure to submit its
Statement of Claim;

* The Arbitral Tribunal stressed that the Statement of Claim would not be deemed
to be submitted if Claimant failed to provide the Czech originals of both the First
and Second Powers of Attorney. Claimant failed to provide the Czech originals
of the First and Second Powers of Attorney by 1 November 2011. The document
attached to JUDr ; ‘s email dated 13 September 2011 cannot be the Czech
version of the full power of substitution signed by Messrs. : and‘
because the English version is dated 24 August 2011; and

. None of the powers of attorney provided by Claimant comply with the directions
of the Arbitral Tribunal set out in its letter dated 22 August 2011 or prove JUDr.
i *s or JUDr *s capacity to act for Claimant in this arbitration.

In its. letter dated 2 November 2011, Respondent further requested that Claimant be ordered
to bear its own costs of the arbitration and to reimburse Respondent for the costs of the
arbitration in the amount of CZK 7,958,422.13 pursuant to Article 42(1) of 2010
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and Article 9(2)(d) of the Treaty.

According to Respondent, its costs are reasonable given that it was forced to undertake
independent investigation of a range of matters of fact and law relating to Claimant and its
alleged investment in order to be able to defend itself against Claimant’s unsubstantiated
claims, Respondent asserts that its costs were further increased by Claimant repeatedly
ignoring instructions from and deadlines imposed by the Tribunal.

Respondent further contends that the principle of “cost follow the event” should apply. In
this regard, Respondent refers to Claimant’s failure to duly pursue its alleged claim and to
comply with the instructions provided and deadlines imposed on it by the Arbitral Tribunal,

Asticle 30(1) of 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules further states that “[i]f within the
period fixed by these Rules or the arbitral tribunal without showing sufficient cause, the
claimant has failed to communicate its statement of claim, the arbitral tribunal shall issue
an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings, unless there are remaining matters
thal may need to be decided and the arbitral tribunal considers it appropriate to do so,”

At paragraph 7 of the minutes of the Procedural! Meeting of 1 August 2011, the Arbitral
Tribunal notified Claimant that if it failed to submit its Statement of Claim within the
deadline set by the Arbitral Tribunal, the arbitral proceedings could be terminated,

Claimant, however, failed to submit its Statement of Claim by the imparted deadline of 1
November 2011 set out in the Arbitral Tribunal’s letter of 1 September 2011 and in
paragraph 34 of Procedural Order No.1.

Claimant did not request an extension of time before the deadline expired or offer any
explanation for its failure to submit the Statement of Claim when the deadline expired.

exaot details of the names and identities of the consorts, of the legal representatives and the
name under which the entity is doing business, If the entity is not sufficiently identified or if
there is not sufficient proof of its existence, the persons having commenced proceedings as

representatives of the entity will be personally liable for costs.!

The Arbitral Tribunal accordingly requests Claimant to identify the members of Konsortium
Oeconomicus within 14 days from the date of the present Termination Decision.

The Arbitral Tribunal shall thereafter render its decision on the Award of Costs.

members of Konsortium Oeconomicus, the representatives of the Claimant shall be liable
for the costs of the proceedings, if any, which Claimant may be ordered to bear.
