B.
Prayers for Relief and Procedure until Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction

6.

Saar Papier's prayers for relief were originally for DM 17'434'732.94. On May 20,
1994, Saar Papier reduced its claim to DM 2.3 Mio. plus 12 percent interest since
March 5, 1992, As a result, its prayers for relief are as follows, see also Saar Papier's
brief of September 29, 1995:

1.

To declare that Poland is liable to compensate all damages
sustained by Saar Papier resulting from the prohibition on
importation of the secondary raw material waste paper since
July 7, 1991,

2.

To render an award in favor of Saar Papier that Poland is
required to pay to Saar Papier reasonable damages taking into
consideration, as to the amount, lost profits of Deutsche Mark
2.3 Million plus 12 per cent interest since March 5, 1992.

3.
To impose the costs of the arbitration proceeding to Poland.

%

At the July 17, 1995, hearing it became clear that Saar Papier was not asking for an
independent Feststellung/declaration but was merely asking for a preliminary finding
on an deb (dem Grundsatz nach) (possibly in a preliminary award), possibly
followed by a (Teil-)Leistungsentscheid (final award) der Héhe nach (quantum
debetur). Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal need not issue any separate declaration.

 

8.
In its submission of September 29, 1995, Saar Papier made it clear that its claim for
DM 2.3 Million related to damage suffered before March 5, 1992.

9.
On May 13, 1994, Poland entered a plea of lack of jurisdiction.

10.
On March 17, 1994, the Arbitral Tribunal issued a Constitution Order.

STOSZ734/ WZ/ 01.11.95 / 06:49

Il,

On August 17, 1994, after a written procedure therein described and an internal
meeting of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Arbitral Tribunal issued an Interim Award
which is joined as an appendix to the present opinion. In that award, the Arbitral
Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction (one Arbitrator dissenting).

12.

The arbitration costs for the jurisdiction question were set as SFr. 15'000.—, and the
Arbitral Tribunal was of the opinion that they must be borne by Poland whose plea
was unsuccessful. They had been advanced by Saar Papier. Accordingly, the
Arbitral Tribunal held, Poland must reimburse Saar Papier SFr. 15'000.—, payable

Procedure on the Merits

13.
On the merits, the parties initially presented the following written submissions:

Saar Papier, March 4, 1994,
Poland, November 18, 1994,
Saar Papier, December 19, 1994,
Poland, January 23, 1995.

14,
A bearing had been set for February 24, 1995. However, on January 27, 1995, the
parties agreed to enter into settlement negotiations until June 30, 1995.

15.

On June 6, 1995, the Arbitral Tribunal wrote the parties to set a hearing for July 11,
1995 should their negotiations fail. It asked them to be prepared to discuss “the law
of expropriation matérielle" and "Vertrauensschutz im Verwaltungsrecht", under the
laws of Poland and Germany, and in comparative law, including the Washington
Convention and ICSID awards,

16,

However, this hearing was postponed by request of the parties. On July 17, 1995, a
hearing was conducted in Zurich. A long discussion of the factual and legal aspects
of the case (without the matters mentioned in above, point 17, on which the parties
were not prepared) was conducted with the parties.

17.
On September 20, 1995 and September 29, 1995, the parties presented final briefs,
commenting in part on the matters mentioned in above, point 17.

18.
The parties could have presented additional comments by October /0, 1995, and
statements of their party representation costs, but they did not do so.

19,
On October 16, 1995, Poland presented a comment, dated October 11, 1995.

20,
On October 16, 1995, the parties submitted statements of their costs.

21.
The Arbitral Tribunal deliberated on October 16, 1995.

D.
Arbitral Tribunal's Opinion - Introduction

22.

The facts of this case as presented by Saar Papier remained undisputed by Poland.
Accordingly, such facts as seem relevant to the Arbitral Tribunal will first be
presented, (below, points 24 ff).

23.

On the /aw, the parties disagreed. However, Poland simply disputed any step of the
reasoning leading to its liability without suggesting a coherent reading of the Treaty
or indeed of Polish law. For instance, it claimed that the Arbitral Tribunal was
bound by any decisions of the Polish courts. When asked what then there could be
left for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide it answered that this would have to be factual,
not legal disputes. Similarly, Poland claimed that the Arbitral Tribunal could decide
only once the internal remedies of Polish law had been exhausted. When asked
where the Treaty said that Poland could not answer. When asked how this squared
with the six month cooling period in the Treaty, Poland said that the Treaty (that
itself had signed and ratified) made no sense, At times, Poland (using a literal rea-
ding of its environmental protection statute) claimed that its law prohibited, and had
always prohibited, the importation of makulatura in an absolute way, without excep-
tion, and with criminal sanctions. Only an act of parliament could have changed the
law. At other times, it, and certainly its customs authorities, accepted that makulatura
could be imported with a special permit. At still other times, (using a teleological
reading of its statute) it, and certainly its Embassy in Bonn, believed that makulatura
possibly could be imported into Poland freely. Under these circumstances, the
Arbitral Tribunal will present its understanding of the Treaty and discuss Poland's
opinions as appropnate (below, points 70 ff).

E.
Facts

24.
The facts in this case remained undisputed,

(a)
Economic background

25.

The economic background is as follows: Until the late eighties, on the basis of barter
agreements, Poland imported fresh Russian pulp to make toilet paper and tissue
paper. Russia then started asking for payment in hard currency. Therefore, the raw
material had to be imported from the West. The first imports occurred already in the
summer of 1989.

26.

Saar Papier buys high quality makulatura (printed paper) from white paper and
makes from this paper pulp, which is made into large tissue reels which then are
conditioned into small tissue rolls and toilet paper. Making these from fresh pulp is
more expensive. Making them from low grade makulatura yields an inferior product.

(®)

Initial collaboration

27.

In October 1986 discussions between Saar Papier and the former monopolistic timber
export organization Paged ("Paged Zentrala Handlu Zagranicznego"-Paged) started.
In ]987 after the Poznan fair, the negotiations resumed.

28.

The investment activities of Saar Papier in Poland then started. Paged as well as the
paper mill Kostrzyn ("Kostrzynskie Zaklady Papiernicze"-KZP) were the contracting
parties of Saar Papier on March /, 1988.

29.

The subject matter of the agreement between these three contracting parties was the
production and manufacture of tissue paper in the paper mill located in Kostrzyn/-
Oder being maintained by KZP; it was the responsibility of Saar Papier to install the
converting machines (from large rolls to small rolls for consumers) required at KZP

and take care of the distribution of all the production in the Western European
market. Two machines were installed in /988. Exports started in August 1989.

30,
On July J, 1989, apparently unbeknownst to all the persons involved, the amendment
of the Statute of April 27, 1989 on environmental protection, came into force.

(@)
Danish Buyers

31,

In /989, Saar Papier entered into an agreement with the Danish enterprise HV Jensen
Aktieselskab as to the delivery of 1,000 tons recycled toilet paper. On March 26,
1990, it was agreed that the amount to be delivered shall be increased to 3,500 tons
per year, and, furthermore, that the contract shall expire on December 31, 1990, and
shall be extended for further periods of one year, provided none of the contracting
parties terminates the agreement within a period of six months.

32.

Hergis AG, an affiliated company of Saar Papier, entered, as an agent of Saar Papier,
into another favorable agreement with the Danish buyer F. Schur & Co A/S on Janu-
ary 30, 1990, This agreement, too, provided for the delivery of 1,000 tons of toilet
paper within a time period of 18 months.

(@)
Subsidiary SPI formed

33.
On January |, 1989, the Polish "Statute on Economic Activities with Participation of
Foreign Economic Individuals” of December 23, 1988, came into force,

34,
Because of this new investment regulation, Saar Papier now was able to form a subsi-
diary in Poland.

33%

Saar Papier made use of this possibility as follows: On April 24, 1990, Saar Papier
filed an "Application for the Authorization for the Formation of a Limited Liability
Company with Participation of Foreign Individuals" with the Agency for Foreign
Investments in Warsaw. This company is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Saar Papier

STOS2754/ WZ/ 01.11.95 (06:49

named "Saar Papier International Spolka Z.0.0."(hereinafter referred to as SPJ")
with its principal place of business in Gérzyca near Kostrzyn.

36.

According to the formation application, SPI was supposed, inter alia, to process,
manufacture, and produce paper products, to import makulatura, and to engage in the
export of finished products. Saar Papier expressly applied for an authorization for
the importation of makulatura.

37,

A more detailed description of the intended business activities of the subsidiary of
Saar Papier to be formed follows from the comprehensive "financial analysis", which
is an integral part of the application of April 24, 1990. This financial analysis con-
sists of an extensive description of the course of manufacture, i.e. the fact that waste
paper/makulatura had'to be imported into Poland:

"The basic raw material for the production of toilet paper and kitchen rolls
is so called base paper.

Saar Papier Vertriebs GmbH, being the sole shareholder of the organized
company in Poland, already collaborates for several years with paper mills
in Kostrzyn/Oder. The future company has guaranteed deliveries of base
paper from these enterprises, which is necessary for the realization of the
intended production against deliveries from the Federal Republic of Ger-
many, of makulatura of high quality in amount of up to 5,000 tons."

(Emphasis supplied)
38.
On November 1, 1990 the factory became operational,

39.

As of May 4, 1990, the application of Saar Papier was granted to the full extent; the
President of the Agency for Foreign Investments authorized the formation of SPI and,
thereby, inter alia, permitted the importation of makulatura.

40.
The formation of SPI was concluded by notarial act of May 9, 1990; the subsidiary of
Saar Papier was entered into the commercial register on May 18, 1990.

Further collaboration

41.

Saar Papier had rented a production hall with rail connection in Gérzyca. It was, in-
ter alia, intended to import the raw material maku/atura particularly from the Federal
Republic of Germany to Poland and manufacture makulatura to base paper, and let
this base paper be processed to finished products.

42,

In this context, negotiations were held with the paper mill KZP, as to which the con-
tractual relationship already described existed, and an agreement was entered into
with a paper mill in Krapkowice.

43.

On December /3, 1999, a "Contract for Collaboration" was concluded between the
paper mill Krapkowice already mentioned, the "Company for the Manufacture of
Tissue Paper "Hikrap", Saar Papier, and its subsidiary, SPI. In this agreement, the
paper mill Krapkowice undertook to produce for Saar Papier a total amount of 8,6]0
tons of lissue paper per year. This tissue paper was supposed to be manufactured to
kitchen rolls or toilet paper, partly by SPI, partly by Hikrap, and was then supposed
to be delivered to Saar Papier. The price agreed for the tissue paper to be delivered
on "parent reel" was DM 460.00 per ton; as to the product to be manufactured by
Hikrap, i.e. toilet paper, a price of DM 925,00 per ton has been agreed upon.

44.

It was intended to start with the production in January, 1991. At first, it has been pro-
vided for a contract term until December 31, 1992. The contract was supposed to be
extended for further two years, provided the contract was not terminated within a
period of twelve months.

45,

Furthermore, negotiations were held with the paper mill KZP on December 18 and
19, 1990, at which it was concluded that the collaboration should be re-arranged
substantially.

46.

Because of the favorable development described above, Saar Papier was able to
steadily increase the amount of deliveries of the raw material makulatura into Po-
land.

47.

Saar Papier submits a list of the amounts of makulatura deliveries into Poland in the
years 1989 through 1991. It follows that already between 1989 and 1990 the amount
quadrupled, (approx. 400 tons to approx. 1,580 tons). After February 1991, further
substantial increases as to the import of the raw material makulatura were estab-
lished. During the months February through June 1991, the amount of deliveries per
month was in each case exceeding 200 tons.

48.

With regard to the distribution of the products manufactured in the paper mills, Saar
Papier was able to enter into a further agreement with "Assort Scandinavia A/S", a
company which took over the firm of HV Jensen, with which Saar Papier already
entered into an agreement on August 8, 1989 (Enclosure 4) as to the delivery of toilet

paper.

49,

The agreement of April 23, 1991, provided for an exclusive distribution right of As-
sort in Denmark; Saar Papier undertook to terminate the agreement with the F. Schur
company of January 30, 1990, as of July 31, 1991, and agreed to deliver to Assort
exclusively following this date.

50.
As to the amounts to be delivered under this agreement, yearly deliveries of 3,180
tons of toilet paper and 1,700 tons of kitchen rolls were agreed upon.

Saar Papier's attempts to set aside the prohibition of July 7, 1991.

51.

The extraordinary increase as to the production activities described above suddenly
came to an end on July 7, 1/99]. As of this date, the forwarder Hartwig, who was
employed by Saar Papier for the clearance of the importation of the raw material
makulatura from the Federal Republic of Germany, informed Saar Papier that the
Polish customs authorities prohibited the importation of makulatura, claiming it to be
“waste.”

52.

Furthermore, another forwarder of Saar Papier engaged in the importation makula-
tura, the Fried firm, was prevented from the importation of the raw material maku-
latura. The supplier of Saar Papier, the Lignac & Levison firm, informed Saar Papier
by letter of July JJ, ]99/ of these facts.

Saar Paper's attempt to set aside the prohibition of July 7, 199]

33.
What happened thereafter was summarized as follows by Saar Papier's manager:

"We sold the rest of makulatura we had in the factory. We had of course
small stock. Then we sent a fax to Warsaw. We bought some Polish
paper, which is of quite different quality. You can not supply anybody
which this paper: The problem is we had contracts for tissue paper made
from high quality makulatura and what is made in Poland was gray from
newspaper, cardboard, etc. We know that we had to make paper from a
quality which is called 1A. We tried for a short time. We bought some
paper from a factory near Warsaw but we were not capable to sell this
paper. We sold that production in Poland also that factory could not
supply a sufficient quantity. The factory went into bankruptcy, We had
tried for a long time to support it by imported money. The workers had
been diminished of course, but the workers asked us ‘what shall we do,
there is no other possibility’,"

54.

The Danish company had to go to the court. Assort was buying from Saar Papier in
Germany. Since Saar Papier no longer was receiving product from Poland it could
not fulfill its contract with Assort.

55.

Promptly after being informed of the prohibition on importation of makulatura, Saar
Papier tried, with numerous letters to different public authorities, to find out primari-
ly the reason for the refusal as to makulatura deliveries by the Polish customs autho-
Tities. Saar Papier itself contacted several institutions and authorized, furthermore, a
Polish law firm, i.e. Mr. S. K. Jenger, Attorey-at-Law in Warsaw, to protect its in-
terests,

STOS27S4 / W2,/ 01.11.9537 0649

56.

Saar Papier first received a response from the Polish embassy in Cologne by letter of
August 9, 1991. In this letter, Saar Papier was for the first time informed that the
current environmental regulations prohibited the importation of waste from abroad.
This prohibition on importation allegedly entered into force resulting from an amend-
ment of the statute of April 27, 1989, and entered into force on July J, /989, In the
letter of the Polish Embassy of August 9, 1991, one reads:

"It has to be asked what consists of waste. Makulatura is generally re-
garded as a secondary raw material",

57.
Also during the month of August 1991, Saar Papier made extensive efforts to set
aside the prohibition on importation of makulatura.

58, :

Upon request of Saar Papier, the (German) Federal Minister of Economics intervened
with a letter of February 11, 1992, addressed to the Polish embassy in Cologne. Af-
ter stating the facts, the Federal Minister of Economics urged to investigate the "ad-
ministrative obstacles".

59.
However, these efforts remained unsuccessful. There has been no reaction by Poland
to this letter.

60.

SPI, filed a claim with the Superior Administrative Court in Warsaw on September
16, 1991, contesting the letter of the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources
of August 14, 1991.

61.

This proceeding was concluded by the order of the Superior Administrative Court in
Warsaw of November 12, 1991 with the argument that the letter of the minister con-
tained "no decision” and thus was not subject to review.

Saar Papier's attempt to set aside the prohibition of January 29, 1992.

62.

Saar Papier thereupon initiated another attempt to import one ton of makulatura into
Poland on January 29, 1992. The customs office Rzepin, department Swiecko, again
prohibited the importation: it argued that no permits had been issued by the compe-
tent minister.

63.

Adwokat Jenger contested this with his letter to the customs authority of February
10, 1992. In this letter he pointed out that the subsidiary of claimant was validly
formed under Polish law and was in the possession of a permission for its economic
activities in Poland, thereby including the importation of makulatura,

64. .

The customs authonities responded by a letter dated February 11, 1992. Without
discussing the arguments presented by adwokat Jenger, the decision of the customs
office was confirmed due to the provisions of the Polish Environmental Protection
Statute.

65.
Adwokat Jenger contested this letter with his brief of February 22, 1992, directed to
the director of the customs office Rzepin.

66.

Now, the customs office Swiecko reacted by the letter of March 5, 1992, addressed
to the customs office Rzepin. The letters of the representative of SPI, adwokat Jen-
ger, were submitted with the "request to comment". At the same time, the prohibi-
tion on importation was confirmed, and the following argument was added: Pursuant
to the letter of the Minister for Envir | Protection and Natural R of
January 9, 1992, only specific enterprises were authorized to import waste paper to
Poland. Since the subsidiary of claimant was not mentioned in this list, the importa-
tion of waste paper was prohibited.

SPI's bankruptcy

On March 12, 1993, SPI filed for bankruptcy.

69.

A decision was rendered by the customs office Rzepin, dated July 30, 1993, There,
it was stated that the office Swiecko should have issued a written rejection of the
importation of the secondary raw material waste paper with legal reasons, and should
have provided information on possible appeals against its decision. However, this
was held to be irrelevant, since the decision had been appealed anyway and was
"substantially correct".

F.
Law - Retroactive Applicability of the Treaty

70,
Poland claims that Saar Papier's claim cannot come under the Treaty because the

Treaty came into force only in April 1990. While this is true, Art. 9 of the Treaty
itself provides that it applies to all investments made since September 14, 1972, years
before Saar Papier started its economic activity in Poland. Poland's argument
therefore simply falls flat.

71.

Moreover, Saar Papier claims damages which it measures as /os? profits from August,
1991, onwards when by any reading the Treaty was in force.

G.
Law - Exhaustion of host country remedies (Art 4 and 1] Treaty).

72,

Poland claims that Saar Papier could bring an action before the Arbitral Tribunal
only once the legal remedies in the host country were exhausted, As a matter of law,
the Arbitral Tribunal does not see such a requirement in the Treaty. All the Treaty
provides is that the host country should provide mechanisms in its own legal system
for an investor to fight measures. Moreover, it provides for a six months cooling
down period before an international arbitral tribunal is called upon. As will be seen
shortly, these six months have long elapsed.

73.

Poland put great emphasis on the fact that SPI initially sued the Ministry for Environ-
mental Protection rather than the customs authorities. SPI's suit against the Ministry
for Environmental Protection was dismissed because that Ministry, according to the
Supreme Administrative Court, lacked standing to be sued since the measure taken at
the border had actually been taken by the local customs authorities, It is undisputed,
however, that these customs authorities acted in compliance with an order given by
the Ministry of Environmental Protection. For this reason, Saar Papier claims that in
reality SPI had sued the right party.

74.

The Arbitral Tribunal need not decide this point of Polish administrative law be-
cause, SPI subsequently filed an administrative complaint against the Customs Office
after a further shipment had been held up in December, 1991. This second complaint
was rejected by the Customs Office on July 30, 1993, when the present arbitration
was already pending. This decision could have been attacked before the Supreme
Administrative Court within 30 days, but was not.

75,

By that time, SPI was bankrupt. The bankruptcy of SPI on March 12, 1993, appa-
rently automatically terminated the power of attorney of the Polish lawyer repre-
senting SPI.

$TOS2754/ WZ/01. 11.95 19649

76.

The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the Treaty does not provide for the ex-
haustion of the host country remedies. On the contrary, anticipating that in the host
country the administrative p dure might be ly slow, it provides only for a
six months cooling period (see art. 11 subs. 2).

 

77.

Justice delayed is justice denied. The instant case provides a telling example of this:
More than three years have now elapsed, and the Arbitral Tribunal si// does not
know whether in Poland the importation of makulatura is prohibited or not since the
Polish courts have not yet finally decided this point. In the meantime, the company
in which the investor invested has fallen into bankruptcy. This is the very type of
case for which the Treaty and its six months cooling period was designed.

H.
Law - Measure Equivalent to Expropriation (Art. 4 Treaty)

(@
Relevance of the Interpretation of Polish Act January 31, 1980?

78.

From the legal point of view of Polish law, the Arbitral Tribunal need not decide
which of two positions is correct under Polish law, the position taken by the Polish
authorities at the time the investment was made, or the position taken by the Polish
authorities at the time a prohibition on import was enforced. The issue before the
Arbitral Tribunal is whether under the Treaty a measure equivalent to an expropri-
ation is present if the host country first encourages an investment under a particular
interpretation of the law, and then changes its mind to make the investment econo-
mically worthless.

79.

To interpret the Treaty administrative law practice in Germany and Poland would be
helpful. Despite repeated requests, the Arbitral Tribunal received little help from the
parties on German and Polish administrative law. It therefore relies on its own un-
derstanding on general administrative law and the principle of good faith to interpret
the Treaty. In administrative law practice two approaches converge to deal with this
type of problem.

(b)

Measure equivalent to expropriation

80.

Historically, a first approach has its origin in the constitutional guarantee of the right
of property. The state can expropriate private property only if certain prerequisites
are met, and then only against full compensation. This type of expropriation is called
“formelle Enteignung".

81.

However, the State may define or limit the right of property in a general way without
compensation. Still, if the right of property is limited in a way that in its economic
effect must be equated to expropriation, compensation must be paid. This is called
"materielle Enteignung" or "schleichende Enteignung" or “enteignungsgleicher Ein-
griff’.

sTOS2754 / WZ) 01.11.98 10899

82.

A “materielle Enteignung" is also present when the property nght is not directly
limited or defined as such by a measure of the state, but the state takes a measure
which must be characterized as an indirect limitation of its enjoyment. To take an
example from Swiss practice: All access roads to a shopping center are cut by the
government.

83.

A "materielle Enteignung” is present in particular if a measure has a general impact
but nevertheless burdens a particular right of ownership far more than all others. So-
called "Sonderopfer"-theory (Wiistenbecker, Staatshaftungsrecht, p. 116; Kraft,
Offentlich-rechtliche Ersatzleistungen, vor § 839, N50).

84,

In order to decide what are measures equivalent to expropriation the Arbitral Tribu-
nal believes that the reasonable interpretation of the Treaty is that it should Jook at
the economic effect of the measures. The effect of an expropriation is to take away
the entirety of an investment made by an investor. Measures similar to expropriation
must be deemed to be measures that have an economic impact that is comparable to
the economic impact of an expropriation.

85.

The Arbitral Tribunal asked Poland to explain what measures might fall under the
category of measures equivalent to an expropriation. Poland agreed that an expro-
priation of the main asset of a company would be equivalent to the expropriation of
the shares of that company. It also agreed that a prohibition of access to the main
asset of a company would be equivalent to the expropriation of that asset and there-
fore equivalent to an expropriation of the shares of the company,

86.
It stopped short, however, at the prohibition of importation of raw material designed
to be processed in the factory.

87.

The Arbitral Tribunal does not find this convincing. If indeed, the factory set up by
Saar Papier could handle only imported makulatura, then the prohibition of import of
that makulatura would have an effect economically equivalent to the effect of an ex-
propriation of the factory (Accord, Salow, Bundesgarantien fiir Kapitalanlagen im
Ausland und internationaler Investitionsschutz, Munich, 1984, p.160),

SsTOST7S4/ WZ! 01.41.95 / 06:49

88.

Poland claims that SPI would still have been free /o purchase makulatura within the
country. The actual experience with the purchase of such makulatura, which was of
inferior quality and yielded an inferior product, disproves that point,

89.

Poland also claims that the company had a much wider corporate purpose than just
to make tissue paper from imported makulatura, In order to judge the economic
effect of a measure the Arbitral Tribunal must however, not look at the legal corpo-
rate purpose of the company but at the economic realities, or, as German doctrine
calls it, the "eingerichtete und ausgeiibte Gewerbebetrieb" (Badura, Archiv fiir off.
Recht, 1973, 153, 170; Ossenbiihl, Staatshaftungsrecht, 4.A., 136 ff). From the
undisputed facts the Arbitral Tribunal finds the conclusion inevitable that the eco-
nomic reality was that while it was technically feasible to convert the factory to
producing tissue paper from either new pulp or from makulatura collected locally,
neither of these courses was economically feasible. The economic reality is that the
lifeblood of the factory was cut off by Poland and this had an effect equivalent to that
of an expropriation.

90.

Poland argues that its prohibition should be viewed in a way similar to a no-parking
sign. The example adduced by Poland is particularly ill-chosen. Many of the par-
ticipants in this Arbitration may have had, on occasion, to park further away or to
pay parking fines. Surely it has driven none of them out of business. By contrast,
the prohibition on importation did drive SPI out of business and into bankruptcy.

91.

Poland's argument that it applied to SPI a general provision applying to al! companies
operation in Poland sounds hollow: Indisputably it was applied in a discriminating
fashion (see also art. 3, subs, 2 Treaty), and now it is abolished altogether. This led
in fact to "Sonderopfer".

()
Good Faith Reliance Protection

92.

The second approach was developed mostly after World War II and starts from the
general proposition that there is an obligation of good faith in public law which
applies to all branches of government. Under certain circumstances a law is not

sTOSI7S4/ W2Z/ 01.11.93 0649

27

applied to certain private persons or, if it is applied, they must be fully compensated
even though the application of the law is lawful. This principle applies where the
state has given misleading information about the law or where the law or admini-
strative or court practice have changed. The circumstances where originally wrong
information by a state authority leads to a right to compensation are described as
follows in BGE 114 I a 209, 213:

(a)
The state authority intervened in a specific situation with respect to specific persons;

(b)
The state authority acted or is deemed to have acted within the limits of its powers;

(c)
The private person must have had serious reasons to believe in the validity of the act
according to which he has behaved;

(d)
The private person must have relied on the act in question to take measures that it
could not modify without suffering damage.

(e)

The law must not have formally changed since the time when the assurance was
given.

93,

By applying the above five requirements to the instant case, the Arbitral Tribunal
comes to the following conclusions:

(a)

There was, on May 4, 1990, an authorization by the president of the agency for
foreign investments for the formation of SPI which was taken in a concrete situation
with respect to specified persons.

(b)

Poland now says that the president of the agency for foreign investments was not
authorized to permit the importation of makulatura and that such an authorization
could be granted only by the parliament of the Republic of Poland. That there was a
prohibition of importation of makulatura since July 1, 1989, was obviously unknown
to the Polish authorities with whom Saar Papier dealt, and remained unknown to

them until July 7, 1991, The various ministries have an obligation to consult each
other before they issue a permit in a matter falling with the jurisdiction of several
ministries. In the Arbitral Tribunal’s opinion, Saar Papier could not be expected to
know what Poland's own government authorities at a higher level apparently ignored.
As the Swiss Federal Supreme Court wrote, the individual party may invoke its good
faith when it was not in a position, even with the required degree of attention, to find
that the authority was acting beyond its powers. Poland cannot come before this
Arbitral Tribunal and hold Saar Papier to a standard that it did not observe.

(c)

With respect to the requirement that the party involved had serious reasons to believe
in the validity of the permit or the inexistence of the requirement for a permit, the
Arbitral Tribunal finds that the existence and the grounds for a requirement prohibi-
ting the importation of makulatura was and is by no means obvious, It notes that Po-
land was incapable of providing any policy grounds for such a prohibition. It simply
relied on the concept of "waste." In the meantime the law was changed (as
distinguished from a prohibition of waste in general). What was not clear to Poland's
own Agency for foreign investments on May 4, 1990, and to Poland's own Embassy
in Bonn on August 9, 1991, and is clear to Poland today only by conceptual thinking,
can hardly have been clear to Saar Papier.

(d)
Tt is obvious that Saar Papier relied on the information received and set up SPI only
on the strength of the permit to do so.

(e)
The statute of April 27, 1989 was not changed in the relevant period since it came
into force on July 1, 1989, Only the practice changed from August 9, 1991, onwards.

94.

Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal finds, that Poland must compensate
Saar Papier for the loss of value of its investment due to the fact that makulatura
could not be imported into Poland. In the meantime, the statute was changed to
allow importation by special permit, but this was after the relevant period.

Conclusion

95.
The two approaches converge. The first approach forms a basis for compensation in
case of "materielle Enteignung" and the facts of this case are such as to warrant

compensation.

96.

The second approach is based on the principle of protection of good faith which is, if
anything, more fundamental than the principle of the protection of property: Since
the state issues a constitutional guarantee of the right of property it may not frustrate
without compensation the legitimate expectations of the parties who rely on this pro-
mise when they acquire property.

97.

Accordingly, when the state parties to the investment Treaty provided that the host
country would not be allowed to take measures having an effect equivalent to expro-
priation without compensation they a/so must be understood to have provided for
compensation if the host country first encourages an investment under particular
interpretation of the law and then changes its mind to make the investment econo-
mically worthless.

L
Mitigation of damages

98.

Poland also claims that Saar Papier failed to mitigate damages. This argument has
two sides: One relates to /ega/ remedies taken. Poland claims that Saar Papier
should have challenged the first import ban of August 9, 1991, the right way, The
Arbitral Tribunal believes that the first attempt was not unreasonable. For the Arbi-
tral Tribunal it is sufficient to say that by Poland's own admission the second action
taken four months later against the customs office decision rejecting importation the
second time around was the correct and only one that could be taken. There is no
allegation by Poland that Saar Papier and SPI did not vigorously pursue this second
action until SPI fell bankrupt, nor any allegation of what they should have done that
they failed to do. On the contrary, the Arbitral Tribunal has numerous indications
that Saar Papier did everything in its power to have the decision of the Ministry of
the Environment overturned. It has no indication that the import ban on makulatura
could have been lifted, at any rate before March 5, 1992, the date to which damages
are claimed.

99.

The second thrust of Poland's argument of lack of mitigation of damages is faciual.
Saar Papier explained that it had tried two alternative routes once its importation of
makulatura had been prohibited. The first one was to obtain makw/atura from the
Polish market itself. It remained undisputed, and the Arbitral Tribunal finds it con-
vincing, that the quality of that makulatura is no way comparable to the makulatura
from printing offices which is makulatura based on white paper, while the paper col-
lection in Poland yields low quality mixtures of newspaper, cardboard an other used
papers. Itis undisputed and obvious to the Arbitral Tribunal that tissue paper made
with such an inferior raw material is itself of inferior quality and not sellable on the
Western market.

100.

The alternative of making tissue paper from fiber is obviously much more expensive,
and it is understandable that the Danish supplier was not ready to switch to fiber-
based tissue paper to be sold on the Western market,

101.

When asked repeatedly what factual measures Saar Papier should have taken to
mitigate damages more than it did, Poland was unable to present any allegation. The
allegation burden on this is with Poland.

102.
Accordingly the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Poland's claim that Saar Papier failed to
mitigate damages is unfounded.

103.

The lost profits claimed are not speculative since they are based on sales onwards to
a Danish purchaser of tissue paper. The Arbitral Tribunal is satisfied that the loss
suffered by Saar Papier reached the requested DM 2.3 Million before March 5, 1992.
This figure was not denied with any particularity.

104.

The interest rate claimed is above the interest specified by the Treaty. Art. 4 of the
Treaty aoe be mnnersfoned ‘to mean 8 percent on DM, On March 5, 1992, when this
arbi 2 the d: ded t or were already due.

P e

105,
Saar Papier's claim must therefore be granted in full except for the interest.

K
Costs

106.
The Arbitration costs and party representation costs for the jurisdiction question were
already set (above, point 14).

107.
The costs of the remainder of the arbitration must follow the outcome on the merits
and be fully bome by Poland.

108.
Saar Papier can receive only party costs conforming to the German BRAGO.

§TOST7S4/W2/01,11.95/ 06:49

Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal issues the following
