THE PROCEEDING

On 23 May 2014, the Claimants submitted the Notice. The Notice, in a section titled
“Identification of the Disputing Investors”, identified the eight Original Claimants and
the six Original Mexican Companies. It set out the factual basis of the claim, identified
the provisions of the Treaty that were alleged to have been breached, and specified the

relief requested.

On 15 June 2016, the Claimants filed the Request with the Centre. On 23 June 2016,

the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request.

On 27 June 2016, the Respondent objected to the registration of the Request, claiming,
inter alia, the (i) failure by the 31 Additional Claimants to provide a notice of intent
at least 90 days prior to the submission to arbitration as required by NAFTA Article
1119 and Article 1122; (ii) failure by the Claimants to identify in the Notice three of
the then nine Mexican Companies on whose behalf they intended to pursue a claim
under Article 1117; and (iii) failure by the Claimants and the Mexican Companies to

consent to arbitration as required by Article 1121.

On 6 July 2016, the Centre sent a questionnaire to the Claimants requesting, inter alia,
(i) copies of the written waivers issued by each of the Mexican Companies; (ii) copies
of each of the Mexican Companies’ written consent to arbitration; and (iii) an
explanation as to how each Claimant and each Mexican Company meets the

requirements of Article 1119.

On 21 July 2016, the Claimants submitted a written response to the Centre’s
questionnaire and to the Respondent’s objections of 27 June 2016. Attached to the
written response were POAs and waivers by four of the then nine Mexican Companies.
The Claimants argued that “consents and waivers” from the five Juegos Companies
were not required because the Respondent had deprived the Claimants of control of

the Juegos Companies, and therefore the exception in NAFTA Article 1121(4) applied.

On 26 July 2016, the Respondent responded to the Claimants’ letter of 21 July 2016.

On 2 August 2016, the Centre informed the Claimants that it could not approve access
to the Additional Facility or register the Request unless the consents of the Juegos

Companies were provided as required by Article 1121(2)(a) NAFTA. ICSID asked

the Claimants to respond by 5 August 2016 and inform the Centre of whether they
wished to: (i) suspend the approval and registration of the claim until the Request had
been supplemented with the necessary consents, or (ii) withdraw the claims made on

behalf of the Juegos Companies under Article 1117 of the Treaty.

On 5 August 2016, the Claimants responded to the Centre, attaching the POAs and

waivers by the Juegos Companies.

On 11 August 2016, ICSID registered the Request pursuant to Article 4 of the ICSID
Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.

On 2 September 2016, the Claimants sent the Amended Notice to the Respondent.

By letter of 9 September 2016, the Claimants appointed Professor Gary Born, a U.S.
national, as arbitrator. Professor Born accepted his appointment on 14 September

2016.

By letter of 26 September 2016, the Respondent appointed Professor Ratil Vinuesa,
an Argentine national, as arbitrator. Professor Vinuesa accepted his appointment on 4

October 2016.

On 31 October 2016, the Claimants wrote to the Centre to request that the Secretary-
General of ICSID appoint the presiding arbitrator pursuant to Article 1124 of the
Treaty, as the parties had been unable to reach agreement on the designation of the

presiding arbitrator.

By letter of 13 January 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID appointed Dr. Gaétan
Verhoosel, a Belgian national, as the presiding arbitrator. Dr. Verhoosel accepted his

appointment on 13 February 2017.

On 14 February 2017, the Centre notified the parties that the Tribunal had been
constituted pursuant to ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.

On 28 March 2017, the Tribunal held its first session by telephone conference. The
parties agreed to bifurcate the proceeding, with a first phase limited to the preliminary
objections raised by the Respondent. On 4 April 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural

Order No. 1, which included a procedural timetable reflecting the parties’ agreement.

On 30 May 2017, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections. On
25 July 2017, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdictional
Objections. On 1 December 2017, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdictional
Objections. On 8 January 2018, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdictional
Objections. Attached to the Claimants’ Rejoinder were 43 additional Witness

Statements.

On 22 March 2018, new evidence was tendered by the Claimants with leave of the
Tribunal. On 25 April 2018, the Respondent filed its Rebuttal Submission in Response
to New Evidence, responding to the new evidence exhibited with the Claimants’

Rejoinder and the new evidence tendered by the Claimants on 22 March 2018.

From 21 May 2018 to 25 May 2018, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in
Washington DC. Present at the hearing were, for the Tribunal: Dr. Gaétan Verhoosel,
Professor Gary Born, Professor Ratil Vinuesa, and Ms. Natali Sequeira, Secretary to
the Tribunal. For the Claimants: Mr. David Orta, Mr. Daniel Salinas, Ms. Julianne
Jaquith, Mr. Kristopher Yue, Ms. Ana Paula Luna Pino, Ms. Dominique Lambert, Mr.
Milton Segarra (all from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP, Washington DC,
USA), and Mr. Julio Gutiérrez Morales (from Rios-Ferrer Guillén-Llarena, Trevifio y
Rivera S.C., Mexico City, Mexico). For the Respondent: Ms. Samantha Atayde
Arellano, Ms. Ximena Iturriaga, Mr. Geovanni Hernandez Salvador, Ms. Blanca del
Carmen Martinez Mendoza (all from Direccién General de Consultoria Juridica de
Comercio Internacional), Mr. James Cameron Mowatt, Mr. Alejandro Barragan, Ms.
Jennifer Radford, Mr. Greg Tereposky, Ms. Yuri Perez (all from Tereposky & DeRose
LLP, Ottawa, Canada), and Mr. Stephan E. Becker (from Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw

On 17 August 2018, both parties submitted their Post-Hearing Briefs.

On 1 October 2018, both parties submitted their statements of costs in relation to this

phase.

On 23 November 2018, the Tribunal invited the parties and the Non-Disputing Parties,
if they so wished, to file submissions addressing the question of whether there are any
relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the NAFTA
Parties within the meaning of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT of which the Tribunal
should take account in interpreting “own[] or control[]” in Article 1117 of the Treaty.

All such responsive submissions were received by 21 December 2018.

In the course of the proceeding, the Tribunal issued seven procedural orders,
addressing a variety of procedural issues and incidents and presenting questions to the
parties for their post-hearing briefs. All procedural orders are available on the ICSID

website and therefore need not be summarized here.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Tribunal sets out below a very brief summary of the factual background insofar
as relevant to this preliminary phase. This summary reflects only what has been
alleged by the Claimants, and not any findings of fact by the Tribunal. The Tribunal
need not, and does not, make any factual findings in this Award other than to the extent
indicated in Part V below, “The Tribunal’s Findings and Conclusions”. Therefore,
since it would be fastidious to insert “allegedly” before each alleged fact in the

summary below, it is to be understood as being expressly qualified as such in toto.

A. THE EXISTING CASINO BUSINESS

The Mexican Companies were involved in the operation of casino businesses.* From
1 April 2008 to 27 May 2009, the casinos were operated under a casino operation
permit held by E-Mex, a Mexican company.> On 27 May 2009, SEGOB issued a
resolution granting E-Games permission to operate the casinos under the same permit
but autonomously from E-Mex, based on the doctrine of “acquired rights” (the 2009

Resolution).°

On 16 November 2012, SEGOB issued a resolution granting E-Games an independent
casino operation permit with its distinct permit number (the 2012 Resolution).’ This
meant that E-Games was no longer operating under E-Mex’s permit, whether
autonomously or otherwise. The permit was to remain valid until 2030 and the
Claimants would have the right to operate up to fourteen gaming establishments (7
remote gambling centres and 7 lottery number rooms), or up to 7 dual-function gaming

establishments.®
The Mexican Companies performed the following functions in the business:

a. Each of the five Juegos Companies owned a casino and related assets.”

b. | From 16 November 2012, E-Games held the casino operation permit and operated
the five dual-function casinos. '° E-Games also leased casino machines from each

of the Juegos Companies. !!

c. Operadora Pesa provided management and administrative services (such as
coordinating with food and beverage vendors) for the five casinos through a

services agreement between Operadora Pesa and E-Games. '*

Each of the Claimants, with the exception of B-Cabo, LLC and Colorado Cancttun
LLC, are shareholders in at least one of the Juegos Companies.'* Two of the Original

Claimants—John Conley and Oaxaca—also are shareholders in E-Games. '*
Further, some of the Claimants provided loans to the Juegos Companies:

a. Palmas South, LLC provided a loan to JVE Sureste, with US$ 130,000 of the
principal outstanding, and a loan to JVE Centro, with US$ 400,000 of the

principal outstanding. !°

b. Gordon Burr made a loan to JVE DF, with US$ 110,000 of the principal

outstanding. !

c. After the casinos were shut down in April 2014, some of the Claimants also made
unspecified loans to B-Mex, LLC, which in turn invested the funds to finance

upkeep obligations of the various Mexican Companies. '7

B. THE Los CABOS AND CANCUN PROJECTS

The Claimants were also in the process of developing two other casino ventures in
Mexico, in Los Cabos and Canctin. These casinos were to be the two remaining dual-

function casinos that E-Games was allowed to operate under its casino operation

in connection with this plan.!? These two Claimants are only asserting claims on their

own behalf under Article 1116.7°

B-Mex II, LLC invested US$ 2.5 million to obtain licenses for the operation of gaming
machines in 2006, some of which were intended to be used in the Los Cabos and

Canctin projects.?!

Colorado Canctin, LLC invested US$ 250,000 in entering into an option to purchase a

gaming license from B-Mex II, LLC.”

B-Cabo, LLC invested US$ 600,000 through loans to Medano Beach, S. de R.L. de
C.V., a Mexican company, for the purchase of property for the B-Cabo hotel and

casino.** B-Cabo, LLC was also in the process of acquiring a gaming license from B-

Mex II, LLC when E-Games’s casino permit was revoked by the Respondent.**

Cc. ALLEGED WRONGFUL CONDUCT BY THE RESPONDENT

On 30 December 2011, E-Mex filed a constitutional challenge—known as an amparo
proceeding—against SEGOB, challenging, inter alia, the 2009 Resolution.*> On 30
January 2013, the amparo judge ruled that the 2009 Resolution was unconstitutional
and ordered its rescission.”° This ruling was affirmed by the appellate court on 10 July
2013.77 On 19 July 2013, SEGOB complied with the judgment and rescinded the 2009

.
Resolution.®

Treatment) and 1110 (Expropriation and Compensation) of the Treaty by taking the

following measures against the Mexican Companies:””

a. On 19 June 2013, the Respondent temporarily and illegally closed the Mexico

City casino.*°

b. On 22 August 2013, the amparo judge improperly re-opened proceedings upon
E-Mex’s request.*!_ On 26 August 2013, the judge issued another judgment
ordering SEGOB to rescind all resolutions based on or derived from the 2009

Resolution, and not just the 2009 Resolution.”

c. On 28 August 2013, SEGOB, apparently in compliance with the amparo judge’s
order of 26 August 2013, rescinded several resolutions, including the 2012
Resolution.*? On 14 October 2013, however, the amparo judge ruled that SEGOB
had exceeded the enforcement of the 26 August 2013 amparo order in revoking

the 2012 Resolution.

d. After making this ruling on 14 October 2013, however, the amparo judge chose
not to issue an order confirming that the 2012 Resolution should not have been
rescinded.** Instead, the judge sent the matter to the appellate court to decide

whether to sanction SEGOB for exceeding its authority.*°

e. On 19 February 2014, the appellate court, instead of deciding the issue of whether
to sanction SEGOB, instead reinterpreted the amparo judge’s decision. The
appellate court determined that SEGOB had not exceeded its powers when
rescinding the 2012 Resolution.*” The Claimants claim that this decision was

“politically motivated and influenced”.*® On remand, on 10 March 2014, the

amparo judge complied with the appellate court’s ruling.*? According to the
Claimants, E-Games was deprived of its due process rights during the course of

these judicial proceedings described in Paragraphs 39b to 39e.*°

On 23 April 2014, E-Games filed a writ to the Mexican Supreme Court—known
as a recurso de inconformidad—attacking the appellate court’s ruling of 19

February 2014, and the amparo judge’s compliance on 10 March 2014.*!

On 3 September 2014, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on procedural
grounds and remanded the case to the same appellate court that had made the 19
February 2014 decision that was being appealed.*” This meant that the appellate
court was reviewing its own decision, and the Claimants allege that they were thus
“effectively and practically denied an appeal”.*7 On 29 January 2015, the
appellate court upheld its own prior decision that affirmed SEGOB’s rescission

of, inter alia, the 2012 Resolution.“

The Claimants allege that the Mexican Government may have unlawfully
intervened in these Supreme Court and appellate court proceedings by threatening

certain judges.*°

The Claimants further allege that a Mexican company, Producciones Méviles,
S.A. de C.V., was allowed to continue operating its casinos despite obtaining its
casino permit under circumstances that were materially identical to how E-Games

obtained its independent casino permit under the 2012 Resolution.*°

On 24 April 2014, the day after E-Games had filed its recurso de inconformidad,
SEGOB, aided by the federal police, closed down all of the Claimants’ casinos.

The federal police entered the casinos while armed, blocked all entrances and

exits, and confined employees to the offices.” SEGOB also refused to provide a

copy of the closure order.**

k. After the casinos’ closure on 24 April 2014, SEGOB blocked any attempts by the
Claimants to mitigate their losses. On three occasions around mid-2014, the
Claimants approached SEGOB about the possibility of working with a partner to
re-open the casinos. SEGOB objected on each occasion.*? On one occasion,
SEGOB informed one of the Claimants’ prospective partners, Grand Odyssey,

that the casinos could not be reopened “if the ‘gringos’ remained involved”.>°

1 On 4 April 2014, E-Games made an application to obtain a new independent
casino operation permit. On 15 August 2014, SEGOB denied the request,
according to the Claimants on purely technical grounds and without affording E-
Games the opportunity to correct the errors.*! SEGOB, during this time, granted

to E-Games’s 2009 operations.*? After a change of government on 1 December

Games had not complied with its reporting obligations and ordering it to pay more

was improper as they had always filed E-Games’s taxes in the same manner, and

a separate audit had found its 2011 filings to be compliant with tax legislation.>*°

THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed all of the parties’ submissions in this arbitration.
Those submissions are available on the ICSID website at https://icsid.worldbank.org/
en/Pages/cases/casedetail.aspx ?CaseNo=ARB(AF)/16/3._ Therefore, rather than
attempting to produce summaries of those pleadings, which would almost certainly
fail to do justice to them, the Tribunal hereby incorporates the parties’ submissions in

their entirety by reference into this section of the Award.

THE TRIBUNAL’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

In this first phase the Tribunal shall decide the following three preliminary issues (the

Issues):

Issue 1: Articles 1121(1) and 1121(2) of the Treaty require that the Claimants and
the Mexican Companies, respectively, consent to “arbitration in accordance with
the procedures set out in [the Treaty]”. Article 1121(3) requires the Claimants
and the Mexican Companies to give that consent “in writing”; to “deliver[] [it] to
the disputing Party”; and to “include[] [it] in the submission of a claim to
arbitration”. The Respondent’s case is that the Claimants’ acceptance in the
Request of the Respondent’s arbitration offer in Article 1122 of the Treaty and
the POAs granted by the Claimants and the Mexican Companies to their counsel
are incapable of satisfying these requirements; and that this deprives the Tribunal

of jurisdiction.*”

Issue 2: Article 1119 provides that a “disputing investor shall deliver to the
disputing Party written notice of its intention to submit a claim to arbitration at
least 90 days before the claim is submitted ...”. Article 1122(1) of the Treaty
provides that the Respondent consents to the submission of a claim to “arbitration
in accordance with the procedures set out in [the Treaty]”. The Respondent
submits that “[i]n order to submit their claims to arbitration, the 31 Additional
Claimants needed to first deliver a notice of intent under Article 1119 and wait at
least 90 days. Failure to do so rendered their purported submission to arbitration
void ab initio. They also failed to engage the Respondent’s consent to arbitration
‘in accordance with the procedures set out in [the NAFTA]’ under Article

1122”.58

Issue 3: Article 1117 of the Treaty provides that an investor may submit a claim
to arbitration on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that the investor owns or
controls directly or indirectly. The Respondent’s case is that at the relevant times

the Claimants did not own or control directly or indirectly the Mexican

Companies on whose behalf they have submitted a claim.** Closely intertwined
with this objection is the Respondent’s objection that the Claimants have failed to
prove that they owned any particular number and type of shares in the Mexican

Companies at the relevant times.”

The Tribunal will first address the first two of these Issues insofar as they apply to the
claims under Article 1116 on behalf of the Claimants. The Tribunal will next address
each of these Issues insofar as they apply to the claims under Article 1117 on behalf

of the Mexican Companies.

A. THE CLAIMANTS’ CLAIMS UNDER ARTICLE 1116
1. Article 1121: consent by the Claimants

In addressing this objection, the Tribunal starts by noting that Article 1121 is not a
monolith. Instead, it contains three paragraphs, two of which are relevant for current

purposes:

a. Paragraph (1) provides that “a disputing investor may submit a claim ... to
arbitration only if” the investor consents to “arbitration in accordance with the
procedures set out in this Agreement” and waives the right to pursue other

proceedings relating to the same measures.

b. Paragraph (3) provides that such consent and waiver shall “be in writing, shall be
delivered to the disputing Party and shall be included in the submission of a claim

to arbitration”.

The Tribunal discerns in paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 1121 two distinct sets of

requirements. They are not to be conflated; each must be given meaning.

a. On the one hand, paragraph (1) sets out two substantive conditions precedent that
an investor must satisfy before it can pursue a claim in arbitration: consent and
waiver. It is clear from the terms of the provision (“may submit a claim ... only
if’) that a NAFTA Party cannot be compelled to arbitrate where those conditions

are not met.

b. — On the other hand, paragraph (3) sets out the manner in which satisfaction of those
two conditions precedent—consent and waiver—is to be conveyed to the

Respondent.

Paragraphs (1) and (3) thus elicit separate enquiries, and the Tribunal will pursue each

in turn.

a. Article 1121(1): have the Claimants given consent?

Arbitration being a creature of consent, lack of consent equates lack of jurisdiction.
Where any Claimant has in fact not consented to arbitrate with the Respondent as
required by Article 1121(1), the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in respect of that
Claimant. The Tribunal must determine whether, as the Respondent submits, that is

the case here.

In paragraph 114 of the Request, the Claimants referred to the Respondent’s offer to
arbitrate in Article 1122 of the Treaty and stated that “[b]y this Request for Arbitration,
Claimants accept Mexico’s offer, and hereby submit the present dispute to arbitration
under the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID”.°! This acceptance was given in a
document reviewed and agreed to by the Claimants,” and signed by the Claimants’
counsel pursuant to POAs by the Claimants authorizing counsel to “take any steps
required for the initiation of, and to represent [Claimants] and act on [their] behalf

against the United Mexican States in, arbitration proceedings under the [Treaty]”.

The Respondent submits on the basis of this record that the Claimants have not

consented. According to the Respondent, the POAs “[a]t most ... suggests that the

 

Claimants would have been willing to consent to arbitration if asked ...”; 4 and the

 

Claimants’ consent as conveyed in paragraph 114 of the Request was only “implied
or constructive”.

The Tribunal disagrees. Leaving aside the counterintuitive nature of the Respondent’s

position—that the Claimants would have spent millions of dollars on an arbitration to

which they did not consent—the record permits no other conclusion than that the

Claimants did in fact consent:

a. The Claimants, who have all confirmed in testimony that they did consent,
conveyed that consent in paragraph 114 of the Request when expressly accepting
the Respondent’s offer in Article 1122. Nothing in that paragraph needs to be

implied or construed to enable the conclusion that the Claimants did consent.

b. It is true that the Claimants provided their consent through counsel. That is also
irrelevant. Where, as here, there is no suggestion that Quinn Emanuel was not
duly authorized or that it acted ultra vires in issuing the Request conveying the
Claimants’ consent, there is no question that all statements in the Request are
attributable to and bind the principals of Quinn Emanuel—the Claimants.
Nothing in the Treaty precludes investors from acting through duly authorized

legal counsel.

While the Respondent elsewhere concedes that “[c]learly the Claimants authorized
Quinn Emmanuel to ‘file the arbitration’ and to that end consented to the firm doing
so”, the Respondent suggests “[t]hat is not the point”.©’ The point, according to the
Respondent, is “[w]hat the Claimants did not do in the [POAs] they signed”: “to
declare in writing—for the benefit of the Respondent—that they ‘consent to arbitration

in accordance with the procedures set out in [the Treaty]’”.°* The argument, therefore,

Each Claimant has submitted evidence stating in these terms, or in materially identical terms: “I
understand that Mexico alleges that I have not provided my consent to the submission of my claims in
this arbitration in accordance with the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. Thi: simply not true; my
consent has been unequivocal at all times. I at all times have expressly consented to the filing of the
Request for Arbitration on my behalf, to the execution of the powers of attorney in favor of Quinn
Emanuel through which I intended to consent and in fact expressly consented to arbitration in accordance
with the procedures set out in the NAFTA, as well as the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. I hereby
affirm, once again, that I have consented, and continue to consent, to arbitration in accordance with the
procedures set out in the NAFTA, in compliance with NAFTA Article 1121”. See Further 32 Claimants’

is that a verbatim recitation by the Claimants of the phrase “arbitration in accordance
with the procedures set out in” the Treaty is required to satisfy Article 1 121(1).°

The Tribunal disagrees. The Request refers to the Respondent’s offer in Article 1122
and states that the Claimants “accept Mexico’s offer” as set forth in that provision. As
further discussed below, Article 1122 in terms already expressly confines the
Respondent’s offer to “arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this
Agreement”. Accordingly, the only offer to which the Claimants could give their
consent in paragraph 114 of the Request was necessarily and already limited to
“arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement”. A verbatim
recitation of that phrase in the Request or in the POAs would not have added anything:
the limitation on consent introduced by that phrase is hard-wired into the Respondent’s

offer. The Claimants could not accept an offer not made in Article 1122.

The Tribunal is not aware of any arbitral authority requiring any particular formulation
for giving consent under Article 1121(1). None of the decisions cited by the
Respondent, including Methanex, Canfor, Merrill and Ring, Cargill, Detroit
International Bridge, Bilcon, Resolute Forest, and Mercer, suggests that a claimant
can only validly give consent under Article 1121(1) by verbatim reciting Article 1122

or using any other particular phraseology.”

In sum, the Claimants did give consent as required by Article 1121(1). The only
question is whether that consent was conveyed in the manner prescribed by Article

1121(3). The Tribunal turns to this next.

b. Have the Claimants conveyed their consent in the manner
prescribed by Article 1121(3)?
Article 1121(3) required the Claimants to give their consent “in writing”, to “deliver[]
[it] to” the Respondent, and to “include[] [it] in the submission of a claim to

arbitration”.

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ acceptance of the Respondent’s offer in
paragraph 1 14 of the Request, filed on their behalf by Quinn Emanuel, failed to satisfy

the three requirements of Article 1121(3).”!

It is true that the Claimants did not issue to the Respondent a separate letter affirming
their consent to arbitration. That is also irrelevant: nothing in Article 1121(3) required
them to do so. All it required was that the consent be (i) “in writing”, (ii) “delivered

to” the Respondent, and (iii) “included in the submission of a claim to arbitration”.

That was done here. To wit, the Request (i) is a written document; (ii) was delivered
to the Respondent; and (iii) was included in the submission of the claim to arbitration
(which pursuant to Article 1137 of the Treaty occurs when the Request was received

by the Secretary-General of ICSID).

The text of Article 1121(3) imposes no other requirements. Its context also militates
against implying any. Under Article 1122(2), “the requirement of ... the Additional
Facility Rules for written consent of the parties” is satisfied by “[t]he consent given
by [Article 1122(1)] and the submission by a disputing investor of a claim to
arbitration”. It would have been surprising if a claimant then could not satisfy Article

1121(3) by doing exactly that.

The cases cited by the Respondent also do not suggest otherwise. None of them have
imposed additional requirements as to the manner of conveying consent beyond those

already contained in Article 1121(3).”

In any event, even if the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 1121(3) were right,

that would not then have affected the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. While there can be no

jurisdiction absent the Claimants’ consent (both as a matter of first principles and
pursuant to the express terms of Article 1121(1)), the requirements of Article 1121(3)
as to the manner in which that consent is to be conveyed to the Respondent do not bear
on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Rather, failure to meet those requirements may affect

the claim’s admissibility and can be cured.”

2. Articles 1122(1) and 1119(a): the Notice and the Respondent’s
consent

Article 1119 requires that, at least 90 days prior to commencing arbitration, the

investor submit a notice of intent specifying: “(a) the name and address of the disputing

investor and, where a claim is made under Article 1117, the name and address of the

enterprise; (b) the provisions [of NAFTA] alleged to have been breached ...; (c) the

issues and the factual basis for the claim; and (d) the relief sought and the approximate

amount of damages claimed.”

Article 1122(1) provides that the Respondent consents to “the submission of a claim

to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement”.

The Respondent contends that (i) the failure by the Additional Claimants “to [submit
a notice of intent] rendered their purported submission to arbitration void ab initio”
and (ii) “[t]hey also failed to engage the Respondent’s consent to arbitration ‘in

accordance with the procedures set out in [the NAFTA]’ under Article 1122”.”*

See, e.g., International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States, UNCITRAL,
Award, 26 January 2006 (International Thunderbird), { 117 (“The Tribunal considers indeed that the
requirement to include the waivers in the submission of the claim is purely formal, and that a failure to
meet such requirement cannot suffice to invalidate the submission of a claim if the so-called failure is
remedied at a later stage of the proceedings”). When other tribunals have referred to the conditions
precedent of Article 1121 as bearing on their jurisdiction, the Tribunal does not read those decisions as
referring to the form requirements of Article 1121(3). See the cases cited at Memorial on Jurisdictional
Objections, 30 May 2017 (Memorial), {{{ 82-83; Reply, {| 131-136; Respondent’s PHB, {J 17-19. As
stated above, the Tribunal agrees with those tribunals insofar as they identified the conditions precedent
of Article 1121(1) as bearing on their jurisdiction.

a. The undisputed defect in the Notice

The Notice submitted on 23 May 2014 alleged that there had been breaches of Articles
1102, 1103, 1105 and 1110 of the Treaty;”° set out the factual background to the

claims;’° and estimated the damages relief sought “in the range of US$ 100 million”.””

In a section titled “Identification of the Disputing Investors”, it provided the names
and addresses of eight investors (who are now eight of the 38 Claimants) and the
names of six Mexican companies’® (who are now six of the seven Mexican
Companies).”” The Notice, however, did not provide the names and addresses of the

remaining 31 Additional Claimants or of Operadora Pesa.*?

It is not in dispute that, if the Claimants’ contentions as regards their shareholding in
the Mexican Companies are found to be correct, the aggregate shareholding held by
the Additional Claimants in each of the Juegos Companies and E-Games was at all
times smaller than the aggregate shareholding held by the Original Claimants, yet by

no means insignificant.

It is also common ground that the only defect in the Notice relates to this failure to
identify the Additional Claimants and Operadora Pesa as required under Article
1119(a). The Respondent has not complained about the summary of facts, the
identification of the Treaty provisions allegedly breached, or the estimate of damages

set out in the Notice.

It remains unclear what led to the omission of the Additional Claimants and Operadora
Pesa from the Notice. The Claimants’ evidence at the hearing was that they relied on
the advice of their specialised arbitration counsel (at that time a different firm from

their counsel of record in this arbitration).*! There was a suggestion that the omission

was insignificant because the Original Claimants allegedly were the controlling
shareholders whereas the Additional Claimants were all “passive investors”.*”

The Tribunal need not resolve this here. For purposes of interpreting Articles 1119
and 1122, it is irrelevant why the information was omitted. All the Tribunal must

determine is whether that omission has the consequences as argued by the Respondent.

b. A matter of jurisdiction or admissibility

The Respondent’s case is that the claims by the Additional Claimants should be
dismissed because their omission from the notice vitiates its consent (“They ... failed
to engage the Respondent’s consent to arbitration ‘in accordance with the procedures
set out in [the NAFTA] under Article 1122”)*? and because the defect renders their
submission to arbitration void (‘Failure to do so rendered their purported submission
to arbitration void ab initio”).** The Respondent contests that this Issue is properly
characterized as going to admissibility rather than jurisdiction, but that the Additional

Claimants’ claims should be dismissed even if it were a matter of admissibility.*°

The Claimants, on the other hand, contend that: the defective Notice does not preclude
jurisdiction over the Additional Claimants;*° the Notice was in fact filed on behalf of

the Additional Claimants as well;°’

and the matter is one of admissibility and the
claims should be admitted because the defect caused the Respondent no prejudice and

would not have changed the course of any settlement effort.**

For the Respondent’s objection to succeed, the Tribunal must find that the omission
of the Additional Claimants from the Notice either (i) deprives the Tribunal of
jurisdiction over the Additional Claimants or (ii) renders the claims by the Additional
Claimants inadmissible. The Respondent’s objections must necessarily come within
the purview of that taxonomy. If the Tribunal has jurisdiction and declares the claims

in question admissible, there is no other basis to dismiss the claims at this stage.

Jurisdiction pertains to whether a tribunal has the power to adjudicate a particular
dispute, whereas admissibility pertains to whether a tribunal—which does have that
adjudicative power—should exercise that power over a particular claim.
Commentators have emphasized the practical relevance of the distinction: whereas
findings pertaining to jurisdiction are subject to set-aside review in most jurisdictions,

findings pertaining to admissibility are not.*?

The Tribunal must necessarily examine this Issue, and the parties’ related submissions,

within the confines of that legal framework:

a. The Tribunal understands that the Respondent’s objection on at least one iteration
(“They ... failed to engage the Respondent’s consent to arbitration ‘in accordance
with the procedures set out in [the NAFTA]’ under Article 1122”)°° raises an
objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction: the Respondent says it simply did not
consent to arbitrate with the Additional Claimants where their names were omitted

from the Notice.

b. It is less clear whether the other iteration of the Respondent’s objection (“Failure
to do so rendered their purported submission to arbitration void ab initio”)®! is
aimed at the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or at the claim’s admissibility. To say that the
defect rendered the submission to arbitration “void ab initio” is tantamount to
saying that the current submission to arbitration cannot be given any effect. This
will be the case both where the Tribunal finds that it has no jurisdiction over the
Additional Claimants and where it dismisses their claims as inadmissible. The
Tribunal’s findings as regards jurisdiction and admissibility will thus necessarily

dispose of this iteration as well.

c. The Claimants’ case is that the defect in the Notice only gives rise to an issue of
admissibility that does not require dismissal.°? That being so, their contention
that the Notice was understood by the Additional Claimants to be sent on their
behalf as well, even if proven, is neither here nor there: the information required

by Article 1119(a) to be included in the Notice would still be missing; and the

question would still remain whether this defect affects the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

or the claims’ admissibility.

Against this backdrop, the Tribunal will first examine whether the defect in the Notice
precludes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Additional Claimants. Should it find
that it does not, it will then examine whether the claims should nonetheless be

dismissed as inadmissible.

c. Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the Additional
Claimants?

(i) The relevant test for jurisdiction

Whether their omission from the Notice deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the
Additional Claimants is a question of consent. To wit, the question is whether the
consent given by the Respondent in Article 1122(1) was made conditional upon

satisfaction of Article 1119(a).

This question is binary and automatic. If satisfaction of Article 1119(a) is a condition
to which the Respondent has tethered its consent, the Tribunal cannot have jurisdiction
where that condition is not satisfied. By the same token, if satisfaction of Article 1119
is not a condition to which the Respondent has tethered its consent, then a defect in a
notice of intent cannot vitiate the Respondent’s consent and the Tribunal does have
jurisdiction. Siren songs of pragmatism and doomsday warnings of floodgates are

alien to this analysis.

To resolve this question, the Tribunal must interpret the Treaty as judiciously and
thoughtfully as it can, in accordance with the principles of treaty interpretation as
codified in Articles 31 and following of the VCLT. Accordingly, the Tribunal will
parse the terms of Articles 1119 and 1122, considered in their context and in light of

the Treaty’s object and purpose.

As set out below, the Tribunal finds that Article 1119 does not condition the
Respondent’s consent to arbitration in Article 1122 and that the Additional Claimants’
failure to issue a notice of intent therefore does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction

over them.

84.

(ii) The ordinary meaning of the text of Articles 1119 and
1122(1)

The Tribunal first examines Article 1119; then Article 1122(1).

First, Article 1119 is stated in mandatory terms: “shall”. However, it is entirely silent
on the consequences of a failure to include all the required information in the notice
of intent. Article 1119 does not in terms refer to Article 1122(1); does not provide
that satisfaction of the requirements of Article 1119 is a condition precedent to a
NAFTA Party’s consent; and does not state that failure to satisfy those requirements
will vitiate a NAFTA Party’s consent. The text of Article 1119 alone therefore does
not compel the conclusion that a failure to include all the required information in the

notice of intent vitiates a NAFTA Party’s consent under Article 1122(1).

Article 1122(1) also does not in terms refer back to either Article 1119 or the notice
of intent. However, Article 1122(1) does provide, in the English version of the Treaty,
that “[e]ach Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration in accordance
with the procedures set out in this Agreement’ (emphasis added). In the French and
Spanish versions of the Treaty, the italicised terms appear as “/’arbitrage
conformément aux modalités établies dans le présent accord” and “arbitraje con

apego a los procedimientos establecidos en este Tratado” , respectively.

In the Treaty’s English and French versions, the exact same language is used in Article
1121(1)(a): “arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement”
and “l’arbitrage conformément aux modalités établies dans le présent accord”. While
slightly different language is used in the Spanish version (“arbitraje en los términos
de los procedimientos establecidos en este Tratado’’), the parties agree that the phrase

as it appears in both Articles 1121 and 1122 must be given the same meaning.”?
The Tribunal must accordingly resolve two questions of interpretation:

a. Does “in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement” in Article

1122(1) modify “arbitration”?

b. If it does, do “the procedures” with which the “arbitration” must accord include

the requirements of Article 1119?
The Tribunal will address each question in turn.

(a) Does “in accordance with the procedures set out in
this Agreement” modify “arbitration”?
The parties agree that the phrase “in accordance with the procedures set out in this
Agreement” should be understood to modify “arbitration”.* The Tribunal agrees with

the parties.

This is of some import. If, on the one hand, “in accordance with the procedures set
out in this Agreement” had modified “consents” in Article 1122(1), then the provision
would have to be construed as requiring that the parties consent in accordance with
the procedures set out in the Treaty. In other words, the procedures referred to would

pertain to the procedures by which consent is to be given.

Tf, on the other hand, “in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement”
had modified “submission of a claim”, then the procedures referred to in Article

1122(1) would pertain to the procedures by which a claim was to be submitted.

But where “in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement” modifies
“arbitration”, the provisions must be construed as providing that the parties’ consent
is limited to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in the Treaty. On
that reading, the procedures referred to pertain to the procedures with which the

arbitration itself must accord.

This interpretation, subscribed to by both parties, gives meaning to Article 1122(1):
the NAFTA Parties did not provide their ex ante consent to just any arbitration: they
only consented to an arbitration which accords with the procedures set out in the

Treaty.

(b) Do “the procedures” with which the “arbitration”
must accord include the requirements of Article
1119?
The question is which provisions of the Treaty can be said to contain the “procedures”

with which the “arbitration” must accord. On this point, the parties disagree.

The Claimants’ position on this point appears to have evolved.®* In their post-hearing
brief, they submitted, in response to questions from the Tribunal, that the “procedures”
pertaining to arbitration are those set out in Articles 1123-1138 of the Treaty, which
contain the specific rules in accordance with which a Chapter 11 arbitration is to be

conducted.°°

The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that “since an arbitration commences with
the submission of a claim, the phrase ‘in accordance with the procedures set out in this
Agreement’ in Article 1121 includes the procedure that must be followed to validly
submit a claim to arbitration”;°” and similarly, in respect of Article 1122, that “the
‘procedures’ in respect of the arbitration itself include the procedures for a valid
submission of a claim to arbitration”.°°

The relevance of the point is clear: on the Respondent’s case, the “procedures” would
also include the requirements for a notice of intent under Article 1119: the
“requirement [of a Notice of Intent containing all the information set out in Article
1119], together with those established in Articles 1120 and 1121 (inter alia) establish
the ‘procedure’ for the submission of a claim to arbitration which ... marks the

commencement of an arbitral proceeding”.””

The Tribunal does not find support for the Respondent’s interpretation in the ordinary

meaning of the terms of Article 1122(1).

It is axiomatic that the “arbitration” to which the Respondent gives consent in Article

1122(1) does not commence or come into existence until the submission of a claim

The Claimants initially suggested that the consent of either party to arbitrate is not conditioned on “strict
and literal compliance” with every procedural detail in Chapter 11. See Counter-Memorial, {{ 337-338:

through the filing of a notice of arbitration.!°

Issuing a notice of intent neither
commences the “arbitration” nor legally commits an investor to commencing
“arbitration”. Only the issuance of the notice of arbitration does. After issuing a notice
of intent and until the filing of a notice of arbitration, an investor remains entirely free

not to commence “arbitration” at all.

The natural and ordinary meaning of “arbitration” is therefore the procedures
commenced by, and to be followed upon, the submission of a claim. Filing a notice
of intent is, put at its highest, a “procedure” to be followed prior to an arbitration, if
any; it is not a procedure with which the subsequent arbitration itself, if any, must
accord. As further explained below—when the Tribunal addresses the context of
Articles 1119 and 1122(1)—Articles 1123 to 1136 set out precisely those procedures

in some detail.

The Respondent counters with the argument that “the ‘procedures’ in respect of the
arbitration itself include the procedures for a valid submission of a claim to
arbitration”.'°! But that argument is circular. To add the qualifier “valid” before
“submission of a claim” is to simply assume the very point in issue. The question
precisely is whether satisfaction of Article 1119 is or is not required to “validly”
submit a claim to arbitration. Simply asserting that it is, as the Respondent’s argument

does, does not address the question whether in fact it is.

The drafters of the Treaty certainly did not so provide in terms. On the contrary, while
Articles 1120 (“Submission of a Claim to Arbitration”) and 1121(1) (“Conditions
Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration”) do expressly provide that certain
conditions must be met before a claim can be “validly” submitted to arbitration,
satisfaction of Article 1119 is not stated to be one of them. Nothing in those provisions
can be said to condition the “validity” of the submission of a claim to arbitration on

the satisfaction of Article 1119.

Pursuant to Article 1137(1) of the Treaty, “[a] claim is submitted to arbitration under this Section when
... (b) the notice of arbitration under Article 2 of Schedule C of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules has
been received by the Secretary-General”.

The Tribunal now turns to the import of these other provisions, which are part of the

context of Articles 1119 and 1122(1) that the Tribunal must consider.

(iii) The context provided by the provisions immediately
preceding and following Article 1122

Article 31 of the VCLT requires that the text of a treaty provision be interpreted in
context. Where the terms of Articles 1119 and 1122(1) do not provide that a failure
to satisfy Article 1119 vitiates the Respondent’s consent in Article 1122, the Tribunal

would need to imply this consequence from the context of those provisions.

Under the applicable principles of treaty interpretation, it is possible in certain
circumstances to imply terms from a provision’s context. The difficulty here,
however, is that the context strongly militates against reading such an implied term

into the Treaty. It does so in two ways:

a. First, in nearly all the provisions of Section B of Chapter 11 immediately
following Article 1122, the Treaty sets out detailed “procedures” with which an

“arbitration” under Chapter 11 must accord.

b. Second, in nearly all the provisions of Section B of Chapter 11 immediately
preceding Article 1122, the NAFTA Parties showed that, whenever they wanted
to condition access to Treaty arbitration on the investor’s satisfaction of certain

requirements, they expressly did so.
The Tribunal will address each point in turn.

(a) Articles 1123 to 1136

The fourteen provisions immediately following Articles 1121 and 1122—Articles
1123-1136—set out detailed procedures to be followed in any arbitration pursuant to

the Treaty.

They include, among other things, rules regarding the number of arbitrators and the
method of their appointment; the appointment of a presiding arbitrator; consolidation;
participation by a non-disputing NAFTA party; the place of arbitration; governing law;

expert reports; interim measures; and the final award.

107.

108.

109.

110.

102

The “procedures” with which any “arbitration” under Chapter 11 must accord pursuant
to Article 1122 most naturally refer to these detailed procedures for the conduct of the
arbitration set out in Articles 1123-1136. The NAFTA Parties did not consent in
Article 1122 to just any generic arbitral process; they agreed to the specific arbitral

process as organised and regulated by Articles 1123-1136.

(b) Articles 1116 to 1121

On the other hand, the provisions preceding Article 1122 show that, whenever the
drafters of the Treaty wished to condition access to Treaty arbitration on the investor’s

satisfaction of certain requirements, they specifically and expressly did so.

Article 1116 provides that “[a]n investor may not make a claim if more than three years
have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first
acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has
incurred loss or damage”.!°? Article 1117 contains mirroring provisions for claims on
behalf of an enterprise. Neither Article 1119 nor any other provision of the Treaty
similarly provides that an investor “may not make a claim” if the notice of intent omits
some of the information specified in that provision. That choice by the Treaty’s

drafters cannot be ignored.

Article 1120, styled “Submission of a Claim to Arbitration”, provides that an investor
may submit the claim to arbitration “provided that six months have elapsed since the
events giving rise to a claim” and subject to the exclusions of Annex 1120.1.'° Article
1120 does not similarly add “and provided that a notice of intent was served containing
all the information specified in Article 1119”. That choice by the Treaty’s drafters

cannot be ignored.

Article 1121(1)(a), styled “Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to
Arbitration”, provides that “a disputing investor may submit a claim ... to arbitration
only if’! the investor consents provides the requisite consent and waiver. Article
1121(a) does not similarly add “and only if the disputing investor has served a notice

of intent in the manner prescribed by Article 1119”. Nor is Article 1119 similarly

styled a “Condition Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration”. That choice

by the Treaty’s drafters cannot be ignored.

Respondent’s interpretation of Article 1122 would also lead to a strained interpretation

105

of Article 1121(1)(a), where—and on this the parties do agree’’°-—the phrase

“arbitration in accordance with ...” is to be given the same meaning. On the
Respondent’s interpretation, at the time an investor submits a claim to arbitration, it
would be required by Article 1121(1)(a) to give its “consent” not only to the arbitration
that it proposes to commence but also to a pre-arbitral step of its own that lies in the
past. It strikes the Tribunal as more natural to read the requirement of giving consent
in Article 1121(1)(a) as being prospective in nature, pertaining to a process that lies

ahead.

Article 1118 exhorts (“should”) the parties to settle a claim through consultation or
negotiation. At least one important objective of Article 1119—and on this the parties
appear to agree!°°—is to enable the Respondent to assess whether it can resolve the
claim through settlement discussions, as envisaged by Article 1118, and thus avoid
international arbitration. That is also apparent from the Free Trade Commission’s
statement on notices of intent to submit a claim to arbitration (the FTC Statement).
After referring to both Articles 1118 and 1119, the FTC states “[t]he notice of intent
naturally serves as the basis for consultations or negotiations between the disputing

investor and the competent authorities of a Party”.!°7

It is common ground that a failure to pursue such settlement discussions however is
no bar to Treaty arbitration.!°* That being so, the Respondent’s reading of Article
1119 presents a logical challenge. On the Respondent’s case, a claimant who fails to
include certain information in a notice of intent would forfeit the right to Treaty
arbitration. Yet a claimant who fails altogether to pursue the settlement effort that the
notice of intent is intended to facilitate, would retain that right undiminished. If failing
to pursue settlement discussions does not bar access to Treaty arbitration, then at least

bald logic—and at this juncture the Tribunal would not put it higher than that—

suggests that neither should a failure to comply with a step designed to facilitate such

settlement discussions.

(iv) The Treaty’s object and purpose

The Treaty’s object and purpose lend further support to the textual and contextual

analysis set out above.

In Article 102, styled “Objectives”, the NAFTA Parties recorded in paragraph 1(e)
that one such objective was to “create effective procedures for ... the resolution of
disputes”. !° In addition, in Article 1115, styled “Purpose”, the NAFTA Parties
recorded that one purpose of the dispute resolution provisions of Chapter 11 was to
“establish[] a mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes that assures ...
equal treatment among investors of the Parties ...”.!!°

This suggests that access to Chapter 11 arbitration was intended to (i) provide investors
access to a dispute resolution mechanism that is successful in producing the intended
result of resolving investment disputes (ii) without distinction between well and ill-
resourced claimants, corporate or natural persons, or more and less sophisticated

investors.

It strikes the Tribunal as a difficult proposition that these objectives could be furthered
by barring access to that dispute resolution mechanism on the basis that the names of

certain investors were omitted from the notice of intent.

(v) Decisions of other tribunals

The Respondent submits that there is a “jurisprudence constante to the effect that ‘all
pre-conditions and formalities under Articles 1118-1121’ must be satisfied by the
disputing investor in order to establish a disputing Party’s consent under Article

11227,111

There are three independent reasons why, to the Tribunal’s mind, that contention does

not advance the Respondent’s case.

(Emphasis added).
(Emphasis added).

a. First, the Tribunal’s mandate is to find the terms of the Treaty as they are and to
interpret them in accordance with the VCLT. If other tribunals have arrived at a

different interpretation of the same provision, that does not change that mandate.

b. Second, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the decisions cited by the Respondent
do form a jurisprudence constante. Other tribunals cited by the Claimants, such
as those in in ADF and Chemtura, for example, have dismissed the proposition
that a failure to satisfy the requirements of Article 1119 “must result in the loss of
jurisdiction”.''? The Tribunal therefore does not break new ground by finding

that consent in Article 1122 is not tethered to satisfaction of Article 1119.

c. Third, it is not even clear whether any of the decisions cited by the Respondent
actually did purport to construe Article 1119 as containing a condition precedent
to consent: none of them reveals any attempt to construe Article 1119 at all.'> To
the extent that those decisions are cited for the proposition that Articles 1120 and
1121(1) impose conditions that must be met for an investor to have access to
Treaty arbitration, the Tribunal does unreservedly agree with them, as explained

above.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent’s consent in
Article 1122 is not conditioned upon the satisfaction of the requirement of Article
1119(a) to identify the Additional Claimants in the Notice. The Tribunal accordingly
finds that it has jurisdiction over the Additional Claimants and dismisses the
Respondent’s objection insofar as it resisted the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the

Additional Claimants.

d. Are the claims by the Additional Claimants admissible?

As stated earlier, where the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction notwithstanding the
Additional Claimants’ failure to satisfy Article 1119(a), it must next examine whether
it is appropriate to exercise that jurisdiction over them—or put differently, whether

their claims are admissible.

(i) The relevant test for admissibility

Article 1119 imposes an obligation on the investor, but the existence of an obligation

says nothing about the consequences of a failure to meet that obligation.

The Treaty does not in terms require a sanction of dismissal. As seen above, unlike
the provisions of Articles 1116, 1117, 1120 and 1121(1), neither Article 1119 nor any
other provision of the Treaty provides that a claim can be submitted to arbitration
“only if’ or “provided that” the requirements of Article 1119 have been met.
Similarly, the FTC Statement does not provide that non-compliance with Article 1119
must result in dismissal of the claim. Absent any language in the treaty so mandating,
the Tribunal cannot imply a right to dismissal of the claim merely because to some it

might seem desirable to do so.!!4

Where the object and purpose of the Treaty includes the “creat[ion] [of] effective

procedures for ... the resolution of disputes”,''> it is also difficult to see how reading

Article 1119 as necessarily and automatically implying a sanction of dismissal could

be consistent with that object and purpose.

Decisions by other treaty tribunals exhibit no uniformity in their approaches to these
issues. Other tribunals have not always drawn a clear distinction between jurisdiction

and admissibility, and whenever in substance they addressed a preliminary objection

This trite point requires no authority but by way of illustration, see South West Africa Cases (Liberia v.
South Africa/Ethiopia v. South Africa), Judgment (Second Phase), 1966 ICJ Rep., p. 6, at 91: “It may
be urged that the Court is entitled to engage in a process of ‘filling in the gaps’, in the application of a
teleological principle of interpretation, according to which instruments must be given their maximum
effect in order to ensure the achievement of their underlying purposes. The Court need not here enquire
into the scope of a principle the exact bearing of which is highly controversial, for it is clear that it can
have no application in circumstances in which the Court would have to go beyond what can reasonably
be regarded as being a process of interpretation, and would have to engage in a process of rectification or
revision. Rights cannot be presumed to exist merely because it might seem desirable that they should”

that the investor had failed to satisfy a pre-arbitral step, they have exhibited a diversity

of approaches.

While some treaty tribunals have dismissed claims and required a refiling upon the
defect being cured,!!® others have admitted the claims when doing so best served the
interests of justice, considering factors such as futility, efficiency, due process,

prejudice and a balancing of the parties’ interests.!!7

See, for example, Western NIS Enterprise Fund v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/2, Order, 16 March
2002, CL-33.

For other NAFTA decisions, see ADF, {¥[ 134, 138, CL-18 (“Turning back to Article 1119(b), we observe
that the notice of intention to submit to arbitration should specify not only ‘the provisions of [NAFTA]
alleged to have been breached’ but also ‘any other relevant provisions [of NAFTA].’ Which provisions
of NAFTA may be regarded as also ‘relevant’ would depend on, among other things, what arguments are
subsequently developed to sustain the legal claims made. We find it difficult to conclude that failure on
the part of the investor to set out an exhaustive list of ‘other relevant provisions’ in its Notice of Intention
to Submit a Claim to Arbitration must result in the loss of jurisdiction to consider and rely upon any
unlisted but pertinent NAFTA provision in the process of resolving the dispute. ... Finally, we observe
that the Respondent has not shown that it has sustained any prejudice by virtue of the non-specification
of Article 1103 as one of the provisions allegedly breached by the Respondent. Although the Investor
first specified its claim concerning Article 1103 in its Reply to the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, the
Respondent had ample opportunity to address and meet, and did address and meet, that claim and the

distinctions drawn between claims brought under Articles 1116 and 1117, a NAFTA tribunal should be

in truth brought under Article 1117, provided there has been clear disclosure in the Article 1119 notice
of the substance of the claim, compliance with Article 1121 and no prejudice to the Respondent State or
third parties. International law does not place emphasis on merely formal considerations, nor does it
require new proceedings to be commenced where a merely procedural defect is involved”). For other
treaty decisions, see, Philip Morris Brands et al v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay, \CSID Case No.
ARB/10/7, Decis risdiction, 2 July 2013, {| 145, 147, CL-12 (“As held by the ICJ, ‘it is not
apparent why the arguments based on the sound administration of justice, which underpin the
Mavrommatis case jurisprudence, cannot also have a bearing in a case such as the present one. It would
not be in the interest of justice to oblige the Applicant, if it wishes to pursue its claims, to initiate fresh
proceedings. It is preferable except in special circumstances, to conclude that the condition has, from that
point on, been fully met’. In the Mavrommatis case the Permanent Court of International Justice had
found that jurisdictional requirements which were not satisfied at the time of instituting legal proceedings
could be met subsequently. The Court stated: ‘Even if the grounds on which the institution of proceedings
was based were defective for the reason stated, this would not be an adequate reason for the dismissal of
the applicant’s suit. The Court, whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to matters of

form the same degree of importance which they might possess in municipal law. Even, therefore, if the
application were premature because the Treaty of Lausanne had not yet been ratified, this circumstance
would now be covered by the subsequent deposit of the necessary ratifications’. The Tribunal agrees
with and accepts this reasoning. It also notes that the same reasoning applies regardless how Article
10(2)’s domestic litigation requirement is characterized. Whether regarded as jurisdictional, admissibility
or procedural, the considerations identified in the Mavrommatis case apply fully. ... Nor does the Tribunal
have to decide between the position taken by the International Court in Croatia v Serbia and the position
taken by Judge Abraham, dissenting, in that case. In Croatia v Serbia, Judge Abraham expressed the view
that the Mavrommatis principle cannot be applied if it is no longer possible to recommence the
proceedings (because of supervening changes in jurisdictional provisions, for example) at the time when
the decision is taken. In the present case, the BIT remains in force and it would be perfectly possible for
the Claimants to commence these same proceedings on the day after a decision by this Tribunal is handed
down, a situation where dismissal of the Claimants’ claims would merely multiply costs and procedures
to no use” (footnotes omitted); Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania, 1CSID
Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, 99] 343-346, CL-22 (“The Republic’s objection depends
upon the characterisation of the six-month period in Article 8(3) of the BIT as a condition precedent to
the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction, or the admissibility of BGT’s claims. In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view,
however, properly construed, this six-month period is procedural and directory in nature, rather than
jurisdictional and mandatory. Its underlying purpose is to facilitate opportunities for amicable settlement.
Its purpose is not to impede or obstruct arbitration proceedings, where such settlement is not possible.
Non-compliance with the six month period, therefore, does not preclude this Arbitral Tribunal from
proceeding. If it did so, the provision would have curious effects .... In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, such
consequences would not have been contemplated in the framing of Article 8(3), and nothing in the text
of this provision requires such, as a matter of treaty interpretation. Equally, this is not to render the
relevant wording in Article 8(3) superfluous (as was suggested, e.g., in Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine).
Treaties often contain hortatory language, and there is an obvious advantage in a provision that
specifically encourages parties to attempt to settle their disputes. There is no reason, however, why such
a direction need be a strict jurisdictional condition. Although there are different approaches to this issue,
in part depending upon the particular treaty provisions in question, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that its
analysis is in line with that adopted in many previous arbitral awards, in respect of equivalent provisions

Tribunal agrees with the view that the notice requirement does not constitute a prerequisite to jurisdiction.
Contrary to Pakistan’s position, the non-fulfilment of this requirement is not ‘fatal to the case of the
claimant’ (Tr. J., 222:34). As Bayindir pointed out, to require a formal notice would simply mean that
Bayindir would have to file a new request for arbitration and restart the whole proceeding, which would
be to no-one’s advantage (Tr. J., 184:18 et seq.). ... The Tribunal further notes that Pakistan made no
proposal to engage in negotiations with Bayindir following Bayindir’s notification of 4 April 2002, which
made an explicit reference to the failure of the efforts to negotiate. In the Tribunal’s view, if Pakistan
had been willing to engage in negotiations with Bayindir, in the spirit of Article VII of the BIT, it would
have had many opportunities to do so during the six months following the notification of 4 April 2002.
Along the lines of the award rendered in Lauder v. The Czech Republic, the Tribunal is prepared to find
that preventing the commencement of the arbitration proceedings until six months after the 4 April 2002
notification would, in the circumstances of this case, amount to an unnecessary, overly formalistic
approach which would not serve to protect any legitimate interests of the Parties and hold[s] ‘that the six-
month waiting period in [the BIT] does not preclude it from having jurisdiction in the present
proceedings’”(footnotes omitted)); Enkev Beheer B.V. v. Republic of Poland, PCA Case No. 2013-01,
First Partial Award, 14 April 2014, { 321, CL-58 (“With these cumulative explanatory factors, the
Tribunal considers that it would not be right to construe the terms of Article 8 of the Treaty as barring
absolutely the Claimant's claims in this arbitration as a matter of jurisdiction; nor, for the same reason
and on the facts of this case, to consider such claims inadmissible as regards the exercise of jurisdiction
by this Tribunal. Having regard to the object and purpose of Article 8 under Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties, given also the context of the Treaty intended (by its preamble)
expressly to encourage and protect foreign investments in Poland, the Tribunal decides that the over-strict
meaning, for which the Respondent contends, is too semantic in its approach and unduly harsh in its
result. This is particularly so where the Claimant's non-compliance is only formalistic and where the
Respondent has suffered no prejudice which could not be compensated by an appropriate order by this
Tribunal for legal and arbitration costs unnecessarily incurred or wasted by reason of the Claimant's undue

If a common denominator can be derived from these diverging approaches, it is that
there is no automaticity between the existence of an admissibility defect and the
dismissal of the claim. Instead, the question of whether to admit the claim
notwithstanding the defect is one that involves a margin of judicial appreciation by the

tribunal.

This is the approach that the Tribunal will adopt here.''® In exercising judgment as to
whether the Additional Claimants’ claims should be admitted, the Tribunal must do
what best serves the interests of justice. To that end, the Tribunal considers that it
must give particular weight to whether the defect has caused the Respondent any

prejudice and which course is favoured by an efficient administration of justice.

As explained in the next section, in the specific circumstances of this case, the
foregoing considerations militate against a dismissal of the Additional Claimants’

claims.

(ii) Whether the claims by the Additional Claimants are admissible

As seen earlier, the FTC Statement indicates that the purpose of a notice of intent is to
provide a NAFTA Party with the information it needs to assess amicable settlement
opportunities as contemplated in Article 1118. It is possible for that purpose to be

fulfilled even where the notice of intent fails to include all of the requisite information.

haste in commencing this arbitration.”); Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic, 1CSID Case No.
ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Adm lity, 4 August 2011, 1 584, CL-38 (“This conclusion
derives more from a weighting of the specific interests at stake rather than from the application of the
general principle of futility: It is not about whether the 18 months litigation requirement may be
considered futile; it is about determining whether Argentina‘s interest in being able to address the specific
claims through its domestic legal system would justify depriving Claimants of their interests of being
able to submit it to arbitration”).

The Tribunal notes that other tribunals have sometimes gone further, considering they had a margin of
judicial appreciation even where a pre-arbitral step is an express condition on a party’s consent to
arbitration. The Tribunal does not (and does not need to) follow that approach. See, e.g., Philip Morris
Brands et al v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2
July 2013, | 144, CL-12 (“[EJven if the [domestic litigation] requirement were regarded as
jurisdictional, the Tribunal concludes that it could be, and was, satisfied by actions occurring after the
date the arbitration was instituted. The Tribunal notes that the ICJ’s decisions show that the rule that
events to the institution of legal ings are to be di ded for jurisdictional purposes
has not prevented that Court from accepting jurisdiction where requirements for jurisdiction that were
not met at the time of instituting the proceedings were met subsequently (at least where they occurred
before the date on which a decision on jurisdiction is to be taken)”) (emphasis added).

134.

In the same vein, the Respondent acknowledges that Article 1119 may need to be
approached with some flexibility when it observes that “there may be room to argue
that a notice of intent containing minor flaws—such as a misspelled name or an
incorrect postal code—is sufficiently compliant with Article 1119”.''? One could
think of other examples, such as the estimation of damages required by Article
1119(d): how many notices can be said in hindsight to have included a truly accurate
estimate? NAFTA case law may in that sense well be rife with technically inaccurate
Article 1119 notices. Yet nobody would suggest that this should have barred those

claims.

While the Tribunal takes the Respondent’s point that the omission of the names of the
Additional Claimants is not a “minor flaw” akin to a misspelling of their names, the
fact remains that the addition of those names would not have expanded on the notice
given to the Respondent as regards the nature of the dispute. The claims by the
Additional Claimants being co-extensive with those asserted by the Original
Claimants in the Notice, the Notice still provided the Respondent with sufficient

information regarding the dispute to enable a meaningful settlement effort.

This is therefore not a situation where a respondent State has been ambushed, hearing
about the dispute as such for the first time upon receipt of the request for arbitration.
Where the purpose of the Notice was to facilitate settlement discussions pursuant to

Article 1118, the Notice here did serve that purpose.

The Respondent submits that the claims by the Additional Claimants should
nonetheless be dismissed because they failed to cure the defect by doing one of two
things:

First, the Claimants as a group could have asked the ICSID to

suspend registration of the claim during the 57 days that

registration was pending. They would then file a fresh notice of

intent naming all of the disputing investors, wait 90 days and then
refile the RFA. ...

The second potential course of action would have been for the
Additional Claimants to file their own notice of intent, wait 90 days
and then file a request for arbitration in a separate proceeding ...

and apply later to have the two cases consolidated under NAFTA

Article 1126!
The Claimants did indeed neither of those things. Instead, they served an Amended
Notice (including the names of all the Additional Claimants) after the registration of
the Request, on 2 September 2016, and they did not refile the Request. The Tribunal

was constituted more than five months later, on 14 February 2017.

The Tribunal accepts that the Amended Notice did not allow any renewed settlement
effort to take place prior to arbitration, as envisaged—albeit in exhortatory terms
only—by Article 1118. In the circumstances of this case, however, the Tribunal
cannot see how dismissal on that basis can be either reconciled with the precept of an

efficient administration of justice or warranted by the existence of prejudice.

First, where, as here, the Notice did in fact contain information sufficient to enable
meaningful settlement discussions prior to the arbitration, there is no discernible
prejudice to the Respondent. Second, even if that had not been the case, where the
parties then still had more than five months before the constitution of the Tribunal to

pursue settlement efforts, the appropriate sanction would not have been dismissal.

Instead, in that case the Respondent would have been entitled to compensation for any

resultant financial wastage. '?!

Where an investor impairs the ability of the NAFTA
Party to pursue settlement prior to arbitration, it is well within the powers of a NAFTA
tribunal to allocate responsibility for any resultant wastage to the investor. Failure to
comply with Article 1119 may in that sense come at considerable financial cost to the

investor, and there is no risk of Article 1119 being rendered nugatory.

Based on the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s
objection insofar as it sought the dismissal of the Additional Claimants’ claims as
inadmissible. The Tribunal emphasizes that it reaches that conclusion in light of the

circumstances specific to this case—what best serves the interests of the

Reply, {{f 79-80.
Conceptually this is not novel. The Tribunal notes that in the domestic legal context, where a contract
requires a notice of dispute prior to commencement of arbitration for the same purpose of enabling
settlement disc ns, a failure to issue a compliant notice of dispute is treated in some jurisdictions in
the same manner as any breach of contract: where that breach of contract can be shown to have caused
financial loss to the other party, the applicable remedy in those systems is to award damages; not to
decline arbitral jurisdiction. See G. Born and M. Scekic, Pre-Arbitration Procedural Requirements, in
D. Caron et al. (eds.), Practising Virtue: Inside International Arbitration (2015), p. 249.

administration of justice will necessarily yield different conclusions in different

circumstances.

B. THE CLAIMANTS’ CLAIM UNDER ARTICLE 1117 ON BEHALF OF THE
MEXICAN COMPANIES

The Respondent has raised all three Issues in respect of the claims under Article 1117
on behalf of the Mexican Companies: consent by the Mexican Companies (Article
1121); consent by the Respondent (Articles 1119/1122); and ownership or control
(Article 1117).

The Tribunal can readily dispose of the second of those objections. As with the
Additional Claimants, the failure to identify Operadora Pesa in the original Notice
does not vitiate the Respondent’s consent under Article 1122. All the reasoning set
out in Section V.A.2 above applies mutatis mutandis to the Respondent’s objection

insofar as it pertains to Operadora Pesa.

The Tribunal will address the two remaining objections in this order: first the objection
giving rise to Issue 3 (ownership or control), and then the objection giving rise to Issue

1 (consent by the Mexican Companies).

1. Article 1117: did the Claimants own or control the Mexican
Companies at the relevant time(s)?

For the Claimants to be able to pursue claims on behalf of the Mexican Companies
under Article 1117, they must establish that they owned or controlled those companies
at the relevant time(s). To resolve the Respondent’s objection that the Claimants have

failed to do so, the Tribunal must answer each of the following questions:

a. What is or are the relevant time(s) at which the Claimants must be able to

demonstrate ownership or control?
b. What number and type of shares did the Claimants own at such time(s)?

c. Based on the foregoing, did the Claimants “own” the Mexican Companies at such

time(s)?

d. Based on the foregoing, did the Claimants “control” the Mexican Companies at

such time(s)?

127

The Tribunal will address each question in turn.

a. What is or are the relevant time(s) at which the Claimants must be
able to demonstrate ownership or control?

The parties agree that the Claimants must establish that they owned or controlled the

Mexican Companies at the time of the treaty breaches.'*> At least one other NAFTA

 

tribunal to have confronted this issue has so held, !73 and this Tribunal agrees.

  

The parties disagree, however, as to whether the Claimants must also establish that
they owned or controlled the Mexican Companies at the time of the submission of the
claim. The Claimants submit that they must not.'24 The Respondent submits that they

must.!?°

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent.

This is clear from the terms of Article 1117 itself, which uses the present tense: an
investor may make a claim “on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a
juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly”.'2° Thus, the
investor must own or control the enterprise at the time it submits a claim on the
enterprise’s behalf. The drafters of the Treaty could have said an enterprise “that the

investor owned or controlled at the time of the alleged breach”. They chose not to.

Similarly, Article 1121(1)(b) requires that an investor submitting a claim to arbitration
“and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of another
Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly,
the enterprise”,'?” waive their right to initiate or continue proceedings before any
domestic forums. Again, the Treaty clearly envisages that the investor own or control
the enterprise at the time arbitration is commenced. The drafters of the Treaty could

have used the past tense; they chose not to.

These textual points alone are, in the Tribunal’s mind, dispositive: disregarding that
unequivocal direction in the text of the Treaty would offend the principles of

interpretation of the VCLT that the Tribunal must apply.

The Tribunal observes that the fact that Article 1117 requires the investor to own or
control the enterprise at the time it submits a claim on that enterprise’s behalf does not
deprive an investor of Treaty protection where a NAFTA Party expropriates, otherwise

causes the loss of, or destroys the value of, its investment.

In those circumstances, the investor’s claims under Article 1116 will survive
undiminished. Article 1116 does not require subsistence of the investment at the time
a claim is submitted. Indeed, unlawful expropriation being the textbook example of
wrongful conduct against which the Treaty seeks to protect, any other interpretation
would eviscerate the protections of Chapter 11. However, where the investor no
longer owns or controls the enterprise at the time of submission of the claim, it can no

longer pursue an Article 1117 claim “on behalf of” that enterprise.

The authorities cited by the Claimants on this point!?* are inapposite. None of them
addressed the question of whether ownership or control for purposes of Article 1117
must be established at the time of submission of the claim. The Claimants themselves
admit that the tribunal in Mondev “did not specifically address ownership/control

130

under Article 1117”.!° In Gallo, as the Respondent rightly points out,'*° the issue

was whether a claimant had to own or control the enterprise at the time of the breach

in order to bring an Article 1117 claim.'*!

Further, Daimler and EnCana are not
NAFTA cases and do not shed any light on this point of interpretation of Article 1117.
To the extent that any of these cases suggest that a claimant does not need to own or
control its investment at the time of submission of the claim, these cases were in the

context of an investor bringing claims on its own behalf, similar to claims under

Claimants’ PHB, { 94.

Article 1116.'*? As already explained, the Tribunal agrees that Article 1116 does not

require subsistence of the investment at the time of the claim.

b. What number and type of shares did the Claimants own in the
Juegos Companies at the relevant times?
One would have thought that this question would be the least controversial part of the

case. Unfortunately it was not. There are three reasons for that:

a. Controversy has arisen as to whether in November 2014 the Claimants transferred
their shares in the Juegos Companies to a third party—which the Tribunal will

refer to as the Grand Odyssey Controversy.

b. Evidentiary difficulties have arisen from the fact that the Claimants have been
unable to produce most of the relevant shareholder registries and capital variation

books for the Juegos Companies.

c. Controversy has arisen as to whether asambleas conducted for the Juegos
Companies in January 2018 could validly and retroactively approve certain share

transfers allegedly made prior to 2014.
The Tribunal will address each point in turn.

(i) The Grand Odyssey controversy

The Respondent alleges that, pursuant to resolutions adopted at asambleas held in 7
November 2014 for four of the Juegos Companies—all except JVE Mexico—the
Claimants transferred their shares in those Juegos Companies to a third party, Grand

Odyssey. !7

The Claimants contend that no such transfer occurred, '** that they called asambleas
in early 2018 to declare the asambleas held on 7 November 2014, and the resolutions

adopted during those asambleas in favour of Grand Odyssey, to be void ab initio.'*>

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the record relating to this matter. On that basis,
the Tribunal finds that no transfer of shares to Grand Odyssey occurred, whether prior
to, during, or after the November 2014 asambleas. The Tribunal sets out below its

findings leading to that conclusion.

Some time prior to August 2014, an individual named Benjamin Chow contacted
Gordon Burr, offering to assist the Claimants in reopening the casinos. Chow
proposed a plan which involved, amongst other things, giving control of the Boards of
the Juegos Companies to Chow and his associates (including an individual named Luc
Pelchat), and the transfer of the Claimants’ shares in the Juegos Companies to Grand

Odyssey. !3°

On 29 August 2014, the five Juegos Companies each held an asamblea in which the
shareholders: (i) granted control of the Boards to Chow, Pelchat and another of their
associates; !*’ and (ii) in the case of four of the Juegos Companies—all except JVE

Mexico—authorised the Claimants to execute a transfer of their shares to Grand

Odyssey while noting that such transfers would still have to be formalised.!**
Subsequently, the Claimants continued negotiating a Share Purchase Agreement with

Chow in respect of the transfer of shares to Grand Odyssey. '*?

On 7 November 2014, Chow called another asamblea for each of the four Juegos
Companies (except JVE Mexico). At the asambleas, Chow purported to approve a
transfer of shares from the Claimants to Grand Odyssey '*° and represented that he had

secured proxies from the Claimants to do so.'4!

However, the evidence on record shows clearly that Chow did not have the proxies
and that there was no quorum at the November 2014 asambleas. 142 Instead, the record
shows that the Claimants, who did not attend the asambleas, had expressly refused to
give their proxies to Chow when he asked; and that they gave their proxies to their
Mexican counsel, Mr. Julio Gutierrez, and his firm, Rios Ferrer. '44 The record further
shows that, upon hearing Chow’s representations, Gutierrez and his associates:
immediately objected to the transfer of any shares;'*> refused to sign the meeting
minutes; '4° refused to deliver the proxies (without which there was an insufficient

accordingly finds that the resolutions purportedly passed by Chow at the November

2014 asambleas were manifestly infected with irregularity.

It is also difficult to see what share transfers those asambleas could have approved: it
was not until 15 January 2015 and 3 February 2015 that the Claimants entered into
two SPAs with Grand Odyssey.'*? It is abundantly cler from the terms of these SPAs

themselves that, as of the date of their execution, there was no transfer of shares:

a. The SPAs provided that, until Closing, the shareholders of the Juegos Companies

“shall own and control ownership of the [shares in the Juegos Companies]”. 150

c. The SPAs provided that asambleas would be called to declare the November 2014

resolutions “void and of no effect” and to recognize that no share transfer would

occur “until Closing under this Agreement”. !*?

are open and operating under the Grand Odyssey License or such other license as

may be obtained by Grand Odyssey in substantially the same manner as prior to

of any Facility”—an event which, it is undisputed, never came to pass.!°

e. The parties agreed that the SPAs could be terminated “if the Closing Date shall

not have occurred on or before June 30, 2015”.!>4

Consistent with these provisions of the SPAs, on 2 June 2015 Ayervais sent an email
to Chow asking him to, inter alia, “[c]all for an asamblea to approve the new deal,
reverse the stock transfers that occurred in November, approve the financials, change
the board of directors until the new deal is completed and deal with the Beiruti
situation.”!°> When read in context, the Tribunal understands Ayervais’s reference to
“reverse the stock transfers” to be a shorthand paraphrasing of the aforementioned
requirement of the SPAs that “actions taken at asambleas conducted on November 7,
2014 which approved a transfer of shares of Class B shareholders of the Casino
Companies to Grand Odyssey ... are [to be] declared void and of no effect ...”.'°° On
1 July 2015, Ayervais sent an email to the parties to the SPAs notifying them of the

termination of the SPAs pursuant to Clause 10.1(f).!°’ On 6 July 2015, Ayervais

followed up with a letter to the parties to the SPAs stating the same. !*

In early 2016, there was a phone meeting between Ayervais, Gordon Burr, Gutierrez,
Chow and Pelchat in which Ayervais and Burr requested that Chow and Pelchat return
Board control to them, and properly document that the 7 November 2014 asambleas
minutes were invalid and that no share transfer to Grand Odyssey had occurred. Chow

and Pelchat refused and demanded “millions of dollars” for alleged expenses.'*? On

exchange for payment of the [Consideration]....” Clause 8.2: “Mutual Conditions Precedent. The
obligation of the parties to complete the transactions contemplated hereunder are subject to the
satisfaction of all parties, on or before the Closing Date, of the following conditions precedent, each of

in substantially the same manner as prior to their closure and there existing no proceedings to terminate

6 June 2016, the Claimants eventually filed a Federal Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claim against Chow and Pelchat in the District
Court of Colorado in order to recover Board control.'© The Claimants testified that
they went down the RICO litigation route for lack of confidence in the Mexican court
system.'®! The Claimants eventually reached a settlement agreement with Pelchat and

Chow in April 2017! and August 2017! respectively.

Based on this evidence, it is clear that the condition precedent in Clause 8.2(e) of the
SPAs was not met; that the SPAs were terminated; and that the share transfer
envisaged in those SPAs never occurred. It is also clear from the SPAs—which were
executed between, inter alia, some of the Claimants and Chow (as President of the
Board of Grand Odyssey)—that the parties to those instruments understood and
recognized that the November 2014 asambleas did not result in a transfer of shares.
Not to put too fine a point on it but they would not have entered into SPAs providing

for the transfer of those shares if those shares had already been transferred.

This disposes of the point. The Tribunal notes that, in their evidence given to the
Tribunal, Chow and Pelchat both also testified that no share transfer had occurred. '®4
The Tribunal would have reached its conclusion without that evidence, to which it
assigns weight commensurate with the credibility of those witnesses. The Tribunal
also need not place reliance on the 5 January 2018 asambleas declaring the November
2014 asambleas resolutions to be void ab initio. While those asambleas are

confirmatory of the Tribunal’s findings, it would have made those findings regardless.
(ii) _ Evidentiary issues arising from the destruction of evidence

The Claimants contend, and have submitted witness evidence affirming, that many of

the corporate documents that would have evidenced the extent of their shareholdings

in the Mexican Companies were either destroyed in a May 2017 fire at the Naucalpan

casino or were ransacked from the office of their lawyer, Mr. Jose Miguel Ramirez.!®

The Respondent does not dispute that the fire at the Naucalpan casino or the ransacking
occurred. The Respondent argues, however, that no matter what reasons the Claimants
have provided for their failure to provide certain corporate documents, the Claimants
have ultimately failed to put forward sufficient evidence to meet their burden of

showing ownership of shares in the Mexican Companies. !°

The Tribunal discerns nothing in the record that casts doubt on the Claimants’
evidence as to how the documentary evidence came to be lost. The witness evidence
on this point also stands unchallenged.'®’ As a matter of first principles, the Claimants
should therefore be afforded a fair opportunity to adduce evidence of their

shareholding through other means.

The manner in which that evidence was eventually marshalled by the Claimants,

however, was less than ideal:

a. First, with its Counter-Memorial, the Claimants only introduced the 2006-2008
capitalisation asambleas and tables in Erin Burr’s witness statement purporting to
Jay out the Claimants’ shareholding in the Mexican Companies from 19 June 2013

to 25 July 2017 (i.e. when her witness statement was submitted). !°*

b. In its Reply Memorial, the Respondent objected that this evidence was
insufficient. The Respondent argued that the minutes of the 2006-2008 asambleas

were, “‘at best, evidence of the Claimants’ shareholding in the Mexican

+169

[Companies] as of the date of the respective asamblea. The Respondent

submitted that the Claimants had to do more than that:

There is no testimony or documentary evidence of any kind from any
of the Additional Claimants, the very parties that allegedly make up
the voting control of the Juegos companies. Surely, in the absence of
corporate records that are alleged to have been lost in a fire, and the

date of acquisition and disposal (if any), the class of shares acquired
and the amount paid would be a witness statement from each investor,
with supporting documentation, such as lawyers’ or notaries’
reporting letters, copies of share certificates, cancelled cheques and/or
receipts, and dividend statements. '”° (emphasis in original)

c. With their Rejoinder, the Claimants then “called the Respondent’s bluff’,!7! as
they put it, and produced witness statements by each of the Claimants attesting to
their respective shareholdings as of 2006-2008 and from June 2013 through the
present.'’* The Claimants also adduced additional documentary evidence to
prove their share ownership during that period using a combination of the

following:

i. Schedule K-1s (Form 8865), which are US tax documents used to report a
partner’s share of partnership income, deductions, credits, etc. of a foreign
partnership.'”* The forms reflect every partner’s percentage interest in the
partnership income at the start and end of the year for which the form is
filed. US investors who receive this form from the companies have to file
it with their annual income tax returns. For all the Juegos Companies, the
forms filed at the end of 2013 and 2014 reflect the Series A shareholding
from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2014. Further, for JVE Sureste
and JVE Mexico, the forms filed reflect the Series B shareholding in those

companies at that time.

ii. Transfer request forms authorising the payment of dividends or the return
of premiums to shareholders, pro rata their interest in the company.! For

asambleas at the Juegos Companies, the minutes of which could have recorded how
the shares were held at such times) and their drip-feeding of important evidence into
the record have made this proceeding more cumbersome than it could have been. That,
however, is an observation relevant only to costs, and the Tribunal returns to this in
due course. The question for present purposes is what the aggregate of the evidence
thus marshalled and placed on the record proves to the Tribunal’s satisfaction. The

Tribunal turns to this next.

(iii) | The Claimants’ share ownership in the Juegos Companies
and the January 2018 asambleas

The evidentiary record regarding the Claimants’ shareholding in the Juegos
Companies is bookended on either side by asambleas. Minutes of those asambleas

were taken and notarized. As a result, these minutes are a matter of public record.

The notarized minutes record what the shareholding was in the Juegos Companies
during the period 2006-2008 (i.e., at the time of their capitalization) and as at January
2018. The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants’ share ownership in the Juegos
Companies as at those times was as recorded in those asamblea minutes.'*° Table 1

below reproduces the share ownership in each of the Juegos Companies on either date.

The Respondent has suggested that there may not have been a quorum at the 2018 asambleas. The
Tribunal is satisfied, on the preponderance of the evidence, that there was a quorum, including the fact
that: (i) the Scrutineer, Mr. Gutierrez, testified at the hearing that there was a quorum; (ii) the minutes
themselves refer to the existence of a quorum; (iii) the Mexican notary public stated in the notarised
asamblea minutes that he or she saw the list of attendance; (iv) the Claimants’ expert, Mr. Zamora, stated
in his expert report that he saw the list of attendance; and (v) no shareholder has challenged the validity
of these asambleas. See Tr. (ENG), Day 2, 579:11-582:3 (Gutierrez); Notarised Minutes of the General

total issued shares, and the types of issued shares, in JVE Sureste.

Table 1: The Claimants' shareholding in 2006-2006 and January 2018

As these tables show, both at the time of the Juegos Companies’ capitalization and in

January 2018, the Claimants held more than 50% of the Series B shares and more than

50% of the outstanding stock in each of the Juegos Companies. The question however

is what the Claimants’ share ownership was in between those two bookends, and

specifically between June 2013 (the first instance of allegedly wrongful conduct) and
June 2016 (the submission of the claim to arbitration). As noted above, these are the

relevant points in time at which ownership or control must be established.

The Claimants contend that the 2014 Shareholding Worksheet accurately represents
the Claimants’ share ownership from June 2013 through the present. To the extent
there are discrepancies between the 2006-2008 asamblea resolutions and the 2014
Shareholding Worksheet, they submit that those are due to certain share transfers prior
to 2014 that were not duly approved by asambleas at the time, as required by the By-

Laws of the Juegos Companies.

According to the Claimants, that lack of requisite asamblea approval is
inconsequential for two reasons. First, they contend, as a matter of Mexican law, the
share transfers were valid and effective as of the date of their execution, regardless of
asamblea approval.'°? Second, even if asamblea approval were necessary to give
effect to the share transfers, the January 2018 asambleas could and did retroactively

give them effect.!°°

The Respondent submits that, as a matter of Mexican law, the share transfers did not
come into existence until they were approved by an asamblea, i.e., in January 2018,
and that the January 2018 asambleas could not retroactively approve the share
transfers.!°* Asa result, the Respondent contends, there is still no conclusive evidence

of share ownership between 2006-2008 and January 2018.!%>

Both parties presented expert evidence on Mexican law in support of their positions.
The examination of both experts revealed a considerable body of agreement between

them. The experts agreed that: (i) under Mexican law, the validity inter se of a contract

for the transfer of shares does not depend on approval by the company;'*° but (ii)
approval by the company is still necessary for the transferee to be recognised as a
shareholder and to be able to exercise its rights as one vis-a-vis the company, i.e.

receive dividends and exercise any voting rights associated with the shares. '°”

They maintained their disagreement, however, as to whether the company can
retroactively recognise such shareholder status by retroactively approving a share
transfer. The Claimants’ expert insisted that it can because lack of contemporaneous
approval infects the transfer only with relative nullity which can be cured

retroactively; 198

the Respondent’s expert, while agreeing that legal acts infected with
relative nullity can be retroactively ratified, '°? contended the opposite because here it
is the company’s approval of the transfer that is simply non-existent.7° The
Claimants’ expert also accepted that there can be no retroactivity even for cases of

relative nullity where this causes prejudice to third parties with acquired rights.7°!

In the Tribunal’s view, much of the experts’ debate, scholarly and helpful as it was,

has limited practical relevance for purposes of this phase, for two reasons.

First, and on this point the experts’ examination at the hearing was elucidating, it is
now undisputed that the share transfers were valid and effective inter partes as at the
time they occurred. It is therefore uncontested that the shares were in fact owned by

the transferee shareholders as at that time.

The only point in dispute is whether the transferee shareholders were also recognized
as such by the Juegos Companies and could exercise the rights to receive dividends
and to vote attached to those shares. In this respect, the record is conclusive that indeed

they could and did.

None of the Juegos Companies or any third party has ever contested the validity of the

share transfers or denied the transferee shareholders the right to receive dividends or

to vote associated with those shares on the basis that the transfers had not been
formally approved. On the contrary, the record shows that the Juegos Companies
issued dividends consistent with the share transfers, and that those dividend payments

were regularly reported for US tax purposes.

On that record, the Tribunal finds that (i) as a matter of Mexican law the transferee
shareholders did own the shares upon the transfer of those shares to them, and (ii) as
a matter of fact, the transferee shareholders have been able to exercise the rights

attached to the shares since the date of their transfer.

Second, even if the Tribunal gave no probative value to the (largely uncontested)
witness and documentary evidence evidencing this ownership and de facto recognition
and found that the Claimants’ share ownership between June 2013 and June 2016 was
instead as recorded in the 2006-2008 asambleas, the Claimants would still have owned
more than 50% of the Series B shares (or, in the case of JVE Mexico, 50% of the
combined Series B and C shares, and at least 50% each of the Series A and B shares),
which, as explained below, the parties agree is the relevant threshold for proving the

legal capacity to control the Juegos Companies under Article 1117.

Put differently, the share movements between 2006 and 2014 were always insufficient
to ever reduce the Claimants’ Series B shareholding below that threshold and they
therefore do not bear on the Tribunal’s determination whether the Claimants controlled

the Juegos Companies for purposes of Article 1117 between June 2013 and June 2016.

In light of the foregoing, and based on the evidentiary record as a whole, the Tribunal
finds that the Claimants’ share ownership between June 2013 and June 2016 was as

represented in Tables 2 to 6 below.

(a) JVE Mexico

The Claimants collectively held at all relevant times at least 84.0% of the A shares,
100.0% of the B shares, 75% of the combined B and C shares and 82.3% of the total

outstanding stock of JVE Mexico.

The Tribunal notes that, unlike the 2014 Shareholding Worksheet and the January 2018 asamblea

shares in the company.

The Tribunal notes the discrepancy between Erin Burr’s second witness statement detailing the
shareholding in June 2013 and the transfer request forms detailing the shareholding in August 2013. Erin
Burr’s witness statement suggests that by June 2013 the total number of Series B shares issued by the
company had decreased by 0.200 shares to 38,800 as a result of a non-Claimant’s bankruptcy. See E.
Burr Second WS, { 41, CWS-8. By contrast, the transfer request forms show that this shareholder
continued to receive dividend payments, and thus held shares in the company, until the end of 2013. See

Table 7: Claimants’ shareholding in E-Games

(b) Operadora Pesa

The Claimants do not own, and have never owned, any shares in Operadora Pesa.258

c. Did the Claimants “own” the Mexican Companies at the relevant
times?
The Respondent submits that the Claimants do not own the Mexican Companies
because ownership requires “full ownership or virtually full ownership of the
company”.”°? The Claimants submit that they do because majority ownership (50% +

1) of the company’s shares is sufficient to “own” the company.”

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent. To reach that conclusion, the Tribunal has

considered the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 1117, read in context.

First, Article 1117 refers to owning “an enterprise’. It does not refer to owning “equity
securities of an enterprise”. That choice of words should be given due weight.
Elsewhere in Chapter 11, when defining “investment”, the drafters of the Treaty took
care to distinguish between ‘“(a) an enterprise” and “(b) an equity security of an

enterprise”.°°! If the drafters of the Treaty would have wanted to equate ownership of

an “enterprise” with ownership of a certain number of the “equity securities of an

enterprise”, this suggests they knew how to do so, and that they would have done so.

Second, Article 1117 does not refer to any share ownership threshold that, on the
Claimants’ case, must be reached to “own” the enterprise. The Claimants suggest that
it is 50% + 1. But it would have been easy for the drafters of the Treaty to say that if
that is what they had in mind. In fact, in another multilateral treaty to which all
NAFTA Parties are also parties, that is what was done. Article XXVIII(n) of the
GATS specifies that a company is “‘owned’ by persons of a Member if more than 50
per cent of the equity interest in it is beneficially owned by persons of that Member”.?

In the Treaty, the NAFTA Parties chose not to so define ownership of an enterprise.

Third, while Article 1117 does not specify an ownership threshold, its context
indicates that the NAFTA Parties envisaged a shareholding threshold that must
always, regardless of applicable law or bylaws, be sufficient to confer the legal

capacity to control the enterprise:

a. Article 1117(3) addresses the situation where an investor pursues claims under
Article 1117 and either the investor “or a non-controlling investor in the
enterprise” pursues parallel claims under Article 1116. This paragraph thus
assumes that the only investor who can pursue an Article 1117 claim on behalf of
an enterprise will be a controlling investor, because a “non-controlling” investor
is deemed limited to the pursuit of an Article 1116 claim. It follows that the
“ownership” of an enterprise in paragraph | of Article 1117 must always be

sufficient to give the investor the legal capacity to control.

b. Article 1121(2) requires the enterprise to consent and provide a waiver as a
condition precedent to the submission of an Article 1117 claim on its behalf by
an investor. This again suggests that the investor has an equity holding that
always confers on it the legal capacity to control the enterprise. If it has not, it
cannot be presumed capable of procuring the consent and waiver from the

enterprise. Article 1121(4) further confirms this when it provides that the waiver

from the enterprise is not required when the NAFTA Party has deprived the

investor of control.

c. Article 1113 contains the so-called denial of benefits clause. It allows a NAFTA
Party to deny the benefits of the Treaty to an investor of another NAFTA Party
that is an enterprise of that NAFTA Party when investors from non-NAFTA
parties “own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial
business activities in the territory of [that NAFTA Party].” The purpose is to
avoid an obligation to extend Treaty benefits to a “sham” company set up by an
investor from a non-NAFTA party. It is intrinsic to the notion of a sham company
that its shareholders can control it so as to gain access to Treaty benefits. That is
also how Canada interpreted this provision in its Statement of Implementation,
where it stated “[u]nder [A]rticle 1113, a Party may deny the benefits of this
chapter in the case that investors of a non-Party control the investment and the
denying Party does not maintain diplomatic relations with the non-Party or the
denying Party has prohibited transactions with enterprises of the non-Party which
could be circumvented if the NAFTA applied. A Party may also deny benefits in
the case of ’sham’ investments (i.e., where there are no substantial business

9263

activities in a NAFTA country). Thus, again, the requisite ownership

threshold is assumed to be one that always confers the legal capacity to control.

As the facts of this case show, the requisite share ownership that confers the legal
capacity to control is not necessarily 50% + 1 of the outstanding stock. What that
threshold is will vary for each enterprise, depending on what its by laws and/or the
governing law provide for. The only equity holding that will always, independently
of the circumstances, confer the legal capacity to control is ownership of all or
virtually all of the outstanding stock. Contextual analysis therefore suggests that by
“ownership” of an enterprise, the NAFTA Parties contemplated ownership of all the

outstanding shares of that enterprise.

Canadian Statement on Implementation of the NAFTA, Canada Gazette, 1 January 1994, Part I, p. 147,
at p. 8, CL-47 (emphasis added). The Claimants have relied on this document where it refers to
“majority-owned” companies in support of their position that to own an enterprise means to majority-
own an enterprise. See, Rejoinder, | 44. However, the passage cited by the Claimants is a summary of
the Treaty’s definition of investment—which clearly does protect majority shareholding—and not Article
1117.

81

205.

The Tribunal also did not find “any relevant rules of international law applicable in
the relations between the parties” within the meaning of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT
that would affect this plain reading of “ownership” in Article 1117. The definitions
of “ownership” in GATS Article XXVIII(n) and Article 13(a)(ii) of the MIGA
Convention? are of limited import because, as argued by the Respondent, the
NAFTA Parties’ choice not to further define “ownership” under Article 1117 must be
respected.” The Claimants’ reference to Mexico’s notification under the OECD
Declaration as to the definition of “owned or controlled directly or indirectly” in that
instrument is also inapplicable because it is not a rule applicable in the relations
between all the NAFTA Parties. In performing an analysis under Article 31(3)(c) of
the VCLT, the Tribunal will not “rewrite” or “substitute a plain reading”?® of Article

1117.

This interpretation of “own” also gives meaning to “or control” in Article 1117. As
discussed in the next section, “control” can mean both the legal capacity to control and

de facto control. Article 1117 thus applies whenever the investor:

a. owns all of the outstanding shares in an enterprise (an enterprise that the investor

“owns”);

b. owns a lesser number of shares that is still sufficient in the specific circumstances
to confer the legal capacity to control (an enterprise that the investor “‘controls”);

or

c. does not own a number of shares sufficient to confer the legal capacity to control
but is otherwise able to exercise de facto control (also an enterprise that the

investor “controls’’).

Tf, as the Claimants contend, “ownership” extended to scenario (b), then “control”
would only be relevant to scenario (c). Yet, as explained below, the ordinary meaning

of “control” encompasses both scenarios (b) and (c).

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants did not “own” the Juegos
Companies or E-Games at the relevant times for purposes of Article 1117. As they
never owned any shares in Operadora Pesa, they naturally did not “own” that company
either.

d. Did the Claimants “control” the Mexican Companies at the
relevant times?

To answer this question, the Tribunal must answer the following questions:
a. Does “control” mean legal capacity to control, de facto control, or both?

b. To have the legal capacity to control, must the Claimants be contractually bound

to vote as a block?

c. To have the legal capacity to control, what percentage of which class of shares in

the Mexican Companies must the Claimants have owned at the relevant times?

d. On the evidence before the Tribunal, did the Claimants thus “control” the Mexican
Companies at the relevant times?

(i) Does “control” mean legal capacity to control, de facto
control, or both?

The Respondent submits that “control” can only mean legal capacity to control.67 The
Claimants submit that “control” can mean both legal capacity to control and de facto

control.7°8

In the Tribunal’s view, the ordinary meaning of “control” favours the Claimants’

position.
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “control” to mean:

a: to exercise restraining or directing influence over

Reply, | 203.
Rejoinder, 47.

83

b: to have power over

c: to reduce the incidence or severity of especially to innocuous

levels”.2

212. Inthe context of Article 1117, any ability to “exercise restraining or directing influence
over” or to “have power over” a company would satisfy the ordinary meaning of

control. There is no specific manner or form that “control” must take.

213. The tribunal in Thunderbird determined that this indeed is the ordinary meaning of

control:

The Tribunal does not follow Mexico’s proposition that Article
1117 of the NAFTA requires a showing of legal control. The term
“control” is not defined in the NAFTA. Interpreted in accordance
with its ordinary meaning, control can be exercised in various
manners. Therefore, a showing of effective or “de facto” control
is, in the Tribunal’s view, sufficient for the purposes of Article
1117 of the NAFTA.”

214. The tribunal in that case further observed:

It is quite common in the international corporate world to control
a business activity without owning the majority voting rights in
shareholders meetings. Control can also be achieved by the power
to effectively decide and implement the key decisions of the
business activity of an enterprise and, under certain circumstances,
control can be achieved by the existence of one or more factors
such as technology, access to supplies, access to markets, access to
capital, know how, and authoritative reputation. Ownership and
legal control may assure that the owner or legally controlling party
has the ultimate right to determine key decisions. However, if in
practice a person exercises that position with an expectation to
receive an economic return for its efforts and eventually be held
responsible for improper decisions, one can conceive the existence
of a genuine link yielding the control of the enterprise to that

person.?7!

215. The parties have given less airtime to the Tribunal’s decision in Aguas del Tunari.
That may be so because that tribunal was called upon to interpret control in the context

of another investment treaty. The Tribunal finds the opinion by its preeminent

269 Merriam-Webster Dictionary, “Definition of control”, https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/control (last accessed 25 March 2019).

majority (consisting of the late Professor David Caron and Mr. Henri Alvarez QC) to

nonetheless provide a helpful disquisition on the subject.

216. The majority first observed that “the ordinary meaning of ‘control’ would seemingly

encompass both actual exercise of powers or direction and the rights arising from the

> 272

ownership of shares’ After an extensive analysis deploying the interpretation tools

available under the VCLT, the majority concluded that “control”, as used in the treaty

under examination in that case, did include the legal capacity to control:

the phrase ‘controlled directly or indirectly’ means that one entity
may be said to control another entity (either directly, that is without
an intermediary entity, or indirectly) if that entity possesses the
legal capacity to control the other entity. Subject to evidence of
particular restrictions on the exercise of voting rights, such legal
capacity is to be ascertained with reference to the percentage of
shares held.?”

217. Unlike the Respondent’s submissions in this case, the respondent in that case had
argued that “control” meant only de facto control—and not the legal capacity to

control. The majority rejected that proposition:

In the Tribunal’s view, the BIT does not require actual day-to-day
or ultimate control as part of the ‘controlled directly or indirectly’
requirement .... The Tribunal observes that it is not charged with
determining all forms which control might take. It is the Tribunal’s
conclusion, by majority, that, in the circumstances of this case,
where an entity has both majority shareholdings and ownership of
a majority of the voting rights, control as embodied in the operative
phrase ‘controlled directly or indirectly’ exists” (emphasis
added).?”4

218. While the majority only opined that a showing of de facto control was not required—
and thus left open the possibility of establishing control in that manner—it also
expressed apprehension about the definitional and evidentiary challenges of a de facto

control standard:

Respondent’s argument that ‘control’ can be satisfied by only a
certain level of actual control has not been defined by the
Respondent with sufficient particularity. Rather, the concept is
sufficiently vague as to be unmanageable. ... Once one admits of

85

the possibility of several controllers, then the definition of what
constitutes sufficient ‘actual’ control for any particular controller,
particularly when an entity may delegate such actual control,
becomes problematic. This becomes apparent with Respondent’s
difficulty in offering the Tribunal the details of its ‘actual’ control
test. ... Moreover, the many dimensions of actual control of a
corporate entity range from day to day operations up to strategic
decision-making. ... The difficulty in articulating a test in the
Tribunal’s view reflects not only the fact that the Respondent did
not provide such a test, but also the possibility that it is not
practicable to do so and that, as discussed in the next paragraph,
the resultant uncertainty would directly frustrate the object and
purpose of the BIT.””>
219. This evidentiary challenge of proving de facto control also appears to have been on

the mind of the Thunderbird tribunal:

In the absence of legal control however, the Tribunal is of the
opinion that de facto control must be established beyond any
reasonable doubt.?”°

220. The Tribunal is unclear as to whether the Thunderbird tribunal intended to set a
different standard of proof for de facto control and, if so, on what basis. What is clear,
however, is the dual consonance of the Thunderbird and Aguas del Tunari opinions.
To wit, both tribunals considered that: (i) there is nothing in the ordinary meaning of
control that precludes either prong of control—legal capacity or de facto; and (ii) de

facto control will typically, and logically, present a greater evidentiary challenge.

221. This reading of “control” is not affected by “any relevant rules of international law
applicable in the relations between the parties” within the meaning of Article 31(3)(c)

”’,?77 the definitions of “control” in

of the VCLT. As with the meaning of “ownership’
GATS Article XXVIII(n) and Mexico’s reservation to the OECD Declaration are not
“relevant rules” for purposes of interpreting Article 1117; and even if they were, the
Tribunal would take them into account by concluding that, had the NAFTA Parties
wished to apply those definitions to Article 1117, they would have done so in the
Treaty. The Tribunal therefore finds that “control” in Article 1117, in accordance with

its ordinary meaning, means both legal capacity to control and de facto control.

(ii) To have the legal capacity to control, must the Claimants be
contractually bound to vote as a block?

The Respondent submits that a binding agreement among shareholders is required to

establish that they collectively control the company.?”* The Claimants submit that no

such binding agreement is required among shareholders to establish that they

collectively control the company.?””

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. Where they can show that their collective
shareholding and voting rights confer upon them the legal capacity to control the
Mexican Companies by aligning their votes, there is no further requirement that they

are legally bound to do so.

If there were, multiple shareholders in an enterprise would never be able to pursue an
Article 1117 claim on behalf of the enterprise absent a binding agreement among them
requiring them to vote as a block. Nothing in the text or context of Article 1117

suggests that this was the intention of the drafters of the Treaty.
When the issue has arisen in other treaty arbitrations, it has proven uncontroversial.

a. In Micula, the two individual claimants each held 50% of shares in two of the
corporate claimants, and each held 46.72% of shares in the third corporate
claimant.?*° The tribunal held that it had jurisdiction over the corporate claimants
as they were “effectively controlled” by the two Swedish citizens collectively.”*!

There was no discussion of any binding instrument between the shareholders or

the need for it.

allegedly “collectively ‘ownf[ed] and control[led] 74%’. There was no

(iii) To have the legal capacity to control, which percentage of
which class of shares must the Claimants have owned at the
relevant times?

The Tribunal will address this question first for the Juegos Companies and then for E-

Games.

(a) The Juegos Companies

The Respondent submits that “in order to demonstrate ‘control’ of the Juegos
Companies, the Claimants would need to demonstrate that they held a majority of the
Series B shares at all relevant times”.”°°

The Tribunal agrees that a simple majority of the Series B shares suffices to confer the

legal capacity to control for the Juegos Companies:

a. The bylaws of the JVE Sureste, JVE Centro, JyV Mexico and JVE DF are broadly
similar. Generally, resolutions at a shareholders meeting can be adopted with a
simple majority of the Series B shares. A shareholder with more than 50% of the

Series B shares can also appoint three out of five members of the Board.7*” Only

(b) E-Games

From 7 June 2011 to 16 July 2013, the by-laws of E-Games required a 75% of the vote
of the shareholders to adopt any resolution.”°? After 16 July 2013, E-Games’s bylaws
require a 70% shareholding to adopt most resolutions, including the election of
members to the Board.”°? Only a closed list of 8 major decisions, including acquisition
of a debt over US$ 5 million, amendment of the bylaws, dissolution of the company

ora sale of substantially all its assets, require 85% of the votes.?**

The Claimants must therefore—both parties agree—own 75% or 70% of the shares

(as the case may be) in order to prove their legal capacity to control E-Games.””

(iv) On the evidence before the Tribunal, did the Claimants thus
“control” the Mexican Companies at the relevant times?
The Tribunal will answer the question first for the Juegos Companies, then for E-

Games.

(a) The Juegos Companies

Having found that the Claimants at all relevant times owned at least 50% of the Series
B shares in each of JVE Sureste, JVE Centro, JyV Mexico and JVE DF, the Tribunal
concludes that they had at all relevant times the legal capacity to control those
companies. Further, having found that the Claimants at all relevant times owned at
least 50% of each of the Series A and Series B shares, and at least 50% of the combined
Series B and C shares, of JVE Mexico, the Tribunal also concludes that they had at all
relevant times the legal capacity to control JVE Mexico. The Tribunal therefore
concludes, on that basis, that the Claimants at all relevant times “controlled” the

Juegos Companies for purposes of Article 1117.

The Tribunal also finds that the Claimants were unable to exercise de facto control

over the Juegos Companies (other than JVE Mexico) between, at least, September

2014 and July 2016, as a result of the August 2014 asambleas and their subsequent
dispute with Chow and Pelchat. The Claimants squarely conceded as much when on
21 July 2015 they advised ICSID that they “do not have board control of the Juegos

Companies”.”°°

The Tribunal, however, has already established that an investor can be said to
“control” an enterprise either if it has the legal capacity to control (and regardless of
whether it de facto exercises control) or if it exercises de facto control (and regardless
of whether it has the legal capacity to control). In this case, the Claimants at all times
retained the share ownership necessary to confer the legal capacity to control and,

shortly after the Request was filed, recovered their ability to exercise de facto control.

The Claimants’ temporary loss of de facto control does therefore not detract from the
Tribunal’s finding that the Claimants did, at all relevant times, “control” the Juegos

Companies for purposes of Article 1117.

(b) E-Games

It is uncontroversial that the Claimants never held 70% of the shares in E-Games.
They therefore did not have the legal capacity either to appoint all members of the

Board or to push through proposed shareholder resolutions.

They did, however, at all times have sufficient shares (more than 25% or 30%) to veto
any proposed shareholder resolutions. In addition, the quorum required for a valid
shareholder meeting being 85% of the capital stock on a first call and 70% of the
capital stock on second call or later calls, the Claimants had the ability to prevent a
quorum from ever being reached for any Board meeting.”*” That already gave them a

considerable degree of de facto control.

Further, the evidence on record establishes to the Tribunal’s satisfaction that the two
Original Claimants that are shareholders in E-Games—Oaxaca and John Conley—

exercised de facto control over E-Games.

The framework within which the Tribunal has assessed the evidence of de facto control
is the one set out by the Thunderbird tribunal, which the Tribunal considered
persuasive. The Thunderbird tribunal found that the “ability to exercise significant
influence on the decision-making” and being the “driving force” in the company
would be significant evidence of de facto control.?°° Beyond influence on decision-
making, the Thunderbird tribunal also took into account other factors such as (i) being
exposed to the economic consequences of decisions in the company?” and (ii) having
expertise and involvement in the capitalisation and operation of the business.*°° To
the Tribunal’s mind, these are examples of relevant factors, although by no means the

only ones.

The record shows that the Claimants wielded pervasive influence over the decision-

making in E-Games:

a. Board control. Prior to 16 July 2013, Jose Ramon Moreno testified that he and
his brother, Alfredo Moreno, as Directors on the Board of E-Games “always”
acted subject to the instructions of the Claimants, and the “reality” was that “in
no case” did he act without the knowledge of Gordon Burr.*°! Further, Claimant
Gordon Burr has been the President of the Board of E-Games since 16 July 2013

to the present,*”? and Claimant John Conley has been a director on the Board since

16 July 2013 to the present.* This latter point is accepted by the Respondent.*4

b. Shareholder voting control. The Claimants were able to always align the votes of

the non-Claimant shareholders:

i José Ram6n Moreno, who has been a shareholder in E-Games since 4 July

2011, testified that, while he “always had freedom” in making voting

prevented under an option agreement from voting 13.34% of his shares in a
manner inconsistent with Mr. Conley’s views without first providing

Conley with the right to purchase those shares at a prearranged price.*”

c. Control over incorporation. In 2006, Gordon Burr and Conley instructed José
Ramon Moreno and Alfredo Moreno to incorporate E-Games to hold casino
assets.*!° It was a decision taken by the Claimants “despite [the fact that Jose
Ramon Moreno and Alfredo Moreno] are listed in [the] paperwork.”?!! The
Claimants also provided a “significant majority” of the capital used to incorporate

the company.*!”

d. Control over direction and purpose of E-Games. The Claimants have continued
to hold decision-making power over the direction and purpose of E-Games after
incorporation. In 2008, Claimants Conley, Gordon Burr and Erin Burr decided to
“repurpose” E-Games as the permit holder for the casino business.*'>_ Gordon

Burr also testified that he had power to “replace[]” employees of E-Games.*!4

transfer all its net profits to each of the Juegos Companies, pursuant to the

Machine Lease Agreements*!® between E-Games and those companies.*!’ As a
result, the Claimants were exposed to the performance of E-Games through their

majority shareholding in the Juegos Companies.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal is satisfied, on the preponderance of the evidence,

that the Claimants de facto controlled E-Games at all relevant times.

(c) Operadora Pesa

The Claimants own no shares in Operadora Pesa. The Respondent submits that, even
if the Claimants did at all relevant times control Operadora Pesa (which it does not
concede), the Tribunal would still have no jurisdiction over an Article 1117 claim on

its behalf because the Claimants have made no investment in Operadora Pesa.*!®
The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent.

Article 1101 of the Treaty provides that it “applies to measures adopted or maintained
by a Party relating to ... (a) investors of another Party; [and] (b) investments of
investors of another Party in the territory of the Party ...” Article 1117 requires that
the enterprise be owned or controlled by an “investor”. Article 1139 in turn defines
“investor of a Party” as “... a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to

make, is making or has made an investment.”

Reading these provisions together, the Claimants must establish that they are
“investors” in Operadora Pesa for the Treaty to apply to measures allegedly adopted
against Operadora Pesa. For the Claimants to be “investors” in Operadora Pesa, they
must show that they seek to make, are making or have made an investment in that
company. It is undisputed that they have not. The mere fact that the Claimants may
control Operadora Pesa—a point the Tribunal need not decide—would still not make

Operadora Pesa an “investment of” the Claimants.

Article 1117 cannot be read as allowing the nationals of one NAFTA Party to pursue
Treaty claims on behalf of an enterprise of another NAFTA Party if they cannot show
to have an investment in that enterprise. If the Claimants were right, it might be
possible, for example, for a Mexican company to appoint a US national as its sole
director and for that director then to pursue claims under the Treaty on behalf of the
Mexican company against Mexico, claiming that she need not be an “investor” herself
to pursue such Treaty claim if she exercises de facto control. That proposition runs
counter not only to the terms of Chapter 11, but also to its fundamental object and

purpose, which is the protection of investments by investors of another NAFTA Party.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants’ claim under Article

1117 insofar as it pertains to Operadora Pesa.

2. Article 1121: have the Mexican Companies given consent in
accordance with Article 1121?

Article 1121(2) requires that the Mexican Companies have consented to Treaty

arbitration and waived the right to pursue domestic proceedings. As explained above,

Article 1121(3) required their consent to be conveyed in a certain manner.

The Respondent objects that: (i) the Juegos Companies did not consent, or at least did
not consent until 5 August 2016, when the relevant POAs were submitted by Quinn
Emanuel;*!” and (ii) there is insufficient proof of consent by E-Games where the
Respondent received on 24 October 2014 a letter purportedly sent on behalf of E-
Games stating that it was “desisting from” the Notice (referred to as the

desistimiento).°°

The Claimants submit that: (i) the Juegos Companies validly consented as the consents
were signed by a member of the Board, Pelchat, who had full authority to execute such
waivers;*! (ii) the submission of the Juegos Companies’ consents on 5 August 2016

did not change the date of the submission of the claim to arbitration—15 June 2016—

as it was a matter of admissibility that could be subsequently cured;*” and (iii) the

desistimiento had no effect on the validity of E-Games’s consent.*”?

The Tribunal will address the objection first as it pertains to the Juegos Companies;

then as it pertains to E-Games.

(a) The Juegos Companies

The chronology surrounding the submission of the POAs of the Juegos Companies is
undisputed. On 6 July 2016, the Centre wrote to the Claimants, requesting “copies of
the Mexican Companies’ written consent to arbitration” and “copies of the waivers
issued by the Mexican Companies”.*** The Claimants then admitted, in a reply letter
to the Centre on 21 July 2016, that “because Claimants do not have board control of
the Juegos Companies, they are not at moment in a position to provide the requested

affirmation.”32> As Claimants explained then, this was because Chow and Pelchat,

who had been elected to the Boards of the Juegos Companies on 29 August 2014,37°

still refused to step down at the time of the filing of the Request.*7”

Eventually, on 5 August 2016, the Claimants sent a letter to the Centre, attaching
POAs from the Juegos Companies signed by Pelchat, who was then a member of the
Board of the Juegos Companies, albeit one who had overstayed his welcome.
Nonetheless, Pelchat had the power to “submit [the company] to arbitration” pursuant

to POAs granted by the shareholders of each of the Juegos Companies when Pelchat

was elected to their Boards.*7

It is clear from the foregoing that, at the time the Request was filed with the Centre,
the Claimants did not have de facto control over the Juegos Companies and that this
was the reason why they were unable to procure POAs from the Juegos Companies at
that time. It is equally clear that when on 5 August 2016 the POAs were submitted,

the Claimants had recovered that de facto control.

The POAs for the Juegos Companies are not only prospective in nature. They also
ratify all steps taken previously by Quinn Emanuel on the Juegos Companies’ behalf
in connection with this arbitration, including the filing of the Request.*?? No
suggestion has been made, and certainly no evidence has been presented to establish,
that, as a matter of Mexican (or any other applicable) law, the Juegos Companies could
not so ratify all prior actions by their agent, including the acceptance of the
Respondent’s offer to arbitrate; or that such ratification could not produce its effects

ex tunc, as at the time of the ratified act.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Juegos Companies have consented to
arbitration as required by Article 1121(2) and that their consent was effective as of the

date the Request was filed.

While the POAs were submitted some 7 weeks after the Request was filed and were
therefore not “included in the submission of a claim to arbitration” as required by
Article 1121(3), the Tribunal has already observed that that requirement goes to

admissibility and that a defect in this regard can be cured—as indeed here it was.

(b) E-Games

The Respondent’s objection as regards consent by E-Games is not based on the
belatedness of the relevant POA.**° Rather, the Respondent alleged in its Memorial
that E-Games purportedly withdrew “as an enterprise on whose behalf a claim would
be brought under the [Notice]”, thus casting doubt on whether it ever consented.**!
The Respondent based this contention on a document, the desistimiento, signed by a
Mr. José Luis Cardenas Segura (Segura).**? The Respondent has not pressed the
point, never returning to it in any of its pleadings after its initial memorial, save for a
brief mention in the Reply in a different context—as evidence that the Claimants

refused to participate in negotiation discussions.**?

The Claimants contend in response that Segura manifestly did not have the authority
to sign the desistimiento; it was done unbeknownst to the Claimants; it was the result
of a fraud perpetrated against them; and those circumstances render the desistimiento
a document without any legal effect.*** The Claimants also argue that E-Games does
not have “standing as an investor under NAFTA to pursue claims on its own behalf”
and therefore has no “authority to withdraw or desist from claims advanced on its

behalf by the Claimants” under Article 1117.**

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the record relating to this matter. It finds that, on

the preponderance of the evidence, the following facts have been established.

a. Segura started working at E-Games in 2009 in his first job as a lawyer.>*° In May
2014, Segura was asked to leave E-Games after the closure of the casinos in April
2014.57 On 10 October 2014, after Mexico initiated investigations against the
Claimants for alleged illegal gambling activities (the PGR Investigation), Chow

met with Gutiérrez to discuss their legal strategy. Chow asked Gutiérrez to hire

In the case of E-Games, the relevant POA was submitted slightly late, on 21 July 2016. It is
uncontroversial however that this was the result of mere oversight. To the extent this was technically
inconsistent with the requirement of Article 1121(3), the Tribunal is satisfied that the resultant ground for
inadmissibility was properly cured.

Segura to assist with the defence against these investigations.*** Gutiérrez asked
Chow to confirm this discussion in writing.**? At this time, Segura apparently
continued to hold a valid power of attorney by E-Games that authorized him to
act on their behalf in respect of certain limited matters despite no longer working

for E-Games.*“°

b. On 12 October 2014, Chow sent an email to Gutiérrez, copying Gordon Burr,
confirming their discussion regarding the hiring of Segura.*! That same day or
the following day, Gutierrez spoke with Burr on the phone. Burr, as President of
the Board of E-Games, approved the hiring of Segura to assist with the PGR
Investigation. Gordon Burr did not give Segura any other authorisation or

instruction.”

c. Shortly after, in mid-October 2014, a lawyer by the name of Noriega, called
Segura and asked for his help in ongoing efforts to reopen the casinos.** Segura
had only had limited previous interactions with Noriega but knew Noriega as a

lawyer who “occasionally” provided advice to E-Games.**+

Noriega asked
Segura to work with Chow’s attorney, a man named Ramirez, in these efforts to
reopen the casinos.*> Noriega also told Segura that the Claimants were aware of

these efforts.*4°

d. Two or three days after the call, Noriega met with Segura. Present at the meeting
were Noriega, Ramirez, a man by the name of Santillan, and another person whose
name Segura could not recall.*47_ Santillan was allegedly a “former SEGOB
official ... who owns a company in the casino business in Mexico called
Producciones Méviles.”*#8 Producciones Méviles allegedly received a gaming

permit under virtually identical circumstances as E-Games: “first as an

independent operator under E-Mex’s permit, then as an independent permit holder

pursuant to a SEGOB resolution in late 2012.”

At the meeting, Noriega made representations that new shareholders might buy
out the US shareholders in the Juegos Companies in order to allow the casinos to
reopen, and asked for Segura’s help in this regard.**° He also represented that “all
those involved” knew of these efforts, which Segura assumed included the

Claimants.**!

Ramirez called Gutiérrez and put him on the phone with Segura,
and Gutiérrez and Segura briefly discussed the PGR Investigation, but not the
NAFTA claim. This phone call further led Segura to believe that the Claimants
knew of these apparent efforts to reopen the casinos since Gutiérrez was the
Claimants’ attorney.*°? The meeting ended with Noriega telling Segura that he
would have to sign some documents necessary for the reopening of the casinos at
the next meeting. Noriega showed him one such document, where E-Games
purported to accept SEGOB’s declaration of the invalidity of E-Games’

independent gaming permit (the allanamiento).***

On 24 October 2014, Noriega asked to meet Segura again to sign the documents.
Noriega did not tell Segura about the contents of the documents, only that they
were necessary for the reopening of the casinos.*°> When Segura arrived at the

meeting at Santillan’s offices, Alfredo Moreno, who used to be Segura’s “boss”

6

at E-Games, was in the waiting room.*>° However, they did not have a

conversation other than an exchange of greetings.**”

The secretary ushered
Segura into a meeting room, and asked Segura to sign several documents.*°* One
of them turned out later to be the allanamiento and the other turned out to be the

whether to acknowledge receipt or to ratify it. Segura, suspicious of the
pressure he was being subjected to sign the documents without review, testified
that he deliberately altered his normal signature in the event this issue came back
to haunt him.*® Segura further testified that Noriega did not contact him again

provide right now. If the client decides to pursue the claim, I will get in touch

with you.”>”

i. In April 2015, after regaining access to SEGOB’s files, Gutiérrez discovered
several unauthorized documents with Segura’s signature, including the

371

allanamiento and desistimiento. Neither Burr nor Gutiérrez knew of these

 

documents, so they approached Segura. Segura explained the facts surrounding
the signing of the documents, including the desistimiento, to Burr and
Gutiérrez.*”” Segura testified at the hearing that this was the first time he had

spoken to anyone from E-Games about the signing of the documents.*”7

j. On 13 July 2016, Gutiérrez met with Vejar (Director of Consulting and
Negotiations) from the Ministry of Economy. According to Gutierrez, Vejar told
him that the Ministry doubted the validity of the desistimiento, which is why they
did not respond to it nor did they issue an official resolution acknowledging its

receipt.*”*

 

This record suggests that the provenance of the desistimiento was dubious and that

Segura may have been used as a pawn in a scheme to which the Claimants were not

 

privy. Whether those circumstances would prevent the desistimiento from having
legal effect vis-a-vis the Respondent as a matter of Mexican law remains an open

question. No evidence of the relevant Mexican law on this point was proffered.

The Tribunal, however, need not resolve that question to dispose of the Respondent’s
objection. That objection fails on the terms of the desistimiento and the terms of the

Treaty—even if it is assumed that it did have legal effect under Mexican law:

a. First, E-Games is not a party to this proceeding. It could not withdraw a claim it
did not submit to arbitration. Only the Claimants could do so. Therefore, the

effect of the desistimiento could not be the withdrawal of the Article 1117 claim.

b. Second, the stated object of the desistimiento is not the withdrawal of the Article
1117 claim—the claim had not yet been submitted at the time of the desistimiento.
Rather, the desistimiento purports to inform the Respondent that E-Games is
“desisting” from the Notice—the notice of intent—issued on its behalf.

Accordingly, E-Games would, at most, have “‘desisted” from the Notice.

c. But third, E-Games could not even do that because it did not issue the Notice. At
most, in the desistimiento E-Games would have informed the Respondent that it
did not, in fact, intend to consent to the submission of an Article 1117 claim on

its behalf.

This is also how the Respondent appears to have deployed the desistimiento in this
proceeding: as evidence of E-Games’s refusal to consent to arbitration. But that
proposition cannot prosper. The Claimants have produced a POA for E-Games that
confirms its consent to this arbitration. Even if the effect of the earlier desistimiento
were that the Notice should be read to exclude E-Games from its scope (because E-
Games “desisted” from that Notice), that could not undo the subsequent confirmation
by E-Games of its consent under Article 1121(2) to the submission of the Article 1117

claim on its behalf.

Instead, put at its highest, the desistimiento would give rise to a defect under Article
1119: effectively the Notice would not have been sent on behalf of E-Games, even
though later a claim was submitted on its behalf. The Tribunal would dispose of that

defect as it did in respect of the Additional Claimants.

COSTS

On 1 October 2018 the parties submitted their statements of costs incurred in
connection with this phase of the proceeding. Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4, the
parties’ statements were divided into four categories: (a) attorney fees; (b) expert fees;
(c) share of each party’s advance requested by ICSID to cover the arbitration costs;>”>
and (d) any other arbitration-related disbursements incurred in connection with this
phase. The Claimants claim a total of US$ 8,453,600.11. The Respondent claims a
total of US$ 1,699,362.40.

The Tribunal defers its decision regarding category (c) above—arbitration costs
incurred in connection with this phase—to the final award in this proceeding. Below
the Tribunal proceeds to apportion categories (a), (b) and (d) above—legal costs

incurred in connection with this phase.

The Tribunal has wide discretion under the Additional Facility Rules to apportion legal
costs. Absent contrary agreement by the parties, the guiding principle should be that

costs follow the event.

At first blush, application of that principle in this case should favour the Claimants:
they did defeat the Respondent’s objections save insofar as Operadora Pesa is

concerned.

There are a number of reasons, however, why application of the principle in this case

does not warrant an award of all—or even the majority—of the Claimants’ legal costs.

First, the Tribunal observes that the Claimants’ legal costs are more than 580% of the
Respondent’s legal costs, even though the Respondent’s legal team displayed the same
level of professional competence, effectiveness, integrity and courtesy as the
Claimants’ legal team. Part of that discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the

Respondent’s legal team was hybrid in composition, including both in-house counsel

The arbitration costs include the (i) fees and expenses of the Tribunal, (ii) the Centre’s administrative
fees, and (iii) any other direct expenses of the proceeding. As of the date of the parties’ statements on
s .e. 1 October 2018), the two advance payments requested by the Centre to cover the arbitration
costs amounted to US$300,000 per party. The Centre requested a third advance payment of US$150,000
per party on 30 April 2019. The Centre received Claimants’ share of the third advance payment on 28
May 2019. The Respondent’s payment was received on 5 July 2019. The third advance payment
requested by the Centre is not reflected in the parties’ statements on costs.

from the Government and external lawyers from Mr. Mowatt’s firm. To fix a
benchmark for reasonable legal costs that can be awarded relating to this phase, the
Tribunal will therefore take the amount of legal costs incurred by the Respondent and

multiply it by two, to US$ 2,798,724.8.

Second, a number of factors militate against an award of 100% of that reasonable

amount of legal costs:

a. First, the Respondent was successful in its Article 1117 objection regarding

Operadora Pesa.

b. Second, the Tribunal recognises that the Respondent’s objections were not
frivolous. Issues 2 and 3 in particular raised questions of law that remain largely

unsettled.

c. Third, while they were ultimately largely victorious, the Claimants could have
avoided all debate for some of these objections and much of the debate for others,
if they had: served a fully compliant Notice; observed all applicable corporate
formalities at the Juegos Companies, such as holding annual asambleas as
required by law and the by laws of those companies;*”° and adduced from the
outset all of the requisite evidence to prove their control of the Mexican

Companies.

d. Fourth, the Tribunal places particular weight on the Claimants’ failure to file a
fully compliant Notice, not only because it would have avoided the Respondent’s
objection under Article 1119 but it could have significantly narrowed the issues
in dispute relating to the Respondent’s Article 1122 objection: had the Additional
Claimants been included in the Notice, the Claimants would not have been
required, as they were, to hedge their Article 1117 defence by trying a difficult
case that the Original Claimants had, in June 2016, de facto control over the

Juegos Companies.*””

Partial Dissenting Opinion
Arbitrator Raul E. Vinuesa

I partially dissent from the Majority on its interpretation of the NAFTA text which finds for
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the present case. It is my understanding that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over the claims submitted by the so-called Additional Claimants and lacks
jurisdiction over their claims on behalf of all the so-called Mexican Companies. I understand
the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims submitted by the Original Claimants and over
their claims submitted on behalf of the Mexican Companies JVE Mexico and E-Games.

It appears from the Parties’ submissions that the so-called “Original Claimants” are those
identified as Claimants in the Notice of Intent of 23 May 2014, and in the Request for
Arbitration, of 15 June 2016. The so-called “Additional Claimants” are those who, despite
not being identified in the Notice of Intent, were included in the Request for Arbitration. The
so-called Mexican Companies, on whose behalf both the Original and the Additional
Claimants claim include at the time of the Partial Award on Jurisdiction, the Juegos
Companies, E-Games and Operadora Pesa.

OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION REGARDING NAFTA ARTICLES 1119, 1121,
1122 (1) AND 1117

1. I disagree with the sequence proposed by the Majority of the Tribunal to deal with
what the Partial Award considers as the first two of the three preliminary issues on which the
Tribunal is to decide.!

2. I agree with dealing separately and lastly with Issue 3 regarding the objections related
to the interpretation and application of NAFTA Article 1117. Nevertheless, I understand that the
objections related to Articles 1119 and 1122(1) must be addressed before the objections raised with
reference to Article 1121, so as to avoid prejudging whether the Additional Claimants have legal

standing.

Additional Claimants; and b) Articles 1119 and 1122(1) by the Additional Claimants

LA.1. Scope of Article 1121 with respect to Articles 1119 and 1122(1)

3. The Majority addresses the questions defined as Issue 1, without addressing the
Respondent’s main objection that the disputing investors and companies had to comply with the

prerequisite of the Notice of Intent under NAFTA Article 1119.

4. The Majority states - at para. 41(a) of the Partial Award - that “Articles 1121(1) and
1121(2) of the Treaty require that the Claimants and the Mexican Companies, respectively, consent

to ‘arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in [the Treaty].’”” However, when the
Majority decided on whether Claimants had conveyed their consent under Article 1121(1), it failed
to consider whether such purported consent had been given or not, in accordance “with the

v2

procedures set out in the Treaty.

Ss. The Respondent contended that “...the Claimants failed to engage the consent of the
United Mexican States under NAFTA Article 1122 by their failures of compliance with Articl

 

1119 and 1121. There being no consent to arbitration by either disputing party, this Tribunal lacks

competence to decide this claim on its merits.”

6. The Majority fails to answer, thus ignores, the objection raised by the Respondent
regarding the lack of consent of all of the Claimants pursuant to Article 1121(1). The Majority
focuses on answering the Respondent's objection to the breach of the formal requirements set forth
by Article 1121(3) without distinguishing between the Original Claimants and the Additional

Claimants.

7. Concerning the objections to the breach of Article 1121(3) requirements, the
Majority holds that all of the Claimants observed those requirements, and, therefore, there was no

breach of Article 1121.

8. In this way, the Majority assumes that all of the Claimants, in their Request for
Arbitration, had conveyed the consent required by Article 1121(1)4 without even assessing whether

that consent had been given “in accordance with the procedures set out in the Treaty.”

9. In conclusion, without previously dealing with the Respondent’s objection on
whether the breach of Article 1119 affected the Additional Claimants’ consent, the Majority seems
to prejudge and accept as valid, without further ado, consent by all of the Claimants mentioned in

the Request for Arbitration—both Original and Additional Claimants.

10. It is established that the Majority should have focused, first, on determining the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections relating to Articles 1119 and 1122(1), in order to later
determine whether all, some, or none of the Claimant Parties mentioned in the Request for
Arbitration had standing to consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in
NAFTA.

11. Concerning the objection as to whether the Claimants had conveyed their consent in
the manner prescribed by Article 1121(3),> I agree with the Majority’s considerations expounded at
paragraphs 54 to 60 of the Partial Award, but only with respect to the Original Claimants.

12. As stated below, the Additional Claimants had no standing to convey their consent
under Article 1121(1) because they had breached Article 1119. Accordingly, the Respondent’s
consent was not triggered, with respect to the Additional Claimants, in accordance with the
provisions set out in Article 1122(1).

13. In conclusion, the Original Claimants having been the only ones who had consented
to submit a claim to arbitration under Article 1121, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims
submitted by the Original Claimants, but lacks jurisdiction to hear the claims submitted by the
Additional Claimants. The reasons why the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Additional

Claimants are explained in detail below.

TA.2. Scope of Article 1119: the notice of intent and its relation to Article 1122(1) on the
consent by the Respondent Party

14. | The Respondent contends the Additional Claimants’ failure to comply with their
obligation to notify their intent to submit a claim to arbitration precludes the Tribunal from
exercising its jurisdiction. Such non-compliance also affects the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because
consent by the respondent Contracting Party is, under Article 1122(1), tethered to compliance with
the procedures set out in the Treaty. The Respondent, thus, maintains that the claims submitted by

the Additional Claimants should be dismissed since the inexistence of a Notice of Intent identifying

5 Id., 9 54-60.

those Additional Claimants vitiates their consent. The Respondent considers its objection is focused
on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Although it disputes that it is a matter of admissibility, the Respondent
argues that the claims should be dismissed even if they were considered a matter of admissibility.°
15. In turn, the Claimants allege that the Notice of Intent was actually submitted on
behalf of the Additional Claimants as well and that the issue raised is simply a matter of
admissibility. They contend that the claims should be admitted because the Notice defect does not

prejudice the Respondent and does not change the course of any settlement effort.’

16. Therefore, the matter the Tribunal is to adjudicate relates to the definition and scope
of “Jurisdiction” and “Admissibility.”

17. On this particular matter, I agree with the Majority on the basic meaning of
“jurisdiction” and “admissibility” as expressed in the first part of paragraph 73 of the Partial Award.

18. Conceptually, “Jurisdiction” refers to the tribunal’s power to hear and adjudicate a
claim, whereas “admissibility” refers to whether it is appropriate or not for the tribunal to hear that
claim.

19. The arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction is founded on the parties’ consensus. If the
respondent State imposed conditions on its consent to arbitration, those conditions must be satisfied.
Otherwise, there is no consent, and consequently, no jurisdiction . Should the tribunal determine
that it lacks jurisdiction, the tribunal will not be able to decide on the admissibility of a claim over
which it lacks jurisdiction.

20. Only if the tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction may the tribunal hear a

 

prospective admissibility claim by applying the rules needed to conduct the proceedings with equity

and efficiency.

21. I partially agree with what has been stated by the Majority at paragraph 72 of the
Partial Award, making clear that, when the Majority asserts in fine that “[i]f the Tribunal has
jurisdiction and declares the claims in question admissible, there is no other basis to dismiss the
claims at this stage,” it should have also asserted that, should the Tribunal lack jurisdiction, the

Tribunal will not be able to adjudicate matters concerning the admissibility of the claims.

? Counter-Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections, 8 January 2018, $f] 280, 282, 283 and 284.

22. Likewise, the Majority avers that “[it] will first examine whether the defect in the
Notice precludes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Additional Claimants. Should it find that it
does not, it will then examine whether the claims should nonetheless be dismissed as inadmissible;”*
it should have also asserted that, should the Tribunal find it lacks jurisdiction, it will not be able to

examine the admissibility of the claims in any way whatsoever.

23. The Tribunal must decide on the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection as a matter of
consent. The dispute between the parties refers to whether the consent conveyed by the Respondent

under Article 1122(1) was tethered to compliance with Article 1119.

24. I fully agree with the Majority on the fact that the matter thus raised must be solved
through interpretation of NAFTA Articles 1119 and 1122 in accordance with the interpretation
principles codified in Article 31 et seq. of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (hereinafter
“VCLT”). Nevertheless, I dissent from the Majority’s conclusion that Article 1119 does not
condition the Respondent’s consent to arbitration in Article 1122(1) and that the Additional
Claimants’ failure to issue a notice of intent therefore does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction

over them.’ The reasons for this dissent are set forth in the following Sections.
.A.2.a. The content and scope of the Notice of Intent of 23 May 2014

25. It is an undisputed fact that the Notice of Intent of 23 May 2014 states that “[t]his

710 4

Notice is submitted by the U.S. Investors”!° and subsequently identifies only eight investors.!!

26. These eight investors are those identified in these proceedings as the Original
Claimants. Nowhere in the text of the Notice is there any reference to any other investor(s) that may

potentially be considered as disputing investors.

27. The “U.S. Investors’” reservation at paragraph 18 of the Notice is exclusively
restricted to the right to amend it for purposes of including additional claims as may be warranted
and permitted by NAFTA. Evidently, the reservation’s text does not permit extension to potential

investors not identified in the aforementioned Notice.

Enterprises”) the U.S. Investors own and/or have invested in gaming facilities.... In addition, the U.S.
Investors... are assisted through their ownership interest in Mexican company Exciting Games...”

 

28. The Majority understands that the lack of identification of other disputing investors
in the Notice of Intent is the “only defect’”!? or an “omission”.!? I disagree with this assertion since
this lack of identification implies the non-existence of (an)other disputing investor(s) and,
consequently, results in non-compliance with a prerequisite mandatory to trigger arbitration under
NAFTA.

29. The Majority holds that it “remains unclear” what led to the omission of the
Additional Claimants in the Notice’s text.'4 The Majority makes reference to the fact that the
Claimants’ evidence at the Hearing was that they had relied on the advice of their specialized
arbitration counsel. The Majority also mentions that there was a suggestion that the omission was

insignificant because the Original Claimants were the controlling shareholders.

30. None of these allegations create any degree of credibility. The law firm that advised
the Original Claimants at the time of submitting their Notice—having extensive experience in the
subject—cannot be presumed, without any evidence, to be the creator of a potential professional
negligence. Furthermore, if failure to identify the Additional Claimants were insignificant, there
would be no reasonable legal basis for attempting to include them after completion of the term set

for the Notice.

31. I share the Majority’s opinion that what the Tribunal must determine is whether the
aforementioned “omission” leads to the consequences alleged by the Respondent. However, I
dissent from the Majority when it holds that “it is irrelevant why the information was omitted.”!> It
is apparent that the reasons why the Additional Claimants are absent from the Notice are relevant
not only to determine good faith in their actions, but also to evidence the grounds that would enable
the Tribunal to eventually hear potential admissibility claims.

32. The first question the Tribunal must consider is whether the Notice of Intent
constituted an obligation necessary to determine its jurisdiction.

LA.2.b. Interpretation of Article 1119 under International Law

33. | The General Rule of Interpretation contained in Article 31.1 of the VCLT provides

that: “A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given

"2 Partial Award, 467.
3 Id.,4 68

“Ia.

'S Id, 469.

to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”

34. Any good faith interpretation of a treaty rule starts with the analysis of the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms thereof. Against this background, it is relevant to interpret the
ordinary meaning given to the term “shall deliver [...] [a] notice” and to its Spanish equivalent
“notificard.”

35. The ordinary meaning of “shall deliver [...] [a] notice” (“notificard” in Spanish)

expre:

 

s a “requirement” or “mandate” that has a clearly defined meaning in the context of Article
1119. Therefore, the term “shall deliver [...] [a] notice” (“notificard” in Spanish) expresses the

imposition of an enforceable obligation.

36. NAFTA Article 1119 requires the existence of a “disputing investor,” who “shall
deliver to the disputing Party written notice of its intention to submit a claim to arbitration at least
90 days before the claim is submitted ...” In this way, it imposes on the disputing investor the
obligation to notify its intention to submit its claim to arbitration requiring that any such notice be
written and at least 90 days before the claim is submitted.

37. The notice of intent shall specify: “a) the name and address of the disputing investor
and, where a claim is made under Article 1117, the name and address of the enterprise; b) the
provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions; c)
the issues and the factual basis for the claim; and d) the relief sought and the approximate amount

of damages claimed.”

38. It arises from the NAFTA text itself that the notice of intent to submit a claim to
arbitration is an enforceable requirement. This condition stems from the ordinary meaning of the
term “shall deliver [...] [a] notice” (“notificara” in Spanish) used by the Contracting Parties. The
term “shall deliver [...] [a] notice” undoubtedly conveys the existence of an obligation that must be
complied with by anyone who wishes to be considered a “disputing investor.” That very same
“disputing investor” will be the one who is able to submit a claim to arbitration under Article 1121.

39. Furthermore, if a disputing investor has delivered to the disputing party a written
notice of intent, but the information that should have been included therein is deficient or contains
excusable errors, the tribunal may, in light of the case-specific circumstances, analyze the
admissibility of that notice once the deficiencies or excusable errors have been cured.

40. In order for this Tribunal to exercise its discretion for the purpose of curing

deficiencies in the information contained in the notice of intent, it must have first inexorably

determined that it had jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction depends on the requirements imposed by the

Contracting Parties in the NAFTA.

41. Case law is categorical in the sense that the term “shall” denotes an obligation or
mandate that must be inexorably complied with. In Article 1119, that obligation implies the

identification of all the claimants and their respective claims.

42. In Philip Morris, the tribunal, concerning the exhaustion of local remedies as a step
prior to arbitration, held as follows: “The sequence of steps to be followed by the Claimants under

Articles 10(1) and (2) before resorting to international arbitration is of importance for the purpose

 

of this analysis. Each such step is clearly indicated as part of a binding sequence, as evidenced by
the word “shall” before each step as follows...”!° It added that “[t]he ordinary meaning of the terms
used for the two steps (i) and (ii), which are preliminary to the institution of international arbitration,
is clearly indicative of the binding character of each step in the sequence. That is apparent from the
use of the term “shall” which is unmistakably mandatory and from the obvious intention of

Switzerland and Uruguay that these procedures be complied with, not ignored.”!”

43. The International Court of Justice (hereinafter “ICJ”) as well as the Permanent Court
of International Justice (hereinafter “PCIJ”) have specified the legal nature of the procedural
conditions and prerequisites imposed on the parties in order to exercise their jurisdiction based on
what was agreed upon in the international instruments enabling their jurisdiction. The ICJ asserted
that, “[t]o the extent that the procedural requirements of [a dispute resolution clause] may be
conditions, they must be conditions precedent to the seisin of the Court even when the term is not

qualified by a temporal element.”!®

44. | Furthermore, the ICJ clearly determined that the limits to its jurisdiction were

 

conditioned by the Contracting Parties’ consent. In this sense, it asserted the following: “...The
jurisdiction [of the Court] is based on the consent of the parties and is confined to the extent accepted
by them... When that consent is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international agreement,

any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon.

2011, § 130.

The Court accordingly considers that the examination of such conditions relates to its jurisdiction

and not to the admissibility of the application ...”!°

45. The Majority, ignoring the ordinary meaning of the term “shall deliver [...] [a]
notice” of Article 1119, is of the opinion that such Article “... is entirely silent on the consequences

of a failure to include all the required information in the notice of intent. Article 1119 does not in

 

terms refer to Article 1122(1); does not provide that satisfaction of the requirements of Article 1119

is a condition precedent to a NAFTA Party’s consent; and does not state that failure to satisfy those

20

requirements will vitiate a NAFTA Party’s consent.

46. The Majority holds, in turn, that “[t[he text of Article 1119 alone therefore does not
compel the conclusion that a failure to include all the required information in the notice of intent

vitiates a NAFTA Party’s consent under Article 1122(1).”?! I disagree with all those assertions.

47. On this particular issue, the scope and consequences of the obligations imposed by
Article 1119 and by Article 1122(1) must be complemented (as subsequently stated) in good faith,

in their context, and in the light of their object and purpose.

48. also disagree with the Majority’s purported inferences whereby Article 1122(1) also
does not in terms refer back to either Article 1119 or to the Notice of Intent.2? Once again, I restate
my understanding of the necessary interpretation of the text of both articles “in their context and in

the light of [their] object and purpose.”

49. Conversely, the question, as raised by the Respondent is not the failure to “include
all the required information,” but the breach of the treaty obligation by the Additional Claimants to
submit a Notice of Intent identifying them as disputing investors.” Actually, the question is not a
simple omission of certain Claimants’ names in a certain notice submission, but, more precisely, the
lack of compliance with a requirement to which any potential investor is bound, within a peremptory

term.

LA.2.c. Interpretation of Article 1122(1) under International Law

50. I disagree with the Majority on its purported interpretation of the expression “in
accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement” contained in Article 1122(1).

51. Such expression makes reference to each Party “consent[ing] to the submission of a
claim to arbitration” and imposes that condition thereon. A good-faith reading of such text “in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty” does not allow us to
depart from that expression in order to suggest that the duty to act in accordance with the procedures
set out in this Agreement only refers to either “submitting a claim” or “arbitration.” Through a
simple reading, the expression “consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration” may only be
interpreted as a consistent and compact, i.e., clearly monolithic, expression. Consequently, I believe
that all of the assertions by the Majority on whether the expression “in accordance with the
procedures set out in this Agreement” only modifies the term “arbitration” are nothing but

groundless speculations.

52. The Majority’s interpretation concerning the scope of Article 1122(1) text terms is
still speculative, despite presuming that such interpretation was accepted by both parties to the
dispute. As stated below, the conclusion reached by the Majority at paragraph 90 of the Partial
Award is unsupported by case law and unanimously rejected by the NAFTA Contracting Parties.

53. Therefore, I differ on how the Majority prejudges whether “‘the procedures’ with
which the ‘arbitration’ must accord include the requirements of Article 1119.74 Of course, I differ
on the direct consequence of such prejudgment: when stating that “[t]he natural and ordinary

meaning of ‘arbitration’ is therefore the procedures commenced by, and to be followed upon, the

 

submission of a claim,” the Majority fails to stick to the literal text it purports to interpret, which

undoubtedly refers not only to “arbitration,” but also to “consents to the submission of a claim to

arbitration.”

54. Clearly, the submission of a notice of intent neither commences an arbitration nor
compels a disputing investor to commence an arbitration. The direct consequence of fulfilling the
duty imposed in Article 1119 is to trigger recourse to an arbitral tribunal. In this regard, within the

framework of the procedural steps defined in Chapter XI of the NAFTA, the Notice of Intent is a

24 Partial Award, title (A)(2)V. c.(ii)(b).
25 1d., 497.

jurisdictional prerequisite that triggers recourse to arbitration, should the disputing investor so

decide and once all jurisdictional requirements have been met.

55. | When stating that nothing in those provisions can condition the “validity” of the
submission of a claim to arbitration on satisfaction of Article 1119,?6 it thus fails to acknowledge
that the text of that Article does not claim to be merely declarative, let alone that its content is non-
binding for the Parties. Once again, the Majority avoids making reference to the effet uttile to be
attributed to any rule subject to an interpretation process in accordance with the rules of international

law.

56. The Majority contends that the procedures mentioned in Article 1122(1) “most
naturally”?’ refer to the procedures for the conduct of the arbitration set out in Articles 1223-1336.
The expression “most naturally” seems to be the only reason stated by the Majority to assert that
“(t]he NAFTA Parties did not consent in Article 1122 to just any generic arbitral process; they

agreed to the specific arbitral process as organised and regulated by Articles 1123-1136.”28

57. The fact that Articles 1123-1236 follow Article 1122 is not a serious ground to
support its assertion.” Nor is the Majority assisted by the fact that the Contracting Parties have
made no reference in the text of Article 1122(1) to an alleged and exclusive relationship with the

“procedures” set forth in Articles 1223-1236.

58. I disagree with the Majority on the purported scope of the terms used in Articles
1116-1121 so as to conclude that the drafters of the Treaty intentionally deprived the agreement set
out in Article 1119 of legal consequences. The Majority’s catchphrase that “[t]hat choice [of the
terms used] by the Treaty’s drafters cannot be ignored”? contradicts the context in which the terms
of a treaty are to be interpreted.

59. In turn, paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 1121 provide that a disputing investor may
submit a claim under Article 1116 or 1117 to arbitration only if the investor consents to arbitration
in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement. The temporal sequence of the steps

that the disputing investor must take pursuant to Articles 1116-1121 forms the context within which

the terms of Article 1119 are to be construed.

60. It is thus surprising that it strikes the Majority as “more natural” to read the consent
requirement in Article 1121(1) as being prospective “in nature,” pertaining to a process that lies

ahead!

61. Even though one of the objectives of Article 1119 is to allow the parties to settle a
claim through consultation or negotiation, it is neither the only nor the primary one. The Notice of
Intent also enables the Respondent to understand the complexity of the alleged dispute as well as to
organize its defense within a reasonable time period. The NAFTA Contracting Parties have

recognized and assured the different purposes contained in Article 1119.5?

62. — This has been confirmed by case law. In this sense, the failure to comply with the
requirements and formalities under Articles 1118-1121 has been deemed hardly compatible with
the requirements of good faith under international law and might even have an adverse effect on the

right of the Respondent to a proper defense.*?

63. The Majority states that, for the Respondent, “a claimant who fails to include certain
information in a notice of intent”*4 (emphasis added) would forfeit the right to Treaty arbitration.
Yet a claimant who has delivered a Notice but fails altogether to pursue a settlement effort would
retain that right undiminished. The Majority concludes that, if failing to pursue settlement
discussions does not bar access to arbitration, then at least bald logic suggests that neither should a

failure to comply with a step designed to facilitate such settlement discussions.**

64. The Majority’s narrative ignores the fact that the Notice is not intended to facilitate

settlement discussions only. Moreover, when the Majority refers to “a claimant who fails to include

certain information in a notice,”*° the Majority cannot, by bald logic, be referring to a claimant
“unidentified in the Notice” (as it occurs with the Additional Claimants in this case.) In this regard,

according to the Majority’s narrative, “a claimant who fails to include certain information” would

necessarily be the one who submitted the Notice and would necessarily be identified. The claimant
who submitted a Notice may not cure the breaches and negligence attributable to the unidentified
investor. It is just as simple, and as complex, as that.

65. | NAFTA’s objective regarding the creation of effective procedures for the resolution
of disputes (Article 102) is supplemented by Article 1115, which proclaims that establishing “a
mechanism” for the settlement of investment disputes is the Purpose of Section B.

66. Such mechanism is defined by each article of that Section of the NAFTA. Therefore,
“the procedures set out in this Agreement” under Articles 1121 and 1122 are necessarily included
in the “mechanism” established for Section B on the Settlement of Disputes between a Party and an

Investor of Another Party in its entirety.

67. Consequently, one cannot ignore the fact that Article 1119 is an integral part of the
mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes which, pursuant to Article 1115, assures “both
equal treatment among investors of the Parties in accordance with the principle of international
reciprocity and due process before an impartial tribunal.” (Emphasis added).

68. Every legal proceeding assumes the existence of rules that condition the parties’
behavior on a series of enforceable obligations. There is no legal proceeding absent a mandatory set
of applicable rules. The general rule under Article 31.1 of the VCLT requires that the terms of a

treaty be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning.

69. The Notice of Intent under Article 1119 is a duty that conditions not only the
possibility that a disputing investor consents to submit a claim to arbitration, but also the other
disputing Party’s consent to submit a claim to arbitration. The context in which the duty to deliver
a Notice under Article 1119 is stated, relates to the prerequisites agreed-upon by the Contracting
Parties in order to consent to submit a claim to arbitration. Such literal reading obviously takes into
account its object and purpose, which is no other than to assure “due process before an impartial
tribunal.”

70. — Article 1115 then assures due process within the mechanism for the settlement of
disputes established in Section B on the “Settlement of Disputes between a Party and an Investor of
Another Party.”

71. It strikes the Majority as a difficult proposition that the objectives of Article 1115

could be furthered by barring access to arbitration on the basis that the names of certain investors

were omitted from the notice of intent.*”

72. The instant case is not merely about “omitted names.” It is about the failure to satisfy
a treaty prerequisite to be met by any disputing investor who may intend, at a given opportunity,
accept the Respondent’s consent to arbitration.

73. The legality of the due process inexorably entails the existence of a regulatory
framework comprising both rights and obligations. The primary objective of Article 1115 may not
be distorted so as to justify a failure to observe the basic rules of the legality of due process.

74. Therefore, the Respondent’s consent pursuant to Article 1122(1) is contingent on the
satisfaction of the prerequisite under Article 1119 concerning the necessary identification of any
potential claimant as a “disputing investor” in the Notice of Intent.

75. Insum, on the basis of an interpretation in accordance with the ordinary meaning of
the text of Articles 1119 and 1122(1), in their context and in the light of the NAFTA’s object and
purpose, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Additional Claimants or their claims. Only the
disputing investors identified in this case, such as the Original Claimants, may submit their claims
to arbitration under Chapter XI of the NAFTA.

76. As explained below, the foregoing conclusions are supported by NAFTA arbitration
case law, as well as the positions adopted by all the NAFTA Contracting Parties in the exercise of

their rights established in Article 1128.

LA.3. Relevance of other tribunals’ decisions

77. Lagree with the criterion whereby every tribunal is the judge of its own competence.
Every tribunal must determine its jurisdiction regardless of other tribunals’ decisions. This Tribunal
is not bound to decide in accordance with other tribunals’ decisions. Every award or judgment
creates law for the parties only. However, the iteration of certain interpretation rules on a given text
under analysis may help another tribunal understand the meaning of the rule to be applied thereby.**
In connection with the issues raised in this case, NAFTA arbitral decisions evidence a clear trend

towards requiring that the disputing investor be identified as such in a notice of intent.

78. Apart from NAFTA decisions, the case law of other tribunals cited by the Majority

% Tribunals are not bound by previous decisions of NAFTA or other international tribunals (See Chemtura,

is absolutely irrelevant in that it concerns rules and facts different from those to be taken into
consideration by this Tribunal.

79. By way of example, the tribunal’s findings in Philip Morris do not apply to the case
at hand. The tribunal held that “[t]he domestic litigation requirement had not been satisfied at the
time this arbitration was instituted...Nonetheless, even if the requirement were regarded as
jurisdictional, the Tribunal concludes that it could be, and was, satisfied by actions occurring after

the date the arbitration was instituted...”

80. Clearly, in the instant case, the requirement whereby a disputing investor must notify
the respondent Party at least 90 days prior to the formal submission of the claim may not be satisfied
“by actions occurring after the date the arbitration was instituted.” The duty to deliver the notice of
intent to submit the claim to arbitration is a requirement that must be inexorably satisfied prior to
submitting the claim and, thus, may not be “satisfied by actions occurring after the date the

arbitration was instituted.”

81. | Moreover, the tribunal in Philip Morris errs in contending that “[iJn the Mavrommatis
case the Permanent Court of International Justice had found that jurisdictional requirements which

were not satisfied at the time of instituting legal proceedings could be met subsequently...”

82. Contrary to the determinations by the Philip Morris tribunal, the PCIJ maintained
that it had jurisdiction based on Article 26 of the Mandate for Palestine. At no time did the Court
describe as a jurisdictional requirement, the ratification of Protocol XII at the time when Greece

submitted its claim,.4!

83. In turn, the NAFTA decisions which mention the rules to be applied by this Tribunal
become relevant when it comes to understand the meaning and scope according to which those very

rules have been interpreted and applied before.

84. In this context, in Methanex, the tribunal ruled that, in order to establish consent to

embraces all disputes referred to it after its establishment. In the present case, this interpretation appears to be

arbitration, it is sufficient to show that Chapter XI applies in the first place, that a claim has been
brought by an investor in accordance with Articles 1116 and 1117, and that all pre-conditions and

formalities required under Articles 1118 -1121 are satisfied.*?

85. In Canfor, the tribunal asserted that arbitral tribunals hearing objections to
jurisdiction under Chapter XI shall ensure that all conditions and formalities under Articles 1118-

1121 have been satisfied.

86. In Merrill & Ring, the tribunal, in accordance with Methanex and as opposed to
Ethyl and Mondev,* held that consent to NAFTA arbitration requires that the Claimant not only
meet the requirements laid down in Articles 1101, 1116 and 1117, but also satisfy all of the

prerequisites and formalities under Articles 1118-1121.4¢

87. In Cargill, the tribunal ruled that a claimant must also provide preliminary notice

pursuant to Article 1119 and satisfy the conditions precedent via consent.*”

88. In Bilcon, the tribunal found that the protection given to investors must be interpreted

and applied in a manner that respects the limits that the Contracting Parties put in place as integral

* “Tn order to establish the necessary consent to arbitration, it is sufficient to show (i) that Chapter 11 applies
in the first place, i.e. that the requirements of Article 1101 are met, and (ii) that a claim has been brought by a
claimant investor in accordance with Articles 1116 or 1117 (and all pre-conditions and formalities required
under Articles 1118-1121 are satisfied). Where these requirements are met by a claimant, Article 1122 is
satisfied; and NAFTA Party’s consent to arbitration is established.” Methanex Corporation v. United States of
America; Partial Award, 7 August 2002, 120.

that determination, the tribunal is required to interpret and apply the jurisdictional provisions, including

aspects of their consent.*®

89. As opposed to the foregoing case law, the Majority finds support in the decisions
adopted in Chemtura and ADF. Still, neither of these decisions makes reference to the failure to
identify a claimant in the notice of intent. Thus, they exert no impact on the trend set by NAFTA

arbitration tribunals.

90. The tribunal in ADF, under the special circumstances of the case, proceeds to
interpret the text of Article 1119 (b) within the narrow framework of its own discretion in order to
make the information requirements for the notice of intent more flexible. The tribunal starts out
from the sine qua non condition that the notice of intent identify the disputing investor.*? Therefore,

the identification of the investor in the notice of intent is undisputed.

91. The tribunal in Chemtura only refers to the “form and content of a notice of intent,”
thus starts out from the basic assumption that a notice of intent has been submitted by a clearly
identified disputing investor. Under each case-specific circumstance a tribunal may deem the
conditions met by the disputing investor in the notice of intent as admissible if satisfied following
submission of such notice. The tribunal in Chemtura, when citing the ADF award, reaffirmed the

need for a notice of intent to exist as an implied condition to cure any defects in the content or form

“8 “In international arbitration, it is for the applicant to establish that a Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and
decide a matter. A Chapter Eleven tribunal only has authority to the extent that is provided by Chapter Eleven
itself [... ] The heightened protection given to investors from other NAFTA Parties under Chapter Eleven of
the Agreement must be interpreted and applied in a manner that respects the limits that NAFTA Parties put in
place as integral aspects of their consent, in Chapter Eleven, to an overall enhancement of their exposure to
remedial actions by investors. The Parties to NAFTA chose to go as far, but only as far, as they stipulate in
Chapter Eleven towards enhancing the international legal rights of investors;” William Ralph Clayton, William
Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v. Canada, UNCITRAL,
Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 17 March 2015, 4228-229.

* ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/1, 135: “Turning back to
Article 1119(b), we observe that the notice of intention to submit to arbitration should specify not only ‘the
provisions of [NAFTA] alleged to have been breached’ but also ‘any other relevant procedures [of NAFTA].’
Which provisions of NAFTA may be regarded as also ‘relevant’ would depend on, among other things, what
arguments are subsequently developed to sustain the legal claims made. We find it difficult to conclude that
failure on the part of the investor to set out an exhaustive list of ‘other relevant provisions’ in its Notice of
Intention to Submit a Claim to Arbitration must result in the loss of jurisdiction to consider and relay upon any
unlisted but pertinent NAFTA provision in the process of resolving the dispute,” ADF Group Inc. v. United
States of America, Case No. ARB(AF)00/1, Award, 9 January 2003, § 134; “It is also instructive to note that
the notice to be given by claimant “wishing to institute arbitration proceedings” under ICSID Arbitration
(Additional Facility) Rules is required merely to “contain information concerning the issue in dispute and an
indication of the amount involved, if any.” (Article 3[1] [d], ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility Rules) The
generality and flexibility of this requirement do not suggest that failure to be absolutely precise and complete
in setting out that “information” must necessarily result in diminution of jurisdiction on the part of the
Tribunal...”

thereof.*°

92. In conclusion, there must be a notice of intent evidencing the very existence of a
claimant investor. This is an essential requirement so as to identify not only the claimant, but also
the alleged dispute itself. The mere existence of a timely notice presumes jurisdiction of a NAFTA
tribunal. Only errors or defects in the information contained in a notice may be cured following
submission thereof. This is the substance of decisions allowing defects or errors in a notice of intent
to be cured. Both Chemtura and ADF tribunals decide on the admissibility of defects or errors in
the notice of intent delivered by a claimant investor. In no way do they purport to allow defects in
the content of a nonexistent notice to be cured with regard to an investor it has failed to identify.

The existence of a notice of intent by the investor is vital for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction.

93. Throughout this proceeding, no case in which access to arbitration was given to an
investor who had not been identified in a notice of intent has been cited. The cases cited by the
Majority so as to prove the absence of a jurisprudence constante (ADF and Chemtura) actually
confirm that, in both cases, all claimants had submitted their respective notices of intent. For
jurisdiction to exist, every claimant must be identified by means of a notice of intent. Under the
specific circumstances of each case, involuntary errors or remediable defects in the Notice are
subject to the discretion of the Tribunal, in the equitable and efficient conduct of the proceeding,

provided that the conditions necessary to establish the Respondent’s consent have been satisfied.>!

94. In view of the categorical assertion in NAFTA decisions on the scope and binding
effects of Article 1119, the Majority may not dispute the relevance of such acknowledgment, in
order to justify its violation by the Additional Claimants.*? In the same vein, the failure to follow
the procedures set out in Article 1122(1) do not evince the Respondent’s consent with regard to

those Claimants.

1.A.4. Scope of the NAFTA Parties’ interpretations under Article 1128

95. Pursuant to Article 1128, NAFTA Contracting Parties may make submissions to a

tribunal on a question of interpretation of that Treaty. It is apparent that, contrary to the

5 Chemtura Corporation v. Government of Canada, Ad Hoc NAFTA Anbitration under UNCITRAL Rules,
Award, 2 August 2010, 4 102.

51 Reply on Jurisdictional Objections, 1 December 2017, § 107.

interpretations by the Free Trade Commission, the Contracting Parties’ interpretations contained in
the submissions made to a tribunal are not mandatory therefor. Neither does it arise from Article
1128 that those interpretations are of a recommendatory nature. Nevertheless, those interpretations
will help a tribunal confirm or not the meaning the Parties gave, or sought to give, to the rules subject

to interpretation.

96. The Tribunal cannot ignore the submissions made by the Contracting Parties,
especially when they reassert and unanimously confirm a recurrent trend to understand that the
prerequisites set out in Articles 1119, 1121 and 1122(1) are enforceable and condition the

Claimants’ consent as well as the Respondent Party’s consent.**

 

97. The Contracting State Parties, in their recurring interpretative submissions on these
same articles, have remained silent on the effects of the waivers the Respondent States may accept
regarding compliance with mere formal requirements or remediable errors which, despite being

mandatory, would be liable to be excused.

98. On this particular issue, it is worth highlighting that the Respondent referred to the
possibility that minor errors and defects in the information the Notice of Intent was supposed to
contain could be regarded as not affecting a Tribunal’s jurisdiction.*4 However, this condonation
does not extend to the lack of identification of the “disputing investor” who failed to submit a Notice

of Intent and who could not establish the existence of a dispute with the Respondent State either.

99. In conclusion, I understand that the positions assumed by the Contracting Parties in
the exercise of their rights under Article 1128 do not impose, but simply confirm, the interpretations

of Articles 1119, 1121 and 1122 that support and substantiate this dissenting opinion.
100. For all the reasons stated above, I consider that:

e The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims by the Additional Claimants.

S3Submission of the Government of Canada pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128, February 28, 2018: “... Articles
1116 to 1121 mandate that a claimant satisfy several requirements in order to perfect the consent of a NAFTA
Party to arbitrate an investment...” II. 3; Submission of the United States of America pursuant to Article
1128, August 17, 2018: “... the United States has long maintained, that the “procedures set out in this
Agreement”, required to engage the NAFTA Parties’ consent and form the agreement to arbitrate necessarily
include Articles 1116-1121. Alll three NAFTA Parties agree that their consent to the submission of any claim
to arbitration is conditioned upon de satisfaction of the relevant procedural requirements. Their common,
concordant, and consistent views form a subsequent practice “that shall be taken into account,” { 16.

 

S4 “While an element of delay, condonation or acquiescence by the disputing Party can be seen in certain
decisions and awards that have excused the disputing investor’s alleged failure of compliance, that is not the
case here. Mexico made its objections at the earliest possible opportunity and has steadfastly maintained them;”
Reply on Jurisdictional Objections, 1 December 2017, § 107.

19

e The Tribunal, lacking jurisdiction over the Additional Claimants, is precluded from
hearing any admissibility claim by those Additional Claimants.

IB. Jurisdictional objection regarding the Claimants’ claims on behalf of the Mexican
Companies under Articles 1117, 1119, 1121 and 1122(1).

101. The Respondent challenges the existence of its consent pursuant to Article 1122(1);
the validity of the Mexican Companies’ consent pursuant to Article 1121; and the Mexican

Companies’ ownership or control by the Claimants pursuant to Article 1117.

LB.1. The Respondent’s consent under Article 1122(1)

102. As regards the objection related to the Respondent’s lack of consent pursuant to
Article 1122(1), I disagree with the Majority due to the fact that, as stated above, failure to comply
with the conditions imposed by that Article precludes the Tribunal from exercising its jurisdiction
over the claims by the so-called Additional Claimants. The rationale and conclusions set out in

Section I.A. extend, mutatis mutandis, to any Mexican company not identified in the Notice of

Intent.
1.B.2. The Mexican Companies’ consent under Article 1121
I.B.2.a.__ The Juegos Companies’ consent.

103. The Respondent challenges the consent conveyed by the Juegos Companies pursuant

to Article 1117(2) and (3).

104. Article 1121, on the Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration,
in its sub-article 2, states that “[a] disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1117 to
arbitration only if both the investor and the enterprise: (a) consent to arbitration in accordance with
the procedures set out in this Agreement; and (b) waive their right to initiate or continue [...] any
proceedings with respect to the measure [adopted by] the disputing Party...;” in its sub-article 3, it
states that “[a] consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in writing, shall be delivered to
the disputing Party and shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration.”

105. All the Juegos Companies that had been identified in the Notice of Intent, which, in
turn, were identified in the Request for Arbitration, proved compliance with the conditions set out
by Articles 1119 and 1122(1). Therefore, these companies were enabled to give their consent

pursuant to Article 1117(2).

20

106. The seven-week delay in the consent provision by the Juegos Companies, through
the powers of attorney the Original Claimants had vested in their counsel, could be cured by the
Tribunal in the exercise of its discretion in the efficient administration of the proceedings and

respecting procedural equity between the Parties.

107. The Respondent acknowledged in its Reply the Tribunal’s ability to cure minor
deficiencies in the proceedings;*> therefore, the Tribunal may and must consider valid the consent

conveyed by the Juegos Companies identified in the Notice of Intent.

108. The Tribunal’s acceptance of the belated consents by the Juegos Companies cannot
be extended to the consents by the Additional Claimants that failed to comply with the prerequisite
of Article 1119. In this sense, Article 1121(1)(a) y (2)(a)) requires that both the investor and the
enterprise “consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement,” inter
alia, the prerequisites of Article 1119.

109. An enterprise’s consent, in compliance with Article 1121(2), does not prejudge the
ownership or the direct or indirect control the disputing investor of a Party seeks to have over an

enterprise of the other Party for the purposes of Article 1117(1).

110. Accordingly, the Respondent’s objection regarding the lack of consent by the Juegos
Companies, that was duly identified in the Notice of Intent, is dismissed. Consequently, as in the
case of the Original Claimants, it is established that the Juegos Companies, identified in the Notice
of Intent, complied with the provisions set out by Article 1121(2) and (3). The aforementioned
consent does not prejudge the ownership or control the Original Claimants had, at the relevant

critical dates, over those enterprises—and on whose behalf the Original Claimants claimed.

1.B.2.b. The withdrawal by E-Games.
111. The Respondent alleges that E-Games lacks standing to submit a claim to arbitration,
because its withdrawal from the Notice of Intent, by letter dated 24 October 2014, affected the right

thereof to consent to arbitration.

112. I agree with the Majority on the assertion that E-Games is not a party to these
proceedings. E-Games could have never withdrawn from the Notice of Intent because the Notice of

Intent was not submitted by E-Games, but by the Original Claimants. Neither could it have desisted

55 Reply, § 107.

21

from the remedy provided for in Article 1117 because such remedy had not been pursued as of the

submission date of the alleged withdrawal.

113. I disagree with the Majority’s conclusion that, in any case, were the desistimiento to
give rise to a defect under Article 1119, the Tribunal would dispose of that defect as it did in respect

of the Additional Claimants.*°

114. In conclusion, I consider that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims by the
Original Claimants on behalf of E-Games, on the grounds that it was duly identified in the Notice
of Intent and that, in compliance with Articles 1119 and 1122(1), it was authorized to convey its
consent pursuant to Article 1121(2) and (3). Once again, an enterprise’s consent, in compliance with
Article 1121(2), does not prejudge the ownership or the direct or indirect control the disputing
investor of a Party seeks to have over an enterprise of the other Party for the purposes of Article

1117().
TB.2.c. The consent by Operadora Pesa

115. It isa fact that Operadora Pesa was not identified in the Notice of Intent. Accordingly,
the conditions set out by Articles 1119 and 1122(1) were not complied with. Therefore, Operadora

Pesa is not authorized to give its consent pursuant to Article 1117(2).

LC. The Claimants’ ownership or control over the Mexican Companies
L.C.1. Value of the evidence produced

116. Tagree with the Majority that the Claimants are the ones that should prove whether
they owned or controlled the Mexican Companies both at the time of the alleged breach of the Treaty

and at the time of the submission of the Request for Arbitration.*”

117. TI agree with the Majority that the Claimants did not manage to transfer their shares

in the Juegos Companies to a third party (Grand Odissey)** in November 2014.

118. In light of the apparent recurrent negligence and constant irregularities in the

Mexican Companies’ management; along with the failure to comply with their by-laws and, thus,

56 Partial Award, | 264.

22

with Mexican law; and in light of the inefficiency proven in the production of the evidence necessary
to support their arguments, I disagree with the Majority’s findings that all of these situations

attributable to the Claimants are only relevant to the allocation of the costs of the proceedings.*?

119. Talso disagree with the Majority’s view that the constant flaws and irregularities of
the Claimants in the production of evidence of their shares in the Juegos Companies may satisfy the

minimum probative demands the Tribunal should make.°°

120. Against this background, the notarized minutes of the 2006 and 2018 Shareholders’
Meetings (asambleas) may satisfy the Tribunal’s demands for evidence of the shareholding in the
Juegos Companies as of those dates only. Nevertheless, the Tribunal must decide what shares the
Claimants held at the date of the first alleged breach (June 2013) and at the date of submission of
the Request for Arbitration (June 2016).

121. The Claimants allege that their 2014 Shareholding Worksheet details exactly what
the Claimants position as shareholders was from June 2013 to date. They justify the discrepancies
between the notarized minutes of the 2006-2008 Shareholders’ Meetings and the 2014 Shareholding
Worksheet in the fact that certain share transfers prior to 2014 were not duly approved by the

Shareholders’ Meeting at the time, as required by the by-laws of the Juegos Companies.

122. The Claimants contend that, under Mexican law, share transfers are valid and
effective as from execution thereof, irrespective of the approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting.
Should approval from the shareholders’ meeting had been necessary, in any case, the 2018

Shareholders’ Meeting granted retroactive effect thereto.

123. For the Respondent, Mexican Law provides that share transfers have direct effects
inter partes but such effects are nonexistent vis-a-vis the company until they are approved by the
shareholders’ meeting beforehand. Therefore, they produce no effect whatsoever regarding the
recognition of the shareholder and exercise of his/her rights at the company. The transfers which
have not been approved by the shareholders’ meeting are nonexistent. Therefore, the 2018

Shareholders’ Meetings have no retroactive effects.

124. I disagree with the Majority regarding the limited practical relevance attributed to the

 

positions assumed by the legal experts on Mexican law,°! which applies to the matters of fact and

of law alleged by the Parties. The Tribunal cannot fail to acknowledge that it lacks ‘expertise’ in the
respondent Party’s domestic law. The debate between the experts evinces that both of them
recognize that there are two legal acts: on the one hand, the share transfer between parties, which

only produces legal effect:

 

between them; and, on the other hand, the Shareholder Meeting’s

approval, which produces legal effects vis-a-vis the company. Without the Shareholder Meeting’s

 

prior approval of a share transfer, that transfer does not exist vis-a-vis the company or third parties.
Contrary to the Majority’s assertion,” there is no evidence on record of alleged rights attached to

such unauthorized transfers, but those rights are only exercised through those who still own them.°>

125. It is apparent that the result of the debate does not support the Majority. In lieu
thereof, it contends, first, that, under Mexican law, the shareholders who were transferred the shares
have owned them since the date of their transfer; and, second, that, as a matter of fact, the transferee
shareholders have been able to exercise the rights attached to those shares since the date of their
transfer. In my opinion, the Majority cites no provision under Mexican law in support of its
conclusion, simply because it cannot find any. The Majority attempts to ignore the legal effects that
the bylaws attribute to the Shareholder Meeting’s prior approval of any share transfer. What is more,

in fact, such lack of authorization is a nonexistent legal act under Mexican law.

126. Under Mexican law, Section 2224 of the Federal Civil Code provides that “a legal
act, nonexistent due to lack of consent or a material component, will not produce any legal effect.
It may not be rendered valid by way of confirmation or prescription; its nonexistence can be invoked
by any interested party.” [Free Translation.] Accordingly, under Mexican Law, the lack of timely
approval of a transfer does not constitute grounds for finding a nulidad relativa (relative nullity)
that may be cured as a matter of fact, as the Majority contends, or retroactively, as Claimants

maintained when interpreting the effects of the Minutes of the Shareholder Meetings held in January

2018. Therefore, under Mexican law, the share transfer without prior authorization by the
shareholders’ meeting is a nonexistent act vis-a-vis the company that cannot be amended or

perfected by any act whatsoever.

127. Consequently, the Majority does not ground its assertions in applicable law, altering

in turn the legal effects Mexican law attributes to nonexistent acts.

128. Moreover, the Majority holds that if the Tribunal gave no probative value to the de
facto share ownership and found that the Claimants’ share ownership between June 2013 and June
2016 was instead as recorded in the 2006-2008 asambleas, the Claimants would have still owned
more than 50% of the shares -the relevant threshold for proving the legal capacity to control the

Juegos Companies under Article 1117.97

129. The Majority fails to distinguish the shareholding percentages between the Original
Claimants and the Additional Claimants, as at the critical date of the first alleged breach of NAFTA

as well as at the critical date of the Request for Arbitration.

130. Despite not taking into account that the share transfers prior to 2004 were not
previously approved by the Shareholders’ Meetings, the Majority is not able to prove the Original

Claimants’ legal capacity to control, as of the critical date of the Request for Arbitration.

131. Concerning JVE Mexico, the Majority only relies on 2006, 2013, 2014 and 2018
data; for JVE Sureste, it only relies on 2007, 2009, 2013, 2014 and 2018 data; for JVE Centro, it
only relies on , 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2018 data; for J y V, it only relies on 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014
and 2018 data; and for JVE DF, it only relies on 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2018 data.®*
Consequently, the Majority does not have sufficient evidence to establish that, as of the date on
which the Request for Arbitration was filed, the Original Claimants controlled the Juegos
Companies.

132. However, the Tribunal does have information provided by the Claimants on their

version of the Original Claimants’ and the Additional Claimants’ shareholdings.

133. In this context, the Tribunal requested the parties to identify the share percentages of
each of the Mexican Companies; distinguishing between Original Claimant shareholders,

Additional Claimant shareholders, and other shareholders.

134. As required by the Tribunal, the Claimants supplied in the tables and charts included
in their Post-Hearing Brief relevant information that evinces their acknowledgment that the Original
Claimants lacked the shares necessary to control each of the Mexican companies, with the exception

of IVE Mexico.

135. In view of the defects in the production of evidence and the inconsistencies of the
evidence produced by the Claimants, I disagree with the Majority’s position that mere inferences

may make up for the burden, absence, or inconsistencies of proof.

1.C.2. Claimants’ ownership and control of the Mexican Companies

136. Article 1117 on the Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise
provides: “1. An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical
person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this

Section a claim that the other Party has breached an obligation...”

137. The parties disagree on the requirements imposed by Article 1117 whereby the
investor must “own[ ]” or “control ] [the enterprise] directly or indirectly.” The parties’ differences
raise a question about the scope and the effects of that rule. This question must be resolved through

international law rules on interpretation.

138. I agree with the Majority that the term “ownership” in the text and context of Article
1117 means holding all the shares in a company. Since the Claimants have failed to demonstrate
that they owned the Juegos Companies, E-Games or Operadora Pesa at the critical dates established

by the NAFTA, they may not claim to be the owners for the purposes of Article 1117.

139. The ordinary meaning of the term “control” implies the exercise of power, decisive
influence or discretionary management over something. Control means to have and exercise an
exclusive power to the exclusion of any other power or influence. Article 1117 draws a distinction
between direct or indirect control only. The categories of “legal control” and “de facto control” are

not provided for therein, and thus were not intended by the NAFTA Contracting Parties.

140. Still, the distinction between “legal control” and “de facto control” has been used by
both disputing parties and some arbitral tribunals. Such distinction may help, and has indeed helped,

to characterize the different forms of control that a Party’s investor may exercise over the other

Party’s enterprise. Nevertheless, such distinction may not alter the very substance of the term
“control” in the ordinary meaning to be given thereto as the manifestation and exercise of an

exclusive power to the exclusion of any other power or control.”

141. Article 1117 only refers to “control.” That control may be exercised either by the one
who is entitled thereto under the bylaws and actually exercises it or else by the one who actually

exercises such control.

142. In Thunderbird, the tribunal held that the owner or legally controlling party has the
ultimate right to determine key decisions. However, if in practice a person exercises that position,

there is a genuine link yielding the control to that person.”!

143. Hence, it contended that the term “control” interpreted in accordance with its
ordinary meaning can be exercised in various manners, and, therefore, a showing of effective or “de
facto” control is, in the tribunal’s view, sufficient for the purposes of Article 1117 of the NAFTA.”

In this regard, although within the framework of non-NAFTA cases, the notion that any “control”

 

must be effective is also confirmed by decisions rendered by ICSID tribunals.”

144. In conclusion, the term “control” may be classified as legal control or de facto
control, but this characterization does not alter the content and scope of the term “control,” i.e., the
exercise of exclusive power in the management of an enterprise to the exclusion of any other power.
Control must be contextualized in time. Only the investor exercising “effective control” at any given

time may resort to arbitration pursuant to Article 1117(1).

1.C.2.a. The Original Claimants’ control over the Juegos Companies

145. The Original Claimants were unable to provide sufficient evidence that, at the

7° “Ownership and legal control may assure that the owner or legally controlling party has the ultimate right to
determine key decisions. However, if in practice a person exercises that position... one can conceive the
existence of a genuine link yielding the control of the enterprise to that person;” International Thunderbird
Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States, Award, 26 November 2006, § 108.

7 Id, 4108.

® Id. § 106: “The Tribunal does not follow Mexico’s proposition that Article 1117 of the NAFTA requires a
showing of legal control. The term “control” is not defined in NAFTA. Interpreted in accordance with the
ordinary meaning, control can be exercised in various manners. Therefore, a showing of effective or “de facto”
control is, in the Tribunal’s view, sufficient for the purposes of Article 1117 of the NAFTA.”

relevant dates (June 2013 and June 2016), they jointly owned most Class B shares in the Juegos

Companies, with the exception of JVE Mexico.”

146. When filing the Request for Arbitration to ICSID, the Original Claimants were also
unable to show that they had effective or de facto control over the Juegos Companies, not only due
to the lack of sufficient evidence, but also in view of the text of Claimants’ letter dated 21 July 2016
in which, in response to a letter from the Centre, they admitted that, “because Claimants do not have
board control of the Juegos Companies, they [we]re not at [that] moment in a position to provide

the requested affirmation.”7>

147. In conclusion, the Original Claimants neither owned nor exercised effective control
over the Juegos Companies at the dates relevant to determining the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under

Article 1117(2).

1.C.2.b. The Original Claimants’ control over E-Games

148. It was established that the Original Claimants did not hold the shares necessary to
control E-Games, neither at the time of alleged breaches nor upon the filing of the Request for
Arbitration.” It was also demonstrated that the Original Claimants exercised effective control over

E-Games at the relevant dates.’”

149. In conclusion, the Original Claimants did not own, but did prove to have exercised
effective control, over the Juegos Companies on the dates relevant to determining the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction under Article 1117(2).

LC.2.c. The Original Claimants’ control over Operadora Pesa

150. It is a proven fact that the Original Claimants were not investors in Operadora Pesa

at the dates relevant to determining the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 1117(2).78

CONCLUSION

151.

In view of the foregoing considerations, I partially dissent from the Majority’s

Decision. Therefore, in my opinion:

The Tribunal should have granted the Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objection based
on Article 1121 of the Treaty with respect to the Additional Claimants and Operadora
Pesa;

The Tribunal should have granted the Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objection based
on Articles 1119 and 1122(1) of the Treaty with respect to the Additional Claimants
and Operadora Pesa;

The Tribunal should have granted the Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objection based
on Article 1117 of the Treaty with respect to Operadora Pesa and the Juegos
Companies, with the exception of JVE Mexico;

Consequently, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims submitted by the Original
Claimants on their own behalf under Article 1116 of the Treaty and on behalf of JVE
Mexico and E-Games under Article 1117 of the Treaty.

The costs of the proceeding should be equally borne by the Parties, and each Party
should bear the costs and expenses incurred thereby in the context of the proceeding.
