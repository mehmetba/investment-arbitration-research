THE PARTIES

4, Petitioner is a company organized under the laws of Bermuda.
5. Respondent is Peru.
THE AWARD
6. The dispute between the parties arose out of a Legal Stability Agreement (“LSA”)

concluded on July 24, 2001, between Peru and DEI. DEI alleged that certain tax assessments
imposed by Peru breached the guarantees contained in the LSA.

its On November 26, 2001, the Peruvian Tax Authority (SUNAT) assessed a tax
liability (plus interest and penalties) against Duke Energy International Egenor S.A. (“DEI
Egenor”), a Peruvian subsidiary of DEI.

8. As a result of such assessments, DEI Egenor made payments to the Peruvian Tax
Authorities of approximately US $16.5 million.

9. The tax assessments were improper and in violation of the LSA. Asa
consequence, on October 7, 2003, DEI submitted a request for arbitration to the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).

10. The arbitration took place pursuant to the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings. On August 18, 2008, the Tribunal issued an Award on the merits.

11. The Tribunal found Peru liable to DEI for breaches to the LSA and concluded that
DEI had “sustained a loss as a result of SUNAT’s assessment against Egenor”, and awarded
compensation in the amount of US $18,440,746 plus interest in favor of DEI. The Tribunal
provided that simple interest would be applicable from June 15, 2007, “calculated using the
actual interest rate(s) stipulated for that period by SUNAT (i.e., the interest rate(s) SUNAT

credits to taxpayers on tax refunds).”

12, On December 15, 2008, Peru applied for annulment of the Decision on
Jurisdiction and in the alternative for partial annulment of the Award.

13. On March 1, 2011, the Annulment Committee issued a decision dismissing Peru’s
application for annulment in its entirety and terminating the stay of enforcement of the Award.
This decision confirmed the Award’s grant of compensation in favor of DEI, and left Peru with
no further legal recourse to challenge the Award.

SUNAT’S INTEREST RATE(S)

14. There is no disagreement between the parties regarding the interest rate applicable
between June 15, 2007 and January 31, 2008. Both parties understand that the applicable rate for
this period was a monthly rate of 0.30%.' However, effective on February 1, 2008, the Peruvian
Tax code changed, by virtue of Law No. 29191.

15, Article 38 of the Peruvian Tax Code, as amended, changed the law to provide two
different interest rates on amounts paid to taxpayers. Section (a) provides that the rate for
interest in arrears (TIM) will apply in the event of wrongful or excessive payments, i.e., that are
“made as a consequence of any document issued by the Tax Administration,” while section (b)
provides that, for any other excessive payment, the applicable rate cannot be lower than the rate

published by the Banking Regulatory Authority as the average deposit rate for the market.

: Indeed, it was this rate the parties’ damages experts utilized in calculating the net present value of
DEI’s damages as of 15 June 2006 (see Marks Decl. Ex. B, 488), as it was the only rate in effect for that
pre-judgment period.

PERU’S DEFICIENT PAYMENT

16. There is no dispute that DEI Egenor’s payments were a consequence of the tax
assessment issued by SUNAT on November 26, 2001. The Tribunal specifically stated that
DEI’s loss was “a result of SUNAT’s assessment against Egenor.”

17. On March 9, 2011, DEI provided Peru the total amount due under the Award as of
March 31, 2011, considering that Peru had committed to tender payment on or before March
31st. The total amount due under the Award is US $23,826,366. This amount was calculated
using the actual interest rates stipulated by SUNAT.

18. Peru has disregarded the changes under Peruvian law, and instead applied the old
0.30% rate, which resulted in their lower interest calculation of US $2,645,407.99. Peru takes
this position notwithstanding its acknowledgment that, as of February 1, 2008, the TIM rate
applies to refunds by SUNAT as a consequence of tax assessments.

19, On March 30, 2011, DEI reiterated its position. DEI indicated that they expected
payment of the undisputed amount of US $21,086,153.99, and reserved the right to pursue the
appropriate legal remedies regarding the remaining balance.

20. On April 4, 2011, DEI received payment of US $21,086,148. Therefore, the
balance that remains unpaid is US $2,740,218. (See Marks Decl., { 11),

CAUSE OF ACTION

21. Petitioner repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
20 as if fully set forth herein.

recognition and enforcement in the United States under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and

pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 2650(a).

US $23,826,366, consisting of $18,440,746 in principal, plus interest through March 31, 2011 of
US $5,385,620.

24. Peru has paid US $21,086,148 of the Award but is in default on the remaining
US $2,740,218.

25. Petitioner is entitled to an order confirming the full amount of the Award (giving
full credit for the amount paid) pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C.
§ 1650(a).
