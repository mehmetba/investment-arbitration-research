and Inicia Zrt. V. Hungary (the “Arbitration’”), conducted in Paris, France, pursuant to the rules

2. The Final Award was rendered in favor of Petitioners following arbitration
proceedings conducted in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention’). A copy of the
ICSID Convention is attached as Exhibit 2 to the Russo Declaration.

3. The Final Award imposed pecuniary obligations on Hungary to pay Petitioners
compensation for its expropriation of Petitioners’ investment and to reimburse Petitioners for
various costs and legal fees.

4. To date, Hungary has not paid any portion of the Final Award.

5. Pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, arbitral
awards issued under the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral attack and must be
enforced in the same manner and given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final
judgment of a court in the United States.

6. Accordingly, Petitioners Magyar Farming Company Ltd., Kintyre Kft, and Inicia
Zrt respectfully request that this Court: (i) enter an order enforcing the Final Award in the same
manner as a final judgment issued by a court in the United States, (ii) enter judgment in favor of
Petitioners in the amount of €7,148,824 million, together with interest from August 1, 2015 until
payment, and (iii) enter judgment in favor of Petitioners for reimbursement of various costs and
fees set forth in the Final Award together with interest at the rate of 6-month Euro Interbank
Offered Rate +2% compounded semi-annually from the date of the Final Award until payment.

10. Respondent Hungary (“Hungary” or the “Respondent’), is a foreign state within
the meaning of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332,
1391(f), 1602-11.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11. As detailed below, the Final Award arises out of Hungary’s breach of its
obligations under the agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and the Hungarian People’s Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments (the “UK-Hungary BIT” or the “BIT”). The BIT was signed on March 6, 1987 and
ratified on August 28, 1987. A copy of the UK-Hungary BIT is attached as Exhibit 3 to the

Russo Declaration.

Case 1:20-cv-00637-CKK Document 1 Filed 03/04/20 Page 4 of 15

12. The Final Award is also governed by ICSID Convention which provides that

“TeJach Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as

binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it

were a final judgment of a court in that State.” ICSID Convention, art. 54(1) (emphasis added).

13. All of the States involved in this action are party to the ICSID Convention:

a.

The United States is a contracting state to the ICSID Convention and has
adopted implementing legislation to give full faith and credit to arbitral
awards rendered under the ICSID Convention. See 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).

Hungary also is a party to the ICSID Convention. See ICSID, List of
Contracting States and Other Signatories of the Convention (indicating that
Hungary signed the ICSID Convention on October 1, 1986 and that the ICSID
Convention entered into force for Hungary on March 6, 1987), available at

https://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/about/Database-of-Member-States.aspx

   

(last checked March 4, 2020).

Moreover, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the
contracting States to the governing BIT) are also parties to the ICSID
Convention. The former signed the ICSID Convention on May 26, 1965 and
ratified it on December 19, 1966, with an effective date of January 18, 1967.
The latter signed it on October 1, 1986 and ratified it on February 4, 1987,
with an effective date of March 6, 1987. See ICSID, List of Contracting

States and Other Signatories of the Convention, available at

https://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/about/Database-of-Member-States.aspx

 

(last checked March 4, 2020).

Case 1:20-cv-00637-CKK Document 1 Filed 03/04/20 Page 5 of 15

14. This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b),
which provides that “[t]he district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over actions and proceedings” to enforce awards entered under the ICSID
Convention. Moreover, the United States federal district courts are vested with original
jurisdiction over any nonjury civil action against a foreign state with respect to which the foreign
state is not entitled to immunity under the FSIA or under any applicable international agreement.
28 U.S.C. § 1330(a).

15. Pursuant to Section 1605 of the FSIA, Hungary is not entitled to immunity from
this Court’s jurisdiction in an action to enforce an award issued pursuant to the ICSID
Convention because Hungary has waived any such immunity by agreeing to the ICSID
Convention. See Blue Ridge Investments, L.L.C. v. Republic of Argentina, 735 F.3d 72, 84 (2d
Cir. 2013) (holding that a foreign country waives sovereign immunity under the FSIA “by
becoming a party to the ICSID Convention”). Hungary is further not entitled to immunity
because it waived such immunity by affirmatively consenting to the arbitration of the parties’
underlying dispute. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1), (6); see also ICSID Convention, art. 26; Final
Award at {[ 220.

16. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Hungary pursuant to the FSIA. Under
Section 1330(b) of the FSIA, United States district courts have personal jurisdiction over a
foreign state as to every claim for relief over which they have original jurisdiction under Section
1330(a) of the FSIA where service has been made under Section 1608 of the FSIA. 28 U.S.C. §§
1330(a), (b); 28 U.S.C. § 1608.

17. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4).

Case 1:20-cv-00637-CKK Document 1 Filed 03/04/20 Page 6 of 15

18. The Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-307, does not apply to
“enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the [ICSID] convention.” 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).

As such, the FAA’s jurisdictional requirements do not apply to this Action.

THE DISPUTE, THE ARBITRATION, AND THE FINAL AWARD
The Dispute

19. The dispute arises out of Petitioners’ investment in Hungary and Hungary’s
subsequent measures regulating possession and disposal of agricultural land owned by Hungary,
which, resulted in the expropriation of Petitioners’ leasehold rights to 760 hectares of land
owned by Hungary and which is located in Hungary’s northwestern region of Ikrény (the
“Land”) and in a diminution of the value of Petitioners’ farming business in Hungary.

20. In sum, Hungary amended relevant land laws and otherwise rigged the lease
bidding process so Petitioners could not exercise their lease rights to the Land and were
otherwise evicted from the Land in disregard of their pre-lease rights and the interim possessory
protection that Inicia had obtained from the local authorities.

21. The leasehold rights at issue were protected by the UK-Hungary BIT and the
ICSID Convention. The Petitioners are incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom and
Hungary, both of which are contracting party to both the UK-Hungary BIT and the ICSID
Convention. Final Award at { 2.

The Arbitration

22. On July 14, 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated July 4, 2017

from the Petitioners against Hungary, together with exhibits C-1 through C-25 and legal

authorities CL-1 and CL-2 (the “Request for Arbitration”). Final Award at [ 29.

Case 1:20-cv-00637-CKK Document 1 Filed 03/04/20 Page 11 of 15

THIS COURT SHOULD CONFIRM THE FINAL AWARD.

43. The United States and Hungary are contracting states to the ICSID Convention.
Article 54 of the ICSID Convention provides that “[e]ach Contracting State shall recognize an
award pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by
that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.” ICSID
Convention, art. 54(1) (emphasis added).

44, The United States is a contracting state to the Convention, see ICSID, List of
Contracting States and Other Signatories of the Convention (available at

https://icsid. worldbank.org/en/Pages/about/Database-of-Member-States.aspx  (Jast — checked

 

March 4, 2020), and Congress has passed implementing legislation to give effect to the
Convention’s requirement that contracting states recognize and enforce ICSID awards.
45. Specifically, 22 U.S.C. § 1650a provides in relevant part:

(a) An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter
IV of the convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of
the United States. The pecuniary obligations imposed by such an
award shall be enforced and shall be given the same full faith and
credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general
jurisdiction of one of the several States. The Federal Arbitration
Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of awards
rendered pursuant to the convention.

Emphasis added.

46. The United States, as a contracting state to the ICSID Convention, is therefore
obligated to recognize and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by the Final Award as if it
were a final judgment of a court of the United States.

47. Arbitral awards issued against a foreign state pursuant to the ICSID Convention

may be enforced by bringing a plenary action in federal court in compliance with the

requirements for commencing a civil action under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and with

-l1-

Case 1:20-cv-00637-CKK Document 1 Filed 03/04/20 Page 12 of 15

the personal jurisdiction, service, and venue requirements of the FSIA. See Micula v. Gov’t of
Romania, 104 F. Supp. 3d 42, 49-50 (D.D.C. 2015); see also Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v.
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 863 F.3d 96, 100, 117-18, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2017).

48. Awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral
attack in enforcement proceedings under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a. “Member states’ courts are. . . not
permitted to examine an ICSID award’s merits, its compliance with international law, or the
ICSID tribunal’s jurisdiction to render the award; under the Convention’s terms, they may do no
more than examine the judgment’s authenticity and enforce the obligations imposed by the
award.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 102. The ICSID Convention therefore “reflects an
expectation that the courts of a member nation will treat the award as final.” Id. (emphasis
added); see also id. at 118 (noting that an “ICSID award-debtor . . . [is] not . . . permitted to
make substantive challenges to the award”); ICSID Convention, arts. 53(1), 54(1).

49. Consistent with this mandate, 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a) provides that the FAA “shall
not apply to enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the convention,” thereby “mak[ing] [the
FAA’s defenses] unavailable to ICSID award-debtors in federal court enforcement proceedings.”
Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 120-21.

50. District courts thus enforce ICSID awards without allowing substantive
challenges to enforcement of the awards. See, e.g., Duke Energy Int’l Peru Investments No. 1,
Ltd. v. Republic of Peru, 904 F. Supp. 2d 131, 132-34 (D.D.C. 2012); Tidewater Inv. SRL v.
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, CV 17-1457 (TJK), 2018 WL 6605633, at *6 (D.D.C. Dec.

17, 2018).

CAUSE OF ACTION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Sl. Petitioners restate and incorporate paragraphs | through SO of the Petition as set
