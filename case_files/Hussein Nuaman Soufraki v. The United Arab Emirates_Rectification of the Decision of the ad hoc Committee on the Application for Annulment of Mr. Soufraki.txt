THE AD HOC COMMITTEE

Composed as above,

After deliberation,

Makes the following decision:

L. On 18 June 2002, arbitration p dings were instituted under the C ion on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States in respect to a
dispute between Mr. Hussein Nuaman Soufraki and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The
Arbitral Tribunal, constituted on 23 October 2002, rendered its Award on 7 July 2004, On 12
November 2004, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered a Request for Annulment of the
Award submitted by Mr. Soufraki. On 18 January 2005 the ad hoc Committee was
constituted. On 5 June 2007, the ad hoc Committee rendered its Decision.

2. On 19 June 2007, in accordance with Article 49 of the ICSID Convention and Rule
49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) filed with the Centre a
Request for Rectification of the Decision of the ad hoc Committee on Annulment (the
“Request”) dated 15 June 2007.

3. In its Request the UAE alleged that, due to an error, Mr. Anthony Sinclair of Allen
and Overy LLP, who had acted as counsel for the Respondent throughout the annulment

proceedings, was not listed in the title page of the Decision on Annulment.

4. On July 3, 2007 the Secretary-General registered the Request, pursuant to ICSID
Arbitration Rules 49(2)(a). On the same date, the Secretary-General, in accordance with
ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(2)(b), notified the parties of the registration of the Request and, in
accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(2)(c) and (d), transmitted copies of the Request to
Mr. Soufraki.

5. By letter dated 18 June 2007, Claimant indicated that it had no objection to the
rectification requested by the Respondent.

6. The ad hoc Committee has taken note of the UAE’s Request for Rectification and of
the Claimant’s lack of objections thereof. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(3),

 

 

the members of the ad hoc Committee have agreed that it would not be necessary for them to
meet in order to consider the Request.

7. The ad hoc Committee has taken into consideration Article 49(2) of the ICSID
Convention, in accordance with which the Request is made, which reads, in pertinent part:

The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date
on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide
any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify
any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall
become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same

manner as the award. (...)

8. Having considered the UAE's Request and the Claimant’s lack of objections, the ad
hoc Committee unanimously decides to grant the Request for Rectification, thereby replacing
the title page of the Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007 with the enclosed revised title
page.

9. For the purpose of ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(4), the present decision refers to the
terms of the Decision on Annulment dated 5 June 2007, relating to the matters indicated in
Arbitration Rule 47(1)(a-g). In accordance with Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the
present decision constitutes an integral part of the Decision on Annulment.
