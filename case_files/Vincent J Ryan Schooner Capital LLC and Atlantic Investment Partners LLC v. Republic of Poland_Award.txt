INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’”’) under the Additional Facility Rules
on the basis of the bilateral investment treaty between the United States of America
and the Republic of Poland Concerning Business and Economic Relations signed on

21 March 1990 (the “BIT” or “Treaty’’), which entered into force on 6 August 1994.

The Claimants are V J. (Mr. R  ”), a national of the United States of
America, S Cc LLC (“S ”)and A I P LLC
(a ”), both of whom are limited liability companies registered in Delaware in

the United States of America. All three are hereinafter jointly referred to as the

“Claimants.”

The Claimants are represented in this proceeding by Messrs. P = -K sR

Z 4R R 5A M ,M J 5A P and Mmes.
K K ,«K Z JA Z ,S U and
M P of K Z and P Sp.J. Mr. J A of

or the “Respondent.” The Respondent is represented in this proceeding by Dr.

WwW Ss and Dr. R M of G J Sp.K., and Ms.

The Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the

“Parties.”
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Mr. V J.R- ,Sc Cc LLC and A I LLC filed on

24 and 27 September 2010 by email and in hard copy, respectively, a joint application

for approval of access to the Additional Facility pursuant to Article 4 of the Additional
Facility Rules and Article I(1)(b) of the BIT.

Pursuant to Article 4(5) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, and in accordance
with Article 4(2) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, on 3 November 2010, the
ICSID Secretary-General granted approval of access to the Additional Facility in

respect of the dispute referred to in the application.

On 8 April 2011, ICSID received a request to institute arbitration proceedings under

the Additional Facility Rules dated 31 March 2011, from V JR YS
Cc LLC and A I LLC against the Republic of Poland (the
“Request’”).

On 26 April 2011, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Request in accordance
with Articles 4 and 5 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules and notified
the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General
invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in
accordance with Article 5(c) and Chapter III of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional
Facility) Rules.

By agreement dated 21 July 2011, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal in this
proceeding was to consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party, and
the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. The Parties’
21 July 2011 agreement further stipulated that in the event the Parties were unable to
agree on the appointment of the presiding arbitrator by 19 September 2011, either
Party may request the ICSID Secretary-General to appoint the President of the
Tribunal.

By letter of 28 July 2011, the Claimants appointed Prof. Francisco Orrego Vicufia, a
national of Chile, as arbitrator and Prof. Orrego Vicufia subsequently accepted his
appointment. By letter of 4 August 2011, the Respondent appointed Prof. Claus von
Wobeser, a national of Mexico, as arbitrator, and Prof. von Wobeser subsequently

accepted his appointment.

By letter of 22 September 2011 and further to the Parties’ 21 July 2011 agreement,
the Claimants requested the ICSID Secretary-General to appoint the President of the
Tribunal. Further to this request, the Secretary-General appointed Mr. Makhdoom Ali

Khan, a national of Pakistan, as President of the Arbitral Tribunal on 8 October 2011.

On 11 October 2011, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 13(1) of the
ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules notified the Parties that all three
arbitrators had accepted their respective appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Frauke Nitschke, ICSID

Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 28 November 2011, the Claimants filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on
matters concerning participation of counsel. The Claimants requested the Tribunal to

decide:

(i) Whether G J Sp.K. as a whole was in a conflict of interest
situation given that one of the firm’s partners had allegedly provided legal

services to predecessors of the Claimants;

(ii) Whether G J Sp.K. had failed to notify the Claimants and their
legal representatives of the fact that they were aware of the existence of a

conflict of interest prior to providing legal services to the Respondent;

(iii) | Whether the legal representation of the Respondent (i.e. both the individual
members and the firm as such) may continue to act as counsel for the

Respondent in the present dispute; and

(iv) | Whether one member on the Claimants’ legal team was in a conflict of interest
situation given his previous engagement with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

of the Respondent.

On 29 November and 6 December 2011, the Respondent filed observations on the
Claimants’ 28 November 2011 requests. Specifically, the Respondent averred that no

conflict of interest existed in relation to one of the managing partners, and further

alleged that, in turn, a conflict of interest existed in the Claimants’ team with regard
to the Claimants’ counsel who had previously had a professional engagement at the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Tribunal held a first session and a hearing on the Claimants’ 28 November 2011
requests regarding the participation of counsel with the Parties on 8 December 2011

in London.

In the course of the first session, the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly
constituted. It was further agreed inter alia that the 2006 ICSID Arbitration
(Additional Facility) Rules would apply to the present proceeding, and that the
procedural language would be English. A schedule for the first round of written
pleadings was also determined. Given that the Parties were unable to agree prior to
and during the session on the legal seat and the governing law of the arbitration, it was
determined that each Party would file a written submission on the matter and that the
Tribunal would subsequently decide the issue. Summary Minutes of the first session
were prepared by the Secretary of the Tribunal and subsequently transmitted to the

Parties and the Tribunal.

Following the first session, the Tribunal held a hearing on the Claimants’ 28

November 2011 requests. Present at this hearing were:

For the Claimants:

- Mr.S D.M Ss Cc LLC

- Ms.K K K Z and P Sp.J.

Also attending the hearing at the request of the Tribunal:

- Mr.M J G J Sp.K.
In the course of the hearing, Mr. J was called by the Tribunal to provide oral
testimony.

Sound recordings of the first session and the hearing were distributed to the Tribunal
and the Parties. A verbatim transcript of the hearing was also made and subsequently

provided to the Members of the Tribunal and the Parties.

On 15 December 2011, the Parties filed simultaneous written submissions concerning
the legal seat of the arbitration. The Claimants proposed London (United Kingdom)
as the place of the arbitration, while the Respondent favoured Frankfurt am Main
(Germany), Paris (France) or The Hague (Netherlands) as the place of these
proceedings. Having considered the Parties’ oral and written submissions, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on 1 February 2012, selecting Paris as the

legal seat of the arbitration.

On 22 December 2011, the Claimants filed further observations concerning their 28
November 2011 requests relating to the participation of counsel. The Respondent

responded to these observations by letter of 30 December 2011.

On 8 May 2012, the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits.

On 29 June 2012, the Tribunal issued a decision on the Claimants’ 28 November 2011
requests and the Respondent’s subsequent request relating to the participation of

counsel. Specifically, the Tribunal examined in its decision:

(i) whether Dr. W Sa , Dr. R M or any other
lawyer associated with G J Sp.k. (“ G
J ”) has a conflict of interest and can continue to act as counsel

Sor the Respondent in this arbitration; and/or

(ii) whether the law firm of G J as a whole has a conflict
of interest and can continue to act as counsel for the Respondent;
and/or

25.

26.

27.

28.

(iii) | whether Dr. M J , a member of the legal team of the
Claimants, has a conflict of interest and can continue to act as
counsel for the Claimants.

In its decision, the Tribunal summarized the Parties’ positions as follows:

Briefly stated, the Claimants submit that a Managing Partner of

G J Sp.k.,Mr.M = jJ — a-—who has not been notified to
the Secretariat as being part of the Respondent’s legal team in this
case — has allegedly provided legal advisory services to predecessors

 

of the Clai or their companies (...). The Clai intained
that in view of this conflict of interest Dr. W Ss , Dr.
R M or any other lawyer associated with G J

cannot continue to act as counsel for the Respondent in this dispute.

The Respondent submits that a conflict of interest exists on the

Claimants’ side, regarding Dr. M J , who was recently

hired by the counsel for the Claimants, and who previously had a

professional engagement for the benefit of the Polish Ministry of

Foreign Affairs. The Respondent maintains that due to this conflict

of interest Dr. M J cannot continue to act as a part of the

legal team of the Claimants in this dispute.
The Tribunal ultimately declined the Claimants’ request, ordering inter alia that (i)
the Respondent’s legal team was to continue to keep an already existing ethical screen
in place and that (ii) the Respondent and the lawyers engaged in the conduct of this
arbitration must not interact with Mr. J in respect of any aspect of this case in
any manner whatsoever, adding that (iii) they must also not share with or receive any
information or documents from Mr. J . The Tribunal further declined the
Respondent’s request to disqualify the member of the Claimants’ legal team who had

a professional engagement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

On 8 October 2012, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits,
including objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, and a request for the bifurcation

of the proceeding.

Following observations by the Claimants on the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation
on 25 October 2012, the Tribunal issued its decision on this request on 16 January

2013, deciding to join the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility to

29.

32.

the merits of the dispute. The Parties subsequently agreed on a timetable for the further

written and oral procedure.

On 7 February 2013, counsel for the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had
learned that an office manager and senior assistant formerly engaged by the
Claimants’ counsel had taken up employment with counsel for the Respondent, i.e.

G J . The Claimants further expressed concern that her new

employment may have an effect on the integrity of the present proceedings.

On 15 February 2013, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to (i) convene a hearing
on the matter; (ii) order the Claimants and the Respondent to file observations on this
issue; and (iii) resolve the matter, and, as the case may be, order the necessary

measures to secure the integrity of this proceeding.

The Respondent filed its observations on the Claimants’ requests on 1 March 2013.
In its submission, the Respondent concluded that the employment of the officer
manager at G J posed no threat to the integrity of the present
proceeding. Specifically, the Respondent averred that the office manager was not a
lawyer, had not been involved in any legal work and was not bound by any code of
ethical conduct applicable to lawyers. The Respondent further stated that she did not
provide any assistance to the legal team working on the present case, and that her prior
engagement at the law firm of Claimants’ counsel had reportedly been limited to
technical assistance such as document formatting. The Respondent further submitted
that its legal team had been unaware of her prior employment. Upon learning this fact,
she was immediately separated from the lawyers engaged in the case and secured
against being involved in it, which had also been notified to the Claimants in early
February of 2012. The Respondent did not consider a hearing on the matter necessary

in the circumstances.

By letter of 5 March 2013, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it did not consider
oral argument necessary and that it was ready to decide the matter on the basis of the
written submissions. However, on 6 March 2013, the Claimants repeated their request

for a hearing.

35.

A hearing was held with the Parties on 13 March 2013 by telephone conference. In
the course of the hearing, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to “order G

J to disengage from the current proceedings” and, alternatively, to “order a
strict Ethical Screen...and to confirm the Claimants’ rights to question any evidence
that may originate from [a] contaminated source.” At the hearing, the Tribunal
requested further information from the Parties, which the Parties submitted on 20

March 2013. Present at this hearing were:

For the Claimants:

- MrP K K Z and P Sp.J.

- Mr.R IB K Z and P Sp.J.

- DrM J K Z and P Sp.J.
For the Respondent:

- DrR M G J Sp.K.

- DrW Ss G J Sp.K.

- MrA D State Treasury Solicitors’ Office

On 1 July 2013, the Tribunal issued a decision concerning the Claimants’ requests.
The Tribunal decided inter alia to decline the Claimants’ request to order G

J to disengage as counsel from the present proceedings. The Tribunal further
directed that if the office manager returned to work from an ongoing medical leave,
the Claimants and the Tribunal be immediately notified and she be put behind an
ethical screen. The Tribunal also ordered that Respondent’s counsel must not interact
with her in respect of any aspect of this case in any manner, nor communicate with
her in relation to this case or share with or receive any information or documents. The
Tribunal further ruled that the Claimants and the Tribunal must be immediately

informed of all measures taken to ensure that the ethical screen is effective.

Following the Tribunal’s decision, on 20 August 2013, the Respondent’s counsel
informed the Claimants and the Tribunal that the office manager did not return to
work at G J following her medical leave and that her employment

contract had been terminated.

On 14 April 2013, following several exchanges between the Parties, the Claimants
filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on various document production matters. The
Respondent produced documents in response to the Claimants’ request on 6 May
2013. On 13 May 2012, the Claimants filed observations on the documents produced
and renewed their request for document production. On 21 and 22 May 2013, the
Respondent produced further documents and filed a response to the Claimants’
observations of 13 May 2013. The Tribunal decided on the Claimants’ request in its
Procedural Order No. 2 on 17 June 2013. The Respondent subsequently filed a request
for clarification of Procedural Order No. 2, to which the Claimants responded in

writing. The Tribunal decided on the Respondent’s request on 20 June 2013.

On 3 September 2013, the Claimants filed a Reply on Jurisdiction and the Merits.

Following exchanges between the Parties, the Respondent filed, on 26 November
2013, a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents, which the
Tribunal decided on 7 December 2013 in its Procedural Order No. 3. A further
document production request was made by the Respondent, on 26 January 2014.
Following the observations of the Claimants of 31 January 2014, the Tribunal on 10

February 2014 issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning production of documents.

On 20 March 2014, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the Merits.

On 8 April 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 concerning the
organization of the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits. On 11 April 2014, the
Claimants requested from the Tribunal certain clarifications of Procedural Order No.
5 and filed a request for the admissibility of further evidence. Following observations
filed by the Respondent on 16 April 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.
6 on 24 April 2014, deciding the Claimants’ 11 April 2014 requests.

not to set out an absolutely complete recitation of each side’s case in this Award, but
instead simply to summarise the principal points made, in the course of the analysis
below. In so far as any argument or evidence has not been specifically identified or
recorded in the body of this Award, this does not mean it has not been taken into full

consideration.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Claimants
In the early 1990s, Mr. V JR and S Cc Cc CS”)
decided to pursue investment opportunities in Poland. W = E I Cw ”)

was set up as a special purpose vehicle for investing in Poland. From 8 November

1994 onwards, which is the date relevant to the present dispute, the shareholder

structure of W consisted of S P L.P.(“S_—_”) as a sole general partner

The Privatization Agreement

As their first investment in Poland, the Claimants chose N Z

P T wB S.A.(“K _”), a state-owned enterprise engaged
in the production and processing of vegetable fats. On 8 November 1994, i.e. prior to
its 1998 merger with S ,S had entered into a Privatization Agreement with
the Polish State Treasury for the acquisition of 55% of the shares of K for the
Polish zloty (“PLN”) equivalent of US$ 18,782,500. In accordance with the

Privatization Agreement:

(i) S undertook not to sell, pledge or transfer the K shares for a period of
10 years except to W_ . This 10 year period was subsequently reduced to 5

years;

(ii) S was required to vote for increasing K share capital and to contribute

US$ 10,000,000 to it; and

(iii) | As a shareholder, S was required to cause K to invest an aggregate
amount of US$ 38,300,000 in its production facilities and infrastructure until

31 December 1997.

S fulfilled condition (ii) above on 21 June 1995 when it voted to increase the share
capital of K and invested US$ 10,000,000 in the company. As a result, S

shareholding increased from 55% to 65.5%. On 17 April 1996, S__ voted to further
increase K share capital and invested the PLN equivalent of US$ 433,929 in the
company. As a result, S shareholding increased to 70.4%. The State Treasury

continued to hold the remaining shares.

On 30 October 1997, S transferred all of its rights, title and interest in and to
K shares toW (“Assignment Agreement 1”). On 3 April 1998, W voted to
increase K share capital and invested the PLN equivalent of US$ 406,164 in the

company. As a result W shareholding in K increased to 75%.

Other investments

Ss and W also invested in other Polish companies. On 30 December, 1994 S
acquired 49% of the shares in W F M S.A. (CW ”), a
company focusing on the business of furniture production. Following an initial public
offering of W shares, with effect from 6 May 1998, S interest was reduced
to 31.97%. On 28 June 1996, W concluded an agreement with the E. K

N I F S.A. Under the agreement W purchased 51% of the
shares in B S.A. (“B ”). This company was also engaged in the production
and processing of vegetable fats. K ,W  andB are hereinafter collectively

referred to as the “Polish Investments.”

K

K main business involved the production of raw rapeseed oil, rapeseed meal and
refined oil and margarine. The Parties disagree as to the development and growth of
K business and its financial position following its privatization. In particular,
they disagree about the impact of the general macroeconomic conditions in Poland on
the vegetable fats industry and on K . The relevant facts are, therefore, described
in the Parties’ positions further below. What is, however, not disputed is that around
the year 2000 K faced a loss in its liquidity. It was eventually declared bankrupt
on 5 June 2003. The reasons for the company’s demise form a part of the subject
matter of the present dispute. These are, therefore, also dealt with in the section setting
forth the Parties’ submissions. Only the events leading up to K bankruptcy on 5

June 2003 are described herein.

In June 2000, K ceased to pay back its loans. In October 2000, K ceased to

pay social security contributions for its employees.

On 17 November 2000, K accounts at various banks, including B Ss

S.A., P B S.A.,B P S.A. and B B S.A. were seized in favour

of B H S.A. for the purpose of enforcement proceedings.* On the same

date, K receivables from J H , H B T
R ,H M and E were also seized in favour of the same
bank.*

60. On 24 November 2000, K account at B P S.A. was seized to secure
B B S.A.’s receivables.> In a letter dated 14 May 2001, B P S.A.

demanded that K pay the outstanding part of its loan. On 14 May 2001, this

amounted to PLN 12,062,962. K was also informed that in case it did not pay,

B P S.A. would enforce its receivables through court.®
61. On June 2001, K account at B B S.A. was seized in favour of the T
Oo inB for the purpose of enforcement proceedings. The receivables of the

T O inB amounted to PLN 3,891,717.30. On 21 June 2001, the interest on
these receivables amounted to PLN 2,214,954.98.7

62. In November 2001, K ceased to pay its employees.

63. On April 2002, K obtained court approval of a collective settlement with its
creditors.* Under the terms of the settlement, the company was obliged to repay 60%
of the principal amount of the debt in 16 or 24 monthly instalments depending on the

value of the claim.” These payments were not made.!°

65. The resulting loss in liquidity meant that the company ceased its normal operations.

66. The Claimants sought to prevent K bankruptcy through various means including
sales and sale/leasebacks of certain production facilities, a sale of K power
plant, the addition of bio-fuel capabilities, mergers with other companies, a sale of
margarine trademarks, negotiations with potential new investors and various other

approaches without success.

rights to the margarine brand trademarks owned or used by K from U

K financial standing, however, caused U to withdraw from the

transaction.!? K and its banks also entered into negotiations regarding a possible
merger with K , one of K competitors. The negotiations, however,

ultimately failed.

68. K tried to sell its margarine trademarks and to withdraw the production of tub and
cube margarines for a period of five years, focusing instead on production of refined

rapeseed oil and on its products designed for institutional clients.

69. One of the obstacles to finding a solution to K financial difficulties was pending
tax proceedings against it for the fiscal years 1994 to 1997, as a result of which tax

arrears and interest thereon had been imposed. K , therefore, sought to restructure

70. On 23 October 2002, K applied to initiate the restructuring process for its tax
liabilities in the amount of PLN 50,709,208.72 as of 30 June 2002. On 23 October
2002, the W T O issued a decision determining that as of 30 June 2002,
K tax liabilities amounted to PLN 50,709,208.72. A restructuring fee of PLN

2,973,580.20 for the cancellation of these tax liabilities was determined.!*

71. On7 November 2002, B P S.A. filed a motion with the District Court for the
City of Warsaw seeking a declaration of K bankruptcy. In its motion, the bank
claimed that as of 30 September 2002, K debts to the bank totalled PLN
30,088,387.35 and K had ceased to pay its debts. 14

The Management Services

The Parties dispute the scope of the Management Services and the extent to which
they were, in fact, provided. The description of the Management Services is based on

the Claimants’ submissions and does not reflect the agreed position of the Parties.

According to the Claimants, under the Privatization Agreement,S was required to
provide K with know-how and other support for its development including: (i)
making available to K patents, trademarks, technology and other rights on
intangible assets (Article VI of the Privatization Agreement); and (ii) causing K

to organize training programs for its employees (Article VIII of the Privatization
Agreement). In this regard, the Claimants referred to a letter dated 23 September 1993
from the Polish Minister for Industry toS expressing his appreciation for S
interest and active participation in Poland’s privatization efforts and agreeing that it
was necessary to provide training and development programs for the management and

employees of Polish companies. '?

The Claimants state that they began providing Management Services to K shortly
after its privatization on 8 November 1994. These services were provided through a
special purpose Polish subsidiary, W Cw”). W

was incorporated in Poland on 12 January 1995. On 26 January 1995,S concluded
an agreement for the purchase of all shares in W _. Subsequently, on 20 June 1996,

Ww purchased 100% shares in W from S

An agreement was concluded between W and K on 2 December 1994 in

relation to the Management Services.?? In accordance with Clause 1 of this

Agreement, W had to provide K with management, advisory and consultancy
services, in particular: (i) consulting in the scope of ongoing business activities; (ii)
management, investment and marketing services; (iii) monitoring K activity in
order to stabilize its market operations, strengthen its market position and win new
sales markets; and (iv) coordinating the cooperation among domestic and foreign fat
industry research institutes. Similar agreements were executed with the other Polish
Investments. Additional agreements in relation to the Management Services were

signed in 1995 (“K 1995 Agreements”) and 1996 (“K 1996 Agreements”).

For the most part, the costs of salaries of the executives and consultants who provided
Management Services and their fees and expenses were incurred directly by W

W then invoiced W and W invoiced each of the Polish Investments who
paid Management Fees to it. In order to allocate the cost of providing the Management
Services to the Polish Investments, the Management Fees were calculated as a
percentage of monthly sales of each of the Polish Investments. The Management Fees
paidmonthlytoW  byK were initially calculated at 1.25% of K monthly
sales. This was subsequently increased to 1.5% under the Annex of 3 January 1996 to
the Agreement of 2 December 1994.7! In 1997, the method of calculating the
Management Fees was revised to remuneration for specific work or an hourly rate for

each individual who provided Management Services.

The Management Services were provided jointly to the Polish Investments. S

recruited three members of management for its Polish activities — Mr. T P.
H , who was hired as W Chief Executive Officer, Mr.P L.B , who
was hired as W Chief Financial Officer and Mr. R H.M , who was hired
as W Senior Vice President for Business Development. Mr. H and Mr.
B agreed to spend 50% of their time in Poland, while Mr. M , who was a
Polish national, agreed to spend most of his time in Poland. According to the

Claimants, a significant portion of the W expenses that were allocated to the Polish

2 See Claimants’ Memorial dated 8 May 2012, footnote 42. While the Claimants’ dis

Investments through the Management Fee arrangement consisted of the salaries and

travel expenses of these three gentlemen.

The stated purpose of establishing W was to have a central office, which could
serve as the base of operations in Poland and accommodate a local team whose
activities would involve supporting the companies acquired by W under the

supervision of W management team.

Ss personnel, including Mr.R-—, Mr. M ,» Mr.M and Ms. M :
also provided consulting services on an as-needed basis to W and the Polish
Investments. The services consisted of continuous involvement on a day-to-day basis
with the necessary functions of the companies including with respect to general
management, finance, sales and marketing. At times other consultants were engaged
when the required expertise was not available among the existing executives and
consultants. These included Sector Advisors to W such as Mr. R F

(Mechanical Engineering) and Mr. R B (Sales and Marketing).

The Management Services were provided to the Polish Investments from 1994 to

1997.
Legal framework of the tax system in Poland

Poland was the first country from the former Eastern Bloc to obtain full sovereignty
and independence after the collapse of the U.S.S.R. In 1989, the first non-Communist
government in Poland initiated substantial legal and economic reforms to usher

Poland’s entry into the free market.
Administrative structure

Under the regulations in force in 1996,”? the tax inspection authorities, after

performing a tax inspection, would issue an inspection report. If the taxpayer did not

s the change in the

 

procedure, they do not refer to the specific law that provides this procedure, or how or through which
instrument this law was changed to provide a new procedure.

question the inspection report within 14 days of its issuance, the document was treated
as a final decision (i.e. one that could be enforced). Otherwise, when the taxpayer
questioned the inspection report, the case was referred to the tax authorities in order
to conduct additional proceedings if necessary. In such a case, the tax authorities at
first instance (i.e. the tax office) would issue a decision based on the evidence
described in the inspection report. The taxpayer could challenge the decision before
the Tax Chamber, who could either sustain or reject the decision made by the
authorities at first instance. Finally, when the Tax Chamber sustained the decision, a
challenge could be filed before the Administrative Court. This procedure applied in

all cases where a tax inspection was instituted before 31 December 1996.

Changes regarding the tax inspection authorities took place on 1 January 1997.73
According to the new provisions, after the closure of an inspection, a tax inspector
would present a taxpayer with the documentation gathered in the course of the
inspection. The taxpayer was entitled to present objections to the documentation
within three days. The tax inspector would then issue a decision determining tax
arrears. The taxpayer could question the decision by filing an appeal before the Tax
Chamber. A decision made by the Tax Chamber could be challenged before the
Administrative Court. This procedure applied in all cases where a tax inspection was

instituted after 31 December 1996.

Before 2004, there was only one Administrative Court in Poland. The organizational
structure consisted of 12 independent branches of the Supreme Administrative Court.
Each branch exercised control and supervision over the decisions of the tax authorities
in the relevant region of Poland. In order to contest a decision by the Supreme
Administrative Court a taxpayer had to apply for its cancellation by the Supreme

Court of Poland through the Minister of Finance.

Incentives for tax inspectors

In order to motivate tax inspectors to detect tax irregularities more effectively, their
remuneration was connected to the value of the tax liabilities they determined. In
accordance with Order Number 89 of the Minister of Finance dated 24 December
1996 “Concerning the Types of Budgetary Receipts Recognized as Additional,
Manner of Their Distribution and Principles of Awarding Bonuses,” additional bank
accounts were opened where 20% of the tax determined and imposed on a taxpayer
as a result of tax decisions, was deposited. Part of these funds was distributed in the
form of bonuses to those tax inspectors who recognized and determined potential tax

irregularities.
Consequences of adverse tax decisions

A taxpayer whose tax deductible costs were disallowed by the tax authorities faced
several further tax-related consequences. First, a taxpayer whose tax arrears exceeded
a certain proportion of his tax liability immediately lost all of the investment
incentives”* to which he was otherwise entitled on account of expenditures incurred
on modernizing his enterprise. While in its non-binding guidelines the Ministry of
Finance advised the tax authorities to apply the law regarding the loss of investment
incentives leniently, binding statutory law providing for more lenient treatment with
respect to investment incentives was only officially introduced in the Corporate

Income Tax Act of 15 February 1992 (“CIT Law”) on 1 January 1999.

Second, under Article 25, Section 1.3 of the Value Added Tax and Excise Act of 8

January 1993 (“VAT Law’), input tax on costs, which were excluded from a

+ The issue of investment incentives was regulated by the resolution of the Council of Ministers of 25 January
1994 “On Deducting Investment Expenditures and Reductions from the Corporate Income Tax.” This
Resolution was repealed on 31 December 1996 although it remained in force with respect to investments made
in areas with high unemployment until 31 December 1998. New investments made after | January 1997 were
generally subject to Article 18a of the CIT Law. At the time relevant to the case, i.e. from 1994 to 1996,
investment incentives were divided into tax reliefs and tax bonuses. At the same time, the amount of
investment reliefs in one tax year could not generally exceed 25-50% of the taxable base; in 1997 the maximum
amount of investment reliefs was decreased to 40 percent; in 1998 to 35 percent; and in 1999 to 30 percent. In
addition to the investment reliefs, taxpayers were eligible for a bonus in a subsequent fiscal year amounting
to half of the investment reliefs deducted from the taxable base in the previous fiscal year.

taxpayer’s CIT-deductible costs, was automatically disallowed.

Third, the VAT Law also imposed severe financial penalties for declaring excessive
input value-added tax (“WAT”), which would happen where, for instance, input VAT
claimed was disallowed because the related costs were not allowed as CIT-deductible
costs. Between 1994 and 1996, declaring excessive input VAT resulted in an
administrative penalty up to three times the value of excess input VAT that had been
claimed. Through an amendment to the law on | January 1997, the penalty was
lowered to 30% of the difference between a taxpayer’s VAT liability as declared in
his return and his liability as assessed by the tax authorities (see Article 27, Section 5

of the VAT Law).

Fourth, Article 53a of the Tax Ordinance dated 1 January 1998 (“Tax Ordinance’’)
and Article 20 of the Tax Liabilities Act dated 19 December 1980 provided for a

severe penalty interest amounting to between 23-67% between 1994 and 2002.

Fifth, Article 173 of the Administrative Procedure Code dated 14 June 196075 (as
applicable until 31 December 2003) provided for immediate enforceability of tax
decisions by the tax authorities at the first instance regardless of any appeal having

been lodged before a higher forum.

Last, Articles 34 to 37 of the Tax Ordinance provided for the institution of a statutory
mortgage. As of 1 January 1998, a statutory mortgage could be imposed by the tax
authorities with respect to all tax arrears, including tax liabilities determined by a
decision at the first instance. For a statutory mortgage to arise, it was sufficient for the
tax authority’s decision to be delivered to the taxpayer, though to remain valid the
mortgage had to be disclosed in the land and mortgage register within one month from
the date it arose. Furthermore, the statutory mortgage was superior to any other
mortgages disclosed in the land and mortgage register, irrespective of the date of their
disclosure. There was an exception in Article 36, Section 6 of the Tax Ordinance for

bank mortgages securing long-term housing loans, which were superior to statutory

mortgages if previously disclosed in the land and mortgage register.

As a result of amendments introduced to the Tax Ordinance on 5 June 2001, for a
statutory mortgage to be effective it had to be entered into the land and mortgage
register. However, if entered into a land and mortgage register, a statutory mortgage
was still superior to any other mortgages with the exception of long-term bank loans.
The rule of superiority of the statutory mortgage was declared unconstitutional by the
Polish Constitutional Court on 26 November 2007 because it violated provisions on

legal equality and non-discrimination in the Polish Constitution.
Transfer pricing

Until 1 January 1997, the CIT Law did not provide any method for the calculation of
the cost of or income from related party transactions and simply stated that the cost of
or income from such transactions should reflect the cost of or income from similar

transactions in the local market.

On 29 April 1996, the Ministry of Finance issued guidelines on the manner and
procedure of income determination by way of estimation (“Guidelines”). These
Guidelines were published on 17 May 1996.7° The Guidelines provided the tax
authorities with rules for the estimation of income in connection with transactions
between related entities based on the “Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises and Tax Administration” issued by the OECD (“1995 OECD Report’).

The tax authorities were authorized to apply these Guidelines retrospectively.

On 1 January 1997, Article 11 of the CIT Law was amended and price calculation
methods proposed in the 1995 OECD Report with respect to transfer pricing were

introduced.

Until the end of 2000, there were no specific regulations regarding a taxpayer’s

obligation to prepare transfer pricing documents of transactions with related parties.

Taxpayers were also not able to obtain binding advice as to the application by the tax

authorities of the tax regulations regarding income assessment.
Tax proceedings in K

According to the Claimants, they expected that the costs incurred by K on the
Management Fees would be deductible costs for the purpose of calculating the tax
base on which CIT was imposed (“CIT-deductible costs”) and that the input value-

added tax would also be tax deductible.

In 1996, 1997 and 1999, the TI oO inO completed four tax
inspections regarding K tax returns for the fiscal years 1994 to 1997. These

inspections focused on the provision of the Management Services.

TheT I Oo inO disallowed the Management Fees paid by K

to W as CIT-deductible costs and as a consequence, K right to deduct VAT
in respect of these Management Fees was automatically disallowed. Following these
tax inspections, separate tax proceedings were commenced regarding CIT for the
fiscal years 1994 to 1997 and regarding VAT for the fiscal years 1995 to 1997. In
total, 7 separate tax proceedings were conducted, lasting for almost 6 years. During
the course of these proceedings, the tax authorities issued a total of 29 tax decisions,

out of which 13 were eventually quashed by the Tax Chamber.

In K case, the decisions regarding the fiscal year of 1995 were issued in
accordance with the administrative procedure provided under the regulations in force
in 1996. The tax proceedings regarding the fiscal years 1994, 1996 and 1997 were,
however, conducted under the new procedure, which came into force on 1 January

1997.
Tax proceedings regarding CIT for the fiscal year 1994

The tax inspection concerning the fiscal year 1994 was conducted during the period

from 22 April 1996 to 12 June 1997. On 16 June 1997, the record of the tax inspection

25

(“1994 Record”) was issued.”’ In the 1994 Record, theT I oO inO
claimed that the purpose of incorporating W was to create a link between K
and S r in order to transfer funds abroad. It was also alleged that the
Management Services arrangement was tailored as a disguised form of transferring

K funds abroad.

105. As such, Management Fees in the amount of PLN 5,336,200,000 were treated as not
having been incurred for the purposes of earning income and were rejected as CIT-
deductible cost.”* As a result of this tax inspection, a tax decision was issued on 10
July 1997 disallowing the Management Fees as a CIT-deductible cost.

106. K filed an appeal against this decision on 31 July 1997 before the T C
inO , in which it requested that the decision be quashed in its entirety and that its
enforcement be suspended.?? K denied the allegation that the Management
Services were not related to its revenue and that the transfer of income out of K
was for the sole purpose of transferring funds abroad. In its decision dated 14
November 1997, the T C in O upheld the decision of the Tax
Inspector.*° Based on the recommendation of A A , whose tax department
represented K in the tax proceedings (and provided K with tax advisory
services), K did not file any further appeal.*!

(2) Tax proceedings regarding CIT for the fiscal year 1995

107. The tax inspection concerning the fiscal year 1995 was conducted during the period
from 18 December 1996 to 10 June 1997. On 16 August 1997, the record of the tax
inspection was issued (“1995 Record”).*?

In the 1995 Record, the TI oO inO claimed that the Agreement
of 2 December 1994 had been arranged for the sole purpose of transferring K
funds abroad and that the Management Fees paid to W were not incurred for the

purpose of earning income.**

As a result, the Management Fees paid by K to W amounting to PLN
4,547,916.58 were disallowed as CIT-deductible costs. Consequently, K input
VAT for the fiscal year of 1995 was automatically decreased by PLN 862,077.**

Through its letter dated 31 July 1997, K wrote to the Director of the T

I Oo inO contesting the findings of the tax inspection regarding the
fiscal year of 1995 and requesting that tax proceedings be instituted before the T
Oo inB > Tax proceedings were instituted as requested* and in the course of
the proceedings, both the tax inspector and K submitted additional evidence. The
additional evidence submitted by K included letters and legal opinions by Prof.
WwW J > Mr. J P from the U B of S , Prof.
WwW M and Prof. A G

In a decision dated 14 June 1999, the T O inB rejected the amount of PLN
4,547,916.58 paid to K as Management Fees as CIT-deductible costs.37

Under Polish law it is possible to file more than one appeal from a single decision and
insofar as all appeals are filed within the time limit, the Tax Chamber is obliged to
consider all of them. On 29 and 30 June 1999, therefore, attorney-at-law A

S andA A lawyers appealed against the decision of the T

Oo in B . They sought that the decision be quashed and the case be
reconsidered on the merits on the grounds that the decision infringed procedural and

substantive law.**

In its decision dated 30 September 1999, the T C inO upheld the
decision of the T O in B . The T C acknowledged that the
Management Services could be recognized as indirect CIT-deductible costs. It,
however, decided that there was no evidence that the Management Services in

question had been actually provided.*?

On 2 November 1999, K filed a complaint against the Tax Chamber decision
before the Supreme Administrative Court in W raising procedural and
substantive objections, including that the consultants providing the Management

Services had not been heard by the tax authorities.*”

The Supreme Administrative Court in W in its decision dated 10 August 2000
upheld the decisions of the Tax Office and the Tax Chamber. The Court stated that
the tax authorities correctly recognized that the sole purpose of the agreements
concluded between K and W regarding the Management Services was to
evade the income taxes due to the State Treasury, and that “/...J if [K  ] showed
that [the Management Services] were actually performed to its benefit, the
expenditures on such performance would undoubtedly represent the tax deductible

cost.”*!

Tax proceedings regarding CIT for the fiscal year 1996

The tax inspection concerning the fiscal year 1996 was conducted during the period
from 23 May to 22 July 1997. On 25 July 1997, the record of the tax inspection (“1996

Record”) was issued.‘

Additionally, according to the instructions of the Tax Chamber in its decision dated
23 June 1999 [described in paragraph 122 below], a supplementary tax inspection was

related to the Management Services. On 1 October 1999, a supplementary tax record

(“Supplementary 1996 Record”) was issued.“

As a result of the tax inspection regarding the fiscal year 1996, a decision was issued
on 15 September 1997 (“CIT Decision 1996/1”) in which the tax inspector, Mr.
S , concluded his decision by stating that: “/...] the expenditure incurred by
[K  ] in 1996 for the purchase of the intangible services provided by[W | were
[sic] not incurred in order to generate revenue and that their sole purpose was to
transfer income (in the form of a sales commission) to the owner of a majority
shareholder [i.e., S ]...via [W and W- (U_ )j.” Consequently, the
amount of PLN 5,384,945.69 K paid to W as Management Fees in 1996 was

rejected as a CIT-deductible cost.

complaint against Chamber CIT Decision 1996/2 with the Supreme Administrative

Court in W 2°

On 15 October 1999, Mr. S issued a third decision regarding K CIT
(“CIT Decision 1996/3”). The decision was based on the Supplementary 1996 Record.
In his decision, Mr. S stated that the Agreement of 2 December 1994 and the
Annex of 3 January 1996 constituted the legal framework for the Management
Services and that K 1996 Agreements were concluded solely to “cloak” the
payments made to W in the form of a commission on sales. As a consequence, all
of the payments for the Management Services in 1996 were rejected and disallowed

as CIT-deductible cost.*°

On 2 November 1999, K appealed against CIT Decision 1996/3 to the T

Cc inO and requested that the decision be quashed insofar as it related to
the rejection of the Management Fees as K CIT-deductible costs.*! The T

and held that the Management Fees in the amount of PLN 5,522,859.74 were not CIT-
deductible costs. The T C inO stated that the expenditures for the
Management Services corresponded to a percentage of K monthly sales. It also
stated that it was apparent that all of K 1996 Agreements had been concluded
in order to conceal the percentage of fees paid to S for the supervision of
K and that the evidence that K submitted was unreliable. The T C

1996/1 which resulted in the “revival” of the first decision regarding K CIT for
1996, i.e. CIT Decision 1996/1.

In its judgment of 17 October 2001, the Administrative Court in W quashed
Chamber CIT Decision 1996/2 and Chamber CIT Decision 1996/3 on procedural

grounds.°!

Following the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court in W of 18
January 2001, the T C inO issued a decision on 28 February 2002
(“Chamber CIT Decision 1996/5’) rejecting the Management Fees as CIT-deductible
costs because in its view, the purpose of the services performed was to transfer income
toS and not to generate revenue. Consequently, K CIT obligation for

1996 was determined in the amount of PLN 12,561,679.

On 26 March 2002, K filed a complaint against Chamber CIT Decision 1996/5

before the Administrative Court in W &

On 7 November 2002, however, K decided to withdraw its complaint™ because
under Article 15 of the Act on Restructuring of Public Receivables, which came into
force on 30 August 2002, a taxpayer who wanted to have his tax arrears restructured
and cancelled together with any penalty interest due could only commence such
restructuring once his case was resolved or the appeal was withdrawn. Following
K request to withdraw the complaint, the Supreme Administrative Court in
WwW decided to discontinue the tax proceedings for the fiscal year of 1996 on 16

December 2002.

Tax proceedings regarding CIT for the fiscal year 1997

The last of K tax inspections, for the fiscal year of 1997, was conducted during
the period from 3 March to 16 November 1999. Upon its conclusion, the record of the

tax inspection for the fiscal year of 1997 (“1997 Record”) was issued.

In the 1997 Record, the TI oO inO expressed several objections
regarding the Management Fees. First, the Tax Inspection Office alleged that
S had contrived the Management Services in order to exercise strategic
control in the company instead of acting in the company’s direct interest. Second, it
maintained that some of W services had not been performed at all. Third, the tax
inspector alleged that the value of some of the Management Services was lower than
the price K had paid for them. Finally, some part of the Management Services
was alleged to be services for an investment to be launched in 1998 and was therefore
not linked to the revenues earned by K in 1997. As a result, Management Fees of

PLN 5,755,244.07 paid by K were rejected as CIT-deductible costs.

As a result of the tax inspection a decision was issued on 16 March 2000. In this
decision, the tax inspector stated that the evidence of the Management Services was
unreliable and that K had failed to sufficiently prove that the services had been
provided and were related to K revenue. As a consequence, the tax inspector
rejected all of the costs of the Management Services provided in 1997 — totalling PLN
5,735,244.07 — and disallowed them as tax deductible costs.”

On 3 April 2000, K filed an appeal against this decision before the Tax Chamber
inO 8K requested that the decision be changed or alternatively quashed and
returned for reconsideration. K argued that the tax authorities should consider the
Management Fees arrangement through the prism of the entire holding structure.
K also stated that due to the nature of the Management Services as intangible

services, the documents submitted reflected only part of the services. K further

© CE-275.
7 CE-196.

33

alleged that the tax inspector had not examined crucial witnesses who had knowledge

of the Management Services provided and their benefits to the company.

139. Through its decision of 24 November 2000, the Tax Chamber in O quashed the
16 March 2000 decision and returned the case for reconsideration, ordering the tax
inspector to further analyse the matters regarding K investment incentives. The
Tax Chamber pointed out that K had lost its right to the investment incentives as

a result of the tax liabilities imposed on the company for the fiscal year of 1996. The

Tax Chamber did not refer to K motion to admit new witnesses in its 24
November 2000 decision.
140. In accordance with the instructions of the Tax Chamber in O which were also

included in its decision of 24 November 2000, a supplementary tax inspection for
fiscal year of 1997 was conducted. On 14 May 2001, the supplementary tax record
(“Supplementary 1997 Record”) was issued. In the Supplementary 1997 Record, the
tax inspector analysed whether K had lost its investment incentives due to tax
arrears for 1996 (as K tax arrears for 1996 were finally confirmed by the Tax
Office in B in a letter of 7 March 2001) and consequently, determined K

tax arrears for 1997.

141. In the Supplementary 1997 Record, the tax inspector determined the value of
investment incentives that K took advantage of in the years from 1994 to 1996 to
be PLN 31,784,771. The loss of the investment incentives resulted in an increase in

K tax arrears for 1997 to PLN 15,084,931.

142. On 13 June 2001, the tax officer issued a second decision. The tax inspector followed
the decision of 16 March 2000 with reference to the Management Fees paid in 1997,
stating that the documentation submitted by K did not reflect the actual scope of
business operations and therefore could not constitute evidence that the Management
Services were provided. The inspector, however, accepted an amount of PLN 20,000

as the company’s CIT-deductible cost. Consequently, the tax inspector estimated that

147.

K CIT due for the fiscal year of 1997 amounted to PLN 15,084,931. As a result,
the tax arrears and the interest accrued as of 16 March 2000 amounted to PLN

14,063,198.90 and PLN 20,224,883.40 respectively.”

Through an appeal filed on 26 June 2001, K challenged this decision and sought

its suspension until the appeal was considered.”!

On 10 July 2002, the Tax Chamber partially quashed the tax inspector’s decision of
13 June 2001. The Tax Chamber also allowed K to treat an amount of PLN
100,000 as CIT-deductible cost rather than PLN 20,000 as the tax inspector had done.
It, however, held that, for the most part, the Management Services were not performed

and, consequently, the Management Fees were not CIT-deductible costs.

On 9 August 2002, K filed a complaint against the Tax Chamber’s decision before
the Supreme Administrative Court in W and asked for this decision as well as
the preceding decision of 12 June 2001 to be quashed.’? On 7 November 2002, K
withdrew the complaint and requested the Supreme Administrative Court in W

to discontinue the proceedings since this was a condition precedent for restructuring

of K tax arrears under Article 15 of the Act on Restructuring of Public
Receivables.
On 16 December 2002, the Supreme Administrative Court in W decided to

discontinue the case.”

VAT proceedings for the fiscal years 1995 to 1997

Under the VAT Law, disallowance of expenditure incurred by a VAT taxable entity
as a tax deductible cost under the CIT Law disentitles that entity from offsetting the

input VAT related to that cost against the output tax due for each month. In K

case, since the cost incurred on account of Management Fees was disallowed under

the CIT Law as a tax deductible cost it automatically created VAT arrears for K

As a result, VAT arrears and interest thereon was imposed on K . In addition,
further penalties were also imposed on K under the VAT Law. The tax authorities
in the VAT proceedings justified their decisions on the basis of assessments by the

authorities in the CIT proceedings.

Investment incentives

From 1994 to 1996, K deducted its investment expenditures from its income for
the purpose of calculating its CIT liability. The amounts deducted totalled PLN
6,489,848 for the fiscal year 1994, PLN 8,100,000 for the fiscal year 1995 and PLN
9,900,000 for the fiscal year 1996.

From 1995 to 1996, K deducted its CIT investment bonuses from its income for
the purpose of calculating its CIT liability. The amounts deducted totalled PLN
3,244,923 for the fiscal year 1995 and PLN 4,050,000 for the fiscal year 1996.

The CIT investment incentives from 1994 to 1996 amounted to PLN 31,784,771.

Through the decision of 13 June 2001 relating to K CIT liabilities for the fiscal
year 1997, the tax inspector held that K had lost its right to the investment
incentives as of 1 April 1997 on the grounds that from 1 April 1997 K liability
for the fiscal year 1996 had been outstanding as a result of CIT Decision 1996/4. As
a result, the amount of investment incentives, i.e. PLN 31,784,771, were added back
to K income for the fiscal year 1997. The tax inspector’s findings were

confirmed by the Tax Chamber in its decision of 10 July 2002.

As a consequence of these proceedings, K lost all of its investment incentives for
the fiscal years 1994 to 1996. The total amount of incentives were added back to its
income for the fiscal year 1997, which increased the income on which CIT was to be
calculated and thus, also K CIT arrears and penalty interest for the fiscal year

1997.

Tax proceedings regarding WEM

In 1998 and 1999, the Tax Inspection Office in P completed three tax
inspections relating to W tax returns for the fiscal years 1995 to 1997. The main

focus of these inspections was the Management Services providedtoW by W

The first inspection was conducted in 1998 for the fiscal year 1995. The tax inspector
issued a decision on 28 December 1998 in which she found that the true purpose of
the Management Fees was to transfer W income through W and W_ to
S and that these fees had not been incurred for the purpose of earning income.
As a result, the total amount of PLN 1,022,520.95 accrued by W on account of
Management Fees was disallowed as a CIT-deductible cost.” W challenged this
decision before the Tax Chamber in P , which issued its judgement on 20 April
1999 and quashed the decision in relation to the rejection of the Management Fees as

a CIT-deductible cost. The Tax Chamber held that indirect costs such as the

™ Claimants’ Memorial dated 8 May 2012, para. 340 (citing CE-174, 176, 178, 180, 182, 184 and 186).

Management Fees could be CIT-deductible costs and that the Management Fees had
been incurred for the purpose of earning and the tax inspector had not been able to
show otherwise. The Tax Chamber, therefore, allowed the Management Fees as a

CIT-deductible cost.”

The second inspection was also conducted in 1998 for the fiscal year 1996. The tax
inspector issued her decision on 30 December 1998 in which she disallowed the
Management Fees on the same basis as her earlier order for the fiscal year 1995. W
challenged this decision before the Tax Chamber in P , which issued its decision
on 20 April 1999, and as it did for fiscal year 1995, found the Management Fees to be
a CIT-deductible cost.””

The third inspection was conducted in 1998-1999 for the fiscal year 1997. The same
tax inspector who had earlier issued decisions for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, issued
a similar decision on 24 March 1999 for the fiscal year 1997. This decision too was
reversed by the Tax Chamber in its judgment dated 6 July 1999 in which it allowed

the Management Fees as a tax deductible cost.’

Similarly, proceedings under the VAT Law were also initiated against W for the
fiscal years 1995 to 1997 and the same tax inspector who had concluded the CIT
proceedings” disallowed the input VAT adjustment claimed by W on the
Management Services on the basis of her decisions disallowing Management Fees as
a tax deductible cost. These decisions were, however, reversed on appeal to the Tax
Chamber in P , which allowed W _ to adjust the input VAT on the Management

Services for the fiscal years 1995 to 1997.8

Tax proceedings regarding W

Ww business activity in Poland consisted of purchasing the Management Services
from Wand reselling themtoK ,W and B . The Management Fees it
collected from the Polish Investments constituted its revenue and it sought to treat the

funds paid to W as CIT-deductible costs.

Ww was also subject to a tax inspection for the fiscal year 1997. The focus of the
tax inspection was the Management Fees. The tax authorities held that the scope of
the Management Services on the basis of the agreements concluded between W and
Ww was narrower than the scope of the Management Services actually received
from W_ . The tax authorities concluded that the Management Services that were not
covered by the W Agreements were received by W from W for free and that
Ww should pay CIT on the value of the Management Services received since this
constituted additional taxable revenue. The value of this additional revenue was
determined on the basis of the market price of the Management Services, i.e. the price
at which they were resold to the Polish Investments. As a consequence, W

income was increased by PLN 3,006,700.86.

With respect to those Management Services purchased from W ___ that were covered
by the W Agreements, the tax authorities held that the Management Fees did not
result in generating revenue and therefore could not be allowed as CIT-deductible
costs. An amount of PLN 3,023,611.26 was, therefore, excluded from the CIT-

deductible costs.

The Tax Office in W issued its decision on 16 September 1999 in which it
determined W tax arrears of PLN 2,583,069 and interest thereon of PLN
1,578,855.06. W challenged this decision before the Tax Chamber in W :
which issued its decision on 20 June 2000 and quashed the decision of the Tax Office
and returned the case for reconsideration. The Tax Office, after reconsidering the
matter, issued a second decision on 25 July 2000 in which the amount of tax arrears

remained the same but the interest thereon was increased to PLN 2,477,977.

39

164. W once again challenged this decision before the Tax Chamber in W . The
Tax Chamber in its decision of 12 April 2001 held that the remuneration for the
Management Services paid by W to W_ was incurred for the purposes of
generating revenue and, therefore, the Management Fees constituted CIT-deductible
costs.*! The Tax Chamber also partially accepted W arguments with respect to
the free benefits allegedly received from W_. As a result, the amount of tax arrears
and interest thereon were decreased to PLN 691,973 and PLN 516,022.30

respectively.

165. W filed a complaint against this decision before the Supreme Administrative Court
in W . The proceedings were discontinued on 29 May 2006 because of W

dissolution.
J. Criminal proceedings

166. From the submissions of the Parties, it is the Tribunal’s understanding that under
Polish law, pre-court criminal proceedings can be divided into two phases. The first
phase, which is a fact-finding exercise, is conducted by the Public Prosecutor or by
the police under the supervision of the Public Prosecutor. This phase begins with an
order to commence criminal proceedings. The Public Prosecutor or the police then
start an investigation into whether a criminal offence may have been committed and
if so, who may have committed it. If the Public Prosecutor is of the opinion that on
the basis of facts unearthed during the first phase there is sufficient probability of a
criminal offence having been committed by an identified person, then a formal
decision for presenting charges is issued and the person is then treated as a suspect.
From that moment onward, the criminal proceedings are to be held against such person
and if his personal conduct so justifies, he may be subject to provisional measures

such as arrest or bail.

into the matter of serious material damage caused to K by its Management and
Supervisory Board members other than Mr. B and Mr. M during the
period from 1994 to 2003 (“K. Criminal Case 5”).*4 This investigation was led by
a different Prosecutor. On 19 October 2010, Mr. M was Called to testify before
the Criminal Court in O . Mr. M appeared and testified in a hearing held
from 26 to 28 October 2010. He was, thereafter, required to submit his views on the
expert opinion of Ms. S . On 11 September 2011, Mr. M submitted
his opinion and another 16-page statement to the Prosecutor explaining why the
criminal proceedings should be discontinued. A second 91-page statement was

submitted by Mr. M on 25 October 2011.

172. On 1 December 2011, the Prosecutor closed K Criminal Case 5 and on 29
December 2011 he issued a Decision on Discontinuation of the Criminal Preparatory
Proceedings in the Matter of Material Damages Caused to K by Management and
Supervisory Board Members other than Mr. B and Mr. M during the
Period From 1994-2003 (“Decision on Discontinuation”).*° In the Decision on

Discontinuation the Prosecutor noted that:

(i) The law did not provide any regulation regarding Management Services at

the relevant time and this was a new issue even for the tax authorities;

(ii) No evidence was found to prove that Management Services were not

provided; and

(iii) K had to create a financial provision for potential tax liabilities in the
amount PLN 38,000,000 which affected its financial results for 1998 and
affected its credibility, and was one of the reasons that contributed to its

bankruptcy.

While K Criminal Case 5 has been discontinued, the Prosecutor, according to the
information provided to this Tribunal by the Parties, continues to uphold the

indictment against Mr. B and Mr. M
Bankruptcy of other Polish investments

W was listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange after an initial public offering held
on 26 January 1998. The Claimants sold their shares in W in 2001. Four years
later, on 25 November 2005, however, W was declared bankrupt. Insolvency

proceedings against B were opened in 2001.
SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
Claimants

According to the Claimants, if it were not for the tax proceedings and the tax
decisions, K would not have gone bankrupt, regardless of the macroeconomic

conditions in Poland and the specific conditions of the vegetable fats industry.
The Claimants, therefore, request: 86
(i) An award declaring:

(a) That the Tribunal has jurisdiction in the present arbitration case;

(b) That the Respondent violated its obligation under Article VII(1) of the
Polish-U.S. BIT by unlawfully expropriating the Claimants’

investment in K ;

(c) That the Respondent violated its obligation under Article II(6) of the
Polish-U.S. BIT by failing to accord the Claimants fair and equitable

treatment;

Respondent

The Respondent seeks the following relief:

(i) The Tribunal declares that it lacks jurisdiction to hear this case or, in the

alternative, that the Claimants’ claims are inadmissible;

(ii) In the event that the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objections to
jurisdiction and admissibility, that the Claimants’ claims are dismissed in

their entirety on the merits; and

(iii) In any case, the Respondent be reimbursed by the Claimants for all costs
borne by the Respondent in relation to the present proceedings, including the
advances on costs of the proceedings, costs of legal representation,

translations, expert reports and other costs and expenditures.

JURISDICTION

The Respondent has raised four jurisdictional objections. The first is with regard to
the Claimant A . According to the Respondent, this company has not made or
acquired rights to any investment in Poland and therefore does not qualify as an

investor under the Treaty.

The second and third jurisdictional objections relate to the Claimants’ claim based on
the alleged irregularities in the tax proceedings and determination of tax liabilities
(“Tax Claim”). According to the Respondent, the entire Tax Claim is covered by the
tax exception provided in Article VI of the Treaty read in conjunction with Article 22
of the Poland — United States Double Tax Treaty (“DTT”) and is, therefore, outside

the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

The fourth and final jurisdictional objection relates to the Claimants’ claim based on

the criminal proceedings (“Criminal Claim’). The Respondent argues that such a

46

dispute does not fall within the definition of an investment dispute under Article IX

of the Treaty and is, therefore, outside the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal.
Jurisdictional objection 1: A standing ratione personae
The Parties’ positions

Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over A claims
because A is not an investor. The Respondent submits that on 28 December
2003, when A acquired all of the assets of W __, including the shares in K :
the bankruptcy proceedings against K were already open and the bankruptcy
administrator was in the process of selling K assets. According to the
Respondent, the value of K shares when A acquired them was basically
zero. The Respondent submits that under Assignment Agreement 2, A did not
pay any consideration to W for the shares. The Respondent points to the
Claimants’ Memorial in which the Claimants supposedly admit that “the Claimants’
investment in K lasted for approximately 6 years”*' (i.e. from 1994 to 2000),
which implies that even the Claimants did not consider K shares as an

investment after 2000.

The Respondent relies on the Claimants’ counsel’s 2009 letter to the District Court in
Ww , which in the Respondent’s view confirms that the only reason for the
continued existence of K was the continuation of the criminal proceedings against
Mr. B and Mr. M - Quoting the Claimants’ counsel, the dissolution of
K before the completion of these criminal proceedings “would further constitute
the indirect deprivation of the [American] shareholder of the right to appeal and thus

the infringement of the Treaty.”*®

8 Letter from K to the National Court Register dated 2 November 2009 (RE-142).

47

183. In support of its argument, the Respondent relies on the decision in Phoenix Action v.

Czech Republic, where it was held that:

...the fact of buying a bankrupt or inactive company must not
necessarily be disqualified as an investment, as the intent of the
investor can precisely be to make the company profitable again. The
Tribunal has initially given the benefit of doubt to the Claimant, but
now that it has refined its analysis, it must come to a different
conclusion. It is not contested by the Claimant that, at the time of the
alleged investment, when Phoenix bought the two Czech companies,
they had no activity. [...]

But a more important feature is that no activity was either launched
or tried after the alleged investment was made. [...]

The evidence indeed shows that the Claimant made an ‘investment’
not for the purpose of engaging in economic activity, but for the sole
purpose of bringing international litigation against the Czech
Republic. This alleged investment was not made in order to engage
in national economic activity, it was made solely for the purpose of
getting involved with international legal activity. The unique goal of
the ‘investment’ was to transform a pre-existing domestic dispute
into an international dispute subject to ICSID arbitration under a
bilateral investment treaty. This kind of transaction is not a bona fide
transaction and cannot be a protected investment under the ICSID
system.

184. According to the Respondent, the only difference between the Phoenix case and the
present dispute is that in the present dispute A shareholding was not

maintained for the purpose of creating an international treaty claim, but to interfere in

domestic proceedings. In either case, however, it is clear that A shareholding
inK was for the sole purpose of legal proceedings and not as an investment in
Poland.

185. The Respondent agrees with the Claimants that the test for whether an investment

exists is as set out in Salini v. Morocco. According to the Respondent, however,

A shareholding in K does not meet two of the criteria set out in the test:

(i) there was no contribution; and (ii) there was no assumption of transactional risk.

The Respondent asserts that Mr. R and S indirectly held only 16.57% of
the shareholding of K prior to its collapse in mid-2000. Out of the total equity
contribution of US$ 46.3 million made into W__ by all its partners, Mr. R and
Ss did not contribute more than US$ 10 million. Almost 50% of the
shareholding in W before mid-2000 was held by non-U.S. partners — the E

B for R and D CE ”) and a group of beneficial
owners of a Cayman Islands company, W Ltd. While
the nationality of all of the stakeholders is not known to the Respondent, it is clear
that the E , which held 34.65% of the shares in W_, was not a U.S. national and

therefore, not entitled to any protection under the B

The Respondent further avers that Mr.R = and S only acquired 75.02% of
the shareholding of K after W transferred all shares in K toA in
December 2003 for zero consideration under Assignment Agreement 2. These two
Claimants are using A as a litigation vehicle to multiply their potential gain
since the current shareholding of A inK is roughly 5 times higher than the
actual, historical equity interest that Mr.R = and S held in K at the time

the initial investment was made (and when K actually had any value).

In this regard, the Respondent relies on Mr. R statement during the hearing that
in case the Claimants prevail in this arbitration, all proceeds from the award, after
deduction of arbitration costs, would be shared pro rata between W historical
partners. By implication this would include the non-U.S. ex-partners in W who were
once entitled to almost 50% of the equity in the partnership. According to the
Respondent, this is precisely the type of scenario envisaged in a number of investment

arbitration cases”! as being abusive since it would lead to (i) the unjust enrichment of

Mr.R-~— andS (in case they do not share the proceeds with their former non-
U.S. partners in W__ ); or (ii) to the circumvention of the nationality requirement in

the BIT (in case they do share).

It

Claimants’ position

189. The Claimants reject the Respondent’s objection. First, the Claimants argue that the
transfer of W assets to A was part of the reorganization of the investors’
corporate structure, which is allowed under both the BIT and international investment
law. In this regard, the Claimants assert that Assignment Agreement 2 and
Assignment Agreement 3 were transactions between affiliated companies and
international investment law recognizes the transfer of an international investment
claim from an investor to an affiliated entity within the framework of a BIT without
any additional consent from the Respondent. The Claimants rely on Prof. S
ICSID Commentary”? and the decision in Quasar de Valores v. Russia. According
to the Claimant, the investors were entitled to set up their corporate structure in the
most efficient and convenient manner. The fact that Mr.R = andS may stand
to benefit from this corporate structure if any damages are awarded to A is not
forbidden under the Poland-U.S. BIT, particularly where this restructuring was
undertaken in good faith and as a matter of good housekeeping after K

bankruptcy.

190. Second, the Claimants argue that a change in the corporate structure would only be
forbidden if it were made for the sole purpose of creating an international investment
claim under the BIT, i.e. treaty shopping. In this case, however, the transfer was not

made for this purpose at all and, therefore, the Respondent’s reliance on the Phoenix

case” is unjustified. There the Tribunal found that an Israeli company was established
by a Czech national for the sole purpose of initiating ICSID arbitration proceedings
against the Czech Republic. In the Claimants’ view, this was confirmed by the fact
that the notification of the investment dispute to the Czech Republic occurred only
two months after the acquisition of the shares. In the present case, the transfer of
shares took place in 2003, while the Notice of Investment Dispute was filed on 20

January 2010.

191. According to the Claimants, their claim is not based on the argument that A
established its own investment in Poland in 2003, but rather on the fact that A
succeeded to all the assets, including any legal claims, of W , which had made an

investment in Poland.

192. In this regard, the Claimants assert that the only criteria to determine W position
are those stipulated in the Poland-U.S. BIT. W_ was a U.S. company under the
Poland-U.S. BIT and W always owned and controlled the investment. The Poland-
U.S. BIT does not limit its benefit to U.S. companies to the extent that they are held
by U.S. entities. As such, W corporate structure was compatible with the
requirements of the Poland-U.S. BIT. The fact that the Respondent has not sought to
rely on the denial of benefits clause under Article I(2) of the Poland-U.S. BIT only

confirms this.

193. Third, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s organs have issued numerous

decisions affirming At succession to W assets:

(i) The decision of the District Court for W dated 25 June 2007 regarding the
share distribution plan in which the court held that the agreement between W
and A for the transfer of rights and certificate of invalidation issued for
W “constitutes sufficient evidence thatW EE I was the legal

predecessor of the creditor submitting complaints to the division plan.”

° Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic (RLA-058).
°5 CE-804, p. 4.

Sl

(ii) A succession was confirmed in the decision dated 12 June 2008 issued

by the District Court in W . Based on Assignment Agreement 2 and
K collective share certificates, the court accepted A request for
authorization to convene K shareholding meeting and stated that A

“sufficiently proved that it is the shareholder of the Participant [i.e.K — .”°°

(iii) On 26 March 2009, the District Court in W appointed a custodian for

K on the basis of A application.

194. In view of these decisions, the Claimants argue that the Respondent accepted A

as W successor and cannot deny its status at this stage.
(2) The Tribunal’s analysis

195. The central question before the Tribunal in this context is: what is the legal standing
of A in this arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules? The facts

undisputed by the Parties are that:
(i) W andA are both U.S. companies.

(ii) W _ transferred its entire shareholding in K toA in 2003 through

Assignment Agreement 2 for no consideration.

(iii) At the time A acquired the shares K was effectively bankrupt.

(iv) A , therefore, did not spend any funds in Poland when it acquired the
shares in K

(v) When it acquired these shares, A was a subsidiary of W

(vi) In the same year, S acquired the entire shareholding of A from

W through Assignment Agreement 3.

(vii) The claim in the present arbitration was filed in 2010.

(viii) By transferring K ownership from W_ to A > Mr R and
S acquired a much greater ownership in K (i.e. a direct holding of
75.02%) than they originally had at the time W made the investment in K
(i.e. an indirect holding of 16.57%).

(ix) While the Respondent has challenged A standing to bring the present

claim, it does not dispute that W could have done so had it still owned K

196. The Respondent argues that in deciding A standing to bring the present claim
under the Additional Facility Rules, the Tribunal should apply the test set out in Salini
v. Morocco®” to determine whether an investment by A exists. If this test were
adopted, the Respondent concludes that A may not bring this claim since it: i)
made no investment in Poland — having acquired the shares in K for no
consideration — and ii) A assumed no risk because K was already bankrupt

in 2003 and A did not intend to revive it.

197. First, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that the so-called “Salini criteria” are merely
tools to assist in the determination of the existence of an investment for the purposes
of ICSID arbitration, and are not jurisdictional criteria. If the Tribunal had to
determine A standing to bring the claim in isolation then the Tribunal might
have been persuaded to adopt the Salini criteria to guide its analysis because in such
a case, the Tribunal would have had to first determine that it had jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the dispute (i.e. ratione materiae). In the present case, however, the
Parties do not contest the Tribunal’ s jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute.

The Parties agree that an investment has been made. The questions are whether the

investment has been made by A and whether A can bring a claim on the
basis of that investment. It is A ratione personae that the Respondent is
contesting.

Atlantic is the successor of W .W assigned all its assets, including any legal claims
relating to those assets, to A . As stated above, the Respondent does not dispute
that W would have been able to bring this clam. When W assigned the shares in
K toA A stepped into W shoes. A has brought a claim on
the basis of an investment made by its predecessor. It is the view of this Tribunal that
in such circumstances, the Salini criteria lose their relevance to determine whether an

investment has been made.

Since both Parties agree that W could have brought this claim, the question is why
cannot W successor, i.e. A , bring this claim? To this the Respondent raises
two objections. The first is that allowing A to bring this claim would amount to
an abuse of international investment law. The Respondent relies on several decisions,
including Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic,°® Caratube v. Kazakhstan’? and

Quiborax and others v. Bolivia, 100 among others.

These decisions, however, are primarily concerned with investors seeking to exercise
rights under investment treaties by way of after-the-event acquisition of assets from
non-protected investors in order to obtain BIT protection. For instance, in Phoenix
Action the Tribunal declined jurisdiction because an Israeli company was established
by a Czech national for the sole purpose of availing remedies available under the
Israel-Czech Republic Treaty. In Caratube, the Tribunal declined jurisdiction because
there was no plausible economic motive for the investor to have acquired the asset for
nominal consideration only five months after a dispute had arisen. Though it did not
base its conclusion on that ground, the Tribunal found that the evidence before it could
lead to the conclusion that “the sole rationale for Devincci Hourani’s [the investor’ s]
belated involvement in CIOC [the asset] was to invoke later the ICSID jurisdiction in

order to seek BIT protection through ICSID, which would otherwise not have been

available to either Lebanese or Kazakh investors, who would appear from the

evidence to be the real investors.”'"!

In Quiborax, the Tribunal declined jurisdiction over the claims made by one of the
claimants, whom the Tribunal found to be only a nominal shareholder who had not
paid for his share but had received it in order to comply with the minimum 3
shareholders requirement under Bolivian law. While in Quiborax, the claimant whose
claim was rejected did not acquire the asset after-the-event, he was making a claim in
his own right. His “investment,” therefore, had to satisfy the requirements of risk,

contribution and duration.

The facts of the present case are distinguishable from the cases cited by the Parties.
W andA are affiliated companies, A being a subsidiary of W_ . They
are both U.S. companies. The question of treaty shopping or a non-protected investor
acquiring assets after-the-event to create ICSID jurisdiction does not, therefore, arise
in the present context. A succeeded to W claim because W assigned all
its assets, including any legal claims relating to those assets, to A A has
brought the present claim as the successor toW_ . The facts of this case are, therefore,

distinguishable from that of the Quiborax case and the other cases referred above.

While A acquired the shares in K for no consideration in 2003 after the
company was effectively bankrupt, the Request for Arbitration was not filed until
seven years later, in 2010. The Claimants have explained the transfer as a permissible
internal corporate restructuring. The Respondent has not been able to point to any
provision in the Treaty or any principle of international law which prohibits such
restructuring. The corporate restructuring in this case appears closer to the transfer
contemplated in Quasar de Valores v. Russia, '°* where one of the claimants was

replaced by a close affiliate, rather than the decisions cited by the Respondent.

Having carefully considered the evidence tendered by the Parties, the Tribunal

concludes that there is no evidence on the record of any abuse of international

investment protection in the present case. In fact, the Respondent itself appears to
have conceded this point by admitting that “the shareholding of Atlantic has not been
intended by the Claimants to open a path to an international treaty claim, but instead
to interfere in the domestic legal proceedings in Poland.”!°? The Tribunal is,
therefore, not persuaded by and dismisses the Respondent’s first objection to the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction with regard to A

The Respondent raises a further objection relating to A standing, which
alleges that Mr. R and S are using A as a litigation vehicle to
multiply their potential financial gain since A current shareholding in K

is five times higher than the actual, historical equity interest that they had in K at
the time the initial investment was made. In the Tribunal’s view, this objection does
not affect A standing to bring a claim, it rather addresses the issue of whether
Mr.R and S will be unjustly enriched if A claim succeeds. The
Tribunal is of the view that this objection may have a bearing when it considers the
question of damages but it does not affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear A

claim.

As earlier observed by the Tribunal,! both Wand A being U.S. companies
in this case does not raise any issue of treaty shopping. The Tribunal, therefore, fails
to see how A being a Claimant would have any bearing on the nationality
requirement of the BIT. This objection of the Respondent relating to A

standing is, therefore, dismissed.

There is no dispute that W made an investment in Poland and could have brought a
claim under the BIT. W _ has assigned all its assets, including any legal claims
relating to those assets to A JA like Wis a U.S. company. In these
circumstances, this Tribunal is of the view that A. , as the successor to W_, has
made an investment in Poland for the purposes of Articles 2(a) and 4(2) of the

Additional Facility Rules.

208. In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal is of the view that A has standing to bring

the present claim and the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear it.

B. Jurisdictional objection 2: lack of jurisdiction based on partial non-

applicability of the treaty to matters of taxation

(L)_ The Parties’ positions

IP

Respondent’s position

209. The Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection arises from the language of Article

VI(2) of the Poland-U.S. BIT. Article VI reads as follows:

1. With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to
accord fairness and equity in the treatment of, and commercial
activity conducted by, nationals and companies of the other
Party.

2. Nevertheless the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular
Article IX and X, shall apply to matters of taxation only with
respect to the following:

(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article VII;
(b) transfers, pursuant to Article V; or

(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an
investment agreement or authorization as referred to in
Article IX(1)(a) or (b),

to the extent that they are not subject to the dispute settlement
provisions of a convention for the avoidance of double taxation
between the two Parties, or have been raised under such
settlement provisions and are not resolved within reasonable
period of time.
210. The Respondent also relies on the U.S. Letter of Submission and Letter of Transmittal,
which states that: “Because the United States specifically addresses tax matters in tax

treaties, this treaty generally excludes such matters, addressing them only to the

S7

211.

212.

213.

extent that they relate to expropriation, transfers, or investment authorizations, and

are not covered by the bilateral tax treaty.” !°°

The Respondent argues that the phrase “‘matters of taxation” in Article VI(2) should
be defined broadly as referring to all issues related to the process or system of
imposing and charging taxes. According to the Respondent, the entire Tax Claim, both
in general terms and with regard to each particular claim made by the Claimants, falls
within the ambit of this phrase. This would include challenges not only to the
substantive law but also to the procedural aspects of the tax proceedings, i.e. the

application and enforcement of the substantive law.

At the centre of the Tax Claim are measures taken by the Polish tax authorities to
enforce the tax liabilities of K under the CIT Law and the VAT Law. In the present
arbitration, the Claimants have challenged the legality of the specific decisions issued
by Polish tax authorities and the procedures applied by them. The entire dispute in
this arbitration is, therefore, concerned with “matters of taxation.” In this regard, the

1'°6 award is

Respondent argues that the Claimants’ reliance on the Occidenta:
misplaced. In that case, unlike the present dispute, the existence of tax liabilities or
their amount was not disputed under international law. The question there revolved
around the right of an investor to obtain a tax refund under a contractual arrangement.
Had the investor in that case challenged the existence and scope of its tax obligations
under Ecuadorian law, the Tribunal’s determination of the applicability of the tax

exemption in the Ecuador-U.S. BIT may have been different.

The Respondent points out that the Claimants’ attempt to recast the subject matter of

the dispute as “the legal c

is such a general proposition that it fails to provide any information
about the nature of the measures taken. The Respondent argues that the legal

consequences that the Claimants refer to can only be “(i) rejection of the costs

incurred by the Company as CIT-deductible expenses; (ii) determination of CIT-
arrears and late payment interest; (iii) determination of VAT-arrears and late penalty
interest, and (iv) determination of an additional tax sanction. All of these are par
excellence measures of taxation within the sense of Article VI of the Treaty.”'> As
such, the Respondent avers that the central theme of the Claimants’ claim remains the
tax proceedings. The Claimants’ entire damages claim is also built on the assertion

that but for the tax measures, K would not have become bankrupt.

According to the Respondent, the effect is that Article II(6) of the BIT, on which the
Claimants base their claims relating to fair and equitable treatment, full security and
protection and non-impairment standards, and Article IX, which establishes the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over claims under Article II, do not apply to “matters of

taxation.”

In this regard, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ position, that if the Tribunal
has jurisdiction on the basis of any one of the exceptions provided in Article VI(2)(a)
to (c) of the Treaty then the Tribunal should also have jurisdiction over all other
claims, is flawed because it would render the tax carve out in Article VI(2) of the
Treaty devoid of any meaning. The Respondent relies on the decision in Burlington
v. Ecuador, 109 Where the Tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction over the investors’
fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security and arbitrary impairment
claims by virtue of the tax exemption in Article X of the Ecuador-U.S. BIT. The
Respondent also relies on EnCana v. Ecuador,'!° where the tax exemption provision
in the treaty was interpreted as a complete bar to all of the investors’ claims except

the one for expropriation.

The Respondent also disagrees with the Claimants’ argument that this Tribunal would
have jurisdiction to hear a claim based on violation of the fair and equitable standard

because Article VI(2) of the BIT recognizes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction with respect

to claims under the expropriation provision (Article VII) and in turn Article VII refers
to Article II, which includes both the fair and equitable standard and the full protection

and security standard.

According to the Respondent, Article VII(1) of the BIT only provides guidance to the
extent that the legality of any expropriation should be decided in accordance with “due
process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(6).”
An expropriation carried out in violation of the fair and equitable standard would be
illegal under Article VII. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal must first find that
there was an expropriation before it can determine whether that expropriation was
legal or illegal under Article II(6). Such a determination would, in any case, only be
relevant at the time of quantifying damages — for instance, the Tribunal may award

greater damages for an unlawful expropriation as opposed to a lawful expropriation.

The Respondent also denies the Claimants’ argument that concerted and orchestrated
actions were taken by a number of organs of the Respondent all of which targeted
K and the transfer of Management Fees. According to the Respondent, the
Claimants have argued that the tax nature of the measures was only a cover and that
the Respondent’s organs abused the tax laws in order to accomplish an internationally
wrongful act. The Respondent argues that whether or not the actions of various organs
were concerted or orchestrated is irrelevant. Such an argument cannot be used to
circumvent the jurisdictional limitation in Article VI(2) of the Treaty. More
importantly, the Claimants’ theory of concerted action is incorrect as the Claimants
have not been able to show any evidence in support of their claim. The Respondent

further argues that the following factors confirm that there was no concerted action:

(i) | The lack of a common aim or motivation is disproved by the Claimants’ own
reliance on the system of bonuses obtained by tax officers as motivation for their
actions against . The Claimants’ reliance presupposes that each of these
individuals actually pursued his or her own agenda, motivated solely by greed

and the opportunity to earn a greater bonus — not any common aim. Prof.

60

' also shows that the tax officers in

G Witness Expert Opinion'!
Opole were not greedy individuals lacking in professional and moral integrity,
but simply that they were overzealous and excessively formulistic in their

approach.

(ii) The lack of an orchestrator is confirmed by the Claimants’ failure to cite any
person or body who was pulling the strings or exerting influence on the course

of events.

(iii) Finally, the lack of any effect on the Claimants is confirmed by the following

facts:

(i) the criminal investigation did not lead to presentation of any
charges to the Claimants and it has been discontinued in 2011; (ii)
the Claimants were able to secure favourable decisions in P >
with respecttoW ,andinW , with respecttoW _ ; (iii) the
tax authorities in B and in O never pushed hard for
enforcement of the Company’s tax arrears, and the tax authorities
are one of the most considerable debtors of the bankruptcy estate of
the Company; (iv) the Respondent agreed to restructure the
Company’s tax arrears and forgive some 95 % of the tax debt; (v)
on a number of occasions, enforceability of tax decisions was
suspended, or (vi) charges for non-material services received by the
Company were held to be CIT-deductible expenses, always when
proven by the Company.!!?

219. The Respondent also disputes the Claimants’ contention that the present dispute
relates to the enforcement or observance of an investment agreement in terms of
Article IX(1)(a) and VI(2)(c) of the Treaty. The Respondent argues that the
Privatization Agreement was neither an investment agreement as that term is used in
the Treaty nor does the present dispute concern the enforcement or observance of its
terms. Furthermore, the Respondent avers that the Privatization Agreement provides
its own dispute resolution clause, which the Claimants would have had to resort to

first.!'5

220. The Respondent contends that the Privatization Agreement is simply a contract for
the sale of shares of a state-owned company. It does not impose any requirements on
the Respondent, which can be characterized as continuing “observance” or
“enforcement” obligations that extend beyond the close of the transaction. It did not
entitle the Claimants to any rights beyond the sale of shares. The Privatization
Agreement cannot, therefore, be termed as an “investment agreement” for the

purposes of the Treaty. In this regard, the Respondent relies on Prof. Vandevelde’s

14

treatise on investment agreements * where he states that such agreements exclude

ordinary commercial contracts. The Respondent also relies on Joy Mining v. Egypt,

where it was held that:

The Tribunal is also mindful that if a distinction is not drawn
between ordinary sales contracts, even if complex, and an
investment, the result would be that any sales or procurement
contract involving a State agency would qualify as an investment.
International contracts are today a central feature of international
trade and have stimulated far reaching developments in the
governing law, among them the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, and significant
conceptual contributions. Yet, those contracts are not investment
contracts, except in exceptional circumstances, and are to be kept
separate and distinct for the sake of a stable legal order. Otherwise,
what difference would there be with the many State contracts that
are submitted every day to international arbitration in connection
with contractual performance, at such bodies as the International
Chamber of Commerce and the London Court of International
Arbitration?'"°

221. According to the Respondent, the mere fact that the Privatization Agreement
authorized the sale of shares and also operated to effectuate that transfer does not
convert a contract for the sale of shares into an investment agreement under the Treaty.
Relying on the definition of “investment agreement” in the 2004 U.S. Model BIT, the
Respondent argues that such agreements are characterized by a significant investment,

their long term horizon and their functional utility to the Host State in terms of natural

resources, public services or infrastructure projects. The Privatization Agreement does

not fulfil these criteria.

Even assuming that the Privatization Agreement was an investment agreement, the
present dispute relates neither to the application nor interpretation of this agreement
as required under Article IX(1)(a), nor does it concern the observance or enforcement
of any term of this agreement as required under Article VI(2) of the BIT. The
Respondent argues that the Privatization Agreement imposed no continuing
contractual obligation on the Respondent such that there could be any case for
observing or enforcing any term thereof. Likewise, the present dispute does not
concern the Claimants’ exercise of any contractual right under the Privatization

Agreement.

The Respondent contends that to the extent that the Claimants contend that the
Respondent’s questioning of the Management Services amounts to questioning the
proper discharge of the contractual duties of the Claimants under the Privatization

Agreement, it is incorrect for the following reasons:

(i) The Respondent does not allege that the Claimants breached the
Privatization Agreement. Even if the provision of Management Services
could have entailed transfer of know-how as provided in the Privatization
Agreement, a failure to provide the Management Services is not a violation
of the Privatization Agreement since these services could have been
provided by appointment of non-Polish managers to the Management of the

Supervisory Board of K

(ii) The Respondent is not taking the position that no Management Services were
provided. Some Management Services were no doubt provided. This was
also the position of the tax authorities. This is, however, irrelevant for the
present dispute since the Respondent’s position is that the tax decisions were
correct as a matter of both Polish and international law. The Tribunal is

seised of the legality of these decisions as a matter of international law, not

63

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

with a determination of whether the Claimants discharged their obligations

under the Privatization Agreement.

The Claimants’ claim is based on a domestic tax law dispute.

The connection between the Management Fees and the Privatization
Agreement was only invented in November 1998, 2 years after the tax
inspections had begun and at a time when K was losing the tax battle.
This argument was recognized as new and characterized as unconvincing by

K own counsel, A A

During the meeting the possible link between the services
performed by W and the Privatization agreement (in
particular paragraphs 5 and 6) was discussed. In our
opinion, referring to the privatisation agreement as to the
basis for services rendered byW __ is unlikely to strengthen
N B position in the litigation. The provisions of
this agreement cannot be directly connected with consulting
and advisory services as the agreement does not oblige
Ss Cc Cc and W to perform
services for N BCG

If the Claimants’ argument were to be upheld, it would allow a person to
circumvent the jurisdictional limitations in Article VI(2) of the Treaty simply
by raising a point of interpretation of an investment agreement, even if it was

secondary and ancillary to the actual issue in the case.

Finally, neither of the Parties has sought any relief in relation to the

Privatization Agreement.

b. Claimants’ position

224. The Claimants argue that the present dispute does not relate to “matters of taxation”

as that phrase is used in Article VI(2) of the Treaty. The Respondent has mistakenly

64

225.

226.

labelled the Claimants’ submissions as a “Tax Claim’ and then sought to create an

artificial distinction between the “Tax Claim” and the “Criminal Claim.”

According to the Claimants, the challenge is to “the legal consequences of the
Management Services’ treatment by the Respondent leading to the collapse of
K _ .”!!7 That, according to them, is the subject of the dispute. As such, the present
dispute is concerned with the legal consequences and cumulative effects of the acts of
the Respondent’s agents consisting of (i) questioning the Claimants’ right to obtain a
fair equivalent for the Management Services rendered to K under the Privatization
Agreement; and (ii) questioning K right to tax benefits related to the
Management Fees under Polish tax law. In this regard the Claimants place reliance on
the Occidental''® award where the Tribunal assumed jurisdiction on the basis of the
connection between the dispute and the contract between a foreign investor and
Ecuador (and not on the basis of the investor invoking any contractual rights as

wrongly alleged by the Respondent).
While the Claimants admit that they question various substantive laws such as:

(i) the introduction on January 1, 1998 into the Polish tax system
of the immediate enforceability of the tax decisions upon their
issuance;

(ii) the lack of transparency of the Polish transfer pricing rules;

(iii) the lack of transparency of the Polish tax system;

(iv) _ the retroactive application of the Guidelines;

(v) the introduction of the regulations into the Polish tax system
in 2002 which discouraged K _ from appealing against the
tax decisions before the administrative courts...''°

 

 

According to the Claimants, these issues would, in any case, have to be considered by
the Tribunal as relevant elements of the statement of facts, even if they were not

challenged as violations of the Treaty.

According to the Claimants, Article VI(1) of the BIT, imposes an obligation on the
Respondent “to strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of

and commercial activity conducted by, nationals and companies of the other party”!

with respect to its tax policies. The decisions in Enron’?! and Occidental'** were cited
to argue that this was not a meaningless reference and imposes an obligation on the
State similar to the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment. The Claimants
submit that this means that if the dispute involves any of the elements described in
Article VI(2)(a) to (c), then it will fall within the purview of the BIT and will be

subject to its dispute settlement mechanism.

The Claimants further argue that even if the present dispute concerned “matters of
taxation,” all the exceptions in Article VI(2)(a) to (c) of the BIT are applicable. The
present dispute relates to (i) transfer pursuant to Article V of the Treaty; and (ii)
observance and enforcement of an investment agreement in terms of Article IX(1)(a)
of the Treaty as envisaged under Article VI(2)(c) of the Treaty. According to the
Claimants, the Privatization Agreement is an investment agreement in terms of Article
TX(1)(a) and its claims under the Treaty are related to the observance and enforcement

of the Privatization Agreement.

The Claimants contend that share purchase agreements such as the Privatization
Agreement are investment agreements since they create a long-term economic
relationship with a Host State. The Privatization Agreement was entered into between
a U.S. company and Poland. This factor itself distinguishes the present dispute from

the Burlington!”

case, where the Tribunal declined jurisdiction because the relevant
contracts were not investment agreements since they were entered into by

Burlington’s subsidiaries, which were not nationals or companies of the U.S.

In the Claimants’ view, the Joy Mining'** case, referred to by the Respondent, is also
distinguishable from the present dispute since there the Tribunal was dealing with the
distinction between long-term projects, which qualify as an investment under Article
25 of the ICSID Convention, and typical sales contracts, which may be subject to the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. As
opposed to this, the Privatization Agreement created a long-term relationship between

Poland and the Claimants.

The Claimants also argue that the Privatization Agreement constitutes an investment
agreement because it imposes significant investment obligations on the Claimants
such as investing substantial funds in K _; providing know-how and technology;
creating training programs for management and employees; and developing exports.
The long-term nature of the investment was recognized in the Privatization Agreement

itself; it was not a one-off deal as alleged by the Respondent.

According to the Claimants, Article VI(2)(c) of the Treaty refers to the “observance
and enforcement” of an investment agreement. This phrase has a broad meaning and
is used in an identical manner in Article X of the Ecuador-U.S. BIT. The Spanish
equivalent of this phrase, i.e. “observancia y el cumplimiento,” suggests a broader
scope of this exception than that proposed by the Respondent. !”> The Claimants rely
on the Tribunal’s decision in EnCana v. Ecuador, where even though the Tribunal
declined jurisdiction on the basis of Article XIII(c) of the Canada-Ecuador BIT, it

observed that

.. there are significant differences between the BIT applicable in the
present case and that which fell to be applied by the tribunal in the
Occidental case. The Ecuador-U.S. BIT, Article X, also contains a
taxation exception but it is in different terms to Article XII of the
Canada-Ecuador BIT; in particular, Article X(2)(c) of the Ecuador-
U.S. BIT allows claims relating to taxation provided they are claims
with respect to ‘the observance and enforcement of terms of an
investment Agreement’. Moreover, under Article VI(1) of the

124 Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt, para. 58 (RLA-074).
!25 The Claimants note that a narrow interpretation was proposed in the Canada-Ecuador BIT and the Panama-

U.S. BIT, which contain the more restrictive phrase

“cumplimiento y ejecucion,” or the Argentina-U.S. BIT,

which contains the phrase “la observancia y el cumplimiento imperativo.”

67

233.

Ecuador-U.S. BIT, jurisdiction is conferred on arbitral tribunals in
relation to ‘investment disputes between a Party and a national or
company of the other Party’ which arise out of or relate to ‘an
investment agreement between that Party and such national or
company’. In the Occidental case, although the claimant had not
invoked any claims of breach of contract or relied on contract-based
rights as such (...) the tribunal held that ‘because of the relationship
of the dispute with the observance and enforcement of the investment
contract involved in this case, it has jurisdiction to consider the
dispute in connection with the merits insofar as a tax matter covered
by Article X may be concerned. '*6
The Claimants, therefore, argue that the present dispute concerns the observance and

enforcement of an investment agreement.

The Claimants submit that, assuming that the exceptions in Article VI(2)(a) to (c) are
applicable to the present dispute, the Tribunal should accept jurisdiction over all of
the Claimants’ claims, including those based on violation of fair and equitable
treatment, full treatment and security, non-impairment standard and free transfer of
payments (the “Gateway Theory”). According to the Claimant, the Gateway Theory

finds support in the language of Article VI(2) and investment arbitration practice.

The Claimants distinguish the case of Burlington relied on by the Respondent on the
grounds that in that case, the Tribunal expressly recognized that when a claim
concerning “matters of taxation” relates to the observance or enforcement of an
investment agreement, it would fall under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as a separate
claim.'?” According to the Claimants, this decision actually supports the Claimants’
position. The Claimants also rely on the award in the Occidental v. Ecuador'® case
to the effect that if a BIT claim relates to the observance or enforcement of an
investment agreement (Article X(2)(c) of the Ecuador-U.S. BIT), the construction of

the taxation carve-out allows the Tribunal to assume jurisdiction over other claims.

126 EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador, footnote 119 (CE-823 and RLA-016); Claimants’ Reply
Memorial, para. 562. The Claimants note that the above peculiarity of the Spanish version of the Ecuador-
U.S. BIT was noted by the English appellate court in the Occidental case (where the court observed that the
Spanish term “cumplimiento” more naturally translates as “performance” or “fulfillment’).

The use of the phrase “in particular” in Article VI(2) of the Treaty clarifies that other
provisions of the Treaty, apart from Articles IX and X, shall apply to “matters of
taxation.” The Claimants submit that in cases where tribunals have rejected the
Gateway Theory, the taxation carve-out provision has been differently worded from
Article VI(2) of the Treaty. For instance, Article XII(1) of the Canada-Ecuador BIT
at issue in EnCana v. Ecuador states that “nothing in this Agreement shall apply to
taxation measures.” '”° Similarly, in the Nations Energy v. Panama case, Article XI
of the Panama-U:S. BIT, which was at issue, states that “this Treaty shall apply to the

taxation matters exclusively with respect to the following...”'*°

The Claimant submits that if this Tribunal finds that the present dispute concerns the
observance and enforcement of an investment agreement, then “the provisions of this
Treaty, and in particular Article IX and X, shall apply,” i.e. all the standards including
those of fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security and non-impairment
will be applicable, and the Tribunal would have jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims if

any of these standards was violated.
The Tribunal’s analysis

The Parties have primarily focussed their arguments on the interpretation of paragraph

(2) of Article VI of the Treaty. The Tribunal will, therefore, examine this issue first.
Article VI of the BIT provides:

(1) With respect to its tax policies, each party should strive to accord
fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of, and commercial
activity conducted by, nationals and companies of the other party.

(2) Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Articles IX
and X, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the
following:

a) expropriation pursuant to Article VI;
b) transfers, pursuant to Article V; or

c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an
investment agreement or authorization as referred to in
Article IX (1) (a) or (b);

to the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of
a convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two
Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are
not resolved within a reasonable period of time.

240. In the Tribunal’s reading, Article VI(2) provides that in relation to “matters of

taxation” an investor may only bring claims if they fulfil two conditions:

(i) | The claims are based on one of the exceptions stated in the paragraph, i.e.
the claim is either based on the BIT’s expropriation or transfer provision, or
relates to the observance and enforcement of the terms of an investment

agreement; and

(ii) The claims are not subject to the dispute settlement mechanism in any double
taxation treaty between the two State Parties to the BIT or have been raised
under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable

period of time.

241. The first question the Tribunal has to address is whether the present dispute relates to
“matters of taxation.” The second question is whether the Claimants’ claims fulfil
condition (i) above. Since these two questions have been raised in the jurisdictional
objection under consideration, the Tribunal has addressed these here. The third
question — whether the Claimants’ claims fulfil condition (ii) above — has been argued
in relation to the Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection and is, therefore, not
addressed in detail here. The Tribunal has accordingly addressed this question in its

determination of the Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection.

Article VI (2) - matters of taxation

IP

242. The Claimants have sought to frame the present dispute as relating to “the legal

consequences of the Management Services treatment by the Respondent leading to the

70

243.

244.

collapse of K _ .”'3! They contend that the former takes their dispute outside the
scope of Article VI(2) of the Treaty and that this jurisdictional objection is without
merit. The Claimants argue that there is a distinction between “matters of taxation”
and “the legal consequences of the Respondent’s treatment of Management Services.”
According to the Claimants, the latter relates to the cumulative effects of the
Respondent’s agents (i) questioning the Claimants’ right to obtain fair compensation
for the Management Services to K as required under the Privatization Agreement;

and (ii) denying K the tax benefits related to the Management Services.

Even assuming that the Claimants’ submissions are correct, at its core each of their
claims relate to the treatment of the costs associated with the Management Services.
In the Tribunal’s view, all issues in the present dispute stem from it. While the
Claimants refer to actions and developments in the criminal proceedings, they did not
introduce any expert in relation to these proceedings. The Claimants’ experts have not
taken the view that the criminal proceedings caused K collapse. The Claimants’
damage theory also does not regard the criminal proceedings as contributing to the
collapse of K —_. The Claimants acknowledge that the criminal proceedings were
conducted in a fact-finding phase and did not personally involve the Claimants. When
charges were eventually brought, those were aimed at and resulted in the detention of
two Polish officers of K and not of any U.S. national. In the view of the majority
of this Tribunal, the references to actions and developments in the criminal

proceedings, do not change the nature of the dispute.

The term “matters of taxation” is not a defined term in the Treaty. Applying the
principles set forth in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, it must be
interpreted “in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the
treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.” *? Even if this term
were to be narrowly construed, the Tribunal fails to see how disallowing the

deductions claimed by an assessee when calculating its tax is not a matter of taxation.

Very broadly and generally stated, an assessee declares its gross income and lists its
expenses. Its net income is the gross income minus expenses. The net income is
subject to tax. The tax authorities have to satisfy themselves that the gross income has
been correctly stated — that nothing has been concealed. Once that is done, the tax
authorities proceed to examine whether the stated expenses have been incurred, i.e.
they are genuine. If the tax authorities are not satisfied that the expenses are genuine,
they can call upon the assessee to prove that these were incurred. If the assessee fails
to satisfy them, the tax authorities exclude the expenses from consideration. As a

result the net income and, consequently, the tax payable increases.

The consequences of a tax authority disputing the genuineness of an expense and
being dissatisfied by the evidence submitted by the assessee to establish that the
expense was incurred would be that the expense would be disallowed, the net income
would increase and the assessee would have to pay higher taxes than it originally
contemplated. This is what happened here. The tax authorities disputed that the
Management Services had been provided. They asked for supporting evidence. They
were not satisfied with the record provided to them. The authorities subsequently
disallowed the expense. The amount of K net income increased. And so did the

tax payable by the K

The legal consequence of the Respondent’s treatment of the Management Services
was an increase in the amount of K tax. The tax authorities sought to collect the
increased amount. The tax authorities had to scrutinise the expenses claimed. They
had to determine whether there is evidence to support the claim. These tasks lie at the
heart of the tax assessing and collecting function of a revenue authority. In the
Tribunal’s view, this essentially is what assessment and collection of tax is all about.
In an effort to distinguish their claims from “matters of taxation,” the Claimants have
underplayed the significance of their challenge to the Respondent’s substantive tax
laws. The Claimants admitted that while they were calling certain laws in question,
“these issues would necessarily be subject to the Tribunal’s consideration as relevant

elements of the statement of facts even if they had not been challenged as being in

breach of the Polish-U.S. BIT.” '? In fact “the Claimants submit that all of their claims
do not concern ‘matters of taxation’ and are not subject to Article VI of the Polish-

U.S. BIT’ 4 (emphasis supplied).

The reason for this may have been that the Claimants wanted to distinguish the case
of Burlington v. Ecuador.'> The Tribunal in that case interpreted Article X of the
U.S.-Ecuador Treaty. It found that the investor’s challenge to a particular Ecuadorian
law was within the ordinary meaning of the phrase “matters of taxation” and therefore,

its claims were limited to the exceptions specified in Article X(2).

The Claimants’ rely on the decision in Occidental'* to argue that even if at first glance
the dispute appears to relate to taxation, on closer inspection the tax itself is not at
dispute. The Claimants’ reliance in this context is, however, misplaced. In Occidental,
the Tribunal, while interpreting Article X in the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, which is identical
to Article VI of the Poland-U.S. BIT, held that “because of the relationship of the
dispute with the observance and enforcement of the Investment Contract involved in
this case, it has jurisdiction to consider the dispute in connection with the merits
insofar as a tax matter covered by Article X may be concerned.”'?’ While the
Occidental Tribunal observed that it had jurisdiction to hear the matter under Article
X on other grounds, it ultimately decided to hear the claim on the ground that the
dispute fell squarely within one of the exceptions in Article X (i.e. the observance and
enforcement of an investment contract) and not on the ground that it did not relate to

a matter of taxation.

The Tribunal concludes that the present dispute involves “matters of taxation” for the
purposes of Article VI(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal, however, concludes by majority
that its jurisdiction is, therefore, limited to the exceptions listed in Article VI(2)(a)-

(c).

Article VI(2)(a) and (b

In the view of the majority of this Tribunal, since it has determined that the present
dispute involves a matter of taxation, it has jurisdiction only over the Claimants’ claim
for expropriation pursuant to Article VII of the BIT and the Claimants’ claim relating

to transfers pursuant to Article V of the BIT.

Article VI(2)(c

The Claimants further argue that the dispute relates to the observance and enforcement
of terms of an investment agreement as referred to in Article IX(1)(a) or (b) of the
BIT, and that the Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction under the exception listed in

Article VI(2)(c).

The Claimants consider that the investment agreement for the purposes of Article
VI(2) is the Privatization Agreement. In the Claimants’ view, a failure by the
Respondent to observe and enforce the terms of the Privatisation Agreement would
permit the Claimant to invoke the dispute resolution provisions of the BIT. It is
contended that this would also permit the Claimant to bring claims based on the

violation of other provisions of the BIT.

This line of argument raises two distinct issues. The first is whether the Privatization
Agreement constitutes an investment agreement. The second is whether the present

dispute relates to the observance or enforcement of the Privatization Agreement.

The Respondent has sought to characterize the Privatization Agreement as an ordinary
commercial contract for the sale and purchase of shares rather than an investment
agreement. The term “investment” is defined in Article I of the BIT and includes an
investment in “a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company.”
Through the Privatization Agreement, S agreed to acquire 55% of the shares of
K from the Polish State Treasury for US$ 18,782,500; i.e. S agreed to and
made an investment in Poland by acquiring “shares of stock...in a company.” The
Tribunal, therefore, accepts that the Privatization Agreement is an investment

agreement for the purposes of Article VI of the BIT.

74

256. This leads us to examine whether the present dispute relates to the observance and
enforcement of the Privatization Agreement. The Claimants have argued that (i) they
were required to provide Management Services to K under the terms of the
Privatization Agreement;'** and (ii) under the Privatization Agreement they had a
legitimate expectation that if such Management Services were provided in good faith,
the Claimants would receive fair compensation for such services. In other words, if
the Privatization Agreement contained any such requirement or guarantee, then the
actions of the tax authorities in relation to the Management Services would constitute
a breach of the Privatization Agreement, and hence, the Claimants argue that the
dispute would concern the “observance and enforcement” of this agreement, which in

turn would trigger the exception in Article VI(2)(c) of the BIT.

257. The issue is whether the Respondent breached any obligation under the Privatization
Agreement when its agents disallowed the Management Fees deductions claimed by
K for calculating its corporate income tax.'*? Even assuming that (i) the
Privatization Agreement required the Claimants to provide Management Services to
K __ ,'#° and (ii) the Privatization Agreement guaranteed the Claimants a fair return
for the Management Services, '*! the Claimants have failed to refer to any provision
of the Privatization Agreement which guarantees that K would be allowed to
deduct any such costs for the purpose of calculating its corporate income tax. Indeed,

the Privatization Agreement does not contain any such assurance or guarantee.

138 In particular, under Article VI, Section 6(1) and Article VII, Section 4(1).

13° The VAT issue is directly linked to the corporate income tax issue, since if a cost is not deductible for the
purpose of calculating CIT, under Polish law, the input tax on it cannot be adjusted for VAT purposes.

40 The Articles of the Privatization Agreement referred to by the Claimants only relate to the transfer of
intellectual property such as trademarks and technology and organizing training programs for employees and
not to consulting services like the Management Services.

K own tax advisor, A A , ina letter dated 3 November 1999 stated that “Jn our opinion
referring to the privatization agreement as to the basis for services rendered by W__ is unlikely to strengthen
N B position in the litigation. The provisions of this agreement cannot be directly connected with
consulting and advisory services as the agreement does not oblige S Cc Cc and W

to perform services for N B __ . It has to be stated that under paragraph 6 of the agreement the Buyer is
obliged only to make available i.e. to transfer to N B the rights or right to use its patents, trademarks,
know-how and other intellectual property rights, i.e. there is no relation to consulting and management
services provided by W  ” (emphasis supplied) (RE-154).

141 Again, no term of the Privatization Agreement provides such an assurance or guarantee.

If the Claimants’ argument that the present dispute relates to the observance and
enforcement of the Privatization Agreement were to be accepted, then any action by
the Respondent that affected K profits (for instance by increasing the tax
payable by it) and therefore, diminished its ability to pay for the Management Services
would concern the observance and enforcement of the Privatization Agreement and
trigger the exception provided for in Article VI(2)(c) of the BIT. The Tribunal, by
majority, sees no reason to interpret the Privatization Agreement in this manner. The
majority, is of the view that the present dispute does not concern the observance or
enforcement of an investment agreement. Hence it concludes that the exception listed

in Article VI(2)(c) is not applicable to the present case.

Claimants’ argument for an extended scope of Article VI(2

The matter, however, does not end here. The Claimants submit that even if their claims
are subject to Article VI(2), the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is not restricted to the
exceptions specified in Article VI(2). The Claimants raise three arguments in support

of this view.

The Claimants’ first argument — the Gateway Theory — is that because the opening
words of Article VI(2) provide that “the provisions of this BIT and in particular
Article IX and X apply” to “matters of taxation,” if the Claimants can demonstrate
that their claims fall within any of the exceptions (a) to (c) of Article VI(2), they can
also invoke the other provisions of the BIT to support their claims, and not just the

ones explicitly listed in Article VI(2). This argument would in effect mean that

(1) With respect to its tax policies, each party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the

treatment of investment of, and commercial activity conducted by, nationals and companies of the
other party.

(2) Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Articles IX and X, shall apply to
matters of taxation only with respect to the following:
a) expropriation pursuant to Article VII;
b) transfers, pursuant to Article V; or
c) — the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorization as
referred to in Article IX (1) (a) or (b);
to the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a convention for the
avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised under such settlement
provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable period of time.

76

although “matters of taxation,” with certain exceptions, are carved out of the BIT by
Article VI(2), once an investor can demonstrate that its claim falls within one of the
exceptions to the carve-out, for instance, expropriation, it can raise claims based on
other violations of the BIT such as fair and equitable treatment or full protection and
security. Effectively, if the investor succeeds in showing that he has a claim for
expropriation (or a claim based on any of the other exceptions), then he can bring

claims based on violations of other provisions of the BIT.

In the Tribunal’s view, the BIT provides a number of protections to the investor and
imposes corresponding mandatory obligations for a Host State. For a breach of any of
these the investor can invoke, against the Host State, the dispute resolution mechanism
of the BIT. In “matters of taxation,” however, the dispute resolution mechanism of
the BIT can be invoked for the breach of not all but a specified number of protections.
The Gateway Theory argument seeks to persuade the Tribunal to hold that if the
Claimants can demonstrate a breach of one of the specified protections, then it opens
the gate for the Claimants to maintain claims for any or all of the other substantive

protections as well.

In the view of the majority of this Tribunal, this argument seeks to place on the BIT a
construction which would result in Article VI(2) ceasing to be a carve-out provision.
It would be transformed into a provision that provides a mere sequential order for the
arguments of a claimant. Once a claim is found to fall within any one of the exceptions
to Article VI(2) and succeeds, then all other claims even outside the list of exceptions
fall within a tribunal’s jurisdiction, dependent on the success of the first. The claim
within the list of exceptions merely has to be the first. The rest would follow. It is the
view of the majority of this Tribunal that such an interpretation would deviate from
the plain meaning of the BIT and place upon its words an unnatural and strained

construction.

The Tribunal, by majority, considers that the meaning of Article VI(2) is plain. It is a
carve-out provision. Its purpose is to limit the BIT protections in “matters of taxation”

to a few specified categories. The BIT, while offering a number of protections to the

77

264.

265.

266.

investors, limited these to “matters of taxation.” The language of the BIT makes it
clear that in such matters its dispute resolution provisions cannot be invoked by the

investor except in the case of a few specified categories.

The Gateway Theory would have the Tribunal go around these limits. There is nothing
in the language of the BIT, the context in which this language has been used, the
objects and purposes of the BIT and the surrounding circumstances, which requires

Article VI(2) to be interpreted in this broad manner.

Such an interpretation would also be contrary to the ordinary meaning of the words of
Article VI(2) of the BIT and repugnant to Article 31 of the VCLT. The Tribunal is not

persuaded to take this course.

The next argument advanced by the Claimants is that Article VII,'*? which deals with
expropriation, contains a reference to Article II(6), 144 Which deals inter alia with fair

and equitable treatment and full protection and security. The Claimants argue that if

‘43 Article VII reads:

1. Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through
measures to exprop or i ("expropriation") except for a public
purpose, in a nondiscriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation, and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of
treatment provided for in Article II (6). Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market
value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or
became publicly known, whichever is earlier; be paid without delay; include interest at a
commercially reasonable rate, such as LIBOR plus an appropriate margin, from the date of
xpropriation; be fully realizable; be freely transfé and on the basis of the
prevailing market rate of exchange for commercial transactions on the date of expropriation.
2. A national or company of either Party that asserts that all or part of its investment has been
expropriated shall have a right to prompt review by the appropriate judicial or administrative
authorities of the other Party to determine whether any such expropriation has occurred and, if
so, whether such expropriation, and any compensation therefor, conforms to the provisions of
this Treaty and to principles of international law.
3. Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the
other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency,
insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded nondiscriminatory
treatment by such other Party as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.

 

    

44 Article II(6) reads:

Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection
and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international
law. Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary and discriminatory measures the

use, enj ion or disposal of
investments. Each Party shall observe any ‘obligation it may have entered into with regard to
investments.

 

 

78

267.

268.

an investor can demonstrate that it has a claim related to “matters of taxation” based
on the expropriation provision then it can also bring independent claims based on a

violation of Article II(6) of the BIT.

The Tribunal notes that Article VII of the BIT aims at protecting an investor from its
investment being expropriated by the Host State. It further requires that for such an
expropriatory measure to be lawful, such measure (i) must be for a “public purpose,”
(ii) must be taken in a “non-discriminatory” manner, (iii) upon “payment of prompt,
adequate and effective compensation,” and (iv) “in accordance with due process of
law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II (6).” It is the
understanding of the majority of this Tribunal that the reference in Article VII to all
these criteria, including those of Article II(6), is to lay down a minimum standard to
which such expropriatory action must conform. As such if the Tribunal finds that there
has been an expropriation, it must be then determine whether such expropriation
conformed to the standards described in Article VII, including the requirement that
the expropriation be in accordance with the due process of law and meet the fair and
equitable standard set out in Article II(6). A failure to observe any one or more of
these requirements would make the Host State liable for damages in relation to the
expropriation. These requirements, however, only come into play if and when there is
a determination that there has been an expropriation and not otherwise. This, in view

of the majority of this Tribunal, is the purpose of the reference.

The reference to Article II(6) in Article VII, in the view of the majority of this
Tribunal, does not mean that the investor can also, for instance, bring a claim for a
breach of the fair and equitable treatment protection in respect of a matter of taxation.
Such an interpretation would make the Article VI(2) carve-out from the dispute
resolution provisions of the BIT meaningless. It is also difficult to see the object and
purpose of creating such an express carve-out in Article VI(2), if all these protections
could simply be brought in through the back door by such interpretative contrivances.

Such a reading of Articles VII and II(6) would render Article VI(2) otiose.

79

N

. The majority of this Tribunal, therefore, does not agree with the Claimants’ argument

regarding the expanded scope of Article VI(2).

Claimants’ argument regarding Article VIC

. The Claimants’ main focus in their argument has been on Article VI(2) of the Treaty.
The Claimants maintain that on its stand-alone interpretation, as well as when reading
it with other articles of the Treaty, the Claimants are not limited to pursuing their

claims for treaty violations only on the exceptions listed in Article VI(2).

. The Claimants have, however, pleaded facts that can form the basis of an argument
that the Respondent violated its obligations (assuming that there are any obligations)
under Article VI(1) of the BIT and that, therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear
this dispute under Article VI(1) of the BIT.

. Article VI(1) of the BIT has been referred to by the Claimants in:
(1) Claimants’ Memorial paragraph 114.'+
(2) Claimants’ Memorial paragraphs 988 to 992; and

(3) Claimants’ Memorial paragraph 970. 4°

When one reads this paragraph it is apparent that the reference here to Article VI(1) of the BIT is a
typographical error. Article VI(1) deals with “Taxation.” The entire discussion in paragraph 1 14 is with regard
to “Compensation for Expropriation” which is dealt with in Article VII of the BIT. All the “prerequisites for
lawful expropriation” mentioned in paragraph 114 are listed in Article VII(1) and not Article VI(1) of the BIT.
Paragraph 114 of the Claimants’ Memorial reads:

None of the prerequisites for lawful expropriation which are stipulated in Article VI(1) of the
Polish-U.S. BIT were fulfilled by the Respondent:
(i) the Respondent did not provide any public purpose which would justify its conduct - on
the contrary, numerous agents of the Respondent confirmed that the collapse of K
would be detrimental to the public interest;
(ii) the Respondent also violated the basic principles of due process of law, including
violating the Investor's right to defense and carrying out several arbitral measures
throughout the proceedings which amount to a denial of justice;
(iii) the Respondent also discriminated K by treating it very differently from Wand
W _ , in virtually identical circumstances and without the Respondent's authorities
providing any justification for that discrimination; and
(iv) the Respondent did not pay any compensation or offer to pay any compensation to the
Claimants for the unlawful expropriation of K

'46 Claimants specifically deny that they are challenging the law.

80

(4) There is no reference to Article VI(1) in the Claimants’ Reply Memorial or

the Post-Hearing Brief.

273. Asummary of the facts considered relevant by the Claimants is provided in paragraph

213 of their Memorial:

(i) Polish transfer pricing regulations were not properly adjusted to
the needs of a developing economy; (ii) the Polish system offered
incentives to tax officials which led to abuses of authority, i.e., the
so-called “bounty system”; (iti) the Polish system of administrative
courts was based on one-instance jurisdiction which in fact caused
infringements of due process of law; (iv) there were legal
mechanisms in Poland that strongly discouraged taxpayers from
appealing against tax decisions; (v) there were legal mechanisms in
Poland that disproportionately compounded the tax arrears
established by tax decisions, i.e., the so-called “snowball effect” ;
(vi) there were legal mechanisms in Poland that could cause a
complete loss or significant reduction of a_ taxpayer’s
creditworthiness in cases of minor tax arrears; and (vii) the Polish
system of tax administration did not provide sufficient protection
from incompetence by the tax authorities or from arbitrariness of
their decisions.

274. The Claimants then provide a detailed description of each of these facts.'47 All of
these facts relate to the legal framework under which corporate income tax and value
added tax was administered and enforced in Poland. The Claimants stated that the
purpose in pleading these facts was to give the Tribunal a “better understanding of

2148,

the issues’ and to set out “some of peculiarities of Polish law which contributed to

the Respondent’s measures which ultimately led to the collapse of K — .”'*°

275. In their pleadings on the merits of their claim, the Claimants argue that some elements
of this legal framework violate the provisions of the BIT. For instance, the Claimants

submit that:

(iv)

The principles of due process were violated by the retroactive application of
the Guidelines relating to transfer pricing, which were issued on 29 April
1996,!°°

The Respondent’s obligation to provide a stable and predictable framework
for investment, which is a component of the FET standard, was violated by
the retroactive application of the Guidelines and by the introduction of a
bounty system in December 1996.!°!

The Respondent violated its obligation to act transparently, under the Fair
and Equitable Treatment standard, by enforcing confusing tax regulations,
which did not provide adequate information regarding a taxpayer’s
obligations relating to transfer pricing. '°*

The Respondent violated its obligation to provide full protection and security
by introducing mechanisms that discouraged taxpayers appealing decisions

of tax authorities before administrative courts!

and by introducing, in
January 1998, a system which provided for automatic enforcement of the

decisions of tax authorities regardless of the filing of any appeal.!*4

276. Even though the Claimants argue that some elements of the legal framework in Poland

violated various protections under the BIT, they do not argue anywhere that either (i)

these elements constitute “tax policies” as that term is used in Article VI(1) of the

BIT; nor do they argue that (ii) these elements violate the Respondent’s obligations

under Article VI(1) of the BIT. In fact, the Claimants go so far as to clarify that “their
claims...are not subject to Article VI of the Polish-U.S. BIT.”'>°

277. Paragraph (1) of Article VI of the BIT requires each State Party to strive to accord

fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of and commercial activity

conducted by nationals of the other State Party. The following paragraph (i.e. Article

VI(2)) begins with the word “Nevertheless.” It then states that the provisions of the

BIT, and in particular Articles [IX and X, shall apply to “matters of taxation” only with
respect to expropriation, transfers and the observance and enforcement of an
investment agreement or authorisation. And that too to the extent that they are not

subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a double taxation treaty.

The ordinary lexical meaning of the word “Nevertheless” is “in spite of that” or
“notwithstanding.” This Tribunal is, therefore, by majority, of the view that paragraph
(2) applies notwithstanding or in spite of what is stated in paragraph (1). Where the
two paragraphs cover the same ground, paragraph (2), therefore, has to be read either

as an exception to or as overriding paragraph (1).

A different reading would result in the Tribunal assuming jurisdiction in a case of
unfair or inequitable conduct by the State in a matter of taxation under Article VI(1)
in spite of such jurisdiction being excluded by Article VI(2). That would either make
paragraph (2) redundant, or subordinate it to paragraph (1). Such an interpretation

would be contrary to the express language of the BIT.

This issue has been considered by other ICSID tribunals. The Nations Tribunal, when
interpreting a similar provision in the U.S.-Panama BIT, held that “the Claimants’
doctrine, pursuant to which Article XI.1 would allow the Arbitral Tribunal to declare
itself as competent with respect to a claim based on a possible unfair and inequitable
treatment of the State in taxation matters, would leave the exception thus provided
for, ineffective.” °°

The Occidental Tribunal, in the context of that case, did not have to address the
distinction between “tax policies” and “matters of taxation” as those terms are used
in Article VI(1) and VI(2) of the US-Ecuador BIT. The expression “tax policies,” like
the expression “matters of taxation,” is not defined in the BIT and therefore, must be

given its ordinary meaning.

Had there been no difference between the expressions “tax policies” and “matters of
taxation,” the Poland-U.S. BIT would have used identical language in both
paragraphs. A different choice of words suggests that the two expressions and hence

the two paragraphs were intended to have different meanings.

The line between “matters of taxation” and “tax policies” is not easy to draw. This
Tribunal has already noted the view of the Burlington Tribunal,!>’ that the investor’s
challenge to a particular Ecuadorian law was within the ordinary meaning of the
phrase “matters of taxation” and therefore, its claims were limited to the exceptions

specified in Article X(2) of the U.S-Ecuador BIT.

Taxation has three aspects. Levy of taxes, assessment of taxes and collection of taxes.
In the view of this Tribunal, tax policies relate to the general framework under which
taxes are levied. A claim that the State, as a matter of policy, has levied a tax in breach
of its FET obligations under the BIT would arguably fall under Article VI(1) of the
BIT. The claimant in such a case must not only demonstrate that the levy under
challenge merely affects it adversely but also that the law levying the tax was the
result of a tax policy of the Host State to treat the foreign investor in an unfair or
inequitable manner or to deny it the protections of the BIT. “Matters of taxation,” on
the other hand, relate to assessment and collection of taxes (i.e. the implementation of
the tax laws) and to claims about a substantive law affecting an investor adversely. It
is the view of this Tribunal that tax legislation which is not the product of a tax policy
of the Host State to deny BIT protections to investors is a matter of taxation and not

tax policy. Article VI(2) and not Article VI(1) of the BIT would, therefore, apply.

There is yet another aspect of the matter. Given the language of Article VI(1) of the
BIT, a question arises whether it creates such an obligation for the State that in case
of the State’s failure to observe this obligation, an investor would have the right to

8

commence an investor-State arbitration. In the Nations'** case a similar clause —

Article XI — in the U.S.-Panama Treaty was the subject of interpretation. The Nations

Tribunal held that Article XI(1) of the U.S-Panama BIT was couched in prescriptive
language (“‘shall strive to grant”), which did not impose a mandatory obligation on
the State, and the language in Article XI(2) (“however, this Treaty shall apply to
taxation matters exclusively with respect to”), created an exception to Article XI(1).
This meant that paragraph (1) of Article XI of the U.S-Panama BIT was outside the

framework of those obligations of the State which could be enforced by investors.

The language of Article VI(1) of this Treaty: “should strive to accord...” is similar to
Article XI(1) of the U.S.-Panama Treaty: “shall strive to grant.” Likewise, the
language of Article XI(2) of the U.S.-Panama Treaty: “however, this Treaty shall
apply to taxation matters exclusively with respect to...” is similar to that of Article
VI(2): “Nevertheless the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Articles IX and

X, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to...”

It is the view of the majority of this Tribunal that the language of Article VI(1) of the
BIT, like that of Article XI(1) of the U.S.-Panama Treaty is prescriptive and directory.
When the language of Article VI(1) is contrasted with the language used in Article
VI(2), it is clear that it does not impose a mandatory obligation on the State, which

can be enforced by invoking the dispute settlement mechanism of the BIT.

The Claimants’ claims in this arbitration focus on the cumulative effect of the actions
of the Respondent’s agents, primarily in the form of tax proceedings, which resulted
in the disallowance of deductions for the Management Fees paidbyK __. As already
held by the majority of this Tribunal, the Claimants’ claims, therefore, fall within the
ordinary meaning of the phrase “matters of taxation” and, therefore, do not fall under
Article VI(1) which relates to tax policies. Even if this was otherwise and they fell
under Article VI(1), the conclusion of the majority would remain unchanged as it is
of the view that Article VI(1) does not create a mandatory obligation for the State and,

therefore, would not give rise to a BIT claim.

In conclusion, the Tribunal, by majority, is of the view that:

(iii) | The Claimants’ claims relating to expropriation and transfers fall within

of the DTT
The Parties’ positions

Respondent’s position

With respect to the claim based on expropriation, impairment of transfers or
observance/enforcement of the Privatization Agreement, the Respondent argues that
the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants did not resort to the “dispute
settlement provisions of a convention for the avoidance of double taxation” before

initiating this arbitration as required under Article VI(2) of the BIT.

According to the Respondent, Article 22 of the DTT provides a dispute settlement
mechanism, of which the Claimants were obliged to avail. Article 22 of the DTT
provides that:

States, present his case to the competent authority of the
Contracting State of which he is a resident or citizen.

 

(2) The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection
appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an
appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with
the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view
to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention.

(3) The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall
endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts
arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention.
They may also consult together for the elimination of double
taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.

(4) The competent authorities of the Contracting States may
communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching
an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.

(5) In the event that the competent authorities reach such an
agreement, taxes shall be imposed on such income in accordance
with the agreement. Notwithstanding any procedural rule (including
statutes of limitations) applicable under the law of either
Contracting State, refund or credit of taxes shall be allowed, as
appropriate, by the Contracting States in accordance with such
agreement.

The Respondent argues that Article 22 of the DTT provides the mechanism for the
settlement of tax disputes under the DTT. The reference in Article VI(2) of the Treaty

to “the dispute settlement provisions of a convention for the avoidance of double

taxation,” therefore, must be read as reference to Article 22 of the DTT.

The Respondent points out that Article 22 of the DTT corresponds to Article 25 of
both the U.S. and U.N. model tax conventions. A leading commentary on Article 25

of the U.N. model convention states that:

[T]axation contrary to the Convention may occur as a result of (i)
wrong interpretation or application of the DTC, i.e., of the rules of
an international treaty, (ii) of a faulty application of domestic law if
DTC law refers to the latter or if domestic law is an element of the

 

87

294.

295.

296.

circumstances (facts) to which DTC law is applied, or (iii) of

incorrect determinations of the facts involved.!°?
The Respondent submits that two of these three bases relate to the application of
domestic law to a particular set of facts or allegations that there has been an incorrect
determination of facts. According to the Respondent, the central part of the present
dispute is the application of income tax laws which is covered under the DTT. As
such, the Respondent argues that the assessment and appreciation of facts that
underpin a tax proceeding is precisely one of the kind of matters that falls within the

ambit of the mutual agreement procedure.

The Respondent argues that the repatriation by the Claimants of the benefits of their
investment was covered under the DTT. The Claimants structured their operations in
such a way that from 8 November 1994 onwards, W _ earned taxable income from

K under two distinct heads:

(i) | As Management Fees calculated at 1.25% and then at 1.5% of the monthly sales
of K ;and

(ii) As dividends from the company’s net profit.

The Respondent argues that the Management Fees are covered under Articles 8, 13 or
15 of the DTT. Dividends are covered under Article 11 of the DTT. Both of these
payments are different forms of repatriation of funds. In 1994, before W was
formed, the Management Services were provided directly byW__. After the formation
of W __, it operated as a pass-through vehicle. It had neither the personnel nor the
capacity to provide the Management Services. The Respondent relied on the opinion
of its legal expert, Prof. P , that with respect to pass-through companies,

international law may disregard them as separate entities.' According to the

'59 Klaus Vogel, Klaus Vogel on Double Taxation Conventions, Third Ed., Kluwer Law International (1999),
p. 1354 (RLA-077).

Respondent, the entire corporate structure involving W was created in order to

reap the benefits of the DTT.'*!

In the Respondent’s view, W was both the beneficial owner of the dividends from
K , pursuant to the instrument of the W trust, and the
beneficiary of the Management Fees. The tax treatment of the Management Fees
directly affected the amount of dividends to which W _ was entitled. Dividends were
to be paid out of the net profits of K _, i.e. the gross profits after deduction of CIT.
The tax authorities’ refusal to allow deduction of the Management Fees for the
purposes of calculating CIT reduced the net profits available for distribution of

dividends.

The Claimants have themselves contended that “their freedom to transfer was violated
by the improper application of the tax law which resulted in K being deprived of
the right to calculate, collect and freely transfer the Management Fees to its U.S.
contractors. In addition, the Respondent’s actions tainted the Management Fees
arrangements and, thereby, made them impossible to collect.”'®? According to the
Respondent, the Claimants’ argument that their right to transfer funds was violated by
the tax measures is precisely the type of taxation matter, which falls within the ambit

of the DTT.

In this context, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ argument that they were
not subject to taxation in Poland and the tax proceedings concerned a dispute between
K and the tax authorities as opposed to the Claimants is misplaced since it
contradicts their own claim based on Article V of the Treaty — to which the DTT in

the Respondent’s view clearly applies.

As such, according to the Respondent, if the Tribunal found that the exercise of
taxation powers by the Respondent in relation to the Management Fees was an

internationally wrongful act, and it proceeded to examine how that act affected the

302.

Claimants freedom of transfer under Article V of the Treaty, it would have to apply
Article 11 of the DTT. The Tribunal would then have to consider whether the act was
justifiable under the DTT. This is precisely the situation contemplated in Article 22(1)

of the DTT and triggers the mutual agreement procedure embedded therein.

Moreover, according to the Respondent, apart from the Claimants’ argument relating
to the violation of Article V of the Treaty, which directly invokes the Treaty, the
OECD’s Commentaries on the Articles of the Model Tax Convention clarify that the
dispute settlement procedure is applicable even in the absence of issues involving any
double taxation — “/t/he mutual agreement procedure is also applicable in the
absence of any double taxation contrary to the Convention, once the taxation in
dispute is in direct contravention of a rule in the Convention.”'® Article 22 of the
DTT conforms to this since the phrase “taxation not in accordance with the
Convention” is not qualified in any other manner. The Claimants argue that they do
not claim any violation of the DTT and, therefore, the present dispute is not covered
by the mutual agreement procedure. The Respondent contends that this argument
finds no support in the language of Articles VI(2) or IX(1) of the BIT, neither of which
gives the Claimants the right to decide which issues of taxation will be subject to the
DTT. A dispute relating to the legality of the refusal to allow tax deductions for the
Management Fees has a direct impact on taxable income and is a dispute relating to
the alleged actions of a Contracting State that result in taxation not in accordance with

the DTT.

As to whether the mutual agreement procedure under Article 22(1) of the DTT could
be regarded as an effective remedy precluding access to international investment

arbitration in accordance with Article VI of the Treaty, the Respondent submits that:

(i) There is no rule of international law which requires a State to consent to the
jurisdiction of an investment treaty tribunal for each and every type of
investment treaty dispute. As such where a treaty provides that the

jurisdiction of an investment treaty tribunal is subject to an investor availing

"68 OECD, Commentaries on the Articles of the Model Tax Convention (2010), p. 356 (RLA-108).

90

303.

the dispute settlement mechanism under a tax treaty, this does not imply that

the dispute settlement mechanism must be ineffective.

(ii) At the time the Treaty was entered into, the concept of arbitration without
privity had yet to be established and the wave of investment treaty
arbitrations had yet to come. At that time, dispute settlement mechanisms

under tax treaties were better established and had a longer track record.

(iii) The lack of record of publicly known cases resolved through such a
mechanism is a result of such disputes being resolved on an inter-
governmental basis and, therefore, not being widely reported. According to
the Respondent, the widespread use of mutual agreement procedures and
their incorporation in the model tax conventions of both the United Nations
and the OECD suggest that there is a global consensus that such procedures

are useful.

(iv) Such procedures have been shown to work, most notably in the case of
Feldman v. Mexico,'™ where the procedure was used before the arbitration
commenced and resulted in one of the claims not being pursued before the

NAFTA Tribunal.

The Respondent further contends that the U.S. tax authorities had jurisdiction in the
matter and, therefore, the mutual agreement procedure could have been invoked. The
Respondent places particular reliance on the memorandum from A A to
Ny from September 1994.'® This Memorandum discusses the applicability of
the DTT to the Claimants’ investment in Poland in the context of W as a pass-
through vehicle and the participation exemption under the DTT. It further
contemplates the qualification of W holdings in Poland as Controlling Foreign

Corporations by the Internal Revenue Service of the U.S. (“IRS”). As such, at the

relevant time, the Claimants’ tax advisors had no doubt that the DTT applied to the

W spartners, including S

According to the Respondent, the Claimants did not resort to the mutual agreement

procedure because

...eligible tax residents of the United States — i.e. W_ L.P. or its
partners — would have had to come to the IRS and, most likely,
disclose this entire scheme: undocumented consulting services,
allegedly performed by friends and relatives, in consideration for
hundreds of thousands of US dollars, the Cayman Islands trust and
the Cayman Islands company set up to allow investors in W to
avoid paying taxes in the United States, and false evidence,
fabricated with active participation of a U.S. national, Mr.

Cc A , and submitted to the Polish tax authorities by

the Company.'°°

The Respondent argues that the W partners probably chose not to apply to the U.S.
authorities under the mutual agreement procedure because these authorities would
have had personal jurisdiction over them and their assets and may not have looked
leniently upon the tax structures at issue in the present case. According to the
Respondent, the failure to resort to the mutual agreement procedure also reflects on
the bona fides and clean hands of the Claimants. Had the Claimants had clean hands
and proper files documenting the Management Services in B , as they claimed,
there would have no better authority to understand their position and advocate their

position before the Polish tax authorities than the IRS.

If the Tribunal is of the view that the tax treatment of the Management Fees by the
Polish tax authorities had an impact on the taxation of W Polish revenues in
accordance with the DTT, then the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection should be

upheld.

Claimants’ position

The Claimants argue that the DTT has no application to the present dispute. In order
to interpret the terms of the DTT, it is important to take into account the purpose of
the DTT. According to the Claimants it is commonly accepted that the purpose of such
treaties is to protect taxpayers against double taxation. Double taxation occurs if all

of the following requirements are met:

(i) | Taxes are imposed in at least two countries;

(ii) Taxes are imposed on the taxpayer;

(iii) The same economic activity is subject to taxation;

(iv) There is similarity between the tax imposed; and

(v) | The taxes are imposed for the same tax periods.

In the Claimants’ view, in the present case double taxation would only occur if income
tax were imposed on K profits for the fiscal years 1994 to 1997 in both Poland
and the U.S. Since K was only subject to taxation in Poland, there is no question
of double taxation here. Moreover, the Claimants argue that the DTT only applies to
direct taxes such as income tax and not indirect taxes such as VAT, which are also at

issue here.

The Claimants submit that since they were not subject to taxation in Poland and the
tax proceedings concerned a dispute between K and the tax authorities, as opposed

to the Claimants and the tax authorities, the DTT is not applicable to the Claimants.

Even assuming that the DTT were applicable, the Claimants argue that the scope of
the mutual agreement procedure only covers violations by a domestic tax provision of
a provision of the DTT. In the present case, the Claimants are not claiming any
violation of the DTT. The present dispute, therefore, would not be covered by the

mutual agreement procedure.

The Tribunal’s analysis

This issue, like the Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection, also revolves around
the interpretation of Article VI(2) of the BIT. As stated above, Article VI(2) is a carve-
out provision and provides that in relation to “matters of taxation” an investor may
only bring claims which fulfil two conditions: (i) they are based on one of the
exceptions described in the Article, that is claims based on expropriation, transfers or
the observance and enforcement of the terms of an investment agreement; and (ii) are
not subject to the dispute settlement mechanism in any double taxation treaty between
the two States or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are not

resolved within a reasonable period of time .

Before the Tribunal can adjudicate on such claims that fulfil condition (i) above, the
Claimants also have to show that their claims are not hit by condition (ii) above, i.e.
they are not subject to the dispute settlement mechanism in any double taxation treaty
between the two States or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are
not resolved within a reasonable period of time. In this case, such a treaty exists
between the U.S. and Poland. It is undisputed that the present dispute has not been
raised under the dispute settlement provision of a DTT and hence the second
alternative in condition (ii) is not applicable. As such, the Tribunal’s analysis will
focus on whether the present dispute falls within the scope of the dispute settlement

mechanism of the DTT.

Article 22 of the DTT allows a resident of one Contracting State to invoke the dispute
settlement mechanism if the actions of one or both Contracting States will result in
taxation not in accordance with the DTT. The Respondent has correctly pointed out
that the central issue in this case relates to the deductibility of costs for the purposes
of calculating corporate income tax and the DTT is applicable to income tax. While
an issue relating to corporate income tax can certainly be raised under Article 22 of
the DTT, the Tribunal has to determine if the present dispute relating to corporate

income tax could have been raised under Article 22.

94

314.

315.

316.

317.

To raise a dispute under the DTT, the taxation complained of must be “not in
accordance with this Convention.” The Claimants, however, have not raised any
argument that they are being taxed in contravention of the provisions of the DTT. The
Respondent, on the other hand, pointed out that the Management Services are covered
under Articles 8, 11, 13 and 15 of DTT. The Tribunal will address the Respondent’s

points in turn below.

Article 8 of the DTT deals with business profits and sub-article (3) provides that in
determining the profits of a business, deductions for expenses incurred for the
purposes of the business shall be allowed. The Respondent, however, has stated that
the present dispute is not whether Management Services were in fact provided, but
whether K adequately documented the provision of the Management Services for
the purposes of claiming deductions. Article 8(3), while recognizing the right to claim
deductions, does not exempt a business from fulfilling the legal requirements for
claiming such deductions under domestic law. Accepting the Respondent’s own
formulation of the dispute, the Tribunal finds that Article 8 has no relevance in the

present circumstances.

Article 13 of the DDT deals with royalties. In the Tribunal’s view, there is no issue of
royalties being paid to or by anyone in this case and therefore, Article 13 of the DDT

has no application to the present dispute.

Article 15 of the DDT relates to personal services, such as the Management Services.
Article 15 of the DDT, however, only deals with the taxation of income derived from
the provision of such services. The present dispute is not concerned with taxation of
the income received from the provision of Management Services; it is concerned with
the treatment of the expenses incurred by K in paying for the Management
Services. The Tribunal finds that Article 15 of the DDT, therefore, also does not apply
to the present dispute. As such, while the Respondent is right that Articles 8 and 15 of
the DDT may cover some aspects of the Management Services, these Articles do not

cover the present dispute relating to the deductibility of the Management Fees.

a

1.

In the alternative, the Respondent has sought to frame the present dispute as one of
repatriation of funds by arguing that the treatment of the Management Fees paid by
K directly affected the dividends to which W_ was entitled. Since the payment
of dividends is covered under Article 11 of the DTT, the Respondent argues that the
present dispute falls within the scope of the DTT. In this regard, the Respondent relies
on the Claimants’ contention that their freedom to transfer was violated by the
improper application of Polish tax law, resulting in K being deprived of its right

to freely transfer the Management Fees outside Poland.

The Claimants’ claim that their freedom to transfer funds was violated because they
could not freely transfer the Management Fees is, however, very different from the
taxation of dividends covered under Article 11 of the DDT. Such a claim is not
covered under Article 11. While the Respondent submits that the dispute relating to
the transfer of funds is exactly the kind of dispute covered under the DTT, it fails to
point out any provision other than Article 11 of the DDT, which covers such a dispute.
Unless the transfer of funds is covered by a specific provision of the DTT, any
limitation on such a transfer will not be in contravention of the provisions of the DTT
and therefore, not subject to the dispute settlement mechanism set out in Article 22 of

the DDT.

In conclusion, the Tribunal is of the view that the dispute raised by the Claimants is

not covered under the DTT and is not subject to its dispute settlement clause.

Jurisdictional objection 4: scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in relation to the

criminal proceedings
The Parties’ positions

Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ claims based on developments relating to
the criminal proceedings in Poland after the bankruptcy of K _, such as the detention
of Mr. B and Mr. M in December 2006, cannot give rise to an

investment dispute within the meaning of Article IX of the Treaty because they (i)

96

322.

occurred after the Claimants had already lost their investment; and (ii) relate to

measures taken against individuals who do not fall under the definition of investors

under the Treaty.

In support of its argument that measures taken against individuals who do not fall

under the definition of investors under the Treaty cannot give rise to a Treaty claim,

the Respondent relies on the decision in Rompetrol v. Romania.'©’ While in that case

the Tribunal concluded that the conduct of criminal proceedings against the

employees and managers of an investor could be the subject of a Treaty claim, this

conclusion was qualified:

()

(ii)

(iii)

In that case the criminal proceedings took place during the life of the investment.
Here the question is whether this Tribunal’s jurisdiction extends to acts against
local managers after the investment is lost. An investment dispute cannot

emerge after the investment is lost.

The Rompetrol Tribunal concluded that the Host State’s conduct had to have a
sufficient link to the investment or investors to fall under the BIT. In that case
the State took invasive measures including arresting the company’s directors,
thereby depriving it of management, and blocking its shares, thereby affecting
investment. In the present case no such measures were adopted. The criminal
proceedings prior to 2006 were limited to fact-finding proceedings (i.e. in rem
proceedings). It was only in 2006 that charges were brought against two
individuals. By this time it had been six years since K had fallen into

technical bankruptcy. These proceedings could not have had any effect on it.

Finally, in relation to allegations of criminal misconduct against the managers

of the investors in their individual capacity, the Rompetrol Tribunal held that

[i]f there have been breaches of Mr. Patriciu’s or Mr. Stephenson’s
[two non-Dutch managers of the Dutch claimant] procedural rights
in the course of the criminal investigation process, of a kind that
could conceivably fall within the scope of ‘denial of justice’ (or its

'61 The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award of 6 May 2013 (RLA-097).

97

equivalent, in the case of Mr. Patriciu), then — even if those breaches
are duly established — they do not and cannot, in and of themselves,
constitute valid BIT claims at the instance of TRG. The rights so
breached would be personal rights of the individuals under
investigation. For their breach to entail a valid BIT claim would
require a separate investigation into their direct or indirect effect
on the investments of TRG itself in Romania, and into whether that
effect did or did not amount to a failure to respect the protections
guaranteed to TRG, as a foreign investor, under the BIT. But that
would be an investigation of a qualitatively different kind, applying
a potentially different standard, namely that laid down by the
relevant provisions of the BIT, properly interpreted and then applied
to the facts of the case. The position is no different if (as is indeed
alleged by the Claimant in certain respects) the interests of TRG
itself became incidentally caught up in steps taken in the criminal
investigations against Mr. Patriciu or Mr. Stephenson.'®

323. The Respondent further points out that the Expert Report of Dr. Z ,!© which is
the central piece of evidence on which the Claimants rely to establish a causal link
between the actions of the Respondent and the insolvency of K —_, makes no mention
of the criminal proceedings. Similarly, Dr. Z supplemental opinion does not,
apart from a single conclusion not based on any evidence, refer to the role of the
criminal proceedings.'"” The Respondent also points out that Prof. S

opinion makes no reference to the criminal proceedings.!7!

According to the
Claimants’ own damage theory and their expert reports, therefore, none of the acts of
the Polish criminal authorities before mid-2000 contributed to the collapse of K

facts as alleged were proven, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction unless they would lead

to a breach of the Treaty or to any damages.

the conduct of the tax proceedings, these proceedings too would fall within “matters

of taxation” for the purposes of Article VI(2) of the Treaty according to the

Respondent.

The Respondent in this respect relies on the Nations Energy v. Panama" case for the

following reasons:

()

(ii)

In that case the Tribunal interpreted a provision similar to Article VI(2) of the
Treaty and declined to exercise jurisdiction over a claim relating to Panama’s
refusal to treat certain tax credits as transferable in the context of a bond
operation by the Claimants. The Tribunal took the view that the claim related to

a matter of taxation.!4

The Tribunal also dealt with the Claimants’ argument that the impugned acts of
the State had consequences beyond mere fiscal measures and that actions of
other non-tax organs, such as the judiciary, were also at issue. The Tribunal
concluded that the fact that the challenged acts had consequences beyond
taxation did not alter the basic nature of the dispute, which related to “matters
of taxation.” According to the Tribunal, it could not decide the Claimants’ claim

without first determining the propriety of the tax measures. !7>

Claimants’ position

326. The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection in relation to the

Criminal Claim should be rejected for the following reasons:

(a) The K Criminal Proceedings was de facto directed
against the Claimants;

(b) The K Criminal Proceedings was related to the
Claimants’ investment in K :

(d) The K Criminal Proceedings started before the collapse

While the Claimants do not seriously dispute that, from a strict formal perspective,
the criminal proceedings were not conducted personally against the Claimants and the
investigation was conducted in a fact-finding phase, they submit that the list of
potential suspects in K Criminal Case 5 included the “former managers” of K

In his Decision of Discontinuation of 1 December 2011, the Prosecutor listed the
potential suspects in the investigation. These included members of K

Supervisory Board such as Mr.R — and Mr. M 7

The Claimants submit that the conduct of the criminal authorities in the K

Criminal Proceedings was an integral part of the acts of the Respondent, which
violated the Treaty. The tax and criminal proceedings were interrelated. The
Respondent’s representatives conducting both proceedings relied on each other’s

statements, particularly in relation to the provision of the Management Services.
In this regard, the Claimants rely on the following documents:

(a) the correspondence between the District Prosecutor in
oO and the Appellate Prosecutor in W , dated April
5, 2005. The correspondence described instigation in 1997
of the criminal proceedings in respect of the alleged
“economically groundless transfer” of K funds
abroad which allegedly took place from November 1994 to
December 1996. In the correspondence, the Prosecutor
alleged that: “(...)W = E I P SP. 20.0.
started its actions aimed at transferring as much money as
possible from the plant in B ” (emphasis added). Further,
the Prosecutor stated: “The companies from B
acquired strategic blocks of shares in another two privatized
companies, that is “B T R "S.A. in

investor took actions justifying assumption that they were
intending to transfer capital from these companies in a
similar way”;

Ms. B testimony during the K Criminal
Proceedings, dated December 12, 1997, who was an
employee of the Tax Inspection Office in B who took part
inK tax proceedings. According to the testimony given
to the police upon the District Prosecutor in O request:
“the purpose of paying for the services rendered by W in
favor of N S.A. was only to transfer income in the form
of the commission on sale — to the majority shareholder of
the block of shares of the inspected company, i.e. S

Cc Cc inB through the company W

in W and W in B - the
concealing of the fact of paying the commission on sale in
favor of W inW ”(emphasis added).

The Prosecutor’s letter to the General Tax Inspector dated
March 7, 1998. In the letter the Prosecutor stated that: “In
the presented state of affairs, it should be noted that there is
a high risk of economically groundless transfer of capital
from Poland to the USA, while the mechanism of this

transfer would include not only N inB  , but also
Ww inO Ww and
‘B ‘T R in B . (..) In relation

with the above, considering also that the factual
circumstances stated in the course of penal proceedings
justify immediate institution of administrative tax
inspections (...)” (emphasis added).

The Prosecutor’s letter to the Director of the Tax Inspection
Office, dated November 25, 1998 in which he stated that:
“Further arrangements made during the preparatory
proceeding allow assumption that despite the fact that the
Tax Inspection Office in O stated irregularities at N

in the years 1994-1996, in 1997 the company did not stop
actions against the law. In particular, this refers to the
settlement of intangible services rendered by W E

I , which would directly affect abuse in the scope of
taxes - income tax and VAT. In relation to the above, I hereby
request conducting supplementary inspection at N in
B __, within the scope identical with the scope of control

KS-X-3/97, but covering the year 1997” (emphasis
added).'*

330. The Claimants submit that it was upon the request of the Public Prosecutor!” that the

331.

tax inspection in K was initiated on 3 February 1997 till 9 May 1997. The tax
inspection was conducted by Mr. I S , who also later carried out the
inspection for the fiscal year 1996. Mr. S was then questioned thrice in the
K Criminal Proceedings from August to October 1997.!'8° According to the
Claimants, it was his testimony that led to a series of criminal investigations
collectively described as the K Criminal Proceedings. These proceedings
seriously affected K day-to-day operations and restricted the Claimants’ ability
to minimize the losses they incurred due to K collapse. These proceedings also

caused the Claimants to suffer moral damages.

The Claimants argue that the actions of the Prosecutor during the K Criminal
Proceedings amounted to acta iure imperii. According to the Claimants, the
Respondent is incorrect in submitting that the role of the Claimants in the K

Criminal Proceedings was limited to the role of a witness and no coercive measures
were adopted against any of them. The Claimants submit that the Respondent has
failed to take into account the circumstances of the relationship of Mr. R and Mr.
M with the Prosecutor. Mr. R and Mr. M had every reason to fear
that coercive measures would be adopted against them as the criminal proceedings
were being conducted against K “former managers” and they were members of
its Board. In this regard, the Prosecutor’s letter of 1 July 2010 indicated that in case
the Claimants failed to provide the information being sought he would seek assistance
from Interpol and the U.S. law enforcement authorities. '*! This request was repeated

through letters dated 10 and 25 August 2010. '**

The Claimants, therefore, were legitimately afraid of coming to Poland, which is why
their legal counsel sought assurances from the Prosecutor, which were given through

the Prosecutor’s letter dated 16 September 2010.!8?

With regard to when the criminal proceedings were initiated, the Claimants submit
that their initiation in 1997 (i.e. by launching an investigation, which was conducted
in the in rem phase) was clearly connected with the initiation of tax proceedings
against K __, and the later developments in the criminal proceedings do not alter the
fact that they were in relation to the alleged illegal transfer of funds abroad and are

still pending.

The Claimants rely on the decision in the case of Biwater v. Tanzania where the
Tribunal observed that the cumulative effect of a series of government acts, which
include initiating criminal proceedings, could lead to expropriation of an

investment. !*

The Tribunal’s analysis

This Tribunal has already, albeit by majority, concluded that the present dispute
relates to “matters of taxation” and therefore, it only has jurisdiction to hear claims
based on the exceptions listed in Article VI(2) of the Treaty. In view of this the
Tribunal is of the view that it does not have jurisdiction to hear any independent claims
based on actions or developments in the criminal proceedings. To the extent that
actions or developments in the criminal proceedings, however, relate to and form part
of the Claimants’ claims based on expropriation or transfers (under Article VI(2)(a)

or (b)), the Tribunal will consider them in its findings on the merits.
Conclusion on jurisdiction

The Tribunal, by majority, is of the view that the present dispute relates to “matters

of taxation” within the meaning of Article VI(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal’s

"83 CE-521,

July 2008 (CE-675).

340.

jurisdiction is, therefore, limited to claims for expropriation, transfers and the
violation of an obligation for the observance and enforcement of an investment
agreement. The majority of this Tribunal is of the view that the present dispute does
not relate to a violation of an obligation for the observance and enforcement of an
investment agreement pursuant to Article VI(2)(c) of the BIT. In light of the above
analysis, the majority also concludes that it has jurisdiction only to hear claims
relating to Article VI(2)(a) and (b). The Tribunal is, however, of the view that the
dispute raised by the Claimants is not covered under the DTT and is not subject to its

dispute settlement clause.

Before turning to the merits of the dispute, however, the Tribunal must determine
whether the present dispute falls within the scope of the Additional Facility Rules.
This is a dispute between the nationals of an ICSID Contracting State and a State Party
which is not an ICSID Contracting State. The Republic of Poland is not an ICSID
Contracting State. Mr. V JR is a national of the United States, which is an
ICSID Contracting State. Determining the corporate nationality based on the seat of
incorporation, S and A are also nationals of the United States for the

purposes of the Additional Facility Rules.

There is no dispute that Mr. R and S have made an investment for the
purposes of the BIT and hence for the purposes of Articles 4(2) and 2(a) of the
Additional Facility Rules. The Tribunal has also found that A has made an

investment for the purposes of the BIT and the Additional Facility Rules.

The Parties disagree about whether the Republic of Poland complied with its
substantive obligations under the BIT in relation to the Claimants’ investment in
K _. The dispute, is therefore of a legal nature, which arises directly out of an

investment in accordance with Article 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules.

The Parties have consented in writing to ICSID Additional Facility arbitration. The
Respondent’s advance consent is contained in Article IX of the BIT, the prerequisites
of which have been fulfilled with respect to all three Claimants, and the Claimants’

written consents are contained in their Request for Arbitration. Further, approval of

104

341.

VI.

342.

343.

344.

access to the Additional Facility was granted by the ICSID Secretary-General on 3
November 2010. As such the jurisdictional requirements established by the Additional

Facility Rules are fulfilled.

The Tribunal, therefore, has the jurisdiction to hear claims raised by the Claimants
relating to Article VI(2)(a) and (b). In its analysis on the merits, the Tribunal will
hence address the Claimants’ claims regarding expropriation pursuant to Article VII
of the Treaty and the Claimants’ claims regarding transfers pursuant to Article V of

the BIT.

LIABILITY

Applicable law

The Claimants submit that based on the subject matter of the dispute, the Tribunal

should apply the following rules of law:

(i) The Treaty;

(ii) | Customary international law;

(iii) General principles of law recognized by civilized nations; and

(iv) U.S. law as the national law of the State of nationality of the Claimants.

The Claimants also ask the Tribunal to refer to the decisions of other courts and

tribunals and writings of eminent scholars.

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal should primarily refer to the Treaty itself
and where the provisions of the Treaty are insufficient to resolve the dispute, reference
may be made to customary international law and general principles of international
law as submitted by the Claimants. The Respondent also agrees with the Claimants
on the persuasive but non-binding authority of decisions of other courts and tribunals

and the writings of eminent scholars.

105

345.

346.

347.

Where the Parties primarily differ is on the application of national law. The Claimants
submit that U.S. law should be applied in determining the standing and status of the
Claimants. They further argue that Polish law should be treated as a fact by the
Tribunal. The Respondent agrees that U.S. law may be applied in determining the
standing and status of the Claimants, i.e. questions relating to the existence of control
by Mr. R over S or A or issues of Delaware corporate laws. The
Respondent also agrees that international tribunals tend to apply domestic law as fact

and does not oppose this approach.

The Respondent, however, argues that Polish law must be applied on an equal footing
as U.S. law in this arbitration and cannot, in any manner, be treated as subservient to
U.S. law. Questions relating to the constitution of W __, rules of evidence in the
Polish tax proceedings, or the specific CIT or VAT regulations applicable to K

must be determined in light of Polish law.

The positions taken by the Parties on the applicable law is hence not far apart, and the
dispute relates only to the precise role of national law, but there too the difference
between the Parties’ positions is marginal. The Respondent’s position that before an
international tribunal questions of domestic law should be treated as questions of fact
and both national laws should be applied on an equal footing where required is
reasonable. This position, which is set out in the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial !*5
was not contradicted or opposed by the Claimants’ in their Reply Memorial. The
Tribunal is of the view that it reflects the settled approach in international arbitration
and it will apply U.S. law and Polish law as questions of fact if and when required and

treat them on an equal footing.

Expropriation
The Parties’ positions

Claimants’ position

The Claimants submit that their investment in K was indirectly expropriated by
the conduct of the Respondent and that none of the requirements for a legal

expropriation under Article VII(1) of the Treaty were fulfilled by the Respondent.

The indirect expropriation consisted of depriving the Claimants in the year 2000 of
the use and expected economic benefits of their investment in K (i.e. as a result
of the Respondent’s action, in particular the tax proceedings, K lost access to bank
financing). Consequently, it could not purchase essential raw material for its
production process and was compelled to cease normal operations. The Claimants
submit that there was a clear and convincing causal link between the actions of the
Respondent and the collapse of K __. In this regard, the Claimants place reliance on
the Expert Opinion of Prof. Z , who unequivocally states that the tax
proceedings, and not any factors attributable to the Claimants or K itself, caused

the collapse of K
The standard for expropriation

The Claimants submit that the present case is one of indirect and creeping
expropriation, where the successive measures of the Host State over a period of time
caused the collapse of the investment. According to the Claimants, the present case
does not concern the powers of the Respondent relating to taxation, but to its conduct
during the tax and criminal proceedings; conduct, which according to the Claimants

was not bona fide.

According to the Claimants, the tax measures in the present case were just one part of
a broader matrix of measures, which, when taken together, led to K collapse. In
this regard, the nature of the measure and the Host State’s intent when applying it are

irrelevant for finding a violation of Article VII of the Treaty. A Host State’s measures

107

352.

353.

are “tantamount to expropriation” when their effect is “the effective loss of
management, use or control, or a significant depreciation of the value, of the assets
of a foreign investor.” '®© The focus, therefore, must be on the effect of a measure, not

the nature of nor intention behind the measure.

The Claimants argue that the present case is distinguishable from the O&L v.
Slovakia'*’ case where the company purchased by the investor was already on the
verge of bankruptcy at the time of the investment and was already burdened with
significant tax arrears. In this case, the conduct of the Respondent constituted an abuse
of tax powers since the measures taken were discriminatory, arbitrary and contrary to

the due process of law.

According to the Claimants, for an expropriation to occur it is not necessary for the
investment to be appropriated by the Host State. The Claimants argue that the
Respondent has itself conceded that the decisions in Olguin v. Paraguay'** and
Lauder v. Czech Republic,'®? on which it relied, do not necessarily constitute the
leading approach.'°° According to the leading approach, creeping and indirect
expropriation consists of measures, which deprive an investor of the benefits of his or
her investment but do not necessarily transfer the investment to the Host State. The

Claimants rely on Metalclad v. Mexico, where the Tribunal observed that

expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and
acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or
formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the Host State, but
also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which
has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part,
of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of
property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the Host
State.!!

The Claimants submit that while the Respondent is correct in asserting that an
expropriation requires a permanent loss of benefits to the investors, this is not the
same as the investor not remaining in control or losing the management of an
investment. Once the investment becomes economically unviable because of the
measures taken by the Host State, whether or not the investor still remains in control
of the investment is irrelevant. In this regard the Claimants rely on Burlington v.

Ecuador, where the Tribunal observed that

[t]he loss of viability does not necessarily imply a loss of
management or control. What matters is the capacity to earn a
commercial return. After all, investors make investments to earn a
return. If they lose this possibility as a result of a State measure,
then they have lost the economic use of their investment.(...) The
measure is expropriatory, whether it affects the entire investment or
only part of it, as long as the operation of the investment cannot
generate a commercial return.'

 

K bankruptcy was caused by the Respondent’s actions

The Claimants rely on Articles 31(1) and 31(2) of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility to argue that a State is obliged to make full reparation for any injury
caused by its internationally wrongful act. The test for causation is either (i) the
natural consequence test; or (ii) foreseeability from the perspective of a reasonable
and well-informed third party. International investment tribunals have consistently
used these two tests to determine whether the injury to an investor is not too remote
(or proximate) from the internationally wrongful act of the Host State. The
applicability of both these tests has been confirmed in CME v. Czech Republic where
the Tribunal stated that “/cJausation arises if the damage or disadvantage deriving
from the deprivation of the legal safety of the investment is foreseeable and occurs in

anormal sequence of events.”'®* The Claimants also rely on the rulings in the cases

14 December 2012 paras. 397-398 (CE-758).

of S.D. Myers v. Canada’ and Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine.'°> According to
the Claimants, the causation tests are also recognized in Polish law (Article 361
paragraph | of the Polish Civil Code states that “a Party obliged to compensation is
responsible only for regular consequences of an act or default leading to damage’)

and have been applied by the Polish Supreme Court.!°°

The Claimants submit that for an expropriation claim to succeed they have to show
that there is an “uninterrupted and proximate logical chain from the initial cause [i.e.

the tax and criminal proceedings we

 

..to the final effect [i.e. to the collapse of K
whereas the Respondents, if negating the causal link, must show that the final effect
was caused not by the wrongful acts of the Respondent but by the actions of the

Claimants or third-parties for which no one can be made responsible.

To prove the causal link, the Claimants rely heavily on the expert opinion of Prof.
Z -!°8 According to his expert opinion, K financial standing during the
period from 1994 to 1996 was sound. During this period K experienced growth
in its scale of operations, as measured by sales volume and revenue. This was a direct
result of the increase in vegetable fat consumption in the country and the company’s
effective marketing strategy. K profitability, EBIDTA-to-sales ratio, return on
equity and return on assets were all, on average, higher than the sector benchmarks
and, in particular, than its most comparable competitor — Z T

K S.A. (“K  ”). Prof. Z also opined that K leverage strategy

during this time was aggressive due to sales growth and extensive capital investment.

194 § D. Meyers, Inc. v. Canada, UNCITRAL, Second Partial Award of 21 October 2002, para. 140: “In its
First Partial Award the Tribunal determined that damages may only be awarded to the extent that there is a
sufficient causal link between the breach of a specific NAFTA provision and the loss sustained by the investor.
Other ways of expressing the same concept might be that the harm must not be too remote, or that the breach
of the specific NAFTA provision must be the proximate cause of the harm” (CE-836).

195 Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Award of 28 March 2011, para. 169: “The
best that the Tribunal can expect Claimant to prove is that through a line of natural sequences it is probable
— and not simply possible — that Gala would have been awarded the frequencies under tender. If it can be
proven that in the normal cause of events a certain cause will produce a certain effect, it can be safely assumed
that a (rebuttable) presumption of causality between both events exists, and that the first is the proximate
cause of the other” (CE-682).

Its overall debt level, however, remained safe and in line with sector benchmarks. As
a result, at the end of 1996, despite unfavourable market conditions, including a rise
in the price of raw material and increasing competition which resulted in a decrease
in profitability, K generated positive net income and was not only able to finance

its purchase of raw material but to continue its investment program.'”

According to Prof. Z , the tax proceedings were the cause of K collapse.
In order to evaluate the link between different factors and K collapse, Prof.
Z created a Base Model in which he analysed whether the joint impact of all
factors, excluding the tax proceedings, relating to K financial and economic
standing was sufficient to cause its collapse.?% Among other factors taken into
account in the Base Model were K investment and sales strategies and its

management reorganization.

In the Base Model, Prof. Z effectively reversed the direct effects of the tax
proceedings. The Claimants submit that Prof. Z constructed the Base Model in
an extremely conservative manner. Even though the tax proceedings had a multi-
faceted impact onK __, Prof. Z only reversed those factors such as net cash
outflows caused by the tax decisions, tax advisor costs and lost access to preferential
loans, which could be quantified with a high degree of accuracy. All other factors
were included in the Base Model and no other positive effects of the absence of the
tax proceedings were taken into account. As a result, the Base Model is, in Prof.
Z view, the worst of many possible worlds without tax proceedings (i.e. a
worst case scenario for the company if no tax proceedings had taken place). Prof.
Z submits that, for instance, the following potential positive events which in

the absence of tax proceedings may have enhanced K positions were excluded:

Gj «K had initiated a comprehensive capital improvement program and would
have benefited from an expansion in its production capacity making it the lowest

cost producer.

111

(i) K suppliers and wholesale clients would have been willing to extend

payment terms, which would have a positive impact on K business.

(ili) K would have been able to procure bank financing to continue its rapeseed

purchase program.

(iv) The Claimants would have invested more money into K

360. The final outcome of the Base Model was premised on a comparison of the results
achieved in accordance with the presumptions in the Base Model and K actual
results, as well as those of K __, its main competitor and the sector benchmark.

361. According to Prof. Z , a detailed analysis of macroeconomic data from 1994 to
2000 reveals that changes in these factors, other than the tax proceedings, would have
had a positive or neutral impact on K _ .7°! While the volatility in the price of
rapeseed, which was the main raw material required by K __, and increasing
competition did create risks, these were risks that all companies in the sector were
exposed to and were not factors in K bankruptcy.”°? These market conditions
began to improve in 2000 and companies, which were in a weaker position than K
in the late-1990’s, were able to recover.

362. With regard to the impact of the tax proceedings, Prof. Z states that

it should be noted that the influence of these proceedings on
K financial and economic standing consisted of numerous
aspects and was negative in each of them, whereas the strength of
that influence can be assessed as substantial. Taking into account
the strength of that influence, above all with regard to K
relations with banks, it can be reasonably assumed that the tax
proceedings caused K bankruptcy.?

363. According to Prof. Z :

excluding a single factor specific to K , Le. the tax proceedings,

would have altered the Company’s financial and economic standing

2! Thid, para. 164.
202 Jhid, paras, 184-185.
283 Thid, para. 247.

112

in 1997-1999 to such an extent that it would have been able to obtain
financing sufficient in order to assure full raw material supplies for
the production process in 2000. Therefore, the presented
quantitative analysis indicates, with a probability bordering on
certainty that if the tax proceedings had not been carried out,

K operating activity would not have collapsed in 2000
(K would not have gone bankrupt).?°*
364. Prof. Z provides a forecast for K from 2000-2010 on the basis of the Base
Model showing that in a no tax proceedings scenario K would not have been

365.

366.

expected to go bankrupt:

This forecast was made solely for estimating the Claimants’ loss.
The Base Model itself was sufficient proof that K would not
have collapsed in 2000, had there been no tax proceedings. Because
in our forecast we conservatively assumed no additional capital
injections from its owners, K positive, safe equity level and
positive cash in the forecast period were additional, strong evidence
that without the tax proceedings K would not have gone
bankrupt.?>

The Claimants submit that in accordance with Resolution No. 8/1999 of the Polish
Commission for Banking Supervision if a company reported negative equity, its banks
had to make provision amounting to between 50% to 100% of the total loans they had
granted to the company.”°° The tax proceedings resulted in K reporting negative
equity at the end of 1999,”°’ which completely changed the company’s negotiating

position with banks and resulted in the loss of bank financing.

In his Supplemental Opinion, Prof. Z distinguishes between in abstracto and

in concreto relation between reporting negative equity and losing bank financing:

According to the Expert Opinion’s approach, reporting negative
equity alone, i.e., in abstracto, was neither a sine qua non condition,
nor a sufficient condition for K bankruptcy, but just an
element which definitely increased the probability of losing bank

206 CE-383, para. 4.2(2).

The key finding of the analysis of the Base Model was that in the absence of the tax proceedings, K

would have reported positive equity at the end of 1999. See Expert Opinion of Prof. Z . paras. 249-263.

financing. Nevertheless, combined with the banks’ assessment of
other risks connected with K tax proceedings (e.g., potential
bank account seizures) and / or risks connected with criminal
proceedings (e.g., the potential detention of K key managers),
it definitely could have proved to be a sufficient condition for losing
bank financing.”

367. A similar conclusion was reached by Prof. S in his Review Opinion:

Even though K experienced financial distress during 1997 to
1999 as shown by its Z score, it did not become bankrupt until the
bankruptcy event materialized. The bankruptcy event had been
preceded by other events, i.e. the commencement of tax proceedings,
tax provisions, the subsequent denial of access to bank credit and
denial of preferential loans and the consequent inability of K

to carry on its operations to generate cash flow to service its debt.
These preceding events were the cascading events that led to the
bankruptcy event which triggered K bankruptcy?”

368. According to the Claimants, the link between wrongful acts of the Respondent and
K loss of financing is confirmed by correspondence between the Respondent’s

agents:

(i) the letter dated January 20, 1999 from Mr. G
M (the Respondent’s representative in K
Supervisory Board and the Director of the Department of the
Finances of the State Treasury in the Ministry of the State
Treasury) to Ms. B P (the then Director of the
Tax Chamber in O ): “IT would like to point out the
negative consequences caused by the unfavorable for the
Company interpretation, of not entirely clear tax
regulations, in particular due to the fact that actions of the
Company in respect of interpretation of these problems were
based on generally accepted principles in western European
countries and correctness of performance was confirmed by
annual audits of the renowned company — A A
Sp. z 0.0. An unfavorable decision of the Tax Chamber could
cause the bankruptcy of the Company, which entails
redundancies, suspension of contracting and purchase of
rapeseed, i.e. a threat to the existence of farmers and
planters and decrease in income to the state budget from
taxes and fees. Such a decision can also have negative

system” (emphasis added);

the letter dated January 9, 2000 from Adam Peziot (the then
governor of Opole Voivodship) to Mr. Jerzy Buzek (the then
Polish Prime Minister): “As it follows from the information
obtained from the Mayor of the city of B_ , problems
connected with the repayment of tax liabilities resulted in the
suspension of credit lines for the purchase of production
material by banks cooperating with the company. In
consequence, contracts with farmers were terminated and
the financial condition of the company has gravely
deteriorated. Possible declaration of bankruptcy of the
company will cause the increase of the unemployment rate
in the B county which at the moment amounts to over
20%” (emphasis added);

the letter dated January 3, 2001 from Mr. Maciej Stefanski
(the then Mayor of B ) to Mr. Jerzy Buzek (the then
Polish Prime Minister): “Recently, the Tax Inspection Office
inO __, after the inspection carried out at K F

ordered the company to pay over PLN 22,000,000.
Problems related with the repayment of the amounts due
resulted in the suspension of credit lines for the purchase of
the production material by the banks cooperating with the
enterprise, which in turn limited the activity of the plant to
perform processing services on order of other oil processing
plants. Thus, contracts with farmers were terminated and the
plant is threatened by the prospect of bankruptcy” ;

the letter dated June 4, 2001 from Ms. Barbara Litak-
Zarebska (the then Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry
of the State Treasury) to Mr. Jan Rudowski (the then
Secretary of the State at the Ministry of Finance); although
admittedly Ms. Litak-Zarebska recognized that factors other
than the tax proceedings influenced K financial
situation, she unequivocally confirmed that the tax issue was
the ultimate and decisive reason for cutting off bank
financing: “The Tax Inspection Office has declined to
recognize the costs incurred for the remuneration of the
managing group as tax deductible costs. Decisions of the
Tax Inspection Office led to gradual deterioration of the
economic and financial situation of the Company and the tax

115

penalties accrued as the result of the above caused the banks
to reject the granting of credit facilities for the purchases.?'°

369. In the Claimants’ view, the banks were also aware of the risks associated with tax

proceedings:

(i) the assessment of K creditworthiness dated September
14, 1998 prepared by B Ss S.A: “(...) there is
uncertainty with regards to the final outcome of the tax
proceedings; assuming pessimistic option for the current
and next years (spreading tax arrears into installments) PLN
38 million could be drawn from the company, which could
significantly affect the financial liquidity” ;

(ii) an opinion of the P S.A.’s analyst with respect to
K loan application submitted in 1999: “the loss on
activity incurred in 1997 and a substantial influence on its
appearance had sanctions imposed on the company by the
Tax Inspection Office on account of excluding the
expenditures borne on consulting and advisory services from
tax deductible costs. Penalty interest as well as provisions
on bud, ‘y liabilities were blished, jointly i
to more than PLN 38 million” ;

(iii) the Report on the Client dated August 9, 1999, issued in
connection with K loan application to P S.A.:
“(...) in 1997 the Tax Inspection Office excluded the
expenditures borne on consulting and advisory services from
tax deductible costs and on this account tax liabilities were
established for the years 1995-1996 in the amount of PLN
30 million;?"'

results of the Tax Inspection Office. As a bank, we were

(ii) the statement of an employee of theB  B S.A., dated

December 17, 2004: “The company’s financial situation at

that time was tragic. The company was not in a position to

act independently because it had no financial fluidity. As far

as I know, it was the result of tax arrears, or at least this is

what could have been concluded on the basis of financial

documents. The tax arrears totaled approximately PLN 50

million. I think it resulted from the Tax Office’s failure to

consider as tax deductible certain expenses incurred, as I

heard, in relation to marketing and advisory services.”?'*
The Claimants submit that the loss of working capital loans from banks meant that
K was unable to purchase the raw material it needed to continue its production.

The company was, therefore, forced to cease normal operations.

The Claimants’ expert, Prof. Z , also created an Alternative Model, which
reveals that even if the tax proceedings had conformed to standards of due process
and concluded within a reasonable time, K would still have required a capital
injection of at least PLN 15,000,000, to maintain the possibility of obtaining the
necessary financing.”!> This Alternative Model confirms that the impact of the tax

proceedings was substantial and could not have been easily overcome by K or the

Claimants.

The causal link between the Respondent’s actions and K collapse was not
broken

K collapse was not attributable to its debt to equity policy

The Claimants rely on Prof. Z Supplemental Opinion in which he addresses
the assertions of the Respondent’s legal experts to the effect that K bankruptcy
was caused by its debt-to-equity ratio, i.e. K high leverage policy and lack of

equity capitalization made its position so fragile that even a slight worsening of

conditions in 1999 would have led to K reporting negative equity value and

therefore, losing bank financing. The Claimants state in their Reply:

(i) “We noted that C Le line of reasoning was
logically flawed because even if the “fragility argument”
was true, it could not justify neither the conclusion that
K debt-to-equity policy caused its bankruptcy, nor
that the tax authorities’ actions did not cause K
bankruptcy. One can easily imagine that even with its debt-
to-equity policy, K need not have been directly
threatened with bankruptcy — as confirmed by numerous
examples of highly levered companies operating
undisturbed — until the occurrence of an extraordinary
factor, such as the tax proceedings in K case. To
better illustrate this issue, let us imagine the following
situation: if John stood in water up to his chin, but was still
able to breathe and counter the waves, and Bill pushed his
head down - we would say that the cause of John’s drowning
was Bill’s action and not the high water level”.

(ii) “Regardless of the above, we examined the soundness of
Cc L “fragility hypothesis”. In regards to
1999, we noted that C L analyses were
methodologically flawed: C L examined
whether in a “no tax proceedings scenario” K equity
would have been negative had the market conditions been
different than they actually were. Such considerations lead
nowhere as in reality without the tax proceedings K
equity would have remained positive in 1999, as evidenced
by our Base Model, whose correctness has not been
disproved by C L ”

(iii) “In order to examine whether K bankruptcy in the
years 2000 — 2004 was “highly probable”, as stated in the
Counter Opinion, we performed a comprehensive stress-test.
We ran 5,000 simulations in which K Base Model
revenue and EBITDA profitability fluctuated randomly
according to appropriate standard deviations estimated for
actual data reported in 2000 — 2005 by K , the
Company’s main competitor. It resulted that K
default probability was below 5%, where default was defined
as equity turning negative in any single year. Furthermore,
even had the volatility of the Company’s key parameters
been twice as high as K (which was practically
impossible), K default probability would have been
lower than 24%. This led us to conclude that C

118

(iv)

(vi)

L claim that even in the absence of the tax
proceedings K bankruptcy was “highly probable”,
was “greatly exaggerated”.

“To support their Counter Opinion’s main hypothesis, i.e.,
that K bankruptcy was caused by excessive leverage
and inadequate equity capitalization, C L also
claimed that K would not have gone bankrupt, had it
been recapitalized with PLN 26.3 M in 1996. From a logical
perspective, this argument is undoubtedly as much true as it
is useless. Obviously had K had more cash and as a
result, e.g., achieved Apple Inc.’s financial standing, it
would have been immune to the subject actions of the tax
authorities. However, this argument neither proves that the
lack of recapitalization caused K bankruptcy, nor
does it disprove that the tax proceedings caused it. If
additional funds were necessary to counter the tax
proceedings’ effects, then it is the tax proceedings and not
the lack of recapitalization that should be considered the
cause of K bankruptcy. Deducing that the lack of
recapitalization was the cause of bankruptcy in such a case
makes as much sense as claiming that the cause of a shooting
victim’s death was this person’s failure to put on a bullet-
proof vest”.

“Probably despite the Counter-Opinion’s Authors’
intentions, the “recapitalization argument” proves rather
the significance of the tax proceedings’ impact than the lack
thereof. This is because according to the subject argument,
K would have required at least PLN 26.3 M to counter
the tax proceedings’ effects and this amount is undoubtedly
considerable compared to K scale of operations”.

“In Subchapter HI.5 of this Supplement, we examine
Cc L other allegations towards the Expert
Opinion’s causality analysis, that is allegations which we
consider minor. We concluded that these allegations were
also unfounded, either due to C L
methodological errors, misinterpretations or incoherence
with the source material.”>'

K collapse was not attributable to its banks

The Claimants argue that the documentary record clearly shows that the banks were
not only aware of the risks associated with the tax proceedings but that the loss of

bank financing was a normal consequence of the Respondent’s wrongful actions.
K collapse was not attributable to any negligent business decisions

The Claimants further submit that the Respondent’s entire argument in this regard is
copied from the indictment against Mr. B and Mr. M and not on any
independent evidence. The Claimants point out that Messrs. B and
M criminal liability is yet to be established and an indictment carries no legal
weight. Furthermore, the Claimants argue that the indictment was based largely on
the opinions of Ms. S , one of the chief officers of O tax authorities.
In this regard, the Claimants rely on Prof. Z examination of Ms.
Ny claims in relation to K business decisions. In the Claimants’
view, Prof. Z has pointed out the numerous instances where Ms. S

(i) gave definitive answers to questions she was not competent to address (for instance,
the ex-post facto evaluation of K business strategy); (ii) failed to differentiate
between losses, which result from admissible business risk and which result from
negligence or bad faith; (iii) assumed that lack of documentation or lack of direct
economic advantage meant that there was negligence or bad faith; and (iv) clearly

exhibited an unsubstantiated negative attitude against K management.?!>

Further, the Claimants submit that Prof. Z also thoroughly examined K.

main business strategies from 1994 to 2000 including (i) investments in fixed assets;
(ii) management system reorganization; and (iii) aggressive sales strategy and
distribution system reorganization, and concluded that they were all within the scope
of rational business decisions.”!© Even assuming, however, that some or all of these

decisions were negligent or taken in bad faith, in accordance with the Base Model

none of these decisions, jointly or cumulatively, would have brought about the

collapse of K _, according to the Claimants.
K collapse was not attributable to its bad faith or negligence during the tax
proceedings

. The Claimants submit that they consistently acted in good faith during the tax

proceedings and rely on the expert opinion of Prof. G for the correctness
of their and K behaviour during these proceedings. Prof. G states:
(i) “In my opinion, K tax proceedings were conducted

with a bias. The tax authorities breached procedural rules,
such as the obligation to reveal the “real truth” and the
obligation to carefully verify and assess the probative value
of the evidence gathered according to the free evaluation of
evidence rule by: making unreasonable requests for
evidence and rejecting evidence submitted by K on
unreasonable grounds, questioning the tax deductibility of
the Management Fees for various irrational reasons,
making contradictory and incoherent conclusions, making
no efforts to gather evidence favorable to K_ ,
disregarding K evidentiary motions, and shifting the
burden of proof from themselves to K ”

(ii) “The tax authorities also breached substantive law, i.e., they
misapplied Article 15 sec. 1 of the Corporate Income Tax
Law (the “CIT Law”) by denying K the right to treat the
Management Fees as tax deductible costs. The tax
authorities also misapplied transfer pricing rules, i.e., in
K tax proceedings for the fiscal years 1994-1996, the
tax authorities completely ignored the procedure for
assessing the market price of the Management Services and
did not go beyond referring to Article 11 of the CIT Law as
the only basis for excluding Management Fees from tax
deductible costs. In K tax proceedings regarding the
fiscal year of 1997, the tax authorities assessed the price of
certain Management Services in violation of the rules
specified in Article 11 sec. 3 of the CIT Law. In particular,
the tax authorities narrowly defined the subject matter of the
price assessment. Additionally, not all physical products of
the Management Services were subject to the price
assessment”.

“Then, I have compared K tax proceedings with the
tax proceedings conducted at W_ . It occurred that the
cases were similar in all aspects, whereas the outcome of the
cases was totally different. The same as in K case,
W _ benefited from the Management Services provided by
Ww Sp. 20.0. . The tax
authorities raised the same allegations with respect to
Management Fees both in K andW tax proceedings.
However, the W case was finally settled by the tax
authority of second instance favorably to W  , whereas
K tax proceedings lasted for many years and did not
end up favorable to K ”

“T also expressed an opinion on what the result of K

tax proceedings would be if the tax authorities obeyed the
procedural and substantive tax laws — in my opinion,
K tax proceedings would have been settled favorably
to K , as it was the case withW Se”.

“(...) The tax authorities should have acted in line with the
law. That means the tax authorities should have obeyed the
rule of law, the objective truth principle, the free evaluation
of evidence and the burden of proof rule, as well as the
obligation to gather evidence ex officio”.

“In particular, during the discovery phase of the
proceedings, the tax authorities should have made efforts to
reveal the “real truth” by taking an active role in gathering
evidence, in particular hearing the foreign consultants who
provided the Management Services to K ”,

“First, the tax authorities should have only made reasonable
requests to submit additional evidence, e.g. the tax
authorities would not request physical proof that the
Management Services were provided but instead they would
determine their scope by other means of evidence, including
witness testimonies, correspondence, hotel and _ flight
reservations. The tax authorities would accept items of
evidence submitted by K and reasonably evaluated their
probative value instead of rejecting evidence for absurd
reasons, e.g., due to the lack of authorship of the reports
drafted”.

“Second, if the tax authorities received general as well as

partial agreements, they would explain their meaning
according to the parties’ intention by other means of

122

(ix)

(x)

(xi)

(xii)

(xiii)

(xiv)

evidence instead of requesting pointless assignment of
reports to particular agreements. They would also not
investigate whether a report’s title matches the subject
matter of a partial agreement. Even if they would still raise
the arguments that an agreement was antedated, this should
have had no impact on K tax matters”.

“Third, the evidence gathered would be evaluated according
to the principle of free evaluation of evidence, i.e., with
logical consistency and according to the rules of
professional experience and common sense. For example,
the tax authorities would examine employees’ statements
submitted by K to determine the facts of the case instead
of rejecting them as unreliable due to the employees’ alleged
loyalty to K ”

“Bearing in mind K active role in evidence gathering,
the burden of proof should not have been shiftedtoK — . If
the tax authorities had some concerns with respect to any
facts of the case, further research should have been
performed”.

“Summing up, the tax authorities would aspire to reveal the
“real truth”, meaning that they would also gather evidence
favorable to K instead of setting traps for K and
acting according to the popular communist maxim: ‘Show
me the man and I'll find you the crime’”.

“Tf the tax proceedings had been conducted according to the
above-mentioned rules, the tax authorities would have
reconstructed the ‘real’ facts of the case, as was done in the
Ww case. In particular, similar to the W case, the tax
authorities in K tax proceedings would not have had
any doubts that the Management Services had actually been
provided”.

“Tf the facts of the case had been reconstructed according to
the ‘real truth’, the application of substantive law would
have led to a totally different outcome of the case”.

“In particular, the tax authorities would have noticed that
the Management Services were indirectly related to K
revenue. As a result, the Management Fees would have been
found tax deductible, as it was the case withW”.

123

(xv) “Uf the tax authorities had any concerns with respect to the
market value of the level of the Management Fees, the value
of the Management Services should have been assessed
according to rules specified in Article 11 of the CIT Law and
in the MF Regulation. The outcome of such a price
assessment is difficult to predict for me because it would
require making calculations and a benchmark based on
relevant data that I do not have access to”.

(xvi) “However, even if it was determined that the Management
Fees were not set at the market level, the Management Fees
could still be deductible to the extent that they reflected the
market price”.

“Summing up, if K tax proceedings had been
conducted according to procedural as well as substantive
law, the outcome of the tax proceedings would have been
totally different. I think that the outcome would have been
the same or similar to the case, i.e., the Management
Fees would have been found to be tax deductible for CIT
purposes. That would have protected K against the
multimillion zloty CIT and VAT arrears, including penalty
interest and additional VAT liability.”?""

377. The Claimants submit that K itself acted in accordance with Polish tax law and
practice. In accordance with Polish tax law, a tax inspection usually commences with
the examination of invoices and their comparison with entries in the books of the
taxpayer. If these match, then this is sufficient evidence in the Claimants’ view to treat
expenses as tax deductible. In case any questions arise, the tax inspector can, of
course, seek an explanation and where he is not satisfied, he may also seek additional
evidence. The Claimants point out that prior to 2001, however, there were no rules or
guidelines that required taxpayers to document related party transactions in any
particular manner. The obligation to prepare so-called “transfer pricing
documentation” was only introduced in the CIT Law on 1 January 2001. Even these
tules, so the Claimants argue, did not require the preparation of transfer pricing
documentation on an on-going basis. In the early 90s, the case law in Poland was also

silent on this issue. The Claimants submit that it was only in the late 90s that case law

on this issue began to emerge and it was only after 2000 that it could be said to be
settled. According to the Claimants, the question this raises is — how could K have
been expected to anticipate this case law (and the rules), which started to emerge 5

years after the Management Service system was designed?

According to the Claimants, even in applying this case law, however, the tax
authorities were required to accept the evidence offered by K during the tax
proceedings. For instance, K provided invoices relating to the Management Fees
paid and maintained books properly. It offered additional documents including
reports, tickets and hotel reservations, which in normal circumstances should have
been sufficient to prove the i of the M: Services arr

K even offered to produce witnesses (such as the consultants and the employees

of K __) who could explain the scope and significance of the Management Services.

The Claimants submit that the tax authorities in the O region, however, went far
beyond what a taxpayer was required to maintain in accordance with the law and asked
for documents which K was neither obliged to have, nor are usually created in the
course of provision of such services. In the Claimants’ view, to satisfy these allegedly
arbitrary and abusive requirements, K had to prepare “back-up” documentation,
including backdated agreements for specific Management Services previously
rendered. According to the Claimants, this evidence was rejected by the authorities
for irrational reasons. Contrary to the Respondent’s arguments, this did not constitute
forgery but was the only way K could comply with the requirements being

imposed by the tax authorities.

The Claimants submit that they did not act in bad faith or negligently in structuring
the Management Services. First, the Claimants state that the Management Services
were provided. This is the only conclusion that could have been drawn by a person
who properly considered the evidence provided by K __, including, for instance, the

statements of the consultants themselves. The Respondent has itself admitted in its

125

381.

382.

383.

pleadings that the Management Services were in fact provided.'® In fact, the Public

Prosecutor admitted as much in his Decision on Discontinuation.

Second, as per the Claimants, the Management Services were beneficial to K

These services were an integral part of the negotiations of the Privatization Agreement
(since such services were not readily available in Poland) and the Claimants’
obligation to provide such services was confirmed in the Privatization Agreement.
The Claimants relied on the statement of Mr. C H , who stated that

the Management Services sought to

...provide know-how and experience of western management types

[sic] consultants with broad management experience. [....] The main

focus was to provide management of those companies with a strong

background and to teach them western management style and

techniques. The aim was not only to provide these companies with

western business education and know-how, but also to teach them

about the practical application of this knowledge; with the emphasis

on increasing operating efficiency and profitability in order that the

companies could successfully compete in Poland and abroad.?"°
Third, contrary to the Respondent’s assertions, the Claimants state that they did not
make any profit off of the Management Services. While the Management Fees were
intended to cover W cost of providing these services, at the end of the day they
did not cover the total costs incurred, as confirmed by A A in its letter of
25 July 1997: “In both 1994 and 1995, the management fees charged were not enough
to fully reimburse the parent for its costs incurred. This resulted in a net loss at the
parent and the management company entities. Or to say it another way, the subsidiary
companies have been charged less than the services actually cost.”*?° Even the tax
decisions confirmed that 40% of the Management Fees were used for the maintenance

of W _ , while the remaining was transferred to W at

Fourth, the Claimants submit that the arrangement of the Management Services from

the manner in which the Management Fees were calculated (as a percentage of sales)

221 Claimants’ Reply Memorial dated 3 September 2013, para. 865.

126

to the documentation of the services provided was in accordance with Polish law and
international practice. According to the Claimants, this was confirmed by the

following statements of the Claimants’ witnesses:

(i) Mr.R = - “In considering the best method for calculating
the remuneration for the Management Services, we took into
consideration that many of the consultants would have to
provide their services to more than one of our Polish
investments, i.e. K ,B , etc., at the same time. We
consulted with A A and decided to choose a
calculation method based on the percentage of the monthly
sales of each investment. This methodology was a normal
international standard and practice.”??

(ii) Mr. M — “Recognizing that the manner of charging
the companies for services must comply with the Polish legal
system as well as sound business and economic principles,

Ss decided to carry out an analysis in order to
establish the formula for the provision of the Management
Services. Thus, A A was engaged and,

following their consultations and advice, it was decided that

the method to be used for the calculation of the management
fees charged to each Polish company for provisions of the
Management Services would be a percentage of the
respective company’s sales.”??>

(iii) Mr. H — “This method for charging the Management
Fees (i.e. the percentage of sales) was a method normally
accepted in the U.S. and other developed countries and
which had been discussed at length with, and considered
acceptable by, A A

The Claimants cannot be blamed for not paying the restructuring fee

384. The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s allegations regarding non-payment of the
restructuring fee must be viewed in light of K financial standing and market
position in 2002 and 2003. At that time, according to the Claimants, lack of bank
financing and production breakdowns caused losses in the amounts of PLN

63,862,885.96 in the year 2000, PLN 108,522,721.01 in the year 2001 and PLN

385.

386.

388.

126,922,492.17 in the year 2002. In such circumstances, the Claimants submit that
even if the restructuring fee may have been small compared to the total tax debt, one

could not reasonably have expected K to throw such money down the drain.

The Claimants also argue that, the final decision on K restructuring was issued
on 15 May 2013 — less than one month before its bankruptcy on 5 June 2013.
Furthermore, the Claimants point out that payment of the restructuring fee was not the
only condition for restructuring K debts and the re-payment of some of K

outstanding amounts was also required.
Failure to obtain State-aid in the form of a loan

According to the Claimants, they cannot be blamed for not obtaining a loan from the
Ministry of State Treasury due to the failure to present a coherent plan for K

financing. K restructuring plan had to be agreed upon between the entities
participating in the restructuring, including the banks and the court supervisor — the
success of the plan was not solely dependent on the Claimants. Moreover, the
Claimants point out that one of the conditions for financial restructuring was
restructuring of K tax debt. In any case, the possibility of State-aid came long

after K breakdown, i.e. at the end of 2002.

Withdrawal of K appeal to the Administrative Court in W was

necessary for restructuring the Company’s tax debt

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s argument that withdrawal of the appeal
was not a necessary condition for restructuring K tax debts is incorrect. The Act
on Restructuring of Public Receivables of 30 August 2002 requires a taxpayer who
wants to have all of his tax arrears restructured to have his case resolved or the appeal

withdrawn.
The Claimants state in K Restructuring Plan for the years 2003 to 2006:

Pursuant to the provision of Articles 15 and 16 of the quoted Act of
30 August 2002 on the Restructuring of Some Public Law
Receivables from Entrepreneurs, wishing to include the disputable

128

389.

(iv)

receivables in the restructuring, K F S.A. Management
Board withdrew complaints filed in the Supreme Administrative
Court against the decision of the Revenue Office in O
concerning corporate income tax for 1996 and 1997. The copies of
application filed in the Supreme Administrative Court for the
withdrawal of the complaints are attached.”

The Claimant’s unwillingness to purchase K after 2000 did not contribute to its

collapse

The Claimants deny that they were not willing to support K or that Mr. M

rejection (on behalf of K I G LLC) of the opportunity to purchase
K assets for PLN 107,000,000 shows that the Claimants were not willing to
support K _. According to the Claimants, the acquisition of the assets of a bankrupt
company without any prospect of resuming its operations cannot be considered a

reasonable business decision.

The Claimants further submit that the price of PLN 107,000,000 had nothing to do

with the value that K could have obtained if it continued to operate after 2000.

Failure to accept that the Understanding of 2 June 2003 did not contribute to a

failure of K restructuring

The Claimants submit that, as allegedly admitted by the Respondent, the
Understanding of 2 June 2003 was not unreservedly accepted by all relevant parties
and, indeed, the pleading submitted by K representatives to the bankruptcy court
on 5 June 2003 (i.e. the day of the declaration of K bankruptcy) demonstrated

that the Understanding was still not signed by some of the parties thereto.
Conduct of the tax proceedings

The tax authorities were biased against K

392. The Claimants submit that the tax authorities were biased and prejudiced against

K . According to the Claimants, this is evident from the manner in which the tax

25 RE.O74.

129

proceedings were conducted. First, the transfer pricing rules were applied
retrospectively. As early as April 1996, the Ministry of Finance issued Guidelines on
the Manner and Procedure of Income Determination by Way of Estimation
(“Guidelines”). These Guidelines were not binding on taxpayers and were for internal
instructions only. They introduced four methods for determining the market price of
related party transactions; methods, which were later introduced into Article 11 of the
CIT Law on 1 January 1997. In the Claimants’ view, the Guidelines made it possible
for the authorities to apply these new rules without any change in Article 11 itself,
which up until 1 January 1997 provided that the tax authorities should determine the
price on the basis of average prices applied in the same location on the date of
performance of the transaction. The Claimants submit that without legislative

approval the tax authorities were able to apply the new rules retrospectively.

393. Second, according to the Claimants the tax authorities set unreasonable standards for
providing documentation for the Management Services. For instance, according to the
Claimants, the tax authorities insisted on being provided physical proof of the
services, not taking into account that intangible services are not associated with
physical proof. The Claimants allege that among the unreasonable requests made by
the authorities was to identify the author of each work product marked with the letter
orlogoof W .K provided a list of 19 names, but the authorities wanted that
each name be matched to a specific work product.??° The Claimants refer to Mr.
H testimony:

(i) The whole of W effort at that time was to be able to
provide know-how and experience of western management
consultants with broad management experience. At that
time, such knowledge was not readily available on the Polish
market; which is why the decision was made to engage these
individuals. In addition, W organized seminars for
K employees. By way of example, there was a four or
five-d’s Executive Education Department, which was
attended by more than 20 top managers from S
Polish companies. W provided K (and S

226 CE-196, p. 8.

130

other companies in Poland) with Management Services on a
daily basis. It was a time-consuming and extensive
development process.?>"

(ii) The problem with the tax authorities reviewing K
back-up information was that they looked at how many
volumes of the documentation K provided; they looked
for quantity instead of the quality of materials. Due to the
nature of the intangible services and expertise provided on
adaily basis by W_ _ personnel and the Consultants, it was
not possible to provide the vast volume of written
documentation that the tax authorities seemed to expect.”

394. According to the Claimants, K for its part made its best effort to ensure that the
documents submitted reflected the actual course of events and even asked W for
help in putting together evidentiary material. The Claimants state that K took
action to change the system of documenting the Management Services once the
amended Article 11 of the CIT Law came into force on 1 January 1997. Reviewing
this documentation, K tax advisors stated that “/g/enerally, a significant
improvement in the quality of documentation supporting the invoices can be observed.
We believe that documentation regarding substance of the services rendered to B
would be sufficient to justify the level of fees charged in most of third party or even

7229 and confirmed that it was not the method of

related party relationships’
documenting the Management Services but the prejudice of the tax authorities that led
to the Management Fees being disallowed as tax deductible: “You also have to take
into account the historic aspect of charges between W and B and possibly
existing prejudice of tax office in this respect the risk exists that — regardless of quality
of documentation that may be provided — tax authorities will challenge the
deductibility of these costs.”*° Ms. § statement that “we suspected almost
from the very beginning that these services might have been fictional, and even if

performed, their purchase from W was not useful for the Company at all?!

during the hearing confirms that the tax authorities approach the proceedings was

biased.

Third, the Claimants submit that the tax and criminal authorities goaded each other on
the issue of alleged siphoning of funds through groundless capital transfers from
Poland to the U.S. under the guise of the Management Fees. According to the
Claimants, it was the Public Prosecutor who, for instance, encouraged that tax
authorities inspect the payments made by the Polish Investments to W for
Management Fees. In the Claimants’ view it was the tax authorities who also leaked

such allegations to the press, leading to articles being published on the issue.

Fourth, the Claimants argue that the system of awarding tax inspectors bonuses linked
to the tax arrears determined irrespective of the final outcome led to abuse, which was
only enhanced by the immediate enforceability of tax decisions. According to the

Claimants, the larger the tax arrears claimed, the larger the bonuses that were awarded.

As a result, substantial bonuses were paid to Ms. M F and Mr. I
S , the tax inspectors who conducted the tax proceedings for their findings
against K 7?

Due process was not afforded to K

The Claimants submit that the tax authorities refused to consider the evidence
provided byK _ . They refused to accept the statements of K employees, who
could have confirmed the utility of the Management Services, by arguing that these
employees’ views represented their private views, which would be influenced by the
employment and loyalty to K _.?*? According to the Claimants, they also rejected
evidence such as receipts for air travel and accommodation of foreign consultants on

Management Services the persons were in Poland.”** The tax authorities rejected

documents submitted by W__ on the grounds that they were a third party who had
nothing to do with the search for objective truth. They also ignored the Claimants’
invitations to examine the relevant documentation located in B . Finally and most
importantly, the tax authorities did not examine the consultants who were most
familiar with the Management Services and their importance to K despite a
motion being filed by A A ,onK behalf, on 14 August 1997 before
the W Branch of the Supreme Administrative Court.?*° As observed by Prof.
G

It is also surprising that neither the tax inspection records nor the
tax decision refer to foreign consultants’ witness hearing records.
This implies that no foreign consultants who provided K with
Management Services were summoned as witnesses. The foreign
consultants who provided Management Services to K were key
witnesses in the tax proceedings as they were the most valuable
sources of information about the scope and type of Management
Services providedto K __. The consultants could provide answers
to many questions raised by the tax authorities, in particular, they
could describe the nature of the services performed, explain why
they were useful for K and why they could not have been
performed by K employees.?*"

 

The Claimants submit that in assessing the Management Services, the tax authorities
also relied on expert opinions that were, according to the Claimants, erroneous,
defective and were given by persons with no credible knowledge in transfer pricing.
The Claimants submit that the result was that the conclusions reached were often
ridiculous. For instance, in his first Opinion Prof.S _ estimated the value of a certain
report without examining the items, which had been included in the cost estimate.?**
According to the Claimants, the tax authorities did not bother to look into the working

and analysis behind these opinions.

facto documentation supporting the Management Services provided to W __, did not

positive manner for W .??

The expropriation of the Claimants’ investment was unlawful

The Claimants submitted that the Respondent did not fulfil any of the criteria in
Article VII of the Treaty for a lawful expropriation. First, the expropriation was not
for a public purpose. While the Claimants agree that taxes as a rule are imposed for a
public purpose, the present dispute does not concern the legal framework of taxation
but the concerted conduct of the tax and criminal authorities. The Claimants argue
that the Respondent could not point to any specific public purpose that it was seeking
to achieve. However, even if it could, the Claimants state that the expropriation in the
present case violated the principle of proportionality which is implied in the concept
of public purpose. According to the Claimants, the tax sanctions imposed on K

and the initiation of criminal proceedings, which eventually resulted in banks ceasing
their financing of K _, were not proportional to the alleged purpose of preventing

tax evasion.

Second, the Claimants submit that the expropriation was discriminatory when
compared to the Respondent’s treatment of W and W on similar facts and

circumstances. W = and K cases were comparable since in both cases:

(i) _ The tax authorities at the first instance relied on the same arguments to disallow

deduction of the Management Fees and impose tax arrears;

(ii) The Management Services were provided through Ws;

(iii) The Management Fees were calculated using the same methodology;

29 Claimant’s Reply Memorial dated 13 September 2013, para. 907.

134

403.

404.

(iv) Similar post facto documentation for the Management Fees was prepared; and

(v) Similar documentation was produced in evidence.

The Claimant submitted that a review of the decisions of the tax authorities at the
second instance reveals that in W case the same arguments of the tax authorities
were dismissed and the Management Fees held to be tax deductible costs, while in
K the same arguments were upheld and the Management Fees disallowed as tax

deductible costs.

Third, the Claimants argue, the tax proceedings violated the due process of law since

the tax authorities allegedly:

(i) | Violated the burden of proof principle by questioning the very method of
calculating the Management Fees and placing an excessive burden on K to
prove a direct link between each and every management service and a specific

beneficial result for K ;

(ii) Made unreasonable requests for evidence and refused to consider the evidence

provided on irrational grounds;

(iii) Disregarded K evidentiary motions;

(iv) Did not make an effort themselves to gather necessary evidence, which may

have provided favourable to K ;

(v) Questioned the deductibility of the Management Fees on unreasonable grounds;

and

(vi) Made contradictory and incoherent conclusions.

In the Claimants’ view, the due process of law was also violated by the Administrative
Court in W in the 1996 CIT and VAT proceedings, which despite not
recognizing the need to examine foreign consultants in accordance with K

motion, concluded that “if the taxpayer [i.e., K — ] showed that the disputable

135

(vi)

intangible services were actually performed to its benefit, the expenditures on such

performance would undoubtedly represent the tax deductible cost.”**°

Prof. S Opinion is flawed

The first major flaw in C L Opinion (whose team was led by Prof.
S ) according to the Claimants, is in its assessment of the impact of the tax
proceedings on K collapse. According to the Claimants, in his first Opinion
Prof. S simply ignored the issue entirely, apart from making a single statement
that the tax proceedings did not cause the collapse of K _. Since it was not possible
to ignore the issue entirely without losing credibility, the Claimants submit that in his
Supplemental Opinion Prof. S took tax proceedings into account, but stated there
were several factors responsible for K negative equity at the end of 1999, of
which the tax proceedings was the least significant. According to the Claimants, Prof.

S was able to make such a statement by:

(i) Lowering the financial impact of the tax proceedings to only PLN 18.5 million.
After the tax proceeding’s effects first materialized in 1997, K had to
establish provisions amounting to PLN 38.2 million, constituting approximately
8.1% of revenue for that year. K profit on sales for that year only
amounted to 7.6% of its revenue. K , therefore, faced the threat of losing its
entire operating margin if it started to repay it liabilities including investment
loans. Had the tax authorities enforced their decisions, K would have had to
pay much more than PLN 18.5 million. According to the Claimants, by ignoring
these facts, Prof. S was able to lower the financial impact of the tax

proceedings.

(ii) Ignoring the effects of the proceedings, which could not be quantified, such as
losing the trust of banks, investors, suppliers, wholesale clients, employees etc.

According to the Claimants, these had a major impact on K ability to

240 CE-231, p. 11; and CE-297, p. 4.

136

406.

407.

operate from the time the tax arrears were first assessed until K

bankruptcy.
The second major flaw in C L Opinion, as per the Claimants, is Prof.
S assertion that K would have collapsed between 2000 and 2004 even

without the tax proceedings. The Claimants submit that not only is this factually and
methodologically incorrect, but that simply showing a high probability of collapse
between 2000 and 2004 does not absolve the Respondent from liability. It is only if
bankruptcy was inevitable at the beginning of this period could the Respondent be
absolved from liability. According to the Claimants, Prof. S has not been able to

show that that was the case.

In the Claimants’ view, the third major flaw in C L Opinion relates
to the arguments that were put forward to contest the Prof. Z conclusion that
without the tax proceedings, K would not have gone bankrupt. These arguments

are addressed by the Claimants as follows:

(i) | The Claimants point out that the vegetable fats market recovered in 2000 due to
K collapse.”*! According to the Claimants, this argument was only raised
by Prof. S in his Supplemental Opinion after reading Prof. Z
Supplemental Opinion in which he stated that part of the market recovery in
2000 could have been attributed to K collapse. The Claimants states that
the purpose of this argument was to undermine K growth forecast after
2000 by showing that it was in fact not tied to market conditions. While K
did have a 20% market share before 2000, it continued to operate in 2000 and
only gave up around 6.1% of the refined oil market and 9.6% of the margarine
market in 2000 — numbers that were too insignificant to result in a significant
improvement in competing companies results. According to the Claimants, what
is more important and what has been ignored by Prof. S , however, is that
the entire market was entering a new growth phase and showed a 6% year on

year increase from 1999 to 2000. The vegetable market’s recovery was

241 Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief dated 6 June 2014, para. 156.

137

confirmed in the market report published by the Polish Ministry of Agriculture

and Rural Development.”

In the Claimants’ view, the reasons for the growth
included (1) an increase in average vegetable fat consumption per capita in
Poland (31% higher than the total increase in the previous two years); (2) a
decline in rapeseed production in 1999, which led to higher margins in 2000;
and (3) the convergence of the Polish economy with Western Europe and

resulting decrease in the cost of debt, which allowed companies to borrow

cheaply.
(ii) In the Claimants’ view, considering K results for 1999, Prof. Z
forecast of K performance in 2000 was too good to be true.” The

Claimants point out that the entire sector’s results improved in 2000 and some
companies even reported record-breaking results. No reason was given as to
why K would not have taken advantage of this general trend. The Claimants
submit that in fact, given K competitive advantages, it was well placed to

take benefit from this general trend.”“4 In this regard, the Claimants submit that

K operating costs in 1999 were burdened with several one-off non-
recurring items such as its cooperation with J M ,LDSB :
Ww R (to temporarily supplement K margarine production

capacities due to increased demand), and purchasing rapeseed above market
prices (as a direct result of the tax proceedings), which should not be taken into

account when forecasting its future growth.

(iii) According to the Claimants, the argument that had K paid the Management

Fees in 1998 and 1999 it would have had to report negative equity in 1999 is
incorrect. When W stopped charging the Management Fees after 1997
because of the tax proceedings, there is no reason why it would have charged

such fees if K positive equity and bank financing depended on it.

(iv) Since even in the absence of tax proceedings, K would not have met loan

(v)

covenants with one of its banks, its loans would have been revoked by banks in
any case.?*° In the Claimants’ view, this argument misconstrues the relationship
between banks and companies. Banks do not terminate loans only because
companies do not precisely meet contractual covenants — rather they use this to
renegotiate terms and increase their margin. In fact, K failed to meet this

particular covenant from the very beginning and was still granted the loan.

In order to claim damages, the Claimants have to show that K would not
have collapsed in any year between 2000 and 2004.74” This argument is based
on an incorrect reading of the principle of liability. For instance, if K had
collapsed in 2000 or 2001, as it did due to the tax proceedings, it would not
absolve the Respondent of its liability because “to claim otherwise would be like
claiming that the killer of a 75-year old woman should not be held accountable,
because statistically speaking she would have died anyway in the course of the

next 4 years.”

Respondent’s position

Standard for expropriation

The Respondent submits that the taxation measures at issue in the present arbitration

were bona fide and that this is dispositive of the Claimants’ entire expropriation claim.

According to the Respondent, the Claimants’ main contention is that these measures

were not bona fide because they were part of a broader pattern of arbitrary and abusive

conduct of the Respondent’s organs.

The Respondent submits that first, the mere fact that simultaneous actions were taken

by various State organs all acting within the confines of their jurisdiction and

competence does not prove that there was concerted action on the part of various State

organs.

139

412.

Second, the Respondent argues that bad faith cannot simply be presumed on the part
of the State authorities. In the present case no proof of bad faith on the part of the

Respondent has been offered.

Third, the Respondent submits that the Claimants are wrong when they argue that the
intent of a Host State when applying a particular measure is irrelevant when
considering whether there has been an expropriation. The Respondent submits that
the sole effect doctrine cannot be applied without reservation in the case of alleged
mala fide tax measures. In the Respondent’s view, a tax applied by a Host State in
good faith cannot be regarded as a measure of expropriation, regardless of its effect
on an investment. In this regard the Respondent relies on the Tribunal’s finding in
RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. Russia that “States have a wide latitude in imposing and
enforcing taxation laws even if resulting in substantial deprivation without
compensation.”*** Only a taxation measure applied in bad faith with the intention of
depriving an investor of his investment or inflicting undue harm on the investment
can be considered an act of expropriation. This was the case in both the

RosInvestCo’ and Quasar de Valores et al.?>°

cases, where the Tribunals found that
the intended purpose of the Host State’s measures such as removing assets from the
control of the company, or seizing and selling its shares, was to expropriate the

investment.

The Respondent submits that the tax authorities only collected PLN 11 million out of
more than PLN 55 million in tax arrears of the company. They were willing to waive
off 95% of the debt of the company under the 2002 amnesty.”°! According to the
Respondent, this clearly shows that the Respondent’s various organs were not acting

with the purpose of expropriating any investment.

cancelled as was 100% of the corresponding tax interest on account of delay in payment. As such of the total
amount of PLN 50.7 million in tax arrears, the tax authorities were willing to waive of PLN 47.7 million.

The Respondent submits that when considering a claim for expropriation, the Tribunal
must consider whether or not the Respondent appropriated the investment. This can
be a decisive factor in a finding for or against expropriation. The Respondent relies
on Olguin v. Paraguay where the Tribunal states that “For an expropriation to occur,
there must be actions that can be considered reasonably appropriate for producing
the effect of depriving the affected party of the property it owns, in such a way that
whoever performs those actions will acquire, directly or indirectly, control, or at least
the fruits of the expropriated property.” According to the Respondent, similar

reasoning was adopted by the Tribunal in Lauder v. Czech Republic.*°*

The Respondent further argues that expropriation requires permanent deprivation of
an investment. Even though K found itself in a state of technical insolvency in
2000, there were several prospects for restructuring the company, including a waiver
of its bank debts and public charges and a settlement with its creditors, so the
Respondent submits. The Claimants appear to take the position that from mid-2000
onwards the loss to them was permanent. This, however, in the Respondent’s view, is
belied by the Claimants’ own actions and substantial efforts from 2001 to 2003 to
resuscitate the company. The Respondent asks if there was no expectation of
commercial viability and a permanent deprivation had taken place, why would the

Claimants have expended such effort?

In this regard, the Respondent submits that a simple lack of access to bank funding
does not imply expropriation. According to the Respondent, the Claimants’ entire case
is premised on the argument that K collapsed in mid-2000 because it was unable
to obtain bank financing, which would have allowed it to purchase raw material for
production. The Respondent states that the problem with this argument is that external
bank funding is only one of the many options that a company has to finance its
commercial activities. In fact, the documents produced by the Claimants reveal that

in early 2000 the E and S were both discussing various options for

282 Eudoro Armando Olguin v. Republic of Paraguay, para. 84 (RLA-036).
83 Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic (CE-661).

141

416.

increasing their investment in K , such as issuance of new discounted shares or
providing a shareholder’s loan.?4 It is, therefore, clear that there were other means
available to K to continue its business. The situation in the present case resembles
that in the Nations Energy case, where the investors also alleged that tax measures led
to the bankruptcy of the company because of an inability to raise financing; the
Tribunal found that even if the tax authorities had acted unlawfully in disallowing the

transfer of tax credits, this did not amount to an expropriation.°°

Finally, the Respondent contests the application of the principle of proportionality as
asserted by the Claimants. The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ reliance on the

Occidental v. Ecuador?®

case was misplaced since the facts in that case were
different. In Occidental, the State took the most drastic action possible by terminating
the concession agreement, and it did so even though other less severe alternatives were
available to it. In the present dispute, the Respondent submits that the tax liabilities of
K arose by operation of law, as did the penalties and late interest payment charges
thereon. The Respondent points out that this was not a matter of discretion for the
Respondent. The Respondent, however, also argues that the Tribunal’s decision in
Occidental was not correct since as long as the sanction was within the competence
of the relevant State organ under domestic law, the State should be allowed to exercise
its sovereign power to shape State policy. According to the Respondent, an

international investment tribunal is not in a position to make such a policy judgment.

(ii) K insolvency was not caused by the Respondent’s actions

417. The Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to establish a link between a
specific international wrongful act of the Respondent and a specific injury as
mandated by Articles 31(1), 31(2) and 34 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.
In this regard, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have referred to a series of

254 See e-mail from Mr. M to Ms. M dated 7 March 2000 (RE-257); letter from Mr.R to

Mr. P. dated 9 July 2000 (RE-258); and letter from Mr. R to Mr. P dated 19 July 2000 (RE-

alleged illegal acts — the bias of tax officers, the refusal to examine witnesses, and
unreasonable requests for documentation among others. According to the Respondent,
the Claimants, however, fail to explain what specific injury was caused by each of
these allegedly wrongful acts. For instance, the Respondent points out that the
Claimants fail to explain whether some or all of the tax officers were biased and what,
if any, was the effect of that. They also fail to explain whether every, or only some,
tax decisions rendered against them were tainted with bias. The Claimants’ analysis
is missing how each of these acts contributed to the collapse of K __. Instead, the
Claimants adopt a global approach, i.e. that the totality of the measures caused the
damage. This position is simply not tenable, which is why the Claimants place such
emphasis on allegations of bias. The allegation of bias, however, presupposes a wilful
intent at the beginning of the proceedings and this argument of the Claimants has at

least four substantial weaknesses according to the Respondent:
(i) It has not been proven through any direct evidence;

(ii) Given the sheer number of tax proceedings and the number of tax officials
involved in B and O , the alleged bias would require some form of
collective prejudice, which, in the absence of strong proof, cannot simply be

presumed;

(iii) It is contradicted by contemporary evidence including the Memoranda of Mr.
M dated 23 and 25 July 1997757 and the notes of A A and
other tax counsel of K , which suggest that serious irregularities were

258

discovered in the documentation of the company only incidentally~® and not as

part of a bonus-driven witch hunt; and

(iv) It fails to explain why such bias was not corrected by the higher forums such as

the Supreme Administrative Court or the Tax Chamber in W

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ theory of causality was premised almost
entirely on the Expert Opinions of Prof. Z . These Opinions, however, in the
Respondent’s view, are not credible because Prof. Z failed to show that K

became bankrupt because of the tax proceedings; his Opinions show a lack of
knowledge and disregard of the actual conditions in which K operated; and his

opinions included fundamental contradictions and errors.

According to the Respondent, the first critical flaw in Prof. Z Opinions is
that they fail to show that the company would not have gone bankrupt in mid-2000 in
the absence of the tax proceedings. The Respondent points out that his causality
analysis ends on 31 December 1999, whereas the relevant date is mid-2000, i.e. six
months later. The first key assumption of the Base Model is that it assumes that all
aspects of the company’s performance would remain unchanged save the tax
proceedings and their effects. Such an assumption fails to take into account the
hypothetical Management Fees that K would have paid in 1998 and 1999 and
which the Claimants admit it did not pay because of the tax proceedings. C

L clearly showed that if such fees were taken into account, the company would

have reported a negative equity value at the end of 1999.

The Respondent points out that more importantly, however, for the purpose of the
Base Model, Prof. Z assumed that nothing would have changed after 1 January
2000; i.e. in the manner in which the company operated, its performance of contracts,
its expenditure in core areas, would have all remained the same. The Respondent
submits that this fact is of critical importance since the positive book value of K

even in the Base Model eroded from PLD 122 million in 1996 to PLN 11 million in
1999. According to the Respondent, Prof. Z fails to explain how this dramatic
fall in the company’s equity, which started in 1997, would have stopped in 1999 but
for the tax measures. Given that the company was burning equity in 1999 at the rate
of PLN 6 million per month, it can be assumed that the company’s equity would have

been significantly below zero by 30 June 2000.

144

421.

422.

423.

424.

In the Respondent’s view, this loss in equity was caused by nothing other than the
flawed economics of K __, including its debt to equity structure, inefficient
organization, exorbitant expenditures, flawed rapeseed acquisition policy and bad

contracts.

According to the Respondent, none of these issues would have been suddenly resolved
after 1 January 2000. K did not take any measures in this regard. The Respondent
argues that the months after 1 January 2000 should, therefore, have been taken into
account in the Base Model and if they had, the company would have continued its
downward spiral in 2000 in the absence of the tax proceedings. The Respondent
submits that given the low level of equity at the end of 1999, it would have gone into

bankruptcy within these six months.

A second critical flaw in the Opinion, in the Respondent’s view, s is that they are
based on two very different versions of K —_. The Respondent points out that the first
K is supposed to replicate the historical performance of the company in the
absence of the tax proceedings. This simulation ends on 31 December 1999 and its
purpose is to show that in the absence of the tax proceedings, the company would not
have collapsed. The Respondent further points out that the second K came into
existence after 1 January 2000 for the purposes of quantifying damages. The
difference between this K and the first K is the former’s ability to generate
more revenues (PLN 515 million for the year 2000) at lower costs. The level of
correction performed on the cost levels of the company by Prof. Z amounts to
over PLN 60 million per year. Prof. Z justifies this on the basis that the
performance of the first K was effected by certain one-off non-recurring events in
1999, in the absence of which the cost of sales and administrative expenses of K

would have decreased by over PLN 60 million.

The Respondent contests this view of the year 1999 as a one-off and argues that it was
in fact in line with the way the market had been developing through the 90s — flat
consumption, surplus production capacity and fierce competition. In the Respondent’s

view, disregarding the events that occurred in 1999 and how they affected the

145

425.

company’s revenues contradicts the basic assumption underlying the Base Model, i.e.
that all factors other than the tax proceedings were to be included. The result is that
Prof. Z analysis, rather than showing that K would not have gone
bankrupt in mid-2000 in the absence of the tax proceedings, shows that an entirely
different company (the second K __) would have performed spectacularly in 2000.
Prof. Z fails to explain how the company would have turned its fortunes around

in this manner.

According to the Respondent, Prof. Z analysis was also plagued by the

following inconsistencies and contradictions:

(i) He was unable to identify the main competitors of K with respect to its key
products, margarine and oil, and as a result did not include U , the

principal competitor of the company, in his analysis;?°°

(ii) He was unable to explain the basic assumptions behind his alternative model

and admitted not to have read the documents relating to the tax proceedings;7°°

(iii) He was not aware why K _ had been recapitalized by its shareholders, even

though the information was on record;7°!

(iv) He did not know how the market forecast its future in 1999;

(v) He failed to analyse key loan agreements entered into by the company such as
the US$ 22 million BSK loan, which imposed certain obligations on K with
respect to its debt-to-equity ratio and which K failed to meet, thereby

creating a technical default with a major lender; and

(vi) Several key assumptions made by him were undermined by Mr. R during

his cross-examination. For instance, Mr. R was clear that U was

K main competitor and not K 3°62 Mr. R was clear that there was no
expectation on the Polish rapeseed market that it would significantly improve
in 2000 or 2001;2© and Mr. R was clear that Poland was a stabilized shelf-

market with no significant growth potential.7°

The Respondent submits that Prof. Z cross-examination revealed the errors
in his conclusions, in particular his attempt to show that K bankruptcy was
caused by the tax proceedings by reference to the book value of the equity. The
Respondent submits that realizing this Prof. Z began to dilute his reasoning
with increasingly less believable explanations such as the Base Model only being a
model for the worst-case scenario. The Respondent argues that it is not the role of the
damages expert to establish the worst-case scenario, but to establish the most probable
scenario. Moreover, the Respondent submits that what all the explanations that he put
forward have in common is that they are based entirely on speculation and
assumptions which are impossible to conclusively confirm or deny and which cannot

form the basis of an arbitral award.
Reasons for K bankruptcy

According to the Respondent, the primary reasons for K bankruptcy were (i) an
aggressive debt leverage policy resulting in high financial costs for the company; (ii)
the inability of the company to generate sufficient cash flows to cover operating and
financial costs; (iii) the lack of any restructuring; and (iv) the failure to recapitalize

the company. All of these were compounded by unfavourable market conditions.

The Respondent submits that between 1994 and 1998, K implemented a capacity
extension program. To this end, the Respondent points out that in the Privatization
Agreement, the investors committed to a US$ 38.3 million investment program. Mr.

R___inhis letter of September 1994 refers to a US$ 35 million investment program.

million. Prof. Z states that the company spent over PLN 201 million in

investment between 1994 and 1998.65

The Respondent points out that according to Mr.R __, the Claimants expected to be
able to finance part of the investment program with a US$ 10 million injection while
the remaining amount was expected to be generated from K internal cash flow.
The Respondent submits that the company’s financial statements, however, show that
the gross profit for the year preceding the investment was PLN 14.35 million
(approximately US$ 5 million). According to the Respondent, the company could not
finance the investment program through internal sources. The Claimants were, so the
Respondent submits, faced with three choices: (i) default on their contractual
obligations under the Privatization Agreement; (ii) recapitalize the company with
equity; or (iii) increase the debt leverage. The company chose the third option and
financed the investment program with bank loans carrying an interest of between 15-
25% per annum. This imposed a financial burden on the company above and beyond
the usual cost of raising external financing each year for the acquisition of rapeseed
in July and August. As a result, the company entered a downward spiral of debt
financing which by 1999 exceeded any rational debt-to-equity ratio according to the

Respondent.

The Respondent states that by the time this program was completed in 1998 the market
conditions had changed. Most of its competitors had also completed similar programs,
while consumption had stagnated. The result was increasing competition and price
wars in 1999 and 2000, which, according to the Respondent, resulted in the
elimination of K and B from the market. K demise was only
accelerated by bad management decisions including the acquisition of rapeseed at

above market price.

Equally important, in the Respondent’s view, was the company’s failure to

recapitalize. While the Claimants argued that the reason they did not inject further

capital into the company was because of the tax proceedings, in actual fact W had
already exhausted the equity contributed by its partners and further capital could not
be raised because of issues relating to the valuation of the partnership.” Moreover,
the Respondent states that the market in Poland at the time was not an attractive option

for investment.

According to the Respondent, the Claimants’ own actions contributed to the
magnitude of its tax problems. The Claimants’ actions (or inaction) resulted in a
snowball effect that eventually made the tax problems unmanageable. The
Respondent contends that it was possible for K to pay the arrears immediately,
thereby capping the interest at a relatively low level and saving its investment
incentives. This could have been done as early as the Memorandum from A

A in July 1996 alerting Mr. H and Mr. M that the Management
Fee scheme was dubious and likely to have tax consequences.”*” The Respondent
points out that Mr. M is on record saying that the company felt that it did not
owe the taxes and therefore, as a matter of principle, it was decided that funds would
not be provided to K to pay taxes, which were not due.?®* Leaving aside whether
this view was justified, the Respondent submits that the result was that the company
did not take any action to mitigate the effects of the adverse tax decisions and the tax

arrears and interest thereon continued to grow until it reached an unmanageable level.

Similarly, so the Respondent states, the company did not follow its tax counsel’s
advice and pay the arrears in 1999 because the amounts were allegedly significant.
This, however, ignores the fact that (i) the ability to raise funds on short notice was
part of the company’s business, i.e. it raised almost US$ 45 million each year for the
rapeseed acquisition campaign;”® and (ii) the company had made a provision for the
tax arrears in April 1998. The whole purpose of a provision is that a company reserves

the financial means to pay the liability.

Conduct of the tax proceedings

According to the Respondent, the central issue before this Tribunal is whether the tax
proceedings were consistent with international law. In the Respondent’s view, this
Tribunal has to decide whether it is surprising, shocking, unfair or unjust from an
international law perspective that the company lost the tax case. The record of the tax
proceedings show that the company was transferring exorbitant fees to a newly
established entity - W — in consideration for non-material services for which the
company kept no record. According to the Respondent, that the company lost the tax

case in these circumstances is hardly surprising.
Insufficient record keeping

According to the Respondent, the principal reason the company lost the tax dispute
was because its record of the Management Services was deficient. This was
recognized as a key issue, by the Supreme Administrative Court in W , in its
two judgments of 10 August 2000, with respect to the 1995 proceedings.””” Where the
provision of services was properly documented, such as in the case of the company’s
expenses on services provided by E Y in 1996, they were allowed as CIT

tax deductible.

In most instances, so the Respondent argues, the company was unable to provide
reliable evidence that the Management Fees were actually paid in return for services
rendered. According to the Respondent, the company then attempted to conceal its
failure to keep any records by fabricating antedated records. In the Respondent’s view,

for instance:

(i) Most records of the provision of Management Services in
1994 and 1995 in the possession of the Company at the time
of the tax inspection were fabricated agreements, cost
estimates and cost reports, which described fictitious
services and were signed by a person who only became
Ww proxy on 8 December 1995.

210 CE-231 and CE-296.

150

(ii) Some of the documents were manifestly untrustworthy, e.g.
because they attested time-entries of W consultants
exceeding 24 hours of work per day.

(iii) | During the tax inspection regarding the 1997 CIT arrears,
the Company was unable to present even copies of the
agreements under which the services were allegedly
provided by W __, not to mention any documents proving
that the services were genuinely rendered.

(iv) — When it finally provided these documents, two months after
the original request by the tax inspectors, it turned out that:
(a) some of the documents had no reference to the content of
the service agreements; (b) other were prepared by
Company’s employees, sent to S/W __ and then, after
being rubberstamped by W __, submitted as evidence of the
services allegedly provided by the latter; whereas yet
another part of them (c) was already submitted to the tax
authorities as evidence of the services allegedly provided in
1996. Moreover, the documents were delivered to the tax
authorities in such pristine condition that it gave rise to
legitimate doubts as to whether the documents had ever been
read. The fact that these documents were created within the
Company and rubberstamped by W was actually pointed
to the tax inspectors by a former chief of controlling at the
Company.?”!

437. In the Respondent’s view, the scarce and fabricated evidence presented by the
company contrasted with the exorbitant Management Fees paid. The Respondent
points out that the lack of documentation was highlighted by a partner at A

A , the company’s tax counsel, in a letter of 15 October 1997” stating that:

(i) His team “received virtually no documentation supporting the charges, made to

Bo;

(ii) The support from the company “is not adding much substantiation in the area
where the tax authorities addressed their problems in accepting the charges;”

and

(iii) Given these circumstances, A A help in a court case “could be

very limited.”

438. The Respondent points out that in 1999, after the Tax Chamber upheld the Tax Office

decision relating to the 1995 arrears,?”? A A advised the company not to

file an appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court because of the poor

documentation provided by the company and the thorough work done by the Tax

Office.?”* The company ignored this advice, challenged the decision and lost.

439. According to the Respondent, at the hearing Mr. R was forced to admit

company did not have the proper documentation:

...we got caught between a way, a methodology that we were using,
and the Polish laws, and we didn't - - we blew it. We didn't have
proportionately what we should have. And then faking documents or
backdating documents is obviously the company trying to cover up
for not having the documentation. On the other hand, we didn't know
about the documentation when we started.?”>

alleged unreasonable requests for documentation. The Respondent submits that the

objective of the tax authorities was to clarify the facts of the case and to do so they

legitimately exercised their investigatory powers and asked questions relating to the
Management Services. The questions asked by the tax authorities were reasonable in
the Respondent’s view: how were payments allocated to W for specific services?
Who were the consultants? Which consultants authored the reports submitted to the
tax authorities? What is the proof that the specific services were provided? What was

the contractual basis for the provision of these services??””

The Respondent argues that in accordance with Polish case-law, legal doctrine and
the practice of tax authorities, the burden to prove that certain expenses were incurred
and can be deducted for the purposes of CIT rests on the taxpayer. Only the taxpayer
has the information required to establish whether such a deduction is justified. The
Respondent points out that Article 15.1 of the CIT Law requires proof that a service
was in fact provided and that there is a link between the cost and the generation of

revenue. Only the taxpayer can establish both.

According to the Respondent, on the one hand, the Claimants argue that the tax
authorities had no legal basis to ask for anything beyond the mere proof of payment
of Management Fees. On the other hand, they argue that the tax authorities did not
conduct an exhaustive investigation. The Claimants also argue that requests for the
identity of consultants and requests for assigning authorship of particular work to
individual consultants were unreasonable. The Respondent also points out that the
Claimants further emphasize that the tax authorities refused to question the foreign
consultants. The Claimants, however, fail to explain how the tax authorities were
supposed to question them, if, according to the Claimants interpretation of the law,

the tax authorities could not even ask for the identity of the consultants.

The Respondent submits that when the Claimants eventually disclosed the identity of
some consultants, they provided neither their contact addresses nor specified the scope
of the work they had done. According to the Respondent, the record reveals that in

2011 Mr.M was unable to recognize the names of some of the individuals who

277 Respondent’s Rejoinder dated 20 March 2014, para. 197.

153

445.

 

had been shown as consultants to the tax authorities.?”* The Claimants also allege that
their motions to hear the consultants were disregarded, but only rely on a single
motion filed on 14 August 1997. The Respondent asks if the Claimants believed that
the statements of foreign consultants were so important, why did they only file a single

motion in only one of seven tax proceedings?

The Respondent submits that the motion of 14 August 1997 is itself couched in such
general language that it is of no use — it does not specify witnesses that should be
examined and it does not specify the scope of their testimony. The Respondent
submits that when it responded to the Claimants’ allegation that the tax authorities
disregarded motions to hear five witnesses by showing that these five witnesses were
examined, the Claimants changed tack and argued that examination of these five
witnesses was insufficient. Had the examination been insufficient, so the Respondent
contends, the Claimants could have used their right to ask the witnesses questions to
bring out any facts, which were not brought out in the tax authorities’ examination.
They did not. Instead, the Claimants rely on their subjective feeling of dissatisfaction
with the outcome of the tax proceedings to argue that the proceedings constituted an

international wrongly act.

The Respondent submits that the use of fabricated and antedated documents by the
Claimants in the tax proceedings also calls into questions the Claimants’ credibility.
According to the Respondent, its position in relation to these documents is
corroborated by the Memorandum dated 23 July 1997 from Mr. M to Mr.

R__ ,27? which discloses that:

(i) the Claimants were aware that ex post fabrication of documents
for purposes of tax proceedings, including backdating, was contrary
to the Polish law and that it would inflict complete loss of credibility
of the Company in the tax proceedings, (ti) that backdating of the
consulting agreement between the Company and W was done
contrary to the specific legal advice of the then Polish counsel of
W sand that as the result of that backdating, that legal counsel
withdrew from representing the client (sic!), (iii) that nobody at the

Company was able to provide the tax authorities with a good
explanation, which services contracts were in force with respect to
the alleged Management Services; (iv) that according to A

A (the then tax counsel of W_), provision of non-material
services in the context of cross-border transfers implied the need to
provide Polish authorities with detailed evidence of the services
provided, (v) that the tax counsel was involved lately in the tax
inspection - A A was not in the Company when the tax
inspection arrived and its offer for assistance was initially refused,
(vi) that the chances of success of the Company in the tax
proceedings were described as “very remote” and were believed to
hinge on the ability of W _ to find strong and persuasive evidence
of the services provided. The Memorandum also reports a rather
disillusioned assessment of the Company’s position by an A

A partner: “he has never seen such a poor case- he stated
that ‘everything was done wrong’”. This is echoed by the words of
Ss D.M , the author of the Memorandum: “Our options

at this point are not very good.”?®°

(vii) Irrelevance of the question whether the Management Services were provided

446. The Respondent argues that the question of whether or not the Management Services
were provided is irrelevant to the present dispute. The Respondent’s position is not
that all of the alleged services were fictitious. The Respondent admits that certain non-
material services could have been provided to K . As a matter of fact, the tax
authorities themselves recognized this and allowed the expenses related to some
services as tax deductible costs.”*! This does not, however, in the eyes of the
Respondent, mean that the Management Fees were not primarily used to drain funds
from K nor that the tax authorities were incorrect in disallowing them as tax

deductible costs.

447. The source documents provided by the Claimants show that the Management Fees
were designed to cover operating expenses and activities of W while the excess

was transferred to W partners.?*? The Claimants sought to escape their tax

obligations in Poland with respect to these fees by designing a tax structure involving

Ww and relying on the provisions of the DTT.?**

The Respondent points out that these Management Fees began to be charged as soon
asS purchased shares in K __, even prior to the establishment of W and the
tax structure for payment of the fees. The general service agreement?** was antedated
in such a manner that it was entered into by acompany—W —— which did not exist

at the time. According to the Respondent:

...when the tax inspection began, someone in the Company
apparently panicked and presented the tax authorities with the
documentation which was made up from A to Z in most dilettante
manner, specifying fictitious dates, services, cost estimates and
values. The Company continued this chutzpah even in 1999, alleging
it had been receiving valuable services that were so intangible they
did not even leave a trace of a paper-trail, just to come back after
two months with a set of pristine printouts of ‘reports’ that contained
a potpourri of very general presentations, scientific papers of
internal documents produced by the marketing and controlling
departments of the Company.®°
In these circumstances, so the Respondent argues, the reaction of the tax authorities

was justified.

The Respondent submits that the tax decisions are not final as a matter of Polish law
and the Claimants should not be given a second bite at the apple to argue that those
decisions were incorrect. However, even if they are given such an opportunity, the
Claimants have failed, in the Respondent’s view, to show which services were
genuine, what their market value was and whether they generated revenue for K

Instead the Claimants only rely on the Decision on Discontinuation and the written
communication of Ms. B . With regard to the Decision on Discontinuation,

the Respondent argues that

[t]he decision of Prosecutor J was issued in 2011, in the
context of criminal proceedings, which have different nature,

283 Letter fromA = A to Mr. B dated 15 September 1994 (RE-242).
284 CE-112.
285 Respondent’s Rejoinder dated 20 March 2014, para. 229.

156

subject matter and focus than tax proceedings. The decision on
discontinuation of the criminal proceedings was concerned with
examination of grounds for criminal responsibility, and not with the
prerequisites for CIT-deductibility of specific non-material services.
Furthermore, the Prosecutor’s view expressed in the decision is not
an authoritative statement under Polish law. Rather, it is an opinion
expressed by a single-person criminal organ of the state to explain
the reasons for his decision. This reasoning does not carry the
effects of res judicata under Polish law and does not affect the
finality of the tax decisions nor the judgments of the Supreme
Administrative Court of 8 August 2000.7*°

450. With regard to Ms. B , the Respondent argues that she

...was an experienced specialist in the tax inspection authority in
O _ , until the time when she was engaged by the Company as an
employee. In other words, either the Claimants or the Company
convinced Ms. B to change sides in the midst of the tax
dispute in which she was involved. Effectively, from one day to
another she became involved in the tax proceedings on the side of
the Company, questioning the acts of her former colleagues.
Actually, she was the representative of the Company that removed
certain documents from control of the tax inspectors in November
1999, 787
The Respondent submits that while the Claimants argue that Ms. B acted to
their detriment in the criminal proceedings, in 1999 they employed her in K_,
offered her a high salary and involved her in representing K before the tax

authorities.
(viii) Alleged bias of the tax authorities

451. According to the Respondent, a crucial part of the Claimants’ case is that the tax
authorities involved in the K proceedings were incompetent and biased. The best
place to prove this, in the Respondent’s view, would have been through cross-
examining the officials involved at the hearing. The cross-examinations of the Polish

tax officials — Mr. K , Ms. P and Ms. S — by the

Claimants clearly showed that these officials were competent and well versed with

286 Thid, para, 233.
2°87 Thid, para, 234.

157

Polish tax law. The Respondent points out that these officials also explained that the
bonus system was a standard component of remuneration of tax officials at the time
and was not something extraordinary as argued by the Claimants. In the Respondent’s
view, the Claimants have failed to establish any causal link between the bonus

awarded to particular individuals and the conduct or outcome of the tax proceedings.
452. With regard to the bonus system, the Respondent further submits that:

(i) Contrary to what the name ‘bonus’ may suggest, the bonuses
were a standard component of remuneration of tax officials,
awarded on a quarterly basis. The record shows bonuses
were awarded (but in a reduced amount) also to officials,
who for most time were on sick leave, or who had bad
results.

(ii) Bonuses were awarded also to those tax officials, who were
not involved in the inspection at the Company. The
comparison of the amounts of bonuses awarded to the
officials involved and the officials uninvolved in the
inspection of the Company does not show any differences in
the level of compensation. The tax officers identified by the
Claimants’ as alleged predators of bounties related to the
tax inspection at the Company, did not usually receive
highest bonuses, nor bonuses that would have been
significantly higher than the bonuses awarded to their
colleagues. As a matter of fact, the differences between
bonuses awarded to all inspectors and employees were not
significant.

(iii) = The amounts of the bonuses, in absolute terms, were also far
from having corruptive potential. The highest quarterly
premiums on the record at that time amounted to PLN
10.000 (i.e. approximately USD 2.500 - 3.000 per 3 months,
equals USD 800-1000 per month). However, on most
occasions the bonuses varied from PLN 3000 to PLN 8000
per quarter, i.a. PLN 1000 to PLN 2700 per month (USD
300 to USD 900).

(iv) There is no clear and direct link between the amount of the
bonuses awarded to tax officials and the amounts of tax
arrears determined with respect to the Company, or
collected from the Company. The Claimants allege that the
bonuses of the tax officials were paid from the 20 % of the
sums collected from the taxpayer. Since the Company

158

453.

(ix)

454.

eventually paid PLN 12 million in tax arrears, the aggregate
sum of all bonuses to all tax officials do not come even close
to 20 % of that amount.

(v) Both the bonus lists and the accompanying orders give
insight into the theory and practice of the criteria which
were taken into account when awarding bonuses.
Effectiveness was rewarded, but so was good quality of work
and involvement in complex proceedings. On the other hand,
there are also comments indicating ‘poor supervision over
the inspection and flawed inspection protocol’ or ‘poor
quality of post-inspection materials’, as comments justifying
lower amount of bonuses. This implies that the tax officials
were discouraged from pushing for results at the expense of
quality of their work. This was not an “eat-what-you-kill”
system.

  

(vi) The tax officials, singled out by the Claimants for their
involvement in the tax inspection at the Company, also
received commendations for their work related to
inspections at other companies at that time.?**

According to the Respondent, the foregoing record shows that Claimants’ argument
that the bonus system biased tax officials against the company has no basis in fact.
Moreover, it must be taken into account that other countries such as Canada have a

similar scheme for remuneration of tax officials.”*?

Weight of the Supreme Administrative Court’s judgments of 10 August 2000

The Respondent points out that the decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court of
10 August 2000 relating to the tax proceedings for 1995 were the only decisions which
addressed the merits of the Tax Claim and are, therefore, crucial to understanding the
tax proceedings. According to the Respondent, the key conclusions of the Court were

as follows:

(i) If...a rule of substantive law makes the possibility of
enjoying a tax privilege (tax credit, reduction of taxable
base) dependent on the taxpayer proving that certain facts

(vii)

have occurred, the burden of proof shall be upon that
taxpayer.

...the tax authorities properly examined all the events, to
which the costs are related, specifically, in a situation where
there is no unequivocal evidence that the services were
provided.

In the case at hand the tax authorities assessed
enforceability for tax purposes not only of the 2 December
1994 agreement but also of the agreements of 27 January, 6
February and 30 May 1995. It should be assumed that in this
case the evidence material fully authorized the tax
authorities to deem that the agreements signed by the
applicant with the company W in W were of
ostensible nature and were aimed solely at reducing the
income tax amount due to the State Treasury...

both, the first instance tax authority and the second
instance tax authority, generally considered _ the
expenditures on intangible services to be tax deductible
costs. In this case these expenditures were questioned due to
no evidence to prove the services actually provided.

...The tax authorities were specifically thorough when
conducting the evidentiary proceedings...

..As regards the applicant’s claims that the appellate
authority refused to admit as evidence Attachments no. 36
and 50-52 to the pleading of 21 January 1999, one should
fully agree with the stance presented by the Tax Chamber in
reply to the complaint that the documents referred to by the
applicant were submitted to the tax authorities after almost
two years had passed from the date when the taxpayer was
obliged to submit the same. The submitted studies do not
generally bear a signature of the author or a date when they
were prepared...

«One cannot accept the party’s claim that the tax
authorities had entirely disregarded the explanations
provided by the party...The majority of claims contained in
the complaint is actually a discussion with the assessment of
evidence made by the tax authorities. In accordance with
Article 191 of the Tax Code, a tax authority assesses on the
basis of the collected evidence whether the fact was proved.
In the Court’s opinion, the tax authorities assessed the

 

160

455. These two judgments, according to the Respondent, show that the Claimants are

456.

(viii)

evidence in a complete and logical manner, and their
assessment may not be claimed to be arbitrary...

... The presented charge of long-lasting idleness on the part
of the tax authorities is not grounded in the facts, since the
procedures applicable in this case for both the first instance
and the second instance authorities were not violated. It
follows from the case files that during the explanatory
proceedings the party presented numerous materials. In
order to enable the applicant to submit such materials and,
next, to have them analysed by the first instance authority,
the Tax Office several times extended the proceedings in
time...?°°

essentially re-litigating the tax issues in the present dispute. The Claimants’ arguments
relating to the interpretation of Article 15 of the CIT Law, the analysis of the evidence
by the tax authorities and the alleged delay in the proceedings have all been addressed

and decided by the Supreme Administrative Court.

The Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to address, let alone rebut,
these findings. The Claimants have not claimed denial of justice with respect to the
decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court; rather, they have complained about
the irregularities of the tax proceedings without addressing these decisions at all.

According to the Respondent, these judgments

(i) defeat the Claimants’ contention that the record-keeping policy of
the Company was in line with the requirements of the contemporary
Polish law; (ii) defeat the Claimants’ contention that the tax
authorities acted in an arbitrary manner or that the process of
evidence-taking by the tax authorities were flawed; (iii) defeat the
Claimants’ views concerning the allocation of the burden of proof
with respect to tax-deductible expenditures, and (iv) defeat the
allegation of bounty-driven bias, since the alleged incentives
(bonuses) did not apply to the judges at the Supreme Administrative
Court.”*!

(x) Reliance on decisions inW and W cases

457. The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ reliance on the decisions in the W

proceedings is not justified since:

()

(ii)

(iii)

According to the Respondent, both cases turned on their own peculiar facts
established with reference to the record of each case. The cases involved
different agreements, different services, different evidence and different
procedural conduct of the taxpayer. These differences can only be appreciated
on the basis of the decisions in the W proceedings (since the files were
destroyed in 2009). The Claimants have, however, failed to show that the

decisions in both cases are comparable.

The Respondent further submits that to the extent that the same points of law
were involved in both proceedings but were decided differently, such
differences are justified on the basis of public policy arguments such as (a) the
need to afford quasi-judicial autonomy to tax authorities deciding cases; (b) the
need to preserve confidentiality of sensitive information related to tax
proceedings; and (c) due process and rule of law requirements, in accordance
with which the case of each taxpayer should be determined in the basis of the

facts of his case rather than those of another taxpayer.

In the Respondent’s view, an investor may not invoke a favourable, but
incorrect, decision (in this case the Respondent argues that the decision in the
Ww cases, which was never challenged before the Supreme Administrative
Court was incorrect) to overturn an unfavourable decision, the legality of which
has already been confirmed by an independent domestic court in a final

judgment.

(xi) Probative value of Prof: G Expert Legal Opinion

458. According to the Respondent, the Claimants rely heavily on Prof. G

Expert Legal Opinion to establish the alleged impropriety of the tax proceedings. The

Respondent argues that the said Opinion suffers from serious defects that undermine

162

459.

460.

 

its credibility and value. For instance, Prof. G admitted that his review of
the source documents was limited to 106 items listed at the end of his report and that
“\..1 did not have access to all the documentation from all the years. If I had had to
do it, I would not take upon myself the writing of the opinion in such a short time.”?°
According to the Respondent, such an admission is sufficient to establish the lack of
thoroughness of his analysis. Yet despite not reading all the source documents, Prof.

G did not shy away from making sweeping conclusions.

The Respondent points out that at the hearing, Prof. G admitted that he
did not know on what legal basis the Management Fees had been disallowed as CIT-
deductible costs; in particular, decisions of the tax authorities. When confronted with
the tax inspection office decision for 1994, the decision of the Tax Chamber for 1994
and the decision of the Tax Office of B for 1995, he stated that his conclusion that
Article 11 of the CIT Law was the only legal basis for the disallowance might have
been based only on the decisions for 1994.79? Except that he had previously admitted

to not having read the decisions for the year 1994.

According to the Respondent, Prof. G also admitted?” to not having read
the Supreme Administrative Court’s decisions dated 10 August 2002 — the only
decisions to consider the merits of the Claimants tax case. While in his Opinion he
stated that the tax authorities disregarded K evidentiary motions,*> during his
cross-examination he admitted that this was an assumption he made.” Similarly, the
Respondent points out that when questioned on the alleged bias of tax officials, Prof.
G could not recall the particular officers involved in the proceedings and
simply stated that he inferred bias from the content of their decisions.?°” With regard
to his conclusions on Polish law, Prof. G admitted that his report did not

reflect the position of Polish law but rather the desires of the expert.7°*

461. Finally the following exchange during the hearing raises doubts about his impartiality,

according to the Respondent:

[Q:] ...only a minority of those 106 items [i.e. the documents Prof.
G reviewed in preparation of his expert report] are
expressly referenced to in your expert report, and I wanted to ask
you why.

A: I saw no reason why the thesis, in my opinion, should be based
on other documents. I selected those which seemed to fit the thesis
which I posited...”

462. For the foregoing reasons, the Respondent submits that Prof. G

does not constitute credible evidence.

(2) The Tribunal’s analysis

opinion

463. The question before the Tribunal is whether in terms of Article VII of the BIT the

Claimants’ investment in K

tax proceedings.

464. Article VII provides as follows:

ARTICLE VII Compensation for Expropriation

1. Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either
directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation
or nationalization (“expropriation”) except for a public purpose, in
a nondiscriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate
and effective compensation, and in accordance with due process of
law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article
II (6). Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of
the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory
action was taken or became publicly known, whichever is earlier;
be paid without delay, include interest at a commercially reasonable
rate, such as LIBOR plus an appropriate margin, from the date of
expropriation; be fully realizable; be freely transferable; and
calculated on the basis of the prevailing market rate of exchange for
commercial transactions on the date of expropriation.

5 Also sometimes referred to as “de facto,

Article VII of the Treaty is in mandatory terms. It provides that investments “shall not
be expropriated or nationalised.” It covers both expropriation and “measures

tantamount to expropriation.”

It is not the Claimants’ case that the Respondent expropriated their property through
formal transfer of title or outright physical seizure. The Claimants argue that tax
measures and other concerted actions by the Respondent resulted in the Claimants

being deprived of their investment.

Given the language of Article VII, the Tribunal must first examine whether acts by
the Respondent were measures tantamount to expropriation.*” If its conclusion is in
the affirmative, it must then further examine whether the pre-conditions established
by Article VII for a lawful expropriation are met. To be lawful in the terms of Article
VII, an expropriation must be (i) for a public purpose, (ii) carried out in a non-
discriminatory manner, (iii) upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation and (iv) in accordance with due process of law and the general
principles of treatment provided for in Article II(6) of the BIT. The examination is,
therefore, a two-step process. First, the Tribunal has to examine whether the measures
may be characterized as an expropriation. Second, it has to determine whether such

expropriation was lawful or not.

Existence of an expropriation — bona fide measures

Both Parties agree that a bona fide exercise of taxation powers does not constitute
expropriation. If the Tribunal were to find the measures bona fide it will be dispositive

of the issue.

While the Claimants admit that bona fide tax measures would not constitute
expropriation, they argue that the present case does not concern the powers of the
Respondent relating to taxation, but to its conduct during the tax and criminal

proceedings which, according to the Claimants, was not bona fide.

‘creeping’ or “indirect” expropriation.

165

470.

b.

471.

472.

The Respondent contends that the disputed tax measures were bona fide and therefore,
cannot constitute expropriation since a State does not expropriate and is not liable to
compensate for loss of an investment or the impairment of its value when the loss or
impairment results from bona fide taxation measures. According to the Respondent it

is generally accepted that these are within the police powers of the State.

Existence of an expropriation — factors to consider in determining indirect
expropriation measures

The Claimants rely on the “sole effects doctrine,” i.e. that it is only the effect of the
State’s actions that is important in determining an indirect expropriation, and not the
intention of the State behind those actions. . The Claimants, however, have rightly
conceded that the sole effects doctrine cannot be applied in a complete vacuum. In
this context, the Claimants themselves rely on the observation of the Tribunal in

RosInvest v. Russia that

...the normal application of domestic tax law in the host State cannot be seen
as an expropriatory act. On the other hand, it is generally accepted that the
mere fact that measures by a host State are taken in the form of application
and enforcement of its tax law does not prevent a tribunal from examining
whether this conduct of the host state must be considered, under the
applicable BIT or other international treaties on investment protection, as
an abuse of tax law to in fact enact expropriation.»
In order to determine if certain measures constitute expropriation, what is to be seen
is whether, as claimed by the Claimants, there was an “abuse of tax law.” The guise
of taxation will not save the Host State from liability for actions, based on an abuse
of tax laws, if these resulted in the total loss or substantial impairment of the
investment tantamount to expropriation. The Tribunal will first examine the
Claimants’ arguments related to concerted efforts by the Respondent. It will then

analyse whether these measures could be considered to be such an abuse of tax law as

tantamount to expropriation.

391 RosInvest Co UK Lid. v. Russian Federation, para. 628 (CE-757).

166

473.

Ie

474.

475.

In view of the Parties’ pleadings, the Tribunal has to determine whether the measures
taken by the Respondent were a bona fide and a legitimate exercise of State power. If
the answer is in the affirmative, then the measures did not constitute an abuse of tax
law and according to the Parties’ admitted position, there could not have been any
expropriation. The Tribunal will, therefore, first examine the Claimants’ arguments
related to concerted action by the Respondent amounting to an abuse of tax law, and
then analyse whether the tax measures themselves were a bona fide and legitimate

exercise of regulatory power.

Concerted action

The Claimants argue that the tax measures in this case were part of a broader matrix
of measures taken by the Respondent, which taken together, deprived the Claimants
of their investment. In this regard, the Claimants rely heavily on the inter-linkages
between the tax proceedings and the criminal proceedings. In the Tribunal’s view, the
Claimants’ contention that the tax proceedings and the criminal proceedings were
interrelated is correct. The tax proceedings were in fact initiated at the request of the
Public Prosecutor. Various communications between the tax authorities and criminal
authorities and the use of testimony of tax officers in the criminal proceedings affirm

this interrelation.

At the same time, the Tribunal is mindful that the same set of facts may form the basis
of a civil offence and a criminal offence. It is not uncommon for two sets of
prosecutions, one on the civil side and the other on the criminal side, to be initiated
on the basis of the same facts. That these two sets of proceedings were being
conducted simultaneously and that the authorities were communicating with each
other does not by itself prove common design or support an argument that there was
concerted action to deprive the Claimants of their investment. The Claimants’
admission that the criminal proceedings were conducted in a fact-finding phase (and
not personally against the Claimants) and the fact that their own experts make no

mention of the criminal proceedings as a reason for the cause of K bankruptcy

167

contradict the Claimants’ stance that the criminal proceedings were part of

coordinated effort by the Respondent to deprive them of their investment.

476. The Claimants have also not produced any evidence to show that the tax proceedings

themselves were part of a concerted effort to deprive the Claimants of their

investment. The record in fact supports the opposite conclusion:

Through a letter dated 20 January 1999, a Director from the Department of
Finance of the State Treasury wrote to the Director of the Tax Chamber in O
requesting a favourable decision in K case since an adverse decision could

lead to the bankruptcy of the company.*

In its letter dated 3 November 1999, A A noted that the Tax
Chamber’s 1995 CIT decision was favourable for K with regard to
investment incentives because it was based on new rules introduced in the CIT
law. Further, the advisors stated that “The Tax Chamber decided not to question
the incentives even though the wording of the law might suggest that N

B lost the right to such incentives (interpretation supporting such a
restrictive approach was issued by the Ministry of Finance and published in one
of tax magazines).°° A A , therefore, warned that in case an appeal
was filed, the Supreme Administrative Court may find the Tax Chamber’s

decision in relation to the investment incentives contrary to the CIT law.

(v) The tax authorities only collected PLN 11 million out of more than PLN 55
million in tax arrears and were in fact willing to waive off up to 95% of the debt

through an amnesty scheme.

The foregoing record does not support a finding that there was concerted action on
the part of the Respondent’s agents to deprive the Claimants of their investment. In
fact, the record suggests that these were tax proceedings taking their regular course.
It is true that a number of the authorities’ decisions went against K , but even in
those decisions, there were aspects which favoured K ; further, some of these

decisions were reversed.

Biased, prejudiced and discriminatory conduct; denial of due process

The Claimants have also argued that the conduct of the tax authorities was biased,
prejudiced and discriminatory and that they were denied due process. For instance,
the Claimants argue that the tax authorities applied the transfer pricing rules through
non-binding guidelines when those rules had yet to be incorporated in the statute. The
Claimants further argue that the guidelines set unreasonable standards for providing
documentation, such as asking for physical proof of the Management Services and
asking K to identify the author of each work product; and rather than seeking the
objective truth, the tax authorities were motivated by a bonus system, which rewarded

them for issuing decisions against taxpayers.

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the evidence presented by the Parties and
concludes on the record before it that the primary reason that K lost the tax
proceedings was not because of the conduct of the tax authorities but because of
K insufficient record keeping. The Respondent concedes that its case is not that
no Management Services were provided, but that K did not adequately record and
document the provision of these Management Services to it for the purposes of
claiming deduction of the Management Fees. The Tribunal agrees with the statement
by the Supreme Administrative Court in its decision dismissing K appeal: “Jn
tax proceedings, the principle that the burden of proof rests with the person who

derives legal effects from this fact applies. Therefore, the taxpayer should document

169

480.

the incurred expenses and demonstrate a causal link between a particular expenditure

and the resulting income.”?°°

The record and documents to prove the fact, quantum and value of the Management
Services were or ought to have been in the control and possession of K __. It was
neither required of nor was it possible for the tax authorities to prove that no
Management Services were provided. The burden was on the Claimants to present
evidence in the correct form before the tax authorities. That the Claimants did not do
so despite being provided an opportunity by the tax authorities is manifest from the

following record:

(i) In a memorandum from Mr. M to Mr. R dated 23 July 1997, Mr.
M states that not only were documents, such as the main agreement for
the provision of Management Services, backdated against the advice of lawyers,
but that K tax advisor, A A view was that K had a very
weak case given that when A A itself successfully contested a

similar matter, the tax authorities sought very detailed documentation.*"”

(ii) In its letter dated 15 October 1997, A A stated that the lack of
documentation received from K in support of the payment of the
Management Fees suggests that the tax authorities may in fact be correct and

that it would be advisable for K to settle the matter.*°°

(iii) In its letter dated 27 October 1997, A A stated that in view of
K poor documentation and the thorough work done by the tax authorities,

the chances of an appeal succeeding were minimal.*°

(iv) In its letter dated 30 December 1997, A A stated that the Tax Office

inB had agreed to postpone issuing its decision till 31 January 1997 in order

482.

to give K time to provide additional documentation that would support the
provision of the Management Services by W __ ; yet despite there only being

one month left, no such documentation had been provided.*!°

(v) Inits letter dated 3 November 1999, A A recommended adopting a
new approach in the tax proceedings because it believed “that the change of
argumentation is needed as the lack of appropriate documentation denies other

ways of presenting the case to the authorities.”>"!

(vi) During the hearing, Mr.R _ himself admitted that

we got caught between a way, a methodology that we were using,

and the Polish laws, and we didn't -- we blew it. We didn't have

proportionately what we should have. And then faking documents or

backdating documents is obviously the company trying to cover up

for not having the documentation. On the other hand, we didn't know

about the documentation when we started.>'*
The Claimants’ own documents, therefore, instead of establishing their case
undermine it. These documents show that K was caught unaware by the tax
proceedings. It did not have adequate documentation to support the provision of the

Management Services.

The extent of K lack of preparation can be seen from the fact that it had not even
entered into a formal agreement for the provision of the Management Services. Such
a written agreement between K and W was created after-the-fact and
backdated to a date when W was yet to be incorporated. The Claimants’ expert,
Prof. G , Suggests in this regard that the backdated agreement was

nevertheless valid, testifying that

the tax authorities’ accusation that the Agreement of December 2,
1994 was antedated and thus invalid — because it was concluded
with an entity that had not been yet incorporated — is groundless.
This is because concluding contracts which confirm a prior verbal

50 RE-190.
31 RE-154,

171

arrangement between the parties is not a forgery. In fact, this is a
standard business practice. The agreement simply became
enforceable from the time W was entered into the commercial

register.>!

483. The Tribunal is not surprised by the fact that the tax authorities regarded such a back-
dated agreement with suspicion. The Tax Chamber in O observed when
upholding the Tax Office’s decision for 1994:

In tax proceedings, the strength of evidence is mainly given to the
documents which reflect the real course of a business transaction.
Those documents show clearly that on 2 December 1994 the
Appellant [K _] entered into an agreement for the provision of
services witha company[W | which did not exist then; therefore,
the agreement, as invalid, cannot give rise to any effect in terms of
obligations.*'+
The Tribunal sees no reason to disagree with this conclusion.

484. This Tribunal is not an appeals court sitting in judgment on the decision of the tax
authorities. Its task is to ascertain whether the Respondent is liable for actions of the
State authorities and reviewing whether these were in breach of the Respondent’s
obligations under the BIT. For this, convincing evidence has to be produced by the
Claimants. That burden has not been discharged here. In view of these facts, the
Tribunal is not prepared to hold that the actions of the tax authorities amounted to an
abuse of tax law in violation of the expropriation provision of the BIT.

485. The Tribunal is also not convinced that the taxation authorities were motivated by a
desire to destroy the business of the Claimants in insisting that the Claimants produce
convincing evidence of the provision and value of the Management Services or in not
accepting the agreement produced by the Claimants.

486. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the decisions issued during the tax proceedings
and the opinions of Prof. G (for the Claimants) and Prof. L and
Dr. T (for the Respondent) analysing these decisions. The Tribunal finds these

488.

decisions to be reasoned and supported by evidence. In each case, the authorities have
examined the evidence submitted by K in support of its arguments and provided
detailed reasoning for either accepting that evidence or rejecting it. For instance, the
Tax Chamber in O while reviewing the Tax Office’s decision for 1996 and

documentation submitted by K , observed that

...moreover, it should be underlined once again that these

documents which allegedly constituted the result of the execution of

the agreements which should be owned and used on a current basis

by the Appellant [K _], were submitted after two years of the

proceedings pending before the tax authorities. If they were not

owned by the Company and moreover, they were used as evidence

material within the period of three years, i.e. 1995-1997 modifying

only a name or transferring fragments from one study to the other

of a different title, in the opinion of this Tax Chamber it means they

were drawn up for the purpose of the pending proceedings.*!°
Prof. G admits that the invoices issued by W and presented to the tax
authorities by K “did not relate to a particular written agreement” and “did not
specify the method for calculating the Management Fees.” He, however, submits that
“the tax authorities did not take into account that the law did not impose such specific
requirements for invoice description. The invoices issued by W for Management
Services were in line with the law and did not depart from the contemporaneous
market practice at the time.”>!® In the Tribunal’s view, it is not unreasonable for the
tax authorities to require invoices to be linked to a particular agreement (especially
when the first agreement was entered into with an entity that did not exist at the time)
or to specify the manner in which the Management Fees were calculated. This
Tribunal is not inclined to hold that these actions were not in the normal course of the

functions of the tax authorities to assess and collect such taxes or that these were taken

only under the veil of taxation for an unrelated purpose.

Similarly, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Prof. G suggestion that the
tax authorities only concentrated on gathering evidence unfavourable to K The

Tribunal also notes that K was associated with the tax proceedings from the

315 Decision of Tax Chamber in dated 28 February 2002 (CE-178).

beginning. It was K that received the Management Services. It stands to reason

that K was best placed to produce any evidence in its favour.

In his Opinion, Prof. G also suggests that K evidentiary motions
were rejected and that this constituted a serious breach of procedural law. Yet during
his cross-examination, he admitted that this was an assumption he had made." Prof.
G Opinion also focused on the tax authorities’ abuse of transfer pricing
regulations and in particular their misapplication of Article 11 of the CIT law.
According to Prof. G the tax authorities “did not go beyond referring to
Article 1] of the CIT Law as the only basis for excluding Management Fees from tax
deductible costs.”?'* An examination of the tax decisions, however, shows that Article
11 of the CIT law was not the only basis of these decisions. The tax authorities relied

equally, if not more heavily, on Article 15 of the CIT law.

As observed above, this Tribunal is not sitting in appeal on the decisions of the tax
authorities in Poland. In this regard, it needs to be emphasized that the tax authorities’
decisions relating to CIT and VAT for the year 1995 were upheld by the Supreme
Administrative Court through two judgments dated 10 August 2000. These judgments
were not the result of denial of justice or abuse of process, nor have the Claimants
made any such claim. Apart from these two judgments of the Supreme Administrative
Court, however, all other decisions were of lower administrative tribunals or the tax
authorities themselves. If these other decisions violated the Claimants’ rights, they
could have challenged them in Poland through the prescribed judicial hierarchy. They

chose not to do so.

The Claimants cannot now seek to challenge these decisions in an international
arbitration. It is not for this Tribunal to rule on the correctness of those decisions as a
matter of Polish law. Its task in the present context is to determine whether the
Respondent breached the expropriation provision of the BIT through actions by the

State authorities using the tax proceedings as a guise to expropriate or nationalise the

8'T. Day 4, 45:14-18.

493.

Claimants’ investment, or that these measures were tantamount to expropriation or
nationalisation. The burden to establish this through convincing evidence was on the

Claimants. That burden has not been discharged.

Tf all that a Claimant is required to demonstrate, in order to claim a violation of the
BIT’s expropriation provision, is an incidental detriment to its business by a taxation
measure, then that would amount to a blanket prohibition on the State to adopt or
implement any taxation measures which impacts a foreign investor or investment. For
instance, a foreign investor may decide not to pay any taxes and as a result incur
penalties in the Host State, which then may lead to the collapse of the investor’s
business. Insofar as these penalties were imposed in the exercise of the ordinary
taxation powers of the State, in a bona fide manner, such measures cannot be equated
to expropriation or to a measure tantamount to expropriation. Bilateral investment
treaties are meant to protect foreign investors against actions by a State in breach of
the BIT; they are not meant to shield foreign investors from a bona fide exercise of

the taxation power of the State.

The Claimants contend that the bonus system was one of the prime motivations behind
the tax inspections and, ultimately, the decisions passed against K at the first
instance. According to the Claimants, the bonus system resulted in a bias against
taxpayers suchas K __. The bonus system, however, is not peculiar to Poland. Other
countries, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, also implement similar schemes
to incentivise tax officials. While the merits of a policy of awarding bonuses to tax
officials based on the tax collected by them may be debated, the simple fact that such
a policy was in place does not constitute evidence for a conclusion of bias in this
particular case. The bonus system was available for the tax officials who conducted
the tax inspections and issued decisions at the first instance. The Claimants themselves
admit that the bonuses once granted, were non-refundable and “were not returned by
tax officials even if their initial decisions were later reversed or changed in tax appeal

proceedings.”*" It is clear from this that the process through which decisions of tax

39 Claimants’ Memorial dated 8 May 2012, para. 225.

175

494.

495.

officials were appealed and reviewed was completely independent of the bonus
system. The bonus system did not extend to the Tax Chamber or the Supreme
Administrative Court, both of which upheld the decisions of tax officials at the first
instance. The existence of the bonus system does not, therefore, of its own establish
that there was systemic bias against K which extended throughout the tax
hierarchy. The Tribunal is, therefore, not persuaded by the Claimants’ argument that

the bonus system led to systemic bias against K

To argue that they were discriminated against, the Claimants refer to the Tax
Chamber’s decisions in the case of W _, which, according to them, involved similar
issues but were decided in favour of the taxpayer. Even assuming that the proceedings
against W _ involved similar issues, the outcome of any tax proceedings relating to
admissibility of expenses depends on the specific documentary evidence presented
during those proceedings, the observance of procedural requirements and the conduct
of the taxpayer. The evidentiary record before the tax authorities in the W case
and on the basis of which they decided the case is not before this Tribunal. In the
absence of this record, the Claimants have not been able to show that the same
evidence that was presented in K case (i.e. the agreements for providing
Management Services, the invoices for the services provided or the final work
product) was also before the tax authorities in W case or formed the basis of
their decision. In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot simply assume that K

and W cases were comparable and there is, therefore, no basis for treating the
two cases differently. The simple fact that different decisions were reached in each

case does not prove discrimination.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that the tax proceedings initiated against K or the
tax decisions issued during these proceedings were arbitrary, biased, discriminatory
or contrary to the rule of law. In particular, this Tribunal is not persuaded that the
Respondent was using these measures intentionally as a cover to expropriate the
Claimants’ investment and that these were in effect measures tantamount to
expropriation. As such these measures did not constitute an abuse of tax laws. These

did not result in the total loss or substantial impairment of the Claimants’ investment

in the form of an indirect expropriation. In conclusion, the Tribunal is of the view that
the tax proceedings involving K were a bona fide and a legitimate exercise of the
State’s police or regulatory powers in the area of taxation, hence non-compensable.
Any incidental or consequential effect on the investment of the Claimants, even of a

substantial nature, did not amount to a violation of Article VII of the BIT.
The Tribunal is, of the view that in this case there has been no expropriation.
Free transfers of funds

The Parties’ positions

Claimants’ position

The Claimants submit that the Respondent violated its obligation to ensure the free
transfer of funds in accordance with Article V of the Treaty. According to the
Claimants, the free transfer of funds may be infringed not only by introducing transfer
restrictions (as suggested by the Respondent), but also by taking other measures,
which prevent the transfer and effectively imprison the investor’s funds in the Host
State. Such measures may include increasing the cost of transfer and subjecting them

to unreasonable demands or burdens.

The Claimants argue that “/eJven though there was no formal prohibition on the
transfer of the Management Fees to the United States, the Claimants submit that their
freedom to transfer was violated by the improper application of the tax law which
resulted in K being deprived of the right to calculate, collect and freely transfer

the Management Fees to its U.S. contractors.”?”°

According to the Claimants, the Management Fees were so closely connected with the
Privatization Agreement that they fall squarely within Article V of the BIT, which

protects transfers connected directly with the investment. In this regard, ensuring the

320 Claimants’ Memorial dated 8 May 2012, para. 1272.

free transfer of remuneration of foreign consultants was particularly important since

the absence of such protection would make it impossible to attract foreign experts.

In response to the Respondent’s argument that the only transfer that may have been
protected under the BIT was the transfer of Management Fees between W and
W_, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s actions made it impossible to
achieve such a transfer and, in fact, the entire purpose of the actions of the tax and
criminal authorities, as revealed by their correspondence, was to prevent such a
transfer from taking place. In any case, the Claimants decided to render the
Management Services through a special purpose vehicle—-W —_ — in order to simplify
settlements between the capital groups and make the exercise cost-effective. The

Claimants were fully entitled to do so.

The Claimants submit that by rejecting the Management Fees as CIT-deductible costs
the Respondent effectively imprisoned the investor’s funds and prevented K from
transferring management fees to the U.S. The tax and criminal authorities have
themselves admitted that their acts were aimed at preventing the alleged illegal
transfer of Management Fees. They were successful in their efforts. As a result of the
tax authorities groundless rejection of the Management Fees as a CIT-deductible
costs, the Claimants could not collect and transfer the Management Fees abroad. The
Respondent, therefore, infringed its obligation to ensure a free transfer of funds to the

Claimants.

Respondent’s position

The Respondent submits that it did not prohibit any transfer of funds regarding the
Claimants investments, whether expressly or impliedly, and whether from K to
Ww or from W or W_. The tax decisions for each year were issued long after
the Management Fees had been collected and transferred to W_ . The tax decisions,

therefore, could not have effectively imprisoned any funds.

The tax decisions relate to fiscal years 1994 to 1997 and the first tax decision was

issued on 10 July 1997, i.e. half a year through the relevant fiscal year when the

178

504.

505.

506.

Management Fees were collected by W and transferred to W_ . Even this
decision, however, could not have affected the Claimants’ collection and transfer of
the Management Fees for the second half of 1997 since, by then, the Claimants had
already decided to change the method for calculation of the Management Fees and tie

them to the individual services rendered.

The Respondent submits that with regard to the fiscal years 1998 and 1999, the
Claimants did not collect and transfer any Management Fees but could have done so.
The Claimants theory of “imprisonment of funds” also destroyed the entire causation
theory developed by Dr. Z . In his Base Model, Dr. Z claimed that even
though K equity had been reduced to PLN 11.1 million by December 1999, it
would have avoided going bankrupt in 2000. The Claimants’ “imprisonment of funds”
argument is based on the assumption that in the absence of tax decisions, the
Claimants would have been able to transfer Management Fees from K in 1998,
1999 and onwards. Under the terms of the 2 December 1994 agreement, K would
have paid W PLN 14.3 million in 1998 and 1999 on account of the Management

Fees.

The Respondent submits that according to the Claimants’ own theory, therefore, had
it not been for the tax decisions, the Claimants would have made payments of PLN
14.3 million in Management Fees and pushed K into negative equity by December
1999. Had the Claimants not been dissuaded by the tax decisions, K would have
reported a negative equity of PLN 3.2 million in December 1999. According to Prof.
Z own rationale, having reported negative equity the company would have

gone bankrupt.
The Tribunal’s analysis

The Claimants argue that that the Respondent violated its obligation to allow the free
transfer of funds under Article V of the BIT by effectively imprisoning the
Management Fees in Poland as a result of the tax proceedings. The Claimants have
not pointed to any measure taken by the Respondent that directly prohibited the

transfer of any funds by K

179

507. With regard to the Claimants’ argument that the tax proceedings themselves prevented
the transfer of funds, the Tribunal notes that the tax proceedings were initiated and the
decisions issued after the Management Fees had already been paid, collected and — in
fact — transferred. Had there been no transfer of these fees by K , there would have

been no dispute about the fees being deductible costs.

508. The Tribunal concludes that the tax proceedings, therefore, did not prevent the transfer

of funds from 1994 to 1997.

509. The Tribunal recalls that after the first tax decision was issued on 10 July 1997, the
Claimants did not collect and transfer any of the Management Fees for the years 1998
and 1999. From the record presented in this arbitration the Tribunal concludes that
they were not prevented from doing so by any act of the Respondent. The requirement
by the tax authorities that the expenses towards the Management Fees would be
admitted as legitimate deductions only if proper supporting documentation was

produced cannot be regarded as a clog on the right to free transfer of funds.

510. The Tribunal is, therefore, of the view that the Claimants have failed to make out any

claim that the free transfer of funds was prevented by the Respondent.

VII. DAMAGES

511. In view of the above findings on jurisdiction and merits the Claimants have not

succeeded in any of their claims. They are consequently not entitled to any damages.

VIII. COSTS

512. The total cost of the arbitration, which includes, inter alia, the arbitrators’ fees, the
expenses of the Tribunal, the Secretariat’s fees and expenses and the charges for the

use of the facilities of the Centre, amount to US$ 910,014.56.*?! The fees of Prof.

321 This amount consists of the arbitration costs at the time of the Award (i.e. US$ 910,214.56), which includes
estimated charges of US$ 800.00 for the costs to be incurred in connection with the dispatch of the Award (i.e.
costs related to courier services, binding, and photocopying). The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties
with a detailed Financial Statement as soon all invoices are received and the account is final. If there is any
balance remaining in the case account, it will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that
they advanced to ICSID.

F oO Vv amount to US $146,250.00. Prof. V expenses amount
to US$ 22,259.35. The fees of Prof. C v W amount to US $208,250.40.
Prof.v W expenses amount to US$ 11,432.95. The fees of Mr. M

A K_ amount to US$ 234,140.00. Mr. K expenses amount to US$ 14,095.39.
The administrative fees of ICSID amount to US $148,000. Other costs, including court
reporters, hearing rooms, meeting facilities and all other ICSID expenses relating to

this arbitration proceeding up to the dispatch of the award amount to US $124,786.47.

The Claimants submit that they should be reimbursed for their share of costs related
to the arbitration proceeding, including all advance payments made in the course of
the proceeding and the US$ 25,000.00 lodging fee paid at the time of filing the
Request. In addition, in their July 2014 Statement of Costs, the Claimants have

claimed the following costs:

(@) US$ 7,036,487.52 on account of all costs borne by the Claimants in connection

with the present proceedings. These costs include the following:

(a) Legal fees of the Claimants’ counsel and foreign lawyers assisting the

Claimants in the present arbitration amounting to US$ 5,915,159.30;

(b) Costs of experts engaged for the purpose of the present arbitration in the

amount of US$ 270,041.53;

(c) Out-of-pocket expenses borne in direct connection with the present

arbitration in the amount of US$ 258,739.43; and

(d) Legal fees and out of pocket expenses in the amount of US$ 2,086,250.41
incurred by the Claimants in connection with (1) evidence gathering (US$
336,829.84); (2) protecting themselves from potential criminal charges
and defamation caused by K involvement, as an auxiliary
prosecutor, in criminal proceedings against Mr. M and Mr.
B (US$ 1,214,449.23); and (3) their efforts to ensure that

K continued to exist in order to collect material for the present

181

(ii)

proceedings and to protect the Claimants against potential criminal

charges (US$ 534,971.34).

To the extent that the costs described above in (a), (c) and (d) relate to legal
services provided by the Claimants’ counsel, they exceed the amount actually
paid by the Claimants since the Claimants and their counsel had agreed to a cap
on remuneration for legal services. The Claimants are, therefore, not claiming
the entirety of these costs insofar as they relate to legal services provided by the
Claimants’ counsel and are only claiming US$ 6,634,318.44, which is what the
Claimants actually paid to their counsel. As a result, the total amount of US$

7,036,487.52 being claimed is less than the sum of (a), (c) and (d) above.

514. The Respondent has submitted that it should be reimbursed for the costs it incurred in

connection with the advance payments to cover the cost of the arbitration. Further, in

its July 2014 Statement of Costs, the Respondent claimed additional costs of US$

2,270,627.00. This amount includes the following costs:

()

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

PLN 3,160,030.68 for legal fees and expenses of its counsel;

PLN 16,566.28, US$ 1,367.62 and EUR 545.00 for costs incurred by the State
Treasury Solicitors’ Office related to its participation in the proceedings. These
amounts include costs incurred on airplane tickets, accommodation and daily

allowances of officials;

PLN 87,157.23 for costs incurred by the Ministry of Finance for translating

documents used in the present arbitration;

PLN 3,685,836.68 for costs incurred by the Ministry of Finance for obtaining
the opinions and participation of experts (i.e. Prof. P ,Dr.M , Prof.

K in the present proceedings. These amounts include the cost of

accommodation and airplane tickets; and

(vi) PLN 1,000.00 for costs of international transfers associated with advance
payments and PLN 900.00 for international transfers incurred in connection

with costs associated with the expert opinions.

The amounts listed in (i) to (vi) above have been converted into US$ at the market rate
on the date on which the Statement of Costs was submitted by the Respondent — 14
July 2014 — to arrive at a total figure (excluding the Respondent’s share of the

arbitration costs) of US$ 2,270,627.00.

By letter of 31 December 2014, the Respondent provided further documentation

regarding the following costs it incurred in this proceeding:

(i) | Costs relating to the preparation of the expert opinions of Prof. P Ny
and Mr. S Z of C L , for two invoices of 17 and 18
July 2014, respectively;

(ii) A further invoice from C L dated 29 September 2014 for the
amount of EUR 29,987.50 ; and

(iii) Costs relating to the translation of documents in the amount of PLN 70.05.

The amount listed in (ii) above has been converted into US$ at the market rate on the
date on which the Statement of Costs was submitted by the Respondent — 14 July 2014
— to arrive at a figure of US$ 49,899.66. The amount listed in (iii) above has been
converted into US$ at the market rate on the date of the Respondent’s letter proving
further documentation regarding costs — 31 December 2014 — to arrive at a figure of

US$ 22.82.

The Tribunal understands from the explanations provided by the Respondent in its
July 2014 Statement of Costs and its December 2014 letter that the costs related to the
invoices referenced in paragraph 515 (i) and (ii) were included in the total amount set
forth in the Respondent’s July 2014 statement. The Tribunal further understands that

183

517.

518.

519.

520.

322

323

the costs related to the invoice referenced in paragraph 515 (iii) as an additional cost
item which was not taken into account in the Respondent’s Statement of Costs filed

on 14 July 2014.

The Parties agree that this Tribunal’s power to decide on costs in these proceedings
derives from Article 58 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules and that, in
principle, the costs should follow the event and should cover the reasonable legal costs

incurred by the winning Party.*??

Where the Parties differ is regarding the Claimants’ argument that even if their case
fails on the merits, the Respondent should bear all costs arising out of its unjustified
and frivolous actions taken in these proceedings including requests to bifurcate the
proceedings, to exclude the Claimants’ counsel, the Matter of Ms. S , and the
decision on the jurisdictional objections, which the Claimants contend were
groundlessly raised by the Respondent. The Parties’ respective positions in this regard

are set out below.
Claimants’ position

At the outset, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s reliance on the decisions in

Cementownia v. Turkey*” and Europe Cement v. Turkey?**

as being unfounded. They
point out that the Respondent has failed to present a single piece of evidence to show
that the Claimants’ claim is based on fraudulent assertions. The Claimants and their

counsel submit that the Respondent’s allegations in this regard are defamatory.

According to the Claimants, while in principle costs should follow the event, the
Respondent should bear all costs arising out of its unjustified and frivolous actions
taken in these proceedings. The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s actions were

aimed at delaying these proceedings. These actions significantly increased the cost of

these proceedings and as a result the Claimants had to bear substantial additional legal

fees. The Claimants submit that the Respondent should bear the following costs:

(i) Costs in the amount of US$ 44,801.17 connected with the Respondent’s request
to bifurcate the proceedings (“Request for Bifurcation’”’). The Claimants contend
that the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation was frivolous and nothing more
than a delaying tactic, which was dismissed by the Tribunal. The Respondent’ s
request increased the cost and duration of these proceedings and it should cover

these costs.

(ii) Costs in the amount of US$ 14,543.75 connected with the Respondent’ s request
to exclude the Claimants’ counsel (“Matter of Dr. J ”). This request was
also rejected by the Tribunal and therefore, all costs relation to it should be borne
by the Respondent (including the legal fees of the Claimants incurred in this

regard).

(iii) Costs in the amount of US$ 25,865.00 connected with the Claimants’ request to
order a hearing to resolve the conflict arising from the Respondent’s counsel
employing a former employee of the Claimants’ counsel (“Matter of Ms.
S ”). According to the Claimants, the Respondent should bear these costs
because (a) the Tribunal found that the Claimants’ concerns were legitimate and
ordered the Respondent’s counsel to establish an ethical screen; (b) this was a
further instance where the Respondent’s conduct forced the Claimants to engage
in proceedings aimed at preserving the integrity of the proceedings; and (c) the
Claimants had legitimate concerns regarding Ms. S engagement by the

Respondent’s counsel.

(iv) Costs in the amount of US$ 6,900.00 in connection with the Respondent’s
application of 4 June 2014 to admit new evidence, i.e. the Award rendered on
16 May 2014 in the case of D v. Poland**

to the record of this case (““Respondent’s Application to admit new evidence”).

B. Respondent’s position

521.

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ assertion that, regardless of the outcome of
this arbitration, the Respondent should be liable for the costs associated with its
requests to bifurcate the proceedings or exclude the Claimants’ counsel or the Matter

of Ms. S for the following reasons:

(i) Firstly, the Respondent notes that the actual costs of these
incidental proceedings are to be assessed after the Parties
submit their respective statements of costs. The costs of these
proceedings will probably be only a small portion of the
entire costs related to the matter. Accordingly, there seem to
be no good reason to depart from the general rule of “costs-
follow- the-event”, which looks at the principal outcome of
the merits of the case...

(ii) Secondly, the outcome of these incidental proceedings
should be taken into account. Clearly, the Claimants lost
both challenges against the Respondent’s counsel. They
prevailed with respect to the Respondent’s challenge against
the Claimants’ counsel. However, it should be noted that the
cost added by that challenge to the cost of the already
pending challenge from the Claimants’ against the
Respondent’s counsel was insignificant. This is reflected
both in the record of the Minutes of the First Session of the
Tribunal and in the proportion, in which either challenge
was discussed by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No.
2. In its turn, although the Respondent’s request for
bifurcation of the proceedings was rejected by the Tribunal,
this was done based on the Tribunal’s assessment of the best
way to ensure the efficient conduct of the present case. The
Tribunal took the view that some of the jurisdictional
objections made by the Respondent can only be decided after
an analysis of the merits of the case. Accordingly, there seem
to be no reason why the decision on costs related to the
decision on bifurcation should not follow the outcome of the
merits of the case.*?°

The Tribunal’s analysis

Both Parties agree that in principle the “costs should follow the event” principle should
be applied. The Tribunal has ruled that the Claimants’ claims have failed. The
Tribunal, therefore, awards the Respondent its costs set forth in paragraph 514 (i)
through (vi), its additional costs set forth in the 31 December 2014 letter as stated
above in paragraph 515, and its share of the arbitration costs set forth at paragraph
512. As a consequence, the Claimants are ordered to pay to the Respondent (i) the
Respondent’s share of the arbitration costs (i.e. one half of the total arbitration costs)
amounting to US$ 455,007.28; (ii) the costs set forth in paragraph 514 (i) through (vi),
amounting to US$ 2,270,627.00; and (iii) the costs set forth at paragraph 515 (iii)
amounting to US$22.82. Hence, the Claimants are ordered to pay the Respondent a
total amount of US$ 2,725,657.10.

At the same time the Tribunal awards the Claimants the following costs:

(@) US$ 44,801.17 connected with the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation, since

the same was rejected by the Tribunal.

(ii) US$ 14,543.75 connected with the Matter of Dr. J , since the

Respondent’s request was rejected.

(iii) US$ 25,865.00 connected with the Matter of Ms. S , since the Tribunal

found that that the Claimants’ concerns were legitimate.

The Tribunal, however, rejects the Claimants’ request for costs relating to the

Respondent’s application to admit new evidence, since the Application was allowed.

The Parties are entitled to set-off the amounts awarded to each against the amounts

owed to the other.

The Tribunal is grateful to counsel for both Parties for presenting this complex case

with great ability.

IX. AWARD

527. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal, by majority, decides as follows:

qd)

(2)

G3)

The present dispute relates to “matters of taxation” pursuant to Article VI(2)

of the Poland-U.S. BIT.

The present dispute does not relate to the violation of an obligation relating to
the observance and enforcement of an investment agreement pursuant to

Article VI(2)(c).

Consequently, this Tribunal only has jurisdiction to hear the Claimants’ claims
based on expropriation (Article VII) and transfers (Article V) pursuant to
Article VI(2)(a) and VI(2)(b).

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:

(4)

(5)

(6)

7)

(8)

(9)

The Claimants’ claim relating to expropriation (Article VII) has failed.
The Claimants’ claim relating to transfers (Article V) has failed.
Consequently, the Claimants are not entitled to any damages.

The Respondent is awarded its share of the costs of the arbitration and other
costs incurred in connection with this proceeding in the amount of US$

2,725,657.10.

The Claimants are awarded costs of US$ 85,209.92 on account of the

applications on which they succeeded.

All other claims are dismissed.
