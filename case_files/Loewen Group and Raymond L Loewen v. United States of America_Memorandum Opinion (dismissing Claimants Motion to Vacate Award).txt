MEMORANDUM OPINION
Petitioner Raymond L. Loewen and the respondent United
States of America were parties to an arbitration proceeding under
the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”). Petitioner
now seeks to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 10 (2000). The motion will
be denied and the petition will be dismissed because it is time-
barred under 9 U.S.C. § 12.
BACKGROUND
In the prior arbitration proceeding, petitioner, a Canadian,
and The Loewen Group, Inc. (“TLGI”), a Canadian corporation,
alleged NAFTA claims stemming from a $500 million Mississippi
trial jury award adverse to petitioner and TLGI, and the
subsequent application of a state law requiring an appeal bond of
125 per cent. Seeking $725 million in damages from the United

States, petitioner and TLGI submitted their respective NAFTA

claims to arbitration governed by the International Centre for
the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) Additional
Facility (“AF”) Rules. The tribunal dismissed the claims in
their entirety on jurisdictional grounds in an award dispatched
to the parties on June 26, 2003. In pertinent part, the award
states:

ORDERS

For the following reasons the Tribunal unanimously
decides —

(1) That it lacks jurisdiction to determine
TLGI’s claims under NAFTA concerning the
decisions of the United States courts in
consequence of TLGI’s assignment of those
claims to a Canadian corporation owned and
controlled by a United States corporation.

(2) That it lacks jurisdiction to determine
Raymond L. Loewen’s claims under NAFTA
concerning decisions of the United States
courts on the ground that it was not shown
that he owned or controlled directly or
indirectly TLGI when the claims were
submitted to arbitration or after TLGI was
reorganized under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code.

(3) TLGI’s claims and Raymond L. Loewen’s are
hereby dismissed in their entirety.

(4) That each party shall bear its own costs,
and shall bear equally the expenses of the
Tribunal and the Secretariat.

After the award issued, the United States requested a
“supplementary decision” to “clarify [the tribunal’s June 26,
2003] unanimous [a]ward . . . in one minor respect,” because
“although the reasoning of the Tribunal’s Award disposes of all
the claims in the case - - and the operative part of the Award
dismisses the claims of both Claimants ‘in their entirety’ - -
the Award does not expressly recite its disposition of Raymond
Loewen’s [NAFTA] article 1116 claims.” Resp.’s Req. for
Supplementary Decision, Aug. 11, 2003 (“Resp.’s Request”), at 1
(appended as Ex. 8 to Resp.’s Opp’n to Pet.’s Mot. to Vacate and
Remand Arbitration Award (“Resp.’s Opp’n”).) Petitioner made a
submission advancing the argument, among others, that the
tribunal had failed to consider his article 1116 claim. (See
Article 58 Submissions as to Raymond L. Loewen’s Article 1116
Claim, 977 2, 4 (appended as Ex. 9 to Resp.’s Opp’n).) The
tribunal refused respondent’s request for a supplementary
decision because it had addressed and determined all claims

submitted. See Decision, The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.

 

Loewen v. United States of America, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3,
Aug. 17, 2004 (“Decision”), at 6 (“ORDERS (1) The request is
denied.”) (appended as Ex. 10 to Resp.’s Opp’n). In explaining
its refusal, the tribunal stated that
[T]he dismissal of all the claims ‘in their entirety’
following the examination of the merits was necessarily

a resolution of the article 1116 claim. That dismissal
was a consequence of the reasoning expressed in paras

213-216. We therefore reject the argument that the
Award did not deal with the art. 1116 claim.

Decision, 7 20.

On December 13, 2004, Loewen instituted this action through
a petition to vacate and remand the arbitration award.
Petitioner argues that the tribunal engaged in “disturbing
misconduct” and showed a “manifest disregard for the law” because
it “never fairly and impartially heard and considered the
relevant evidence.” (Pet.’s Mot. to Vacate and Remand
Arbitration Award (“Pet.’s Mot.”) at 37.) Respondents argue that
the motion should not be considered because it is time-barred,
but that if it is considered, it should be denied on the merits.
(Resp.’s Opp’n at 18 - 44.)

DISCUSSION

The FAA requires a petitioner to serve “[n]otice of a motion
to vacate . . . within three months after the award is filed or
delivered.” 9 U.S.C. § 12. “There is no statutory exception to
this time limitation.” Thyssen Carbometal Co. v. FAI Energy,
Ltd., Civil Action No. 89-1695 (JHG), 1990 U.S. Dist. Lexis 427
*6 (Jan. 16, 1990 D.D.C.). There is also no common law exception
to this time limitation. See Florasynth, Inc. v. Pickholz, 750
F.2d 171, 175 (2d Cir. 1984). Failure to move to vacate the
award within the three-month time period provided by the statute

precludes a party from later seeking that relief. See id.

Petitioner served his notice of motion to vacate the award
on December 13, 2004, some eighteen months after the tribunal
delivered its award on June 26, 2003. Petitioner does not
dispute that 9 U.S.C. § 12 requires him to act within three
months of the date of a final award. Instead, he argues that the
June 26, 2003 award was not complete, i.e., not final for
purposes of moving to vacate it, until the tribunal responded to
the respondent’s request for a supplementary decision. (See
Pet.’s Reply at 5-7.) Petitioner asserts that “the U.S. request

precluded Mr. Loewen from seeking to vacate the Award at
that time.” (Pet.’s Mot. at 9 (emphasis added) .)

Petitioner’s position is inconsistent with the plain
language of the ICSID Rules, the FAA, and case law in this
district and elsewhere. The relevant ICSID Rule provides that an
award “shall contain . . . the decision of the Tribunal on every
question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which
the decision is based,” and “[t]he award shall be final and
binding on the parties.” See ICSID AF Rules (appended as Ex. 2
to Pet.’s Reply), Art. 52. The ICSID AF Rule on supplementary
decisions permits a party, within certain time limits, to
“request the Tribunal . . . to decide any question which it had
omitted to decide in the award,” and provides that any

supplementary decision of the tribunal “shall become part of the

Case 1:04-cv-02151-RWR Document10_ Filed 10/31/2005 Page 6of9

-~6-
award.” See ICSID AF Rules, Art. 57 (previously Art. 58) .7

Thus, the ICSID AF Rules contemplate the possibility that a
submitted question is not answered by an award and provides a
corrective procedure. If there is a supplementary decision - -
which is not the case here - - that decision supplements the
award, that is, “become[s] part of the award.” Id. The Rules do
not expressly provide, as they could have, that an award is final
and binding unless a party seeks a supplementary decision. The
ICSID AF Rules, whether viewed individually or as a whole,
neither state nor imply that an already-filed award is rendered
not final by virtue of the fact that a party makes a request for
a supplementary decision. Rather, the plain language of the
Rules states that an award is final and binding on the parties
when it issues. See ICSID AF Rules, Art. 42.

Case law on the finality of awards is consonant with this
interpretation of the ICSID Rules. “Normally, an arbitral award
is deemed ‘final’ provided it evidences the arbitrators’
intention to resolve all claims submitted in the demand for
arbitration ... .” Fradella v. Petricca, 183 F.3d 17, 19 (1st

Cir. 1999); accord Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Employees AFL-CIO Local

*  Respondent’s request erroneously cites ICSID AF Art. 58
as the provision authorizing its request, when in fact, the ICSID
AF Rules had changed effective January 1, 2003, and the governing
provision at the time of the request was Art. 57. The language
of the new Art. 57 was identical to the language of the previous
Art. 58; only the number changed.

3090 v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 777 F.2d 751, 755 (D.C. Cir.
1985) (noting that private sector labor arbitral awards are
deemed final “if they purport to resolve all aspects of the
dispute being arbitrated”). Here, there can be no doubt that the
arbitrators intended the award to dispose of all claims. The
award stated without qualification that “TLGI’s claims and
Raymond L. Loewen’s are dismissed in their entirety.” Award

at 70.

Petitioner’s argument recasting the operative date of an
award to a later date has been considered and rejected already in
this district. In Thyssen Carbometal, respondent argued that for
purposes of the time limits imposed on a notice of motion to
vacate an arbitral award, an award should be “deemed issued
{as of] the day that the arbitrators reaffirmed their award
pursuant to . . . [respondent’s] motion for clarification,
reconsideration, and modification” rather than the date on which
the award was first delivered. 1990 U.S. Dist. Lexis 427, *6.
The respondent argued that “its filing of the application to
modify or correct means that the decision of the arbitrators was
not final for the purposes of the 90-day limits.” Id. at *7.

The court found that the argument lacked merit and denied
respondent’s motion to vacate as untimely. Id. at *7, 10.
Petitioner’s position, if accepted, would establish a rule

permitting any party to render an award incomplete or non-final

Case 1:04-cv-02151-RWR Document10_ Filed 10/31/2005 Page 8 of9

-8-
by the mere act of requesting a supplementary decision or a
clarification “in one minor respect.” Resp.’s Req. at 1.
Petitioner cites no case law to support his position and the
court is aware of none. Other courts have reached the opposite
conclusion. “[A] party moving for reconsideration of an
arbitration award [does not] toll the running of the limitations
period.” Int’l Ass’n of Bridge Structural & Ornamental Iron

Workers Shopmen’s Local Union 501 v. Burtman Iron Works, Inc.,

 

928 F. Supp. 83, 86-87 (D. Mass. 1986) (citing Dreis & Kemp Mfg.

Co. v. Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, 802 F.2d

 

247, 250 (7th Cir. 1986)). This must be so, because

if the limitations period prescribed in [9 U.S.C.] § 12
were subject to suspension simply because an arbitral
award contained an error, even though the arbitrators
had intended to resolve all submitted “claims,” an
unsuccessful party could preclude the commencement - -
or suspend the running - - of the limitations period
simply by alleging subsidiary errors in their [9
U.S.C.] § 10 motions to vacate an adverse arbitral
award. Thus, the contention that mere error - -
whether ministerial, procedural, or substantive - -
renders an arbitral award non-“final” is fatally
flawed.

Fradella, 183 F.3d at 20 (emphasis in the original). Nor does
“an application to modify or clarify an arbitral award toll[] the
FAA § 12 limitations period.” Id.

CONCLUSION

The ICSID AF Rules specify that an award is final and

binding on the parties when it is dispatched and the award

Case 1:04-cv-02151-RWR Document10_ Filed 10/31/2005 Page 9of9

-~9-
dispatched on June 26, 2003 evidenced the arbitrators’ intention
that the award was final. The FAA allows a party only three
months after an award is delivered to file a notice of motion to
vacate. Because the petitioner did not serve a notice of motion
to vacate by September 26, 2003, petitioner’s motion is now time-
barred. Accordingly, petitioner’s motion will be denied and the
petition dismissed. An final order accompanies this Memorandum
Opinion.

SIGNED this 31st day of October, 2005.
