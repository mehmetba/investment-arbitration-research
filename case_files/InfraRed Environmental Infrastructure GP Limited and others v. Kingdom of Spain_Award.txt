I THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A. OVERVIEW

1. The present arbitration arises from the changes enacted by the Kingdom of Spain
(“Spain” or the “Respondent”) to the regulatory and legislative regime of state subsidies
to renewable energy producers from 2012 through 2014. In particular, the issues in
dispute pertain to the effect of those regulatory changes on two Concentrated Solar
Power (“CSP”) plants in which the Claimant entities invested.

2.  ACSP plant produces electricity by concentrating solar power using mirrors placed on
towers or parabolic troughs placed on a line on the ground.' Thus concentrated, the
solar power heats a fluid, typically oil, water or molten salts, which in turn generates
steam that powers a turbine connected to a power generator. CSP plants rely on what
is referred to as “thermaf’ solar, or thermosolar, technology (as opposed to “photovoltaic”
technology). CSP plants are described as “capital intensive.” The largest part of their
cost relates to the initial investment necessary to build and commission the plant.?
Investors’ return on their initial investment comes principally in the form of profits earned
during the period of operation of the CSP plant.‘

3. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Spain pursued a vigorous policy to encourage
renewable electricity production and attract investments in renewable technologies,
including CSP sources. This policy furthered Spain’s international commitments and
obligations set out, among others, in the directives of the European Union and the Kyoto
Protocol.§

4. At that time, most renewable energy production sources were unprofitable by market
standards alone. The costs required to design, install, commission and operate most
renewable electricity production technologies were not recoverable solely from the
revenues generated by selling the electricity on the open market.® State economic
incentives were essential to the implementation of such technologies. That was
particularly true for CSP, which, by the account of Respondent's experts in this
arbitration, was the “most immature renewable technology.”’ The implementation of
CSP technology, in Spain and elsewhere, was therefore heavily dependant on state
economic assistance.

5. As of 1997, Spain established a regime of subsidies meant to provide renewable energy
producers with the remuneration necessary to make renewable energy production

profitable, and to turn Spain into an attractive investment destination for such
technology. (These measures are discussed in detail below, at section I.C.)

6. The Claimants in the present dispute (the “Claimants”) are:

(i) InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited (“InfraRed Limited”), a
private limited company incorporated and existing, since January 16, 2008,
under the laws of the United Kingdom. InfraRed Limited acts in its own name
and on its own behalf and as a General Partner in the name and on behalf of
InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure Fund | LP (a Limited Partnerships formed
under the English Limited Partnerships Act 1907), InfraRed Environmental
Infrastructure Fund Il LP (a Limited Partnership formed under the English
Limited Partnership Act 1907) and InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure Fund
Ill LP (a Limited Partnership formed under the English Limited Partnership Act
1907). InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure Fund | LP, InfraRed Environmental
Infrastructure Fund II LP and InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure Fund Ill LP
are registered with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales
(Companies House);

(ii) European Investments (Morén) 1 Limited;
(iii) European Investments (Morén) 2 Limited;

(iv) European Investments (Olivenza) 1 Limited; and

S

European Investments (Olivenza) 2 Limited.

These four companies (listed at sub-paragraphs (ii) to (v) above) are private limited
companies established under the laws of the United Kingdom on 20 July 2011.

7. | Onor around 28 July 2011, Claimants invested a total of €31 million in two Spanish CSP
plants: Iberedlica Solar Morén, S.L. (“Morén”) and Iberedlica Solar Olivenza, S.L.
(‘Olivenza’).?

8. Between 2012 and 2014, Spain enacted a series of changes to the remuneration regime
for renewable energy production, which — by all accounts — reduced the total
remuneration available to renewable energy producers, including CSP plants. As
discussed in further detail below, Spain claims that these changes were adopted in order
to curb a so-called “tariff deficit’ affecting the Spanish Electricity System (the “SES"),
which became particularly acute after the liquidity crisis of 2008, as the income
generated by the SES failed to keep up with the growing costs of electricity production
and distribution, including the subsidies paid to renewable energy producers.

13.

The central question at issue in this arbitration is whether those legislative and regulatory
changes violated Spain’s international obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty (the
“ECT’).

B.  THEECT

The ECT is a multilateral treaty that was signed in December 1994 and entered into
force in April 1998, the purpose of which is to “promote long-term cooperation in the
energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the
objectives and principles of the [European Energy] Charter.”®

One such principle of the European Energy Charter is the promotion and development
of “an efficient energy market throughout Europe, and a better functioning global market,
in both cases based on the principle of non-discrimination and on market-oriented price
formation, taking due account of environmental concerns.”'°

Article 10 and following of the ECT provide for an array of protections that each
Contracting Party undertakes to accord investors from other Contracting Parties with
respect to investments in the energy sector. In particular, Article 10 (1) of the ECT
provides as follows:

“Article 10: Promotion, Protection and Treatment of Investments

(1) Each C ing Party shall, in with the provisions of this Treaty,
and create stable, itabl ble and conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties

 

 

 

 

fair_and. itabl . Such Ir shall_also_enjoy the most constant
protection | and security and no C¢ Party shall in any way impair by
or their use, or disposal.

 

Inno case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favorable than that required
by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any
it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an investor of any

Contracting Party.
6)"
[Emphasis added]

This said, the ECT also recognizes the principle of state sovereignty over energy
resources:

(..)”
Cc. THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN FORCE AT THE TIME OF THE INVESTMENT

14. The regulatory framework governing the remuneration of CSP plants in force in Spain
when Claimants invested in the Morén and Olivenza plants in 2011 (the “Original
Regulatory Framework’) was based principally on:

- alegislative act, Act 54/1997 of November 27 on the Electrical Power Sector (“Act
54/1997,” also known the “EPA 1997”),'' which establishes the main
parameters for what was called the “Special Regime” of remuneration benefitting
renewable energy producers; and

- a series of ensuing regulations (royal decrees or royal decrees-law) which
establish, modify and/or detail the amounts, modalities and conditions of the
remuneration available to renewable energy producers, including CSP plants.

15. The regulations adopted subsequently to Act 54/1997 can be roughly grouped in two
chronological periods: those enacted between 1997 and 2007, aimed at encouraging
the construction and development of renewable energy facilities in Spain; and those
enacted between roughly 2009 and 2010 aimed at curbing the number of producers that
could benefit from the regime of state subsidies.

16. So ambitious was the Spanish renewables programme that between 1997 and 2007,
Spain more than doubled its 2010 target for the proportion of electrical energy produced
using renewable sources — from 12% in 1997"? to 29.4% in 2007." As a result, by 2009,
the total capacity of CSP plants proposed by would-be developers greatly surpassed the
target set by the regulator (500 MW targeted versus 4,499 MW proposed).'* This trend
held for the entirety of the renewable sector.

‘1 Act 54/1997 of November 27 on the Electric Power Sector (C-0047t) (the “EPA 1997”).

12 See the EPA 1997 (C-0047t), at the 25" additional provision.

13 See Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25 (C-0049t), regulating the activity of electric energy production under
the Special Regime (the “RD-661/2007") at the preamble: “With this Royal Decree it is intended that in the
year 2010 the indicative national target included in Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and
Council of September 27, 2001 on the promotion of electricity generated using renewable sources in the
internal electricity market energy is achieved, so that at least 29.4 percent of gross electricity consumption in
2010 comes from renewable energy sources.”

As a result, in 2009 and 2010 — against the backdrop of the gathering economic storm
and as the tariff deficit issue crept slowly into the political agenda — the Spanish
government adopted, as mentioned, a series of regulations and decrees aimed at
ensuring that the SES would be capable of absorbing the output of new renewables
facilities and the associated costs (principally subsidies).

i. Act 54/1997 — the EPA 1997

Act 54/1997 — the EPA 1997 — regulated electrical energy production and distribution
and furthered the objective of market liberalization.'> It established a free market
framework for the production and distribution of electricity, but vested in the Spanish
government the power to regulate certain aspects of the production and distribution
process, such as the remuneration of electricity producers. ®

In this regard, article 15 of EPA 1997 provides:
“Article 15. Remuneration of Activities

1. Activities for the supply of electric power shall be financially remunerated in the manner
prescribed herein, with charge tolls and prices settled.

2. The remuneration of the regulated activities will be financed through revenue collected by
transport and distribution network access tolls paid by consumers and producers.

3. The tolls and prices will be determined by regulatory setting of the remuneration of the
activities with objective, 3p: and iscrimii ry criteria to
Ip. in the il , ic and technical efficiency of
these activities and the quality of electric power supply.”"”

 

 

More importantly for the present case, the EPA 1997 created a two-pronged
remuneration scheme comprising an “ordinary regime” applicable to producers of
electricity using non-renewable sources (the “Ordinary Regime”) and a “special regime”
(the “Special Regime”) applicable to producers using renewable sources that comply
with certain strict conditions. '® In this regard, article 27 EPA 1997 provides as follows:

“Article 27. Special regime for the production of electricity

1. The electric power production activity shall be considered production under the special
regime in the following cases, when it is performed using facilities whose installed capacity
does not exceed 50 MW:

b) When any of the non-consumable renewable energies, biomass or any type of
biofuel is used as primary energy, whenever its owner is not engaged in production
activities under the ordinary regime.”'®

[Emphasis added; bold characters in the original]

In furtherance of the legislative purpose of “promot(ing) renewable energies’, the EPA
1997 provided that the remuneration of renewable energy producers “shall be
supplemented with the perception of a premium’ to be established by subsequent
regulations, which would allow the renewable energy producers to earn a reasonable
return on their investment.” In that regard, Article 30(4) of the EPA 1997 provides:

“Article 30. Obligations and rights of producers under the special regime

(...)

4. The regime for power production facilities under the special regime shall be
with the ion of a premium, in the terms to be by
implementing requlations (...):

The determination of premiums will take account of the voltage level of the delivery of
energy to the network, the effective contribution to the improvement of the environment,
the primary energy savings and energy efficiency, the production of economically justifiable
useful heat and the investment costs incurred, in order to achieve reasonable rates of
profitability with reference to the cost of the money on the capital markets.

(1

[Underlining added; bold characters in the original]

The EPA 1997 does not specify the precise amount or payment terms of the “premium”
benefitting renewable energy producers. Respondent submits that — in accordance with
the “Kelsenian pyramid” that describes the Spanish legal system — the EPA 1997 sets
the general legal framework for remuneration under the Special Regime,” which is
further developed and detailed in subsequent royal decrees and royal decree laws.
According to Respondent, these royal decrees and royal decree laws must be
considered as legally subordinated to and implementing the provisions of the governing
statute, the EPA 1997, and, in particular, to the principle of “reasonable rate of
profitability with reference to the cost of the money on the capital markets.”*>

23. Between 1997 and 2007, Spain adopted a series of regulatory and legislative
measures” that fleshed out the scheme of remuneration under the Special Regime
created by the EPA 1997, as well as a suite of policies and other measures to encourage
renewable energy production from solar sources and to attract investment in Spain’s (at
the time) fledgling solar sector.

24. These initiatives include the following:

- The adoption in 2000 of a Renewable Energy Planwhich specifically listed thermal
solar technology (e.g., CSPs) as a renewable source to be developed and
established a target of 200 MW thermal solar installed capacity to be reached by
2010;25

- A presentation prepared by the Institute for the Diversification and Saving of
Energy (the 1DAE”) *¢ titled “The Sun can be yours,” intended to entice investors
to invest in Spain's solar energy industry.?” The presentation posed the question:
“Why is it good to invest in a solar thermal power facility?” and answered the
question as follows: “Because ... the RETURN on your investment is reasonable
and at times can reach 15 %.” [underlining added]

- The adoption in 2005 of a new Renewable Energy Plan which raised the 2010
target for installed capacity of CSP projects to 500 MW.28

25. These initiatives culminated in 2007 with the adoption by the Spanish Government of
Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, which regulated the activity of electric energy
production under the Special Regime (“RD 661/2007”).”°

iii. RD 661/2007

renewable sources of energy, waste and cogeneration (C-0054t); Act 14/2000, of December 29 on fiscal,
administrative and social order measures, (C-0058t) which modified the EPA 1997 to add, among others, the
following provisions at Article 30(5) of the EPA: “Nevertheless, the Government shall be able to authorize
higher premiums than those indicated in the previous paragraph for those installations using solar energy as
their primary energy source.” See also Royal Decree 436/2004, of March 12, establishing the methodology
for updating and systematizing of the legal and economic regime governing electric power production under

of investment in the renewable energy sector and the slow pace of progress towards
Spain’s renewable energy targets, in particular the target of 500 MW of installed CSP
capacity to be achieved by 2010.°

27. One of the most significant features of RD 661/2007 is the remuneration regime it set
forth,2? which entitled renewable energy producers, including CSP plants, to
remuneration in the form of a “feed-in’ system that offered two alternative forms of
revenues:

- A regulated “feed-in tariff’; essentially a price fixed by regulation that the
producer receives per unit of energy (kWh) integrated into the SES distribution
grid;3?

- A “pool price premium”; a fixed supplement (or premium) in the amount of
c€25.4/kWh over and above the prevailing market price for electricity that
renewable producers were entitled to receive.**

28. RD 661/2007 granted renewable energy producers subject to the Special Regime the
following remuneration entitlements (described by Claimants as the “seven rights” in
reliance upon which they invested*):

1. Right to opt between the tariff and the premium: Under Article 24 of RD
661/2007, renewable energy producers, including CSP plants, had the right to
elect to be paid under either the feed-in tariff or the premium method, at their
discretion.*°

2. Right to sell full amount of electricity produced: Under Article 17(b) of RD
661/2007, renewable producers, including CSP plants, had the right to
“incorporate into the system, through the electric distributor or transport company,
their net production of electric energy or energy sold provided that it is technically
possible for it to be absorbed into the grid.”°’ [Emphasis added]

3. Right to back-up fuel: Under Article 2(1)(b)(1) of RD 661/2007, CSP producers
had the right to receive remuneration under the Special Regime even for electricity
produced with non-renewable back-up fuel (i.e. natural gas), to the extent that the

31 See RD 661/2007 (C-0049t) at explanatory note, para. 3: “The creation of the special regime electricity
generation was an important milestone in our country’s energy policy. The targets for the promotion of
renewable energies and combined heat and power, are collected in 2005-2010 Renewable Energies Plan and
the Strategy of Energy Saving and Efficiency in Spain (E4), respectively. In view thereof it is found that
although experienced by all the special arrangements for electricity generation has been remarkable growth
in certain technologies, the objectives are still far from being achieved.” [Emphasis added]

52 The “feed-in” system set out by RD 661/2007 maintained and further supplemented the one set out at Article
22 of RD 436/2004 (C-0055t).

33 See Article 24(1)(a) of RD 661/2007 (C-0049t).

total amount of electricity so produced did not exceed 12 % of the total energy
produced if the producer opted to be remunerated under the feed-in tariff option
and 15 % if it opted for the pool price premium option.*® This was deemed
important for CSP plants, since efficiency considerations require the heat
transmitter fluid to be maintained at a high temperature even in the absence of
solar radiation.

4. Remuneration for lifetime of plants: Under Article 36 of RD 661/2007, the CSP
producers had a right to receive remuneration under the Special Regime for the
entire lifetime of the CSP plants (the values of the tariffs and premiums were to
decrease after the first 25 years of operation, from €26.9/kWh to €21.5/kWh for
the tariff and from c€25.4/kWh to c€20.3/kWh for the premiums).°°

5. Updating of tariff and premium: Under Article 44(1) of RD 661/2007, the values
of the tariff and premium were to be updated in accordance with the Consumer
Price Index (“CPI’) less 0.25% until 2012 and less 0.50% after 2012.4°

6. Priority access: According to Article 17(e) of RD 661/2007, the CSP producers
were entitled to a right of priority in accessing and connecting to the Spanish
electricity grid to distribute the energy produced, “under the terms and conditions
set out in Annex XI of this Royal Decree, or in such regulations that_may
supersede them.™' [Emphasis added]

7. Reactive energy: Under Article 29(1) of RD 661/2007, the CSP producers had
the right to receive a supplement for reactive energy and were to pay a penalty
depending on whether the plants respected certain prescribed “power facts.”*? (It
is telling, however, that during cross-examination at the hearing, the
representative of InfraRed, Mr. Sausmikat was unable to answer questions

annually updated, using as a reference the increase in the CPI less the value set out in the First Additional
Provision of this Royal Decree.” The First Additional Provision of RD 661/2007 provides as follows: “The
reference value established for the subtraction of the CPI referred to in this Royal Decree for updating certain
established values shall be twenty-five basis points [0.25 %] until December 31, 2012, and fifty basis points
[0.5 %] thereafter.”

under Article 24.1, shall receive a reactive energy supplement or penalty, as appropriate, for maintaining
certain stipulated power factor values. This add is set as a percentage of the value of 8.2954 c €/kWh,
depending on the power factor at which the energy is supplied, to be reviewed annually by the Minister of
Industry, Tourism and Trade. This percentage shall be established in Annex V to the present Royal Decree.”

regarding the supplement for reactive energy, even from a purely commercial
point of view.*°)

Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 expressly contemplated a revision of the applicable tariffs,
premiums and other remuneration variables in 2010 and every four years thereafter,
which would be based on:

- the costs associated with the respective renewable technologies;

- the “degree of participation of the Special Regime in covering the demand and its
impact upon the technical and economic management of the system’;*°

- the necessity to “guaranteeing reasonable rates of return with reference to the
cost of money in the capital markets.”4°

[Emphasis added]

However, paragraph 2 of Article 44(3) specifically provided that the “revisions (...)

indicated in this section shall not affect facilities for which the commissioning certificate
had been granted prior to January 1 of the second year in which the revision has been
performed.”*’ [Emphasis added]

 

Claimants submit that one of the key features of the Original Regulatory Framework as
articulated in RD 661/2007 was that remuneration was calculated principally by
reference to the electricity produced and sold. Claimants’ experts describe the feed-in
system of the Original Regulatory Framework as a “performance-based system."*®
Under the pool price premium method, remuneration was calculated based on the
electricity sold, the actual market price at the time of the sale, a reference premium fixed
by RD 661/2007 (being c€25.4/kWh)*° as well as upper and lower limits to the actual
price received per kWh also fixed by RD 661/2007. (The upper and lower limits were
meant to keep producers’ remuneration within a fixed bracket — i.e. between
c€25.4038/kWh and c€34.3976/kWh — should the market price sink too low or soar too
high.)

In an internal memorandum on a draft version of the RD 661/2007 circulated two months

prior to the adoption of that royal decree, Respondent stated that the premium option
would entitle plants to a rate of return on their investment of 9.5 % for a standard

11%.5!

iv. 2009-2010: Registration requirements restricting access to the Special
Regime — RD-L 6/2009, the Pre-Allocation Registry and the RAIPRE

For the early to late 2000s, the installed capacity of renewable energy projects increased
dramatically (by more than 50000 MW, according to Respondent).5* As of 2008,
however, the demand for electricity started decreasing as a result of the impact of the
international financial crisis on the Spanish economy.*®? This gave rise to a growing gap
between the revenues generated by the SES (i.e, consumer rates and access tariffs
collected on the deregulated market) and the costs of the SES, including the subsidies
(in the form of the Special Regime feed-in tariffs and premiums) paid to renewable
energy producers.® By 2013 this “tariff deficit’ had reached €20 billion.°

In May 2009, the Spanish government enacted Royal Decree Law RD-L 6/2009 (“RD-L
6/2009”) which tightened the conditions under which producers would be eligible to
receive remuneration under the Special Regime. In doing so the Spanish government
expressly sought to address the growing tariff deficit that had already started to affect
the SES:

“The growing tariff deficit (that is, the difference between the amounts collected from the
regulated tariffs established by the Administration and the rates paid by consumers for
their regulated supply, and the access tariffs that are established by the deregulated
market and the real costs associated to such tariffs) is provoking serious problems that,
in the context of the current international financial crisis, is seriously affecting the system
and not only putting the financial situation of the companies in the electric power sector
at risk, but also the sustainability of the system itself. This imbalance is unsustainable
and entails dire consequences, being that it is detrimental to the security and capacity
of financing the investments that are necessary to supply electricity at the levels of quality
and security demanded by the Spanish people.’®>

35. Access to the Special Regime was restricted by the creation of two “registers”, a
remuneration pre-allocation register (the “Pre-Allocation Registry’)®’ and an
administrative register of production facilities under the special regime (the “RAIPRE”)®.

36. Under RD-L 6/2009 and a subsequent resolution of the Council of Ministers adopted on
24 November 2009 (the “Council of Ministers Resolution’)®°, Spain obliged producers
wishing to avail themselves of the Special Regime to: i) pre-register on the Pre-allocation
Registry; and ii) begin producing electricity and register on the RAIPRE by a fixed date.©°
Producers that failed to comply would be disqualified from remuneration under the
Special Regime.

Registry.*' On 31 May 2012, the Morén plant registered on the RAIPRE.® The Olivenza
plant registered on the RAIPRE on 18 December 2012.

representatives as part of the regular consultative process preceding a legislative or
regulatory enactment. Claimants rather qualify these discussions, insofar as they
concerned the CSP sector (separate discussions were held with other renewable energy
producers), as negotiations preceding the conclusion of a binding agreement between
the government and the CSP sector which exempted CSP facilities already in operation
or registered on the Pre-Allocation Registry from the forthcoming regulatory changes.

The discussions — whether understood as consultations or negotiations — culminated in
public communications by the Government of Spain which nonetheless referenced the
term “agreement’ and spoke of mutual concessions by the Ministry of Energy and
Tourism (the “MINETUR’) on the one hand, and the CSP sector on the other.® The
announcement of this purported agreement was followed by a series of letters from the
CSP plants in question and resolutions from MINETUR in which the plants agreed to
postpone their start-up date (as Spain had requested) and Spain advised the plants in
writing of the applicable remunerative regime. This exchange of letters and resolutions
occurred contemporaneously with the adoption of royal decree RD 1614/2010 which —
according to Claimants — enshrined as law the agreement entered into by CSP industry
and the Government of Spain.

According to Claimants, the discussions, the purported agreement, the exchange of
letters and resolution and the enactment RD 1614/2010 form the basis of Claimants’
contention that Spain undertook a specific commitment to maintain the Original
Regulatory Framework stable for the duration of the plants’ lifetime or, at the very least,
to carve out the CSP plants registered on the RAIPRE (including the two plants at issue
in this arbitration) from the scope of application of any regulatory reform.

Discussions — The Parties do not dispute and the evidence does indeed show that
discussions were held during the spring and summer of 2010 between:

- Government_representatives: Dr. Miguel Sebastian Gascon (Minister of
Energy), Mr. Santiago Caravantes Moreno (head of the Special Regime
Production Unit) and Antonio Hernandez Garcia (Director General of Energy
Policy and Mining);®” and

- Industry representatives: Mr. Luis Crespo, Secretary-General of Protermosolar
(the industry association which purported to speak on behalf of Spain's CSP
producers), and others.®.

The “Agreement” — Following these discussions, on 2 July 2010, the MINETUR issued
a press release titled: “The Ministry of Industry closes an agreement with the wind and
thermosolar sectors to revise their remuneration frameworks.” °° [Emphasis added]

According to the press release, the purported agreement contained the following
elements:

- A waiver by the CSP producers of their right to avail themselves of the premium

- A limitation of the number of hours of operation during which the electricity

On 8 July 2010, Ms. Rosa Francisca Gutiérrez Perez, acting “On Behalf Of D.G. Energy
Policy and Mines” sent Mr. Crespo (Secretary-General of Protermosolar) an email titled:
“Solar Thermal Agreement.” [Bold characters in the original]’’ The email contains a
single sentence: “In keeping with instructions from Mr. Antonio Hernandez, please find
attached the Agreement with the Solar Thermal Sector.” [Emphasis added] The
document attached to the email bears the heading of the MINETUR and of
Protermosolar and is titled: “Agreement with the Thermosolar Sector’ (the “Purported
Agreement’).’5 The document provides as follows:

- Article 1 provides that the market price and premium option will be eliminated
“exceptionally and temporarily’ for one year;

- Article 2 provides for a “firm commitment to delay the entry into operation of
several of the plants entered on the basis of the attached list.” The appendix titled
“Limitation to the entry into operation” provides that the entry into operation of the
Moron plant would be delayed from January 2011 to June 2012, while the entry
into operation of the Olivenza plant would be delayed from January 2012 to June
2012;74

- Article 3 provides as follows: “Amendment of Section 44.3 of Royal Decree
661/2007 establishing that any future revisions of the premiums will not affect
existing facilities, as it [is] currently established for regulated tariffs, and upper and

47. The Purported Agreement also provides, at Article 5, that the conditions contained
therein “are legally suitable [and shall] be reflected in the administrative decisions
corresponding to each facility."”’ [Emphasis added]

48. Letters of waiver and resolutions — During the fall of 2010, the same representatives
of the Spanish Government and of the CSP industry who had led the discussions leading
to the Purported Agreement (including Messrs. Crespo and Caravante) discussed, via
email, the terms of the waiver letters that the CSP plants would submit to the Spanish
Government by which they would formally defer their right to begin operations for an
agreed period of time.’ In November, 2010, the waiver letters were finalized and sent
to the Spanish government on behalf of the Olivenza and Morén CSP plants.”° The
letters advised the Spanish Government of the waiver and requested the government to
communicate the remuneration conditions applicable to the plants for their operational
life.®°

49. On 29 December 2010, the MINETUR sent resolutions directly to the Olivenza and
Mor6n plants (the “December Resolutions”). The December Resolutions appear to
respond explicitly to the letters of waiver.*’ Among other things, the December
Resolutions provided that:

50. The December Resolutions also contained a provision stipulating that an appeal could
be filed against each December Resolution in conformity with the modalities of Spain’s
laws on administrative procedure.** Respondent invokes this appeal mechanism to
argue that the December Resolutions are records of administrative actions, not of
contractual undertakings.®° Respondent says that the December Resolutions would
have been promulgated in any event, independently and irrespective of whether the
plants tendered the letters of waiver.®°

51. Council of Ministers’ Press Release — On 3 December 2010, the Council of Ministers
issued a press release, referring as follows to a royal decree (ostensibly RD 1614/2010),
which was to be enacted within a few days:

“The Council of Ministers has approved a Royal Decree that regulates remuneration of
electricity production by the wind and concentrated solar power technologies.

The new regulations, which were agreed with both sectors last July, have the main
objectives of obtaining savings to benefit consumers and to make the objectives of
promotion of renewable energies compatible with those of limiting electricity production
costs to guarantee the sustainability of the electricity system.

The regulation also involves reinforcement of the visibility and stability of the regulation
of these technologies in the future, and quarantees the present premiums and tariffs of
Royal Decree 661/2007 as of 2013 for installations in operation and for those included
on the pre-register.’®”

[Emphasis added]

52. RD 1614/2010 — On 8 December 2010, contemporaneously with the exchange of the
waivers and December Resolutions discussed above, the Spanish government enacted

82 C-0266t and C-0276t.

Royal Decree RD 1614/2010®, which modified the prevailing regulatory framework
along the lines mentioned in the Purported Agreement, among others by:

- Limiting the number of hours of operation during which the CSP plants are entitled
to remuneration under the Special Regime (Article 2); and

- Forcing the CSP plants to receive remuneration solely under the market price and
premium option during the first year of operation (Article 3).

53. Furthermore, and perhaps more significantly, Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 provided as
follows:

“For thermosolar technology facilities under Royal Decree 661/2007, of May 25, the
revisions of tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits, to which Article 44.3 of said

Decree-Law 14/2010, establishing urgent measures to correct the tariff deficit in the
electric sector (“RD-L 14/2010”). In the introductory note, RD-L 14/2010 noted the rapid
expansion of the renewable energy sector, the growing tariff deficit and the necessity
that energy producers start shouldering more of the cost burden of the SES.®' Among
others, RD-L 14/2010 lifted payment exemptions on the use of transmission and
distribution networks and imposed an access fee of €0.5 per MWh, applicable to all
renewable energy producers.°* RD-L 14/2010 also restricted the number of hours of

operations of photovoltaic (not thermosolar) producers for which they are entitled to
receive remuneration under the Special Regime.°

Both Parties invoke the changes brought about by RD-L 14/2010 in support of their
arguments. Respondent invokes the imposition of access fees to renewable energy
producers to cast doubt on Claimants’ purported reliance on the perceived stability of
the remunerative regime set out in RD 661/2007.% Claimants point out that the
restriction on the hours of operation brought about by RD-L 14/2010 did not apply to
CSP producers. This, they say, demonstrates that the Spanish Government considered
itself bound by the Purported Agreement it allegedly entered into with the thermosolar
industry.° (No such agreement appears to have been concluded with photovoltaic
sector producers, who saw their hours of operation slashed by RD-L 14/2010.°°)

D. CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENT

On 23 June 2011, Claimants’ investment committee approved an investment of up to
€31 million in the Morén and Olivenza 1 Plants.9” Claimants subsequently invested in
the Plants on 28 July 2011. As discussed above, this was some 19 months after the
Plants’ registration on the Pre-Allocation Registry (on 11 December 2009), and some 16
months before their final registration on the RAIPRE (on 31 May 2012 for Morén, and on
18 December 2012 for Olivenza 1).

At the time of Claimants’ investment, construction on both plants was ongoing and the
plants were under pressure to complete those works by the deadline for registration in
the RAIPRE and the beginning of production of electrical energy.°*

i. Claimants’ Purported Expectations

Claimants’ argue that their investment strategy was largely informed by the their
INFRARED ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUND (the “Fund”), the vehicle by
which Claimants invested in the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants.°° The Fund's strategy
prompts it to target “projects employing commercially proven technologies, in
established environmental infrastructure sectors and located in well-governed
economies.”'® The Fund invests in projects during the initial stages of construction
located in jurisdictions assessed as “stable” and “reliable” from a political and legal
perspective.'"' This reflects a deliberate strategy to take on and manage the
construction risk (i.e. the risk that delays or other construction issues interfere with the
project's viability) but to avoid political risk (i.e. the risk that political upheaval in the target

jurisdiction affects the project’s profitability). In this regard, Mr. Sausmikat, Director of
Infrastructure at InfraRed Capital Partners Ltd., testified as follows:

“When raising the capital for the Fund, INFRARED decided it was to be denominated in Euros
since the primary geographic focus for investments were jurisdictions in Western Europe.
Countries within this region were to have attractive and reliable regulatory

for the environmental Infrastructure sector.”°

[Emphasis added]

Claimants say they regarded Spain as a “stable, consolidated, reliable Western
democracy and a country where the law and political commitments are honoured.”'°
They say they started to seriously consider an investment in the CSP sector in Spain
after the enactment of RD 1614/2010.1%

Claimants further contend that the remuneration scheme set out in RD 661/2007 and
the content of RD 1614/2010 were crucial to their decision to invest in the Morén and
Olivenza 1 plants.'5They assert that, in deciding to invest €31 million in the plants,
Claimants relied on RD 661/2007, on the fact that the target plants had been registered
in the Pre-Allocation Register,'°° on the purported agreement between the Spanish
government and the thermosolar sector and — most importantly — on RD 1614/2010,
which, in Claimants’ understanding, enshrined that agreement in law, including the
undertaking that the remuneration regime would remain fixed for the plants’ lifetime.

Claimants argue that they decided to invest based on an expectation that their return on
investment would be at least 15 % after tax.'°” In particular, Mr. Crawford, then Director
of Infrastructure at InfraRed Capital Partners LLP, testified that Claimants would not
have invested had the forecasted rate of return been lower than 15 %.'°8 He noted that
Claimants’ forecast was based on the remuneration regime set out in RD 661/2007 and
the understanding that the “remuneration regime would stay in force (a) in its existing
form and (b) for the whole lifespan of the Projects."'°°

ii. Claimants’ Due Diligence

To assess the contemplated investment and build their financial models and other
analysis, Claimants state that they carried out and relied on a multi-pronged due
diligence process, including:'1°

A legal “confirmatory due diligence” carried out by the law firm Clifford Chance in
the spring 2011 at the behest of certain of the financial institutions which had
invested in the project.''' To be clear, Claimants themselves did not perform an
extensive or exhaustive due diligence of the regulatory framework in force in
Spain, but rather relied on the verifications and due diligence performed by or for
those banks and other financial institutions;'!

Oral discussions with Clifford Chance lawyers, who — according to the testimony
of Claimants’ witnesses — confirmed that the main tenets of the Original
Regulatory Framework would remain stable;

An accounting due diligence which consisted principally in an audit of Claimants’
financial models performed by Ernst & Young;'"4

An engineering verification of the project carried out by the engineering firm
Lahmeyer International;''>

An internal Draft Investment Paper,"'® (the “Investment Paper’) prepared by
Messrs. Crawford and Sausmikat and addressed to the attention of the Fund, with
a view to obtaining the requisite authorization for the investment contemplated.
The Investment Paper mentions that the renewable energy sector in Spain
experienced some uncertainty in 2010 as a result of the government's efforts to
address the tariff deficit, which put financial pressure on the subsidies available to
the renewable energy producers,''? but expresses the view that no further
changes would be forthcoming given the Purported Agreement which had the
effect of “stabilizing” the existing regulatory framework:

“(...) The position has now been stabilized with agreement being reached late in 2010 that,
in respect of CSP... As part of the changes, the government has removed the piece of the

of 2011 to ascertain the progress of the construction works;'2°

- Telephone conversations with Mr. Luis Crespo, the head of Protermosolar,
regarding his discussions with the Spanish government and the purported
agreement concluded between the government and the thermosolar industry;'2"

64. Other than the Investment Paper, none of the documents invoked by Claimants contains
an express statement regarding the “stabilization” of the remuneration scheme in force
at the time of the investment, nor any advice as to the possibility of future regulatory
change that might affect the plants’ remuneration. '2? Further, the list of contracts binding
on the Moron and Olivenza 1 Plants disclosed to Claimants by the sellers of the shares
concurrently with the investment (the “Disclosure List”)'?? does not mention the
Purported Agreement.

65. In cross-examination during the hearing on the merits, Claimants’ representatives
acknowledged that the due diligence which Clifford Chance carried out was understood
as a follow-up to the banks’ own verifications, not as a comprehensive review of the
applicable regulatory framework. They also testified clearly and with noteworthy
precision'*4 that they explicitly raised the question of the stability of the remuneration
scheme and scope and effect of the Purported Agreement in their discussions with
Clifford Chance and with Mr. Crespo prior to investing. '?° According to those witnesses,
Clifford Chance repeatedly confirmed that the plants’ remuneration would not be
affected by any future regulatory changes. 176

66. As regards the Disclosure List, Messrs. Sausmikat and Crawford’s uncontradicted
evidence is that the list was a “red-flag report’ and that it was not meant or understood
to be an exhaustive list of all the contracts binding upon or benefitting the plants. '?” They
further testified that the Disclosure List was compiled by the sellers in the transaction
and for their benefit, as a means to limit their potential liability toward Claimants arising
from the transaction., '78 As such, Claimants had no interest to press further or to insist
on the exhaustiveness of the list. 17°

67. Claimants’ representatives also acknowledged that they were aware of Spain’s tariff
deficit and of the efforts under way by the Spanish authorities to address the issue. °°
The Investment Paper also shows that Claimants had contemplated the possibility of
changes to the provisions of the Original Regulatory Framework that allowed renewable
energy producers to receive remuneration under the Special Regime even for the
electricity produced with natural gas:

“While the Spanish authorities allow CSP plants to generate up to 15% of power from natural
gas, there is no quarantee that this percentage will stay the same for the duration of the project.
Speaking to Lahmeyer and industry there is a residual risk that the level may either
be reduced. as it may be considered too generous."*'

[Emphasis added]
E. THE MEASURES AT ISSUE

68. In November 2011, general elections were held in Spain amid much popular discontent
over the country’s economic and financial situation — which, by that time, had become a
European concern. The Spanish electorate voted out the socialist government of José
Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and replaced it with a government led by Mariano Rajoy Brey,
head of the conservative, Christian democratic Partido Popular. '?? In December 2011,
about four months after Claimants’ investment, president-elect Rajoy announced plans
to introduce a sweeping reform of the SES meant to curb the tariff deficit by slashing
costs while at the same time sparing consumers any additional price increases. '°>

69. As of 2012, the Spanish government began implementing that plan, enacting a series of
legislative and regulatory initiatives, which altered the existing regime benefitting CSP
plants and renewable energy producers more generally, in particular by reducing the

remuneration that renewable energy producers were entitled to receive (the “Measures
at Issue”).

Respondent argues that these changes were meant to achieve a valid public policy aim,
namely to contain and reduce the tariff deficit without imposing rate hikes on
consumers. '4 Respondent also argues that any decrease in remuneration to renewable
energy producers was in any event nothing more than a reduction of an unjustifiable
windfall that those producers — and CSP plants in particular — were receiving under a
remuneration scheme that failed to reflect the changing economic and technological
reality of energy markets in Spain and globally.'°° Claimants counter that — as mentioned
— Respondent enticed them (and other investors) to invest in Spain’s renewable energy
sector by means of a remuneration model allegedly premised on stability. Claimants
fault Respondent for changing that model “mid-stream.”'%° They argue that the
Measures at Issue were enacted after their costs were already “sunk” in the construction
of the plants. They claim that Spain improperly appropriated to itself the “efficiencies”
that they and the plants would have been able to achieve based on the Original
Regulatory Framework. '%” Claimants also argue that the Measures at Issue are neither
justified nor reasonable since Spain had other means available to it to reduce the tariff
deficit.18

Be that as it may, both Parties seem to agree that the laws, royal decree-laws and royal
decrees at issue had the overall combined effect of decreasing the remuneration that
Claimants could have expected under the Original Regulatory Framework.

The Measures at Issue are detailed below at subsections /.E.ito I.E.v. Their impact on
Claimants’ investment is discussed in section IF of the present Award.

i, Act 15/2012

On 27 December 2012, Spain enacted Act 15/2012 of December 27 on fiscal measures
for the energetic sustainability (“Act 15/2012”).'°9 That legislation introduced two
measures that are among those impugned by Claimants:

- It eliminated the feed-in tariff remuneration scheme under the Special Regime for
electricity produced using “back-up” non-renewable fuel, regardless of the
proportion of the electricity thus produced over the total electricity produced of a
given plant;14°

- It enacted the Tax on the Value of Electric Power Generation (the “TVPEE”). The
TVPEE is a tax at the rate of seven per cent (7%) applicable to the total amount

received by an electricity producer for the production and incorporation of electric
power into the Spanish electrical system.'4’ The TVPEE applies equally to
renewable and non-renewable energy producers. '4?

Claimants refer to Act 15/2012 as the first measure of the set of regulatory changes that
would follow over the next few years and would culminate in the enactment of a series
of ministerial orders in June, July and October 2014.'4° They argue that between
December 2012 and October 2014, the plants operated in an environment of sheer
uncertainty as regards their remuneration, which allegedly prejudiced their
investment. ‘44

ii. RD-L 2/2013

On 1 February 2013, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 of February 1, on urgent
measures in the electric system and the financial sector (“RD-L 2/2013”).'*° This royal
decree law introduced the following two measures impugned by Claimants in this
arbitration:

- The cancellation of the feed-in premium that plants expected to receive as a
supplement to the market price for electricity under Article 36 of RD 661/2007. "4°
The premium — set at c€25.4 per kWh by Article 36 of RD 661/2007 was effectively
reduced to €0 by Article 2 of RD-L 2/2013.'4” As a result, the plants benefitting
from remuneration under the Special Regime were forced to receive the state
subsidies in the form of the regulated tariff, which according to Claimants, was
less favourable to producers than the premium option;

- The establishment of a new method of updating the remuneration available to
renewable energy producers by replacing the CPI index with the CPI at a constant
tax rate without unprocessed foodstuffs or energy products;'48

iii. RD-L 9/2013

On 12 July 2013, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 of July 12, adopting
measures to ensure the financial sustainability of the electric system (“RD-L 9/2013”). '4°
This royal decree-law continued the reform of the remuneration regime available to
renewable energy producers. Unlike the Measures at Issues enacted previously, RD-L.

9/2013 modified the very structure of the remuneration available to renewable energy
producers. RD-L 9/2013 did away with the feed-in remuneration system that awarded
subsidies (in the form of a regulated tariff or premium) per kWh of energy produced. It
introduced instead the concept of subsidies awarded per actual unit of installed
capacity of a given plant, at a rate calculated based on a standard plant of the same
type.

77. Inparticular, RD-L 9/2013 introduced the following contested measures:

- The complete abrogation of RD 661/2007 and — with it — the complete abrogation
of the “feed-in” remunerative scheme based on a regulated tariff or a premium in
addition to market prices calculated in c€ per kWh of energy produced and
distributed into the electricity grid;1°°

- The modification of Article 30.4 of the EPA 1997 (which provided the remuneration
modalities to renewable energy producers) and its replacement with the following
provisions which enacted the new remuneration scheme based on subsidies per
unit of installed capacity calculated according to standard plant types:'5'

“4. — (...) the facilities may receive a specific remuneration composed by a term per unit
of installed capacity which covers, where applicable, the investment costs for a
standard facility that cannot be recovered through the sale of energy and a term
to the operation which covers, if applicable, the difference between the operating
costs and the revenues from this standard facility participating in the market.

To calculate said specific remuneration for a standard facility (...) the following
[shall] be taken into account:

(a) | The standard revenues from the sale of energy generated valued at the
production market price;

(b) The standard operating costs;
(c) The standard value of the initial investment.”'2
(...)

This remuneration regime will not exceed the minimum level necessary to cover
the costs which allow the facilities to compete on equal footing with the other
technologies on the market and which allow _a reasonable profitability to_be
obtained with reference to the standard facility applicable in each case.

iv. Electric Power Act 24/2013

On 26 December 2013, Spain enacted Act 24/2013, on the Electric Power Sector (the
“EPA of 2013”).'®° Article 13 of the EPA enshrined the principle of the economic and
financial sustainability of the SES in the following terms:

“Article 13. Economic and financial sustainability of the electric system

1. The actions of Public Administrations and other actors that fall within the scope of
application of this act will be subject to the principle of the economic and financial
sustainability of the electric system.

The principle of the economic and financial sustainability of the electric system refers to
the ability to cover all of costs of the system (sic), in accordance with the provisions of
this act and of its implementing regulations.

2. The costs of the system will be financed using revenue from the electric system.
()
4. Revenues of the system will be sufficient to cover all costs of the electric system.
(...)54

[Emphasis added]

At Article 14, the EPA confirmed and enshrined the provisions of the new remuneration
regime enacted by RD-L 9/2013.'55 This new remuneration regime entitled producers to
state subsidies (“specific remuneration’) of a monetary value per “unit of installed
capacity.”° As mentioned, the subsidies are stated to cover the costs of investment
and the operating costs of a standard plant of the same type as the plant at issue'S’ and
to allow that plant to “achieve a reasonable return by reference to the standard facility
applicable in each case.”'°

The EPA of 2013 did not — however — establish the formula to compute the remuneration,
nor the standard costs of investment or standard operating costs for the types of plants
subject to this scheme, nor did it establish the value of the “reasonable return by
reference to the standard facility applicable in each case.”° Those modalities and
values were eventually established by a series of regulations and ministerial orders
adopted in 2014, which are discussed in more detail below.

82. RD 413/2014 — On 6 June 2014, Spain enacted Royal Decree 413/2014, by means of
which electric energy generation from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and
waste is regulated (“RD 413/2014”).'* Among its other provisions, RD 413/2014

specified the methodology for calculating
renewable energy producers as suppleme!

the “specific remuneration” available to
nt to the remuneration derived from the

distribution of the electricity on the free market. In particular, RD 413/2014 set out the
formulas for calculating the two components of the “specific remuneration” under the
new regime: the return on the investment per unit of installed capacity and the return on
operation.* Both formulas are based — among other variables and constants — on
standard values of initial investments into the type of facility at issue and of the costs to

operate such a standard facility."

RD 413/2014 also provides that the remuneration parameters could be revised at the
end of each “regulatory period’ of six (6) years and at the end of each “semi (regulatory)”
period of three (3) years. 1

The Ministerial Orders enacted in June, July and October 2014 - Starting in June
2014, Spain enacted a number of ministerial orders which further specified the
remuneration parameters, the values of the standard type installations and fixed other
variables of the formulas used to calculate the “specific remuneration” for renewable
producers.

Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 (“MO IET/1045/2014")'®7 fixed the lifetime for which
CSP plants could receive “specific remuneration” under the EPA of 2013 at twenty-five
(25) years. '®® MO IET/1045/2014 also set the maximum number of operating hours for
which “specific remuneration” would be received at 2,040 hours per year,'®? a reduction
from the higher cap of 2,855 hours per year set by RD 1614/2010.17°

MO IET/1045/2014 determined certain categories of standard CSP plants based on the
date on which the commissioning certificates were issued and the type of technology
used and classified each existing installations within these standard categories. '7!
Finally, MO IET 1045/2014 also fixed the value of the reasonable rate of return
(“reasonable profitability value”) for those plants at 7.398 %. ‘72

All of these measures are vigorously contested by Claimants, who take the position that
these modifications to the remunerative regime available to the CSP plants under the
Original Regulatory Framework comprised a radical and fundamental shift away from a
system based on the actual production of electricity and to a system based on the
supposed efficiency of so-called standard installations. Claimants contend that the
fundamental unfairness and illegality of this shift lies in the application of new efficiency
standards to plants (including the Morén and Olivenza plants) that had been designed
and built in reliance on the Original Regulatory Framework and that simply could not
attain the new standards. The Measures at Issue thus doomed those plants to
unprofitability or — at best — break-even status.

F. THE IMPACT OF THE MEASURES AT ISSUE UPON CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENT

Impact on the Plants — It is uncontested that the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants expected
to draw the great majority of their revenues from the State subsidies under the

165 See Article 15 of RD 413/2014 (C-0328t).

applicable to certain facilities which produce power from renewable energy sources of energy, cogeneration
and waste (C-0321t) (“MO IET/1045/2014”).

remuneration regime established by the Original Regulatory Framework.'”? Claimants
say — and there is no dispute in this point — that the abrogation of the Original Regulatory
Framework and the enactment of the Measures at Issue reduced significantly the
remuneration available to the plants. According to Claimants, yearly earnings before
income tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) were slashed by 40% to 60%
each year for the first 25 years of the plants’ operational lifespan and by 100% from year
26 onwards.'”4 Claimants calculate that the drop in EBITDA resulted in net losses of
€50,726,030 for the Olivenza 1 plant!” and €53,845,950 for the Morén plant'”° during
the fiscal year ending December 2013. Claimants also submit that the enactment of the
Measures at Issue and the ensuing losses posted by the plants for the year ending 2013
triggered events of default under the plants’ project financing schemes, which in turn
triggered the plants’ insolvency (i.e. a “cause of dissolution’ under Spanish law).'7”

89. Asaresult, Claimants say that the two plants were forced to undergo a series of complex
restructuring transactions to remain operational. The restructuring brought about the
following consequences:

1. It forced the plants’ shareholders to inject additional capital into the distressed
companies (in an amount of €1,766,009 for the Mordn plant and €2,876,298 for
the Olivenza 1 plant).'7® This triggered the issuance of additional shares.
Claimants say the did not participate in this issuance of these additional shares,
as a mitigation measure, but that this issuance had the effect of significantly
diluting their equity interest in the company (as exposed below);

2. It forced some of the companies’ creditors, including Claimants, to swap their debt
for equity to preserve the ratios within the parameters established by the credit
agreements with the plants’ institutional creditors.'7°

90. Impact on Claimants qua Investors — Claimants argue that the above-mentioned
restructuring transactions diluted significantly their equity interest and all but wiped out
their debt interest in the two plants.'®° These effects can be summarized as follows:

173 According to the Respondent, that is still the case today, with the plants earning only 18% of their income
from selling the energy produced on the open market and 82% from state subsidies. See in this regard the
presentation titled Fundamental Facts: Objective Framework, Presentation submitted by the Respondent at
the Hearing on the Merits; see also Eduard Saura, Christophe Schmit, Stéphane Perrotto, “Second Economic

Looking ahead in Claimants’ investment horizon, the Parties do not seem to dispute that
the Measures at Issue lowered considerably Claimants’ expected overall rate of return,
from 15% after taxes to 7.398% before taxes.'*' According to Claimants, under their
financial model — and assuming a lifespan of 35 years '® and that ail the elements of the
Original Regulatory Framework would have remained relatively unchanged for the
entirety of the plants’ lifespan — they expected to break even on their investment by 2017
and to begin earning profits as of that year.'®° By 2034, Claimants expected to earn
yearly profits in excess of €100 million, a figure that was expected to double for the last
three (3) years of the project, i.e. between 2045 and 2048. 184

As a result of the enactment of the Measures at Issue and the correlative reduction in
the plants’ cash flows, Claimants contend that they do not expect to break even until
2035, and to make only a negligible profit in 2036 through 2039, the last year the plants
will benefit from the “specific remuneration” established by the EPA of 2013.18

The Q Cc i — Clail ” experts Clair ’ loss of profit
caused by the Measures at Issue using the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. 18°
Claimants’ experts opine that the projected loss of cash flows for the two (2) plants over
their useful life, discounted back to the valuation date of June 2014 (when Claimants
say the new remuneration regime was fully concretized), yields a total loss of profit for
Claimants of €75.7 million. '®” That is the amount claimed as damages in this arbitration.

181 The Respondent argues, however, that the expected rate of return of 15% was not legitimate, but rather
‘speculative, as it will be exposed below.

182 This assumption is contested by the Respondent, who claims the lifespan is at most 25 years old. The
disagreement is subject to a debate between the technical experts presented by each respective Party.

94. Virtually all aspects of the Claimants’ valuation are contested by Respondent, including
the appropriateness of the DCF method."® On this issue, Respondent's experts are of
the opinion that the DCF method should not be applied here because: i) it generates an
exaggerated book-to-market value;'®° ii) it generates an excessive rate of return,
surpassing even Claimants’ expectations (36.7 % vs. the expected 15%);1®° iii) the CSP
technology is immature and there is insufficient empirical evidence to allow for a
meaningful extrapolation from historical performance and costs of CSP plants;'®" iv) the
temporal horizon for such an extrapolation is too short for a meaningful statistical
projection given the relative novelty of this technology.'®* Respondent's experts opine
that the only appropriate method of evaluation is one based on the costs of construction
(ie. an asset-based valuation), the application of which demonstrates that the Disputed
Measures in fact have no appreciable financial impact whatsoever on Claimants’
investment:

538. Given that the current Spanish regulation specifically offers a reasonable return
on the capital invested, the FMV of a typical facility has not been altered and therefore,

there cannot be any claimable financial impact.”°°
[Emphasis added]

95. Subsidiarily, Respondent's experts apply the DCF method, but using different discount
rates based on different assumptions — in particular, that the plants’ installed capacity is
55 MW (rather than 50 MW),'® and that the Measures at Issue decreased the regulatory
risk and increased the plants’ marketability since they eliminated the tariff deficit and
enhanced the sustainability of the Spanish subsidies regime.'8° Based on these
assumptions, Respondent's experts opine that the Measures at Issue in fact result in a
net benefit to Claimants of €16.5 million.'° On the other hand, should the installed
capacity be 50 MW (instead of 55 MW) Respondent's experts are of the opinion that the
damages to Claimants calculated using the DCF method are at most €7.7 million.'9”

implement the procedure set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. By this

On 23 February 2018, the Claimants further informed the Tribunal that the Novenergia
Il v. Spain (Award) had become public and, thus, requested leave from the Tribunal to
introduce it into the record.

On 28 February 2018, the Respondent submitted its comments to the Claimants’
observations and request of 21 February 2018.

. On 8 March 2018, the Tribunal allowed the Respondent's to introduce the Wirtgen v.

Czech Republic (Award) and the Claimants to introduce the Novenergia Il v. Spain
(Award), into the record. The Tribunal gave further instructions to the Parties concerning
next procedural steps in the proceeding. On the same date, the Respondent requested
leave from the Tribunal to introduce into the record the Judgment of the European Court
of Justice (“ECJ”) of 6 March 2018, in the case Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV, Case
C-284/16 (“Achmea”).

On 9 March 2018, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request to introduce the
Achmea Judgment into the record.

On 20 March 2018, each Party submitted their comments to the Wirtgen v. Czech
Republic (Award) and the Novenergia II v. Spain (Award). Respondent's submission
was accompanied by Legal Authorities RL-109 and RL-110. Claimants’ submission was
accompanied by Legal Authorities CL-245 and CL-246.

On 23 March 2018, each Party filed their comments on the Achmea Judgment. The
Respondent's submission was accompanied by Legal Authority RL-111.

On 6 April 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that it had “signed two agreements
for the sale of its shareholding interests in Morén and Olivenza and the assignment of
all the rights and obligations as creditor under the subordinated loans.” The Claimants
further contended that they retained “their rights over the ECT claims and actions.” On
the same date, the Respondent filed its comments to this Claimants’ communication.

On 7 April 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision towards the Claimants’
communication of 6 April 2018.

On December 28, 2018 the Tribunal directed the parties to file their costs submissions
by 25 January 2019. Pursuant to the Tribunal’s instructions the Parties filed their costs
submissions on 25 January 2019

The proceeding was closed on April 18, 2019.
THE NON-DISPUTING PARTY APPLICATIONS

On 12 November 2014, the Commission filed an Application for Leave to Intervene as a
Non-Disputing Party (the “Commission’s First Application’).

On 9 December 2014, the Respondent filed its observations on the Commission’s First
Application, and the Claimants did so on 9 January 2015.

On 9 February 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning its Decision
on the “Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party by the European
Commission”. The Tribunal found that the Commission sought to intervene regarding an
issue that was not raised by the Parties. Thus, it denied the Commission's First
Application without prejudice to the Commission’s re-submission of the request in an
appropriate time.

On 9 December 2015, the Commission submitted a Second Application for Leave to
Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party pursuant to Arbitration Rule 37(2) (the
“Commission’s Second Application’).

On 19 February 2016, the Parties submitted their observations on the Commission’s
Second Application. The Claimants submission was accompanied by Indexes of Factual
Exhibits and Legal Authorities, Exhibits C-455 to C-465, Legal Authorities CL-017, and
CL-159 to CL-179. The Respondent submission was accompanied by Legal Authority
RL-080.

. On 19 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning its “Decision

on the Re-Application for Leave to Intervene as Non-Disputing Party Submitted by the
European Commission”. In its Decision, the Tribunal authorized the Commission to file
a written submission addressing only the intra-EU jurisdictional objection and ordered it
to “attach to its its Submission all other requests, submissions, briefs or statements
concerning the intra-EU jurisdictional objection submitted by the Commission to other
international tribunals established under the ECT”®®. The submission was limited to 30
pages and ordered to be filed by 19 May 2016. The Commission was denied access to
the record of the arbitration, to the Parties’ pleadings, and to any hearings, and although
it was not ordered to secure payment it was directed to comply with payment for its
participation as non-disputing party shall a Party filed a request for reimbursement.

On 4 May 2016, the Commission submitted a “Request to Alter the Procedural Order
No. 4 of 19 April 2016: Decision on Re-Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-
Disputing Party submitted by the European Commission” (the “Commission’s
Reconsideration Request”) On this submission, the Commission informed that it was
not in a position to comply with the Tribunal’s directions established under Procedural
Order No. 4.

Following the Tribunal’s invitation, on 13 May 2016, the Parties filed their observations
on the Commission’s Reconsideration Request. Claimants’ submission was
accompanied by Exhibit C-466.

On 19 May 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that pursuant to the
Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 4, the Centre had received on 18 May, the
Commission’s Submission. However, the Tribunal ordered the Centre not to transmit it
to the Parties in view of the Commission’s Reconsideration Request. The Tribunal

further informed the Parties that it would shortly issue a procedural order concerning the
Commission’s Reconsideration Request.

197. On 19 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning its “Decision
on the Request by the European Commission to Alter Procedural Order No. 4”, granting
it in part. The Tribunal altered paragraph 55 of Procedural Order No. 4 as to protect third
parties’ confidential information and rejected the request to alter the Tribunal’s directions
on costs. The Tribunal informed the Parties that the procedural calendar remained
unchanged and that they should present their observations to the Commission’s
Submission in their respective briefs. The Commission was ordered to file its Submission
no later than on 24 May 2016.

198. By letter of 23 May 2016, the Commission notified the Tribunal that following its
Procedural Order No. 6 it refrained from filing a written submission.

IV. THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION

199. Pursuant to its Memorial on Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation
(‘MoPO”), Respondent contests the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to hear all or part of the
claims brought by Claimants upon the following six (6) grounds:

 

 

Designation Nature of the objection
(MoPO)
A. The Intra-EU Objection: Respondent submits that the ECT does not apply

to what it terms “intra-EU investments,” being investments made in an EU
member state by an investor established in another EU member state. In
particular, Respondent submits that the Claimant entities are not investors of
“another Contracting Party’ for the purposes of Article 26 of the ECT, since
both the United Kingdom (where the Claimant entities are incorporated) and
the Respondent Kingdom of Spain are Members of the EU, a Regional
Economic Integration Organisation (“REIO”) which has also signed and
ratified the ECT. 19°

 

B. The Investor Standing Objection: Respondent submits that the Claimants
do not satisfy the criteria of “investor with investments” under Articles 1(6) and
26 of the ECT, and as such, have no standing to bring their claims to
arbitration. Respondent alleges that the Claimant entities are mere conduits
used to funnel the investments at issue in the Spanish entities from other
entities upstream on the corporate ownership chain, which are not parties to
this arbitration.2°

 

 

 

 

Cc. The Taxation Objection: Respondent submits that the Tribunal does not
have jurisdiction to hear the part of the claim brought by Claii under

 

 

189 Respondent's Memorial on Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation, 17 July 2015, (“MoPO”), at
paras. 13 and 35 to 92.
200 MoPO, at paras. 14 and 93 to 188.

Article 10(1) ECT with respect to the Tax on the Value of the Production of
Electric Energy (the “TVPEE”), since the ECT contains a specific carve-out
that renders Article 10(1) inapplicable to taxation measures enacted by the
Contracting Parties.2°"

 

D. The Taxation Expropriation Objection: Respondent submits that the part of
the claim brought on the basis of alleged expropriation as a result of the
enactment of the TVPEE is inadmissible as long as the competent national tax
authorities will not have issued a ruling on this matter in accordance with
Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT.202

 

E. The Insufficient Notice Objection: Respondent submits that Claimant has
not fulfilled the notification and negotiation steps pre-requisite to commencing
arbitration with respect to a series of regulatory and/or legislative enactments
adopted by Respondent after receipt of the initial Notice of Dispute.2°°

 

 

F. No prima facie case on the merits: Respondent submits that the allegations
contained in the Request for Arbitration and in its Memorial on the Merits are
so frivolous, implausible and contradictory that they do not disclose a prima
facie case on the merits.2°4

 

 

200.

201.

202.

In its Reply on Preliminary Objections, the Respondent explicitly withdrew objections B
and E, stating that, “in light of the memorials and documentation filed in the
proceedings,” it was not appropriate to maintain those objections. As regards
objection D, Respondent admitted that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the
expropriation claim based on the enactment of the TVPEE, given that the Spanish tax
authorities had issued their conclusions within the requisite time period, thus satisfying
the requirement at Article 21(5)(b) ECT.2°° As regards objection F, Respondent
conceded that this jurisdictional objection has become moot further to the Tribunal’s
dismissal of Respondent's request for bifurcation, but reserved its rights to raise, on the
merits, the alleged lacunae in Claimants’ allegations.?°”

As a result, the only remaining jurisdictional objections in dispute at the present stage
are the Intra-EU Objection and the Taxation Objection.

The Tribunal notes that, in the following ECT arbitration cases, the Kingdom of Spain
has raised some or all of the objections that remain in dispute in the present case:

A.

THE INTRA-EU OBJECTION

i, The Respondent's Position

204. Respondent's arguments on the Intra-EU objection follows (albeit implicitly on occasion)
the following two (2) main themes which run as common threads through Respondent's
submissions on this issue:

The ECT itself, interpreted in the context of its ratification and of the greater
European economic integration system, excludes intra-EU disputes from its scope
of application;

208 The Tribunal notes in passing that the following authorities, which were filed by Claimants in support of
their costs submissions, also treat the intra-EU jurisdictional objection: Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A.
v. Kingdom of Spain, |\CSID Case No. ARB/14/1, Award (16 May 2018) (“Masdar’), CL-0262; and Antin
Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.a.r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain, Award
(15 June 2018) (“Antin”), CL-0263. However, since these authorities were not invoked or commented by any
Party on the merits or the jurisdictional aspects of the case, the Tribunal has not considered them in the context
of its analysis of the intra-EU jurisdictional objection, nor indeed in the context of any other substantive or
jurisdictional issue determined in this award.

- EU law is supreme and peremptory among EU member states, and it excludes
the jurisdiction of ECT tribunals to intra-EU investment disputes.

205. The Tribunal will summarize Respondent's position on the intra-EU objection following
the structure of these two main argumentative themes.

1. The ECT and its scope of application

206. Foreignness Criterion — First, and central to Respondent's arguments, is the
contention that the foreignness criterion set out at Article 26 ECT?!° is not met in the
context of intra-EU investment disputes. Respondent submits that the dispute-resolution
mechanism contained at Article 26 ECT applies only to “disputes between a Contracting
Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party.”*'' [Emphasis added] The
Respondent submits that because the parties to the present dispute are an EU state
(Spain) and investors of another EU state*'? and because the EU is itself a Contracting
Party to the ECT, and signed the ECT as a REIO, the present dispute fails to meet the
foreignness criterion and falls outside the scope of Article 26 ECT and of the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal constituted pursuant to that provision." Put differently, by Respondent's
account, the investors in the present case cannot be considered “of another Contracting
Party’ than Spain, since they are EU investors claiming against an EU member state.

207. In support of this position, the Respondent marshals an array of arguments.

208. EU legal system for investor protection — The Respondent submits that the EU legal
system created an integrated market governed by legal rules that provide privileges to
intra-EU investors, both substantive and procedural (i.e. pertaining to the procedure of
dispute resolution), which are “greatly superior’ to the protection provided by the ECT.?"4
As regards substantive rights, the Respondent cites the guarantees of free movement
of goods, services, persons and capital; the broad right of establishment in any member
state of the EU; and the prohibition of any differential treatment, in the EU, of intra-EU
investments.'5 In terms of procedural guarantees, the Respondent submits that upon a
breach of the foregoing substantive rights, investors have the choice of suing the
respective member state before national courts, or invoking EU law and thus ultimately
elevating the dispute to European courts.2"6

209 The notion of the supremacy of EU law was not very prominent in Respondent's Memorial on Preliminary
Objections and Request for Bifurcation. It was principally brought forward explicitly and developed as a basis
for Respondent's arguments in the latter's Reply on Preliminary Objections.

Investment of the latter in the Area of the former [...]”

218 MoPO, at paras. 43 et seg. The Respondent cites in this regard the following provisions of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the EU (the “TFEU"): Articles 21, 45, 49, 54 and 63 TFEU.

211.

ECT recognition of EU investor protection — The Respondent further submits that the
ECT explicitly recognizes the system for the protection and promotion of intra-EU
investments. In support of this submission, Respondent first cites Article 25 ECT, which
provides that Contracting Parties members of an Economic Integration Agreement
(“EIA”) shall not be obliged to extend to Contracting Parties non-members of that EIA
any preferential treatment applicable solely as a result of adherence to that EIA. Second,
Respondent cites the definitions of “Contracting Party” and “Area” at Articles 1(2) and
1(10) ECT and submits that the inclusion of REIOs and their territories within those
definitions constitutes an explicit recognition of the system of protection of rights of intra-
EU investors provided by EU law.?17

Interpretation of the ECT according to ordinary meaning — The Respondent invokes
the interpretative canon of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”)
and submits that an interpretation of the ECT that includes intra-EU disputes within its
scope is contrary to the ordinary meaning@"* of Articles 1(2), 1(10) and 26 of the ECT.
In line with its argument summarized above, Respondent submits that where the dispute
is brought by an investor established in an EU member state against another EU
member state, the terms “Contracting Party’ and “Area” must be interpreted to refer
respectively to the EU and to the EU’s territory (not to a particular EU member state or
to the territory of such a state). Since the EU is itself a Contracting Party, the foreignness
criteria is therefore not met, according to Respondent.

Interpretation of the ECT according to its context, object and purpose —
Respondent invokes the investment protection systems provided respectively under EU
law and the ECT and argues that the EU and its member states could not have intended
the ECT to apply to an area purportedly already covered by EU law.?'® Respondent also
submits that the objective of the ECT was to improve the security of energy supply of
Western Europe by enticing energy transactions with ex-Soviet Republics and
integrating the latter into the European market.?2° Respondent argues this type of
integration was already achieved between EU member states at the time of signature of
the ECT and that the application of the ECT to intra-EU disputes was not only
unnecessary, but also contrary to the objective of an integrated market pursued by both
the ECT and the EU treaties. In particular, Respondent relies upon this reasoning to
distinguish the ECT arbitration cases cited by Claimants. Respondent pleads that those
cases were brought against former Eastern Bloc countries that were not part of the EU
when they adhered to the ECT (and could therefore contract Part Ill investor protection
obligations at will).22"

2. The principle of primacy of EU law

No power to enter into the ECT as among EU member states — Respondent submits
that, by acceding to the EU, member states abdicated their power to bind each other to
the investor protection obligations set out at Part Ill of the ECT, including the dispute
resolution mechanism set out at Article 26 ECT. In support of this argument,
Respondent invokes the following authorities and legal provisions:

- Costa v. ENEL, a reference case rendered by the ECJ in 1964.225

- Article 344 TFEU, which provides that “Member States undertake not to submit a
dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method
of settlement other than those provided for therein.”**4 [Emphasis added]

- Article 36(7) ECT, which provides that, for the purpose of voting at the Charter
Conference, a REIO shall have a number of votes equal to its number of member
states and that the REIO shall not be entitled to exercise its votes if the member
states exercise theirs. Respondent argues that this provision recognizes that
some matters fall within the exclusive competence of the EU. According to
Respondent, this explicit arrangement regarding voting rights implicitly recognizes
that EU member states do not (and, presumably did not, at the time of adhesion
to, and ratification of the ECT) have competence to bind themselves to the investor
protection obligations set out at Part Ill of the ECT.225

Peremptory application of EU law to intra-EU disputes — Respondent argues that
EU law applies peremptorily in intra-EU disputes, to the exclusion of any other norm of
national or international law, and thus displaces the provisions of the ECT on investor
protection and the recourses of investors against host states.?26

In particular, Respondent argues that Article 26(6) ECT requires the Tribunal to resolve
the present dispute in conformity with international law, which includes EU law.?27
Respondent further argues that this raises an applicable law conflict between the
provisions of the ECT and EU law, or, at the very least, it raises issues subject to the
application of EU law, such as the prohibition of state aid.?2° This will necessarily require
the Tribunal to interpret and apply EU law, an exercise that is beyond its competence,

argument that, in entering into the EU founding treaties, the EU Member States have bound themselves to
abridge their sovereign power to enter into treaties with each other on matters of investor promotion and
protection.

according to the Respondent's reading of the most recent decision in that regard by the
ECU (see below).?2°

215. To support this position, the Respondent marshals the following authorities and legal
provisions:

- Slovak Republic v. Achmea, (“Achmea’), a judgment rendered by the ECJ on
the operability of the arbitration clause contained in the bilateral investment treaty
between Germany and the Slovak Republic (the “Germany-Slovakia BIT’) in light
of the provisions of EU law, including Article 344 TFEU.”°° The ECJ reaffirmed the
principles of autonomy of EU law and the uniformity of its application and
interpretation, in furtherance of which EU Member States undertook not to submit
any dispute concerning the application and interpretation of the EU founding
treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for in those
treaties.251 The ECJ found that the international arbitration tribunal constituted
under that BIT may be called upon to interpret and apply EU law, considering that
Article 8 of the Germany-Slovakia BIT mandates the tribunal do decide the dispute
on the basis of, inter alia, the “the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;
the provisions of ... other relevant agreements between the Contracting
Parties.'*°2 The ECJ also ruled that the international arbitral tribunal constituted
under the Germany-Slovakia BIT is not a tribunal within the EU legal order, that it
may not make a reference to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling on a point of EU law
(under Article 267 TFEU) and that its decision is subject only to limited review by
the national courts of EU member states.”%° As a result, the ECJ ruled that Articles
344 and 267 TFEU render inoperative Article 8 of the Germany-Slovakia BIT,
since the dispute settlement mechanism it sets out contemplates a ruling on a
point of EU law by a decisional body outside the EU legal order, the decision of
which is subject to only limited review by EU courts, the whole in breach of the
provisions of the TFEU.?54

- The January Declarations — On 15 January 2019, a group of 22 EU member
states issued a declaration purporting to comment the “consequences” of the
Achmea decision by the CJEU (the “January 15 Declaration’).2°> Among others,
the January 15 Declaration stated that — in the light of the ruling in Achmea —

233 Achmea, op. cit., (RL-0111), at paras. 49 and 53.

234 Ibid., at paras. 56 and following. The ECJ seems to limit the scope of its ruling to investment arbitration (in
particular arbitration mandated by a BIT), explicitly carving out from the scope of its ruling commercial
arbitration, which is based on the “wishes of the parties” in contradistinction to investment arbitration, which is
based on a treaty between States. According to this reasoning, international investment arbitration clauses in
BITs run afoul of Article 344 TFEU which places an obligation upon States (not commercial parties) not to
submit disputes regarding the interpretation of the EU founding treaties to any method of settlement other than
those provided for in those treaties. See Achmea, op. cit., at paras. 54 to 56.

investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties
(‘BITs”) are contrary to EU law and inapplicable.?°° The January 15 Declaration
further stated that, to the extent that the arbitration clause in the ECT is interpreted
as applicable between member states, such clause is incompatible with the
foundational treaties and must be “disapplied.”*°” On 16 January 2019, a group of
5 EU member states issued a declaration reflecting the statements of the January
15 Declaration as regards BITs (the “January 16 Declaration”), but stopping
short of making any statements regarding the ECT.7° That same date, the
Kingdom of Hungary issued a declaration sensibly to the same effect as the
January 16 Declaration (the “Hungary Declaration,” collectively with the January
15 Declaration and the January 16 Declaration, the “January Declarations”).7°°

Respondent pleads that the January 15 Declaration discloses the true intention of
the signatory parties to the ECT as regards the interpretation of Article 26 ECT.
Respondent argues that the January 15 Declaration reflects “a subsequent
agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the
application of its provisions,” as per the terms of Article 31(3)(a) VCLT.° In the
alternative, Respondent pleads that the January Declarations constitute
“subsequent practice ... which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding
the interpretation” of the ECT, as per the terms of Article 31(3)(b) VCLT.24" In
particular, Respondent argues that Articles 31(3)(a) and 31(3)(b) VCLT do not
require a consensus among ai/ parties to a treaty and should rather be interpreted
in a “non-formalistic way.” Respondent also argues that the January Declarations
confirm the primacy of EU law over the ECT in case of conflict and regardless of
the provisions of Article 30 VCLT which govern conflicts between successive
treaties.242

Finally, Respondent argues that the absence of any mention of the ECT in the
January 16 Declaration and the Hungary Declaration should not invalidate the
interpretative force of the January 15 Declaration. Respondent says the
Governments of Hungary and the 5 EU member states that issued the January 16
Declaration simply withheld their views on the inter-relation between EU law and

the ECT since that issue is presently pending before their respective national
courts.243

- What Spain refers to as the current controversy surrounding intra-EU BITs.
In June, 2015, the EC asked five (5) EU member states to terminate all the
bilateral investment treaties (“BITs”) entered into between them. This request is
in line with the EC’s position that intra-EU investment treaties are superfluous and
pose a risk of fragmentation of the EU single market by conferring rights to
investors on a bilateral basis.?44 Furthermore, according to Respondent, there is
presently one more case — other than Achmea — where the opinion of the ECJ is
sought on the issue of the compatibility between EU law and arbitration under
intra-EU BITs.?45 Respondent draws an analogy between BITs and the ECT and
submits that the European Commission's position is evidence of the
incompatibility of the ECT and EU law.?46

- Costa v. ENEL?“’ (see above at paragraph 212).

- Article 25 ECT, which stipulates that member states of a REIO are not bound by
the provisions of the ECT to extend to states non-members of that REIO a
treatment more favorable than the treatment that member states of that REIO
agreed to extend to each other.

- Article 36(7) ECT, which as mentioned above, governs voting modalities for the
purposes of the Charter Conference.

- The EU rules on state aid and the possibility that a potential award rendered by
this Tribunal ordering Respondent to pay damages to Claimants may be
considered illegal state aid by European authorities under European law.
Respondent refers in this regard to the order of the ECJ in Elcogds S.A. v.
Administracién del Estado, Iberdrola S.A.748, which held that amounts financed by
the users of Spain’s electricity system and distributed to producers by a state
agency constitute state aid subject to the rules of European law. Respondent also
refers to the decision by the European Commission (“EC”) ordering Romania to
suspend the execution of the award rendered by an ICSID tribunal in favour of
Swedish investors in Micula v. Romania, on the grounds that the award amounted
to illegal state aid. °4°

- The Lisbon Treaty, which was entered into by the EU member states in 2007
and, which, according to Respondent “expressly gathers competence in favour of
the EU over foreign investment.” =° According to Respondent, EU Law prevails
over (and displaces) the ECT in the context of intra-EU disputes by virtue of the
lex posterior principle enshrined at Article 59 VCLT. Respondent stops short,
however, of citing any provision of the Lisbon Treaty that supports its conclusions.
It also does not reference any incompatibility between the Lisbon Treaty — and EU
law more generally — and the ECT.

ii. The Claimants’ Position

216. As ageneral matter, Claimants first plead that Spain's objections to jurisdiction are both
frivolous and purely dilatory. °5' In its Rejoinder on the Preliminary Objections, Claimants
specifically invoke Respondent's withdrawal of more than half of its objections in support
of their request for the costs of the arbitration and for all legal costs that Claimants
incurred.252

217. As regards the Intra-EU Objection, Claimants plead that:

- An interpretation of Article 26 ECT in the context of the other relevant ECT
provisions and the travaux préparatoires disproves Respondent's position;

- The principle of the primacy of EU law in intra-EU relations is not binding upon
this Tribunal, and, at any rate, does not exclude the application of the ECT to intra-
EU investment disputes;

- The frivolous and purely dilatory nature of the preliminary objections render
Respondent liable for the full costs incurred by Claimants, the Arbitral Tribunal
and ICSID to deal with the jurisdictional objections and the request for bifurcation.

1. The interpretation of the ECT

218. Article 26 ECT — Claimants submit that the term “Area” as defined at Article 1(10) and
used at Article 26 ECT refers to the area of contracting parties and to that of the REIO
interchangeably, depending on whether the dispute is brought against a member state
or against a REIO. The two definitions are not mutually exclusive, but rather
interchangeable, depending on the identity of the respondent party.25° According to
Claimants, this is the only interpretation of Article 26 ECT that comports with the context
of that provision, and in particular with Article 16 ECT. In turn, Article 16 ECT provides
that where the parties to the ECT enter into a subsequent or prior agreement that

overlaps with the ECT, the provisions most favorable to the investors as between the
two agreements (including on such matters as dispute resolution) shall prevail.

Absence of a disconnection clause — Claimants submit that had the parties to the
ECT intended to prevent the application of that treaty to intra-EU disputes, they would
have included an explicit disconnection clause.”°> Claimants point out that one such
clause was included in the ECT to govern the relation between the ECT and the Svalbard
Treaty,25° providing that in case of conflict, the latter shall prevail.25” Claimants further
submit that the travaux préparatoires of the ECT show that an explicit disconnection
clause was initially proposed by the EC, but that the EC itself ultimately withdrew the
proposal and such a clause never formed part of the final draft.25°

Jurisprudence constante — Claimants submit that arbitral tribunals have consistently
rejected the intra-EU objection. In this regard, Claimants invoke: i) recent intra-EU
arbitral decisions against Spain rendered under the ECT; ii) intra-EU cases against other
European member states rendered under the ECT; and iii) intra-EU cases against other
European member states rendered under BITs. According to Claimants, these cases
undermine the key assumptions of Respondent's arguments (in particular those
regarding the EU integrated system of investment promotion and protection) and stand
for the following propositions:

- The ECT and EU law do not cover the same subject-matter and, in any event,
there is no inconsistency or incompatibility between the two;

- The ECJ does not have an interpretative monopoly preventing arbitral tribunals
from exercising jurisdiction over cases that require the application of EU law;

- EU law does not prevent or prohibit investor-state arbitration of intra-EU
disputes.259

Claimants submit that the EC itself implicitly admitted that the ECT applies in case of
intra-EU disputes in the case Electrabel v. Hungary, since it only invoked the intra-EU
jurisdictional objection against a part of the investors’ claims under the ECT.?°° In
Electrabel, it appears that the EC took the position that the claim brought under the ECT
which is subject to EU state aid law is not within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, whereas
those claims which are not subject to EU law would impliedly fall under the tribunal's
jurisdiction.26' As such, according to Claimants, the EC took the position that EU law

does not a priori prevent EU member states from binding each (and as between each
other) to Part Ill investor protection obligations, but rather that the ECT becomes
inapplicable only to the extent of incompatibilities with EU law.?62

2. The primacy of EU law

222. Claimants plead that the principle of primacy of EU law is not binding upon the Tribunal
and, in any event, does not lead to the inapplicability of the ECT in the context of intra-
EU disputes for the following reasons.

223. Constitutional treaty — First, Claimants submit that the ECT is the “constitutional treaty
of the Tribunal and of this arbitration. In case of any inconsistency between the ECT and
other treaties (such as the EU founding treaties), Claimants submit that the ECT prevails
“under all circumstances.”*65

224. Article 16 ECT - In any event, Claimants plead that the ECT itself settles any
incompatibility issues that could possibly arise from its interaction with other treaties as
it stipulates that the provisions of the treaty most favourable to the investor must prevail.
Claimants plead that the ECT grants investors recourse in arbitration, whereas EU law
does not. To the extent any incompatibility arises between the dispute resolution clause
of the ECT and EU law (see comment above regarding whether Respondent
successfully makes a showing of any such incompatibility), the former must therefore
prevail.264

225. The Achmea decision — The Claimants contest the applicability of the Achmea decision
to Respondent's jurisdictional objection. The Claimants argue that this case, unlike
Achmea, is sourced in the provisions of a multilateral investment treaty, not a BIT.265
Even if it were applicable here, the Achmea decision is of no assistance to Respondent,
say the Claimants, since it provides for the validity and applicability of international
arbitration agreements to intra-EU disputes, ‘provided that the autonomy of the EU and
its legal order is respected.”*©° Claimants further argue that the autonomy of the EU
legal order is not jeopardized here since: i) there is no regulation, directive or any legal
act of the EU that is applicable to resolve the merits of this dispute; and, in any event, ii)
no conflict or incompatibility exists between the provisions of the ECT and EU law.?6”

226. The Claimants further argue that the Achmea decision is a judgment by the highest court
in “the legal sub-system’ of a Contracting Party.?6* As such, this decision has no bearing

on the validity or scope of an arbitration agreement entered into by virtue of an
international treaty, which is the “constitutional treaty’ governing the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. In the absence of an explicit disconnection clause that could have otherwise
excluded the application of the ECT to disputes between an EU member state and an
investor based in another EU member state, the Claimants argue that the EU cannot
amend the ECT via a decision rendered by the ECJ.?69

The January Declarations — The Claimants first argue that the January Declarations
disclose divergent views among EU member states since the January 16 Declaration
and the Hungary Declaration are at odds with the January 15 Declaration over the impact
of the Achmea decision, if any, on the validity and applicability of Article 26 ECT to intra-
EU disputes.?”° As such, Claimants argue that the January Declarations are, at best, an
indication of the position of some EU member states. The Claimants also point out that,
in any event, the January Declarations can have no interpretative effect since EU
member states cannot unilaterally establish or modify the interpretation of the ECT
without the agreement of the other signatories to the ECT which are not EU member
states.?”1 As such, Claimants argue that the January Declarations cannot qualify as
instruments, subsequent agreements or practices under Articles 31(3)(a) and 31(3)(b)
VCLT since they do not meet with the consensus of al/ ECT parties.?”? Regardless of
the interpretative effect of the January Declarations, Claimants argue that the terms of
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention forecloses Respondent from withdrawing its
consent based on the January Declarations at this stage of the proceedings..?”
Claimants say Respondent's consent has been perfected when Claimants filed their
Request for Arbitration on 8 May 2014 and thus accepted Respondent's standing offer
to arbitrate investor-state disputes arising under the ECT.

 

Article 344 TFEU — Claimants submit that Article 344 TFEU does not apply to investor-
state disputes, but rather only to state-state disputes. In any event, that provision could
not prevent the Tribunal from disposing of the present dispute, since the prohibition
against resorting to alternative dispute resolution methods is explicitly restricted to
disputes concerning the “interpretation and application” of the founding treaties of the
EU, whereas the present dispute concerns the interpretation and application of the
ECT.274

EU rules on state aid — Claimants plead that the EU rules on state aid are not relevant
for the assessment of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, since arbitral tribunals may apply — and
have customarily considered — provisions of EU law on the merits of an investor-state

dispute. One recent example of such an application of EU law — and in particular the
rules with respect to state aid — is Electrabelv. Hungary, which, much like this case, was
brought under Article 26 ECT. In that case, the tribunal analysed the case law of the
ECJ and concluded that an international arbitration tribunal ruling upon private disputes
or investor-state disputes is entitled to consider and apply the precepts of European
law?75 to dispose of the issues on the merits. Claimants also submitted that the relief it
seeks on the merits is not contrary to EU law, a submission that we shall analyse in
more detail below,?”° as part of the Tribunal’s discussion of the Parties’ respective
positions on the merits of the case.

iii. | Recent decisions on point

PV Investors v. Spain?”’ — This case is an ad hoc arbitration brought against Spain on
16 November 2011 by a group of investors established in Luxembourg, The Netherlands
and Germany. The arbitration was brought under the ECT, pursuant to the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules and under the auspices of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the
“PCA’). Spain objected to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, invoking among other
legal bases, the intra-EU nature of the dispute and its alleged lack of consent to refer to
arbitration disputes with EU nationals.2”8

The tribunal dismissed this objection. It started its analysis at Article 26 ECT and
patterned its methodology upon the framework provided by the interpretative canon set
out at Article 31 et seq. VCLT. In particular, it proceeded to interpret the scope of Article
26 ECT according to: i) the ordinary meaning of that provision in light of its context,
purpose and other provisions of the ECT, as mandated by art. 31(1) VCLT; ii)
subsequent agreements and subsequent practice between the parties regarding the
application of the ECT; and iii) supplementary means of interpretation such as the
travaux préparatoires.

First, the tribunal held that, contrary to Respondent's position, the term “Area” as defined
at Article 1(10) ECT and used at Article 26(1) ECT refers to the territory of the state
member of a REIO when the claim is brought against that state, and to the REIO itself
when the claim is brought against the REIO.27° In PV Investors, the claim was brought
against Spain by investors established in other states. The diversity of area requirement
was therefore met.?®° The tribunal also relied on the absence of a disconnection clause
with respect to intra-EU dispute. Since the parties to the ECT provided a disconnection
clause in case of incompatibility with the provisions of another treaty (the Svalbard

278 It is noted that, unlike in the present case, the Tribunal in P.V. Investors v. Spain granted Spain’s request
for bifurcation and accepted to render a preliminary decision upon the jurisdictional objections, which were
dismissed or — in case of the TVPEE objection — joined with the merits. As at the date of this award, the Parties
did not bring to the attention of the Tribunal the decision — if any — rendered by the ECJ in the Micula case.

Treaty), it stands to reason that they would have done so as well if they truly intended
EU law to prevail over the ECT.?8! Finally, with respect to Article 344 TFEU, the tribunal
held that this Article does not give a monopoly to the ECJ over the interpretation of EU
law in private and mixed investor-state disputes.

Second, the tribunal held that the Lisbon Treaty and the other European legal
instruments (including various EU regulations and the positions of the EC) invoked by
Spain do not qualify as “subsequent agreements” or “subsequent practice” for the
purpose of the VCLT because they are not “in the application” of the ECT. In any event,
such instruments are, at most, only binding between EU member states and do not
establish the consent of all of the parties to the ECT.

Finally, as regards other circumstances such as the pivotal role of the EU in the
conception and negotiation of the ECT and the controversy regarding intra-EU BITs, the
tribunal held that such circumstances can at most serve as “supplementary measures
of interpretation” under Article 32 VCLT. In conformity with the provisions of the VCLT,
such circumstances can at most confirm the interpretation yielded by the application of
Article 31 VCLT. In any event, these circumstances cannot assist Respondent in its
proposed interpretation of the ECT.

Charanne B.V. and Construction Investments S.A.R.L v. Kingdom of Spain?®? —
This case is an SCC arbitration brought against Spain by Dutch and Luxembourgish
investors on 7 May 2012, under the aegis of the ECT.78? On 21 January 2016, the
tribunal rendered its award disposing both of jurisdictional objections and of the merits
of the case.”* The tribunal dismissed all of Respondent's jurisdictional objections.

As regards the Intra-EU objection, the tribunal first held that the definition of the term
“area’ was to be read interchangeably as the area of the EU member state at issue or
the area of the EU depending on the content of the particular claim and the entity against
whom the claim was brought. In that case, since the claim was brought solely against
Spain and on the sole basis of Spain’s sovereign actions, the term “area” must designate
the area of Spain. As such, the tribunal held that the criterion of diversity of areas under
Article 26 ECT was satisfied.” Finally, the tribunal dismissed Spain’s arguments based
on Article 344 ECT (also invoked in the present arbitration‘), holding that the latter
provision applies solely to disputes between EU Member States and not to investor-
state disputes.?°”

Lux S.a rl. v. Kingdom of Spain*® — This case is an ICSID arbitration initiated against
Spain on 22 October 2013 by two (2) investors, one established in Luxembourg and
another in the United States, under the ECT. On 5 February 2015, the tribunal granted
Respondent's request to bifurcate the proceedings. On 6 June 2016, the tribunal
dismissed all of Respondent's preliminary objections, including the Intra-EU Objection.

238. As regards the Intra-EU Objection, the tribunal acknowledged the dual nature of EU law
as the constitutionally supreme body of law within the EU legal order, as well as a part
of the larger body of international law outside the EU legal order.?8° According to the
tribunal, EU law may well prevail over other domestic norms strictly as between EU
members states. However, within the international legal order, EU law cannot bind non-
European states that enter into international treaties with EU member states.?9° EU law
is nothing more than res inter alios acta for the latter.2°' As such, in case of contradiction
between EU law and the ECT, the latter must prevail given that it is the tribunal's
“‘constitutional’ instrument, upon which its jurisdiction is founded.”292

239. This said, the tribunal found that there is no conflict between EU law and the ECT and
disposed of Respondent’s argument based on Article 344 TFEU (the same argument as
raised by Respondent in the present case*®), ruling that the latter provision applies to
disputes concerning the interpretation of EU founding treaties, whereas Article 26 ECT
is concerned only with investor-state disputes.2% Finally, the tribunal dismissed
Respondent's argument based on an implicit disconnection clause (the same argument
is not made in the present case), ruling that the parties to the ECT could have excluded
its application in certain circumstances only if they did so expressly and
unequivocally.295

bifurcation and requested that its jurisdictional objections be heard before the hearing
on the merits. That request was dismissed on 12 January 2015 and the tribunal rendered

As regards the Intra-EU objection, the triounal assessed Respondent's arguments in two
(2) broad categories, similar to those informing the arguments presented in the present
case: i) the extraterritoriality (or absence thereof) argument based on the interpretation
of Article 26 ECT; and ii) the purported primacy of EU law in intra-EU disputes.29”

Assessing the extraterritoriality argument, the tribunal held that, while the area of a REIO
may cover the area of a Member State, this does not deprive that Member State of an
“area’ for the purpose of Article 1.10 of the ECT.?°° The term “area” at Article 26.1 ECT
refers to the area of the Contracting Party against whom the investor is acting; here, that
of Spain, not of the EU.?°° The tribunal also concluded that the absence of an explicit
disconnection clause lends credence to this interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT.5°°

Assessing the argument regarding the primacy of EU law in intra-EU disputes, the
tribunal held that any alleged incompatibility between EU law and the ECT would raise
a simple conflict of law (not of jurisdiction), a conflict which the tribunal is empowered to
resolve.°*' The tribunal further held that Article 344 TFEU refers exclusively to the
founding treaties of the EU, which are not in play in the dispute between the Dutch
investors and the Kingdom of Spain since the investors’ claims were not brought under
EU law, but rather under the ECT. In any event, the tribunal held that it is empowered to
apply EU law to the extent necessary to resolve the dispute.°°2

Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.a.R.I. v. Kingdom of
Spain - This case is an ICSID arbitration instituted by British and Luxembourgish
investors in the CSP energy sector against the Kingdom of Spain on 9 December 2013,
under the ECT. On 22 December 2014, the Kingdom of Spain filed a request for
bifurcation, asking the tribunal to address its jurisdictional objections, including the Intra-
EU Objection, as preliminary questions.*°? On 9 February 2015, the tribunal dismissed
Respondent's request for bifurcation.5°*

The Award was rendered on the merits on 4 May 2017 dismissing the Respondent's
jurisdictional objection, including the intra-EU objection. Pursuant to the Award, the
tribunal also granted the Claimants’ claims on the merits and ordered the Kingdom of
Spain to pay the investors an amount of €128 million based on the Respondent's failure
to abide by its treaty obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants
(Article 10(1) of the ECT).2°5

246. As regards the Intra-EU Objection, the tribunal assessed the Respondent's arguments
pursuant to a two-pronged analysis, examining first the interpretation of Article 26 ECT
and inquiring subsequently into Respondent's argument on the primacy of EU law in
intra-EU disputes.

247. To interpret Article 26 ECT, the tribunal applied the interpretative canon provided at
Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.°° It found that the plain meaning of Article 26 ECT did
not support the exclusion of intra-EU claims sought by the Respondent. Turning to the
purpose of the ECT, the tribunal ruled that the exclusion sought by Respondent would
have required some “express warning.” No such explicit language supporting
Respondent's interpretation is to be found within the stated purpose of the treaty —
formulated at Article 2 ECT — nor anywhere else.°°” The tribunal also suggested that the
absence of a disconnection clause pertaining to intra-EU disputes — given other such
disconnection clauses pertaining to the interaction of the ECT and other treaties — also
suggests that the parties to the ECT did not intend to exclude intra-EU disputes from its
scope.°°8 As regards the context of Article 26 ECT, the tribunal held that the provisions
of the ECT cited by the Respondent, being Article 36(7) regarding voting rights of a REIO
and Article 25 regarding the non-discrimination obligation between member states of a
given REIO, do not preclude any of those member states from mutually undertaking the
investor protection obligations enshrined elsewhere in the ECT.%°° As such, the tribunal
ruled that the foreignness argument asserted by the Respondent must fail because, on
the one hand, investors organized in accordance with the law of any contracting party
satisfy the definition of “/nvestor’ of a “Contracting Party’; and, on the other hand, it is
hard to see how those investors could qualify as investors of the EU, since there is no
trans-national body of EU law regulating the constitution of companies.*"°

248. Finally, as regards the primacy of EU law, the tribunal held that Article 16 of the ECT
resolves — in favour of the ECT — any conflict that could arise between EU law and the
ECT.*"' The tribunal also held that Article 344 TFEU was not applicable to this dispute
since that article only contemplates disputes between EU member states, not disputes
between an EU member state and an international investor.5'2

the Intra-EU Objection to the tribunal's jurisdiction.°'* On 11 October 2017, the Tribunal
rendered its award, dismissing the EC’s Intra-EU Objection and dismissing the
Claimants’ claims on the merits.°1”

In dismissing the Intra-EU Objection brought forth by the EC, the tribunal held that the
accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union in 2004 did not terminate the
Germany-Czech Republic BIT since that BIT and the TFEU do not relate to the same
subject matter (i.e. EU law does not provide an investor protection mechanism as
provided by that BIT).°'® As such, the conditions of Article 59 VCLT for the abrogation
of a treaty by the coming into force of a subsequent treaty are not met. The tribunal also
decided that Article 344 TFEU is not applicable to resolve the dispute because that
Article only covers state-state disputes and does not prohibit the submission of investor-
state disputes to another method of settlement.?1°

Novenergia Il - Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg),
SICAR v. Kingdom of Spain**° — This case is an SCC arbitration instituted against the
Kingdom of Spain by Luxembourgish investors in the photovoltaic solar energy sector
on 8 May 2015, under the ECT. On 29 April 2016, the Respondent filed its Statement of
Defense and its jurisdictional objections, including the Intra-EU Objection. On 15
February 2018, the Tribunal issued the Award, dismissing the Respondent's Intra-EU
objection and ordering the Respondent to pay the investors an amount of €53.3 million
for having breached its obligations to accord the investments fair and equitable
treatment (Article 10(1) ECT).

As regards the intra-EU objection, the tribunal first examined whether it has jurisdiction
rationae personae over the claims, in particular whether the diversity of territory criterion
at Article 26 ECT was met. After deciding that issue affirmatively, the tribunal assessed
whether the principle of the primacy of EU law in intra-EU relations deprives it of the
jurisdiction granted by Article 26 ECT.921

The tribunal first ruled that the diversity of territory criterion set out at Article 26 ECT was
met. The tribunal applied the interpretative provisions of the VCLT and concluded that
the ECT grants Contracting Parties individual standing, even where those Contracting

Parties are members of REIO.°% The tribunal found no basis in the ECT for limiting that
individual standing where the investor is a national of a Contracting Party which is a
member of the same REIO as the respondent.**5

Second, the tribunal dismissed the Respondent's arguments on the primacy of EU law
for the following reasons: i) the ECT contains no explicit exception to its application in
the context of intra-EU disputes;$% ii) the claims before the tribunal were not brought
under EU law, but rather pursuant to the terms of the ECT; iii) the jurisdiction of the
tribunal is based solely on the terms of the ECT;%6 and iv) there is no incompatibility
between EU law and the terms of the ECT.*?”

Finally, the tribunal invoked the jurisprudence constante issued by the international
arbitral tribunals which considered the intra-EU objection in circumstances identical or
similar to the one there and consistently dismissed it.5?°

iv. Analysis

The intra-EU jurisdictional objection ultimately raises the question of interpretation of the
ECT and the interaction in time between different multilateral treaties entered into by a
diversity of parties. It also raises the question as to whether the Tribunal must consider,
interpret or apply EU law on the merits and — if so — whether any limitation on the
interpretation and application of EU law contained in that body of law is determinative of
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The Tribunal accepts Claimants’ submission — which was also followed by the RREEF
and Novenergia tribunals (to name only a few) — that the ECT is the Tribunal’s
“constitutive treaty.” The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is grounded in the ECT and no other legal
instrument. As such, the starting point of the analysis into the question of jurisdiction is
the ECT and its scope of application in the light of its own provisions.

This said, under the ECT, the Tribunal is also mandated to resolve this dispute in
conformity with the “applicable rules and principles of international law.”>?° The EU law
is undeniably part of the body of international law that the Tribunal is also bound to apply.
The Parties do not seem to dispute that EU law is fundamentally treaty-based law. There
is no disagreement that EU law is fundamentally sourced in the Treaty of Rome and has
evolved over time as a result of various subsequent treaties and international
instruments entered into between EU member states throughout the years.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal can take guidance from the provisions of the VCLT,
in particular Articles 30 and 31 et seq. of the VCLT, raised by both parties in their
pleadings, to determine the scope of application of the ECT and the impact — if any — of
the foundational treaties of the EU and the various related instruments raised by both
parties.3°°

The Tribunal cannot, however, overstate the importance of the long record of recent
arbitral awards or partial awards which disposed of the intra-EU jurisdictional objections
and maintained the jurisdiction of the respective ECT tribunals.°°" In the Tribunal’s view,
these form an arbitral jurisprudence constante which, short of binding this Tribunal,
provides nonetheless a persuasive, reasoned and documented analytical framework
that the Tribunal endorses and adopts without the need to spell it out in detail below.

In this case, the disputes that the Parties agreed to submit to international arbitration
under the aegis of the ICSID pursuant to Article 26(4)(a)(i) ECT are defined at Article
26(1) of the ECT as follows: “/djisputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of
another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former,
which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part Ill (...).”
[Emphasis added]

The Tribunal is of the view that the ordinary meaning of Article 26(1) of the ECT, read in
its context and in the light of the ECT’s object and purpose does not preclude the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over disputes between an EU member state and an investor from
another EU member state for the following reasons.

First, the ordinary meaning of the the term “Area” used at Article 26(1) ECT does not
obviate the foreignness criterion in the presence of an intra-EU investor-state dispute.
Article 1(10) ECT provides two (2) definitions of the term “Area.” With respect to a state
that is a Contracting Party, “Area” means the territory under the state’s sovereignty.°°2
With respect to a Regional Economic Organisation (REIO) which is also a Contracting
Party, “Area” means the territory under the sovereignty of the member states of such
REIO.*3 The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the two definitions are not mutually
exclusive. Rather, one or the other definition applies depending on the author of the
actions impugned, the REIO or the member state.

Second, this interpretation of the term “Area” is congruent with the context of related
ECT provisions. Most importantly, it is the only definition that comports with Article 16
ECT, which states unequivocally that, in case of conflict between the dispute resolution
provisions at Article 26(1) ECT and those of any other treaty, the provisions most

favourable to the investors must prevail. This shows that the Contracting Parties to the
ECT intended to safeguard the applicability of the dispute resolution provisions at Article
26(1) ECT even in case of conflict with another treaty to the extent that the ECT is “more
favourable to the Investor or the Investment.” The mere presence of an intra-REIO
dispute is therefore insufficient to exclude international arbitration under Article 26(1)
ECT. Per Article 16 ECT, to set aside the application of Article 26(1) ECT to intra-EU
disputes, Respondent had the burden of showing that the EU legal system provides a
method to resolve Claimants’ dispute with Spain that is “more favourable” to the
investors than the one provided at Article 26(1) ECT. Respondent failed to do so.

By contrast, the rigoristic interpretation of the term “Area” proposed by Respondent finds
no support in the other terms of the ECT cited by Respondent or in any relevant
authorities. Article 25 ECT, invoked by the Respondent, applies to relationships between
parties to an Economic Integration Agreement (“EIA”) and non-parties to that EIA, and
vice versa. This provision stipulates that the ECT cannot be invoked by outsiders to an
EIA to avail themselves of rights under that EIA that they would otherwise not have.
Article 25 ECT is of no relevance to determine under what conditions the foreignness
criterion set out at Article 26(1) of the ECT is met. In any event, the interpretation of the
term “Area” proposed by Claimants affects in no way the operability or sphere of
application of Article 25 ECT.

Third, there is no incompatibility between the object and purpose of the ECT and the
jurisdiction of ECT international arbitration tribunals over intra-EU disputes. Even if the
Tribunal were to accept that the integration of former Soviet bloc states into the West
European energy market was as prominent a purpose of the ECT as the Respondent
pleads it was, the Tribunal is not convinced that this purpose is in any way diminished
or negated by the jurisdiction of ECT tribunals over intra-EU disputes. Quite to the
contrary, the integration sought is perfected by the application of the same dispute
resolution method to all ECT-related investor-state disputes, whether these disputes are
intra-EU or not.

Fourth, the Tribunal cannot qualify the various decisions, statements and legal positions
of the European Commission as an “instrument,” “subsequent agreement’ or
“subsequent practice” that the Tribunal is bound to consider under Articles 31(2)(b),
31(3)(a) or 31(3)(b) VCLT respectively. The same holds true for the Achmea decision.
That is because all these instruments, decisions and/or statements have been enacted
solely within the legal sphere of the European Union and, as such, have not met with
the agreement of all ECT Contracting Parties (including non-EU member states
Contracting Parties) nor can they be qualified as a practice establishing such an
agreement between all ECT Contracting Parties.

As regards the January Declarations in particular, the Tribunal reviewed carefully the
only legal source provided by Respondent in support of its position that the term “parties”
at Articles 31(3)(a) and 31(3)(b) VCLT should be interpreted as meaning some but not

necessarily all parties to a treaty.°°4 The Tribunal sought but could not find in that legal
source anything of assistance to Respondent's thesis.°*5 As a result, the Tribunal cannot
grant the January Declarations the “interpretative force” proposed by Respondent.*6

. Nor can the Tribunal accept Respondent's argument that the January Declarations have

an interpretative effect on the scope and content of EU law regarding investment
protection and treaties concluded, inter alia, between EU member states.°°” That is
because the January Declarations were not adopted within the EU legal order and are
not EU legal instruments. They are, at best, declarations by the governments of some
EU member states. Although the governmental delegates who signed the January
Declarations convened with the occasion of a meeting of the the Comité des
représentants permanents (“COREPER’, itself an EU organ), the mere existence of
three (3) distinct declarations enouncing three (3) distinct legal positions on the same
issues by three (3) distinct groups of EU member states confirms that neither of those
declarations can be attributed to the COREPER or, for that matter, to any other organ
of the EU. In particular, the ECJ, which is the highest judicial body in charge of the
interpretation of European law, has not taken so far any position as to the applicability
of its judgment in the Achmea case to arbitration tribunals the jurisdiction of which is
based on the ECT. Taken for what they are, i.e. declarations by sovereign states made
within the framework of the general international legal system, the January Declarations
cannot be considered as a source of an authentic interpretation of the part of EU law on
which they purport to opine.

In any event, judging by its terms, the 15 January Declaration®** invoked by Respondent
exceeds the scope of a simple “interpretative declaration,” as this term is commonly
understood in international law. The 15 January Declaration states that a key provision
of the ECT, namely Article 26 ECT — which is clear and contains no inherent ambiguity
whatsoever — is to be simply set aside in the settlement of an intra-EU investor-state
dispute, an initiative which comes very close to introducing a disconnection clause, of
sorts, into the ECT, contrary to the original intention of the drafters of this treaty.°°° As
such, the 15 January Declaration purports to bring about an effect akin to an amendment
of the ECT or, at the very least, akin to a reservation by the states that signed it. Yet,
such an amendment could be only valid with the unanimous consent of all ECT
contracting parties as explicitly provided at Article 36(1)(a) of the ECT.*° As for the

possibility of a potential reservation, Article 46 ECT provides clearly that “No
reservations may be made to this Treaty.”

Fifth, the travaux préparatoires of the ECT confirm that the Contracting Parties turned
their minds to the possibility of a disconnection clause between the ECT and the EU
treaties but ultimately stopped short of including such a clause in the final text of the
ECT. This fact — in conjunction with the existence of a disconnection clause in favour of
the Svalbard Treaty**' — confirms the Contracting Parties’ intention to apply the dispute
resolution method provided at Article 26 ECT to intra-EU disputes.

This result might be different if the EU members states that signed the January
Declarations would have withdrawn from the ECT or activated the procedure for
amending the ECT. But that has not occurred. And in the absence of such a scenario,
these documents cited by Respondent qualify at best as “supplementary means of
interpretation” under Article 32 VLCT to which the Tribunal can resort at its discretion to
either confirm the result of the interpretative exercise above or to infirm it in the limited
circumstances set out at Articles 32(a) and (b) VCLT. The Tribunal chooses not to do
the latter here, for the following reasons:

- The result yielded by the interpretation of Article 26(1) ECT in accordance with the
ordinary meaning of its terms in their context and in the light of its object and
purpose is not “ambiguous or obscure” nor is it “manifestly absurd or
unreasonable”;*42

- The legal positions set forth in the foregoing EU decisions, statements, and/or
declarations are largely based upon the premise that — in the context of intra-EU
investor-state disputes -, international arbitral tribunals would be called upon to
apply or interpret EU law to resolve the merits of the dispute. That premise does
not hold true in this case. As shall be amply made clear below, the Tribunal is of
the view that the provisions of EU law are not dispositive nor even relevant to
resolve the issues raised by this dispute. For the reasons outlined below, in the
sections dealing with the merits of this award, the same can be said for the Spain
national law provisions invoked by Respondent.

- In any event, Respondent did not make a satisfactory demonstration of any
incompatibility or conflict between any EU legal provisions and the ECT provisions
applicable here, whether as regards the jurisdictional issues or the merits of this
dispute. On the jurisdictional question, the ECJ implicitly upheld the validity and
applicability of international agreements referring intra-EU disputes to non-EU
decision-making bodies “provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order
are respected."*3 The Respondent failed to demonstrate that recourse to
arbitration to resolve a dispute between an investor from an EU member state and
another EU member state would jeopardize the autonomy of the EU. The Tribunal

is not aware of — and the Respondent did not invoke — a recourse in international
arbitration for aggrieved investors under EU law similar to the one created by
Article 26 ECT. As regards the merits of this dispute, Respondent invoked a
plethora of EU regulations, treaty provisions, guidelines and other instruments
(especially pertaining to state aid)*** but — in the Tribunal’s view — failed to show
any incompatibility thereof with the investor-protection regime contained at
Articles 10 ECT and following.345

In the Tribunal’s view, the foregoing reasons are dispositive as well for the argument
raised by Respondent regarding the alleged primacy of EU law in the context of intra-
EU disputes, which the Tribunal does not follow.

For all these reasons and given the jurisprudence constante on this issue, the Tribunal
dismisses the intra-EU jurisdictional objection.

B. THE TAXATION OBJECTION

As noted above, the purported taxation measure at issue insofar as the issue of
jurisdiction is concerned is the Tax on the Value of the Production of Electric Energy (the
“TVPEE”). The TVPEE was enacted on 27 December 2012 by the Act 15/2012, as part
of the Regulatory Framework No. 2 impugned by Claimants.*° Both parties agree that
the TVPEE is a 7 % charge on the value received by an electricity producer in
consideration for producing and incorporating electricity into Spain’s electric system.°4”
Both parties further agree that the TVPEE applies both to conventional power producers
and renewable power producers.*“8

On the merits, Claimants invoke the TVPEE to demonstrate three (3) alleged breaches
of the ECT by Respondent. Claimants argue that: i) the TVPEE amounts to an
expropriation of its investments, in breach of Article 13 ECT;**° ii) the enactment of the
TVPEE amounts to a breach of its legitimate expectations regarding Spain's regulatory
framework governing renewable energy production, and therefore constitutes a breach
of Respondent's fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) obligations under Article 10(1)
ECT; jii) the enactment of the TVPEE constitutes a breach of Respondent's obligation
not to impair Claimants’ investment by “unreasonable” or “discriminatory’ measures,
pursuant to Article 10(1) ECT.°5"

344 See in particular Respondent's PHB, at paras. 181 and following.

345 See infra, at paras. 411 and following.

346 As shall be discussed in more detail in the merits section below, the Claimants take issue with two series
of legislative and executive enactments, being Regulatory Framework No. 2 (2012-2013) and Regulatory
Framework No. 3 (2013-2014), which allegedly altered fundamentally the legal framework governing the
renewable energy market to the detriment of producers.

The TVPEE appears central to the expropriation claim as well as to the non-impairment
claim. It appears, however, only an ancillary foundation for the FET claim.

Respondent initially asked the Tribunal to declare that it lacks jurisdiction to hear all
InfraRed claims invoking the TVPEE, both those based on expropriation (Article 13 ECT)
and those based on FET and non-impairment obligations (Article 10 ECT). After
Claimants responded to all of these jurisdictional objections, Respondent withdrew its
objection with respect to Claimants’ expropriation claim based on the TVPEE.

As it presently stands, Respondent's Taxation Objection relates solely to Claimants’ FET
and discrimination claims under Article 10 ECT in relation to the TVPEE.

i, The Respondent's Position

Summary of Respondent’s Argument — Respondent submits that its consent to
arbitration under the ECT is limited to disputes arising under Part Ill of the ECT. By virtue
of the carve-out at Article 21(1) of the ECT, Part Ill of the ECT does not create obligations
or rights with respect to Taxation Measures (as defined at Article 21(7) of the ECT), save
for certain limited exceptions. According to Respondent, the TVPEE is one such
Taxation Measure, which does not fall within the various exceptions provided by the ECT
(referred to as “claw-back provisions” by the parties). As such, Respondent argues that
it did not consent to arbitrate claims arising from the TVPEE.

Taxation Measure — Respondent argues that the TVPEE falls within the scope of the
term Taxation Measure (Article 21(7)(a) ECT) because it is “a provision related to
taxation” both under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain and according to international
law. The Respondent invokes the provisions of the Act 15/2012 which creates the
TVPEE as well as various orders and other legislative measures which, according to
Respondent, establish that: i) the TVPEE is a direct tax; ii) taxpayers must record the
TVPEE in their expense accounts and can apply for a deduction in corporate taxes as a
result. The Respondent also submits that the TVPEE satisfies the international legal test
for qualifying a taxation measure, since it is: i) a financial obligation imposed by law; ii)
levied on a class of persons — specifically all electricity producers (both those using
traditional and renewable technologies); and iii) for a public purpose.

Good faith - In response to Claimants’ arguments that the TVPEE is not a good faith
taxation measure, Respondent submits that: i) the good faith analysis proposed by the
Claimants is not applicable in the present case; and ii) even if such analysis were indeed
applicable, the TVPEE was enacted in good faith. In particular, Respondent submits that
the good faith analysis proposed by Claimants (as undertaken by the tribunal in Yukos
v. the Russian Federation) is only applicable in the presence of extraordinary
circumstances, where the purpose of the taxation measure is entirely dissociated from
the public interest and aims instead at the destruction of a particular corporation or the
elimination of a political opponent.**? Respondent submits that no such circumstances
are present here. Even if the good faith analysis were applicable, Respondent defends

the bona fide nature of the TVPEE by submitting that the TVPEE does not discriminate
between energy producers since it is applicable to both renewable and conventional
producers. In fact, the renewable energy producers are the least affected by this
measure since, by Respondent's account, they are entitled recover some of the amounts
levied through the remuneration they receive for the energy produced. Such
remuneration includes a reimbursement of operating costs, which according to
Respondent, includes the TVPEE.°3

283. Non-Application of Claw-back — |n response to Claimants’ alternative argument
regarding the so-called “Claw-back’, the Respondent argues that the exceptions created
by the ECT for the application of Part III obligations to taxation measures do not apply
in the present case. Respondent submits that the exception provided at Article 21(3)
ECT** finds no application here since the TVPEE is a tax on income, which can never
come within the scope of the claw-back, per the clear language of Article 21(3) ECT.35>
The Respondent relies upon a Reader’s Guide published by the Energy Charter Treaty
Secretariat, which assimilates taxes on income with “direct taxes.” Respondent further
argues that direct taxes are those which “cannot be legally passed on by the taxpayer
to another person” (the most obvious example of which are taxes on consumption). By
contrast, Respondent pleads that the TVPEE is a tax on income (albeit on gross income)
and thus a direct taxation measure which cannot be passed down to consumers.
Furthermore, Respondent also invokes the broad definition of the term “taxes on income
or on capital’ at Article 21(7)(b) ECT: “there shall be regarded as taxes on income or on
capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of
capital (...) or substantially similar taxes, (...)” [Our underlined]

284. Even if the TVPEE were not considered a tax on income, Respondent submits that this
taxation measure cannot be subjected to the most favoured nation (“MFN”) obligation
invoked by Claimants, since the international treaty provisions invoked by Claimants to
establish that obligation relate to taxation measures and, as such, are excluded from the
scope of the claw-back.*5° Since MFN obligations cannot be imposed by virtue of the
ECT with respect to advantages accorded by Spain pursuant to other tax provisions of
international treaties, the Respondent argues that the TVPEE is therefore not subject to
the obligations created by Article 10 ECT.

ii. The Claimants’ Position

353 Resp. Co-Mo, on p. 129.

354 Article 21(3) provides that Articles 10(2) (equal treatment) and Article 10(7) (most favorable nation
treatment) shall apply to Taxation Measure other than those on income or capital. However, pursuant to Article
21(3)(a), these provisions shall not apply to “impose most favoured nation obligations with respect to
advantages accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to tax provisions of any convention, agreement or
arrangement described in subparagraph 7(a)(ii) or resulting from membership of any Regional Economic
Organisation.”

285. Summary - The Claimants submit that the TVPEE is in effect a State-mandated cut in
the remuneration of renewable energy producers garbed in the disguise of a taxation
measure. Claimants argue that the TVPEE is therefore not a good faith Taxation
Measure. For this reason, it should not be affected by the carve-out stipulated at Article
21 ECT.*” In any event, even if it were deemed a Taxation Measure, the investor
protection obligations incumbent upon Spain are applicable to the TVPEE by virtue of
the claw-back provision of Article 21(3) ECT since: i) TVPEE is not a tax on income or
on capital;3®° and ii) Spain has already granted the protection sought here to investors
from other countries. As a result of the MFN obligation salvaged from the carve-out by
the claw-back provision, Respondent is bound to extend to Claimants the same
protection as regard the TVPEE.*°°

286. Good Faith — Claimants submit that the TVPEE is not a bona fide Taxation Measure —
though it bears the appearance of one — and is therefore not subject to the carve-out
contained at section 21(1) of the ECT for the following principal reasons:

- The TVPEE is not levied to finance public expenses : According to Claimants, the
TVPEE was enacted to offset the costs of Spain’s electricity system and thus
tackle the deficit plaguing that system. Claimants submit that the budget of the
electricity system is not a public expense because the electricity system functions
as a private market in which various actors (producers, distributors, etc.) ply their
various services, albeit under the supervision of a public body, the CNMC.%°
Therefore the costs of the electricity system (which generated the deficit) are
liabilities payable to private actors, not government entities. By this account, any
measure to offset those costs are beneficial to the private actors, not the state;

- The TVPEE fails to respond to its environmental justification: Claimants submit
that the ostensible environmental justification of the TVPEE is belied by the
economic effects of the measure. Since the TVPEE affects both traditional energy
producers and renewable producers, with no regard to their relative environmental
footprints, Claimants infer that the Respondent could not have truly pursued an
environmental purpose when it enacted the TVPEE.**

- The TVPEE is economically equivalent to a reduction in the remuneration of the
renewable energy producers: Claimants invoke several public declarations by
high-ranking Spanish government officials to the effect that the government had
considered implementing a direct cut in the remuneration of the renewable energy
producers to address the tariff deficit, but, due to the legal problems this option
posed, the Spanish government decided instead to enact the TVPEE. Claimants
rely on these declarations to argue that both the TVPEE and a potential direct cut
in the remuneration of renewable energy producers bring about the same

economic effect, i.e. a reduction in the revenue of renewable energy producers. 92
As such, Claimants argue that the ultimate goal of the TVPEE was to “slash the
remuneration of Special Regime producers (...) to finance the tariff deficit.">°

Application of the Claw-back — In the alternative, should the Tribunal find that the
TVPEE is a good faith Taxation Measure for the purposes of Article 21(1) ECT,
Claimants submit that it would nonetheless remain subject to the MFN obligations
(Article 10(7) ECT) as a result of the claw-back provision contained at Article 21(3) ECT.
In particular, Claimants submit that the TVPEE is not a tax on income and thus falls
within the scope of the claw-back provision, since the TVPEE is levied on the gross
revenue received by electricity producers, not on net income (obtained after deduction
the costs of production, taxes, etc.).°°* Claimants invoke the ordinary meaning of the
term “taxes on income” and cite the definition given to this term by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) which equates taxes on income with
taxes levied on “net income or profits (gross income minus allowable tax reliefs) (...).”9

Since Respondent has generally undertaken FET, Most Constant Protection and
Security (“MCPS”), Umbrella Clause and Non-Impairment obligations towards investors
from other countries pursuant to certain BITs, it follows that it must extend that same
treatment to Claimants with respect to the TVPEE, pursuant to the MFN obligation set
out at Article 10(7) ECT which, in Claimants’ account, remains applicable to the TVPEE
by virtue of the claw-back.%®°

Finally, Claimants submit that the BITs they invoke to establish the Respondent's
obligation to extend to them the same protection extended to other investors with respect
to the TVPEE are not taxation measures nor conventions, agreements or arrangements
for the purpose of Article 21(7)(a)(ii) ECT and are therefore included in the scope of the
claw-back.%6”

iii, | Relevant authorities

RREEF*® — Although the TVPEE objection was raised in RREEF, and although the
tribunal in that case granted Spain’s bifurcation request, the tribunal ultimately joined
this partial jurisdictional objection to the merits of the dispute.

After reviewing the parties’ arguments, the tribunal held that the characterization of the
TVPEE as a bona fide or mala fide taxation measure cuts to the heart of the dispute on
the merits and must be assessed in light of the entire body of “a careful investigation of

the circumstances and of the effects of the challenged measure.”*°° For this reason, the
Tribunal joined this objection with the merits, without, however, prejudging the
admissibility of this objection as a preliminary issue. The Parties did not bring the
decision on liability in RREEF to the attention of the Tribunal.

292. Isolux°”° — The tribunal first decided that the TVPEE is prima facie a taxation measure
subject to the carve-out at Article 21(1) ECT.97' Taking guidance from the authorities
submitted by the Claimant (identical to the ones submitted by the Claimants in this case),
the tribunal decided that the taxation carve-out only applies to bona fide taxation
measures.°”? Tribunals are therefore empowered to inquire into the true nature of the
impugned taxation measure and assess whether it was promulgated for ulterior motives,
other than to raise revenues for the state.5’ The carve-out fails where the measure was
enacted in bad faith.?”* Any impugned taxation measures is presumed in good faith and
the claimant bears the burden to overturn that presumption.°”

293. In Isolux, the tribunal found that the Claimant failed to overturn the presumption. The
tribunal found that the TVPEE applied equally to the fossil fuel and renewable energies,
without discriminating between traditional and more recent technologies, nor between
the remuneration for the energy produced (market price or regulated tariff). Absent
“extreme purposes’ ,>’° the economic repercussions or effects of the taxation measure
were held insufficient to overturn the presumption.°”’ The tribunal conceded that the
TVPEE may fail to measure up to its stated purpose in favour of the environment and its
promulgation may have had no other real purpose than to reduce the tariff deficit. But,
according to the tribunal, this incongruity between stated purpose and economic effect
was not sufficient to overturn the presumption of good faith.*”° The tribunal therefore
declined jurisdiction over the claim based on the enactment of the TVPEE.%”9

294. Ejiser®®° - As in Isolux, the Eiser tribunal first decided that the TVPEE has all the
characteristics associated with a legitimate taxation measure and therefore falls within
the literal definition of “Taxation Measure” under Article 21(7) ECT.%8' Unlike /solux,
however, the Eiser tribunal did not wade into the debate regarding the applicability of
the carve-out set out at Article 21(1) ECT to taxation measures enacted in bad faith. The
Eiser tribunal simply held that the evidence produced in the record falls short of
demonstrating an improper or abusive use of the Kingdom of Spain’s taxation power, or

that that TVPEE was enacted to destroy the claimants.°®? The tribunal therefore declined
jurisdiction over the part of the claims pertaining to the TVPEE.°®°

Novenergia**‘ — The ruling by the Novenergia tribunal on the TVPEE taxation measure
follows the same analytical pattern as the ones adopted by the tribunals in Eiser and
Isolux. The Novenergia tribunal first decided that Act 15/2012 enacting the TVPEE was
prima facie a taxation measure within the meaning of Article 21(7) ECT. Like the
Isolux tribunal, the Novenergia tribunal accepted that the carve-out of taxation measures
only applies to those taxation measures enacted in good faith.**° The tribunal further
ruled that the claimant bears the burden of proving that Act 15/2012 was enacted in bad
faith. The claimant failed to discharge that burden since the evidence produced and
arguments submitted fail to disclose the “extreme actions” which, according to other
tribunals, constitute mala fide grounds.*®’ As a result, the Novenergia tribunal declined
jurisdiction over the part of the claim arising from the enactment of the TVPEE.*%

iv. Analysis

. In the light of the foregoing, it appears that the fundamental issues in dispute in the

context of the Taxation Objection are the good (or bad) faith nature of the TVPEE and,
subsidiarily only, whether the TVPEE is covered by the claw-back provision at Article
21(3) ECT.

Good faith — As regards the good faith nature of the TVPEE, the Tribunal is of the view
that the parties are fundamentally in disagreement about the economic effects of the
TVPEE. Indeed, the great majority (if not all) of the arguments raised by Claimants to
impugn the good faith of the TVPEE seem to relate to the economic effects of this
measure independently of its legal operation. As such, these arguments deal primarily
with the economic objective prompting Spain to levy the TVPEE, the effectiveness of the
TVPEE to accomplish that objective, the economic impact of the TVPEE upon the
renewable and the conventional energy producers, etc.

The principal arbitral decision cited by the Parties that ruled on the exclusion of bad faith
taxation measures from the scope of the tax carve-out provision in the ECT is Yukos v.
Russia.**° |n that case, the tribunal held that Claimants successfully demonstrated that
the taxation measures at issue were enacted by the Russian Federation with the sole
motivation of eliminating a political opponent and bankrupting his company. In particular,
the tribunal held that the claimants had demonstrated that, among others: a) the
motivation of the State or the enacting authority was to achieve a purpose entirely

unrelated from the purpose of raising general revenue for the State;5°° and b) that such
a motivation could be apparent independently of the effects of the taxation measure.°°!

This approach seems consistent with the legal test applied by other international
arbitration tribunals in investor-state disputes to determine whether a taxation measure
is covered by the scope of carve-out provisions contained in various BITs similar to the
one contained at Article 21(3) ECT. For example, in EnCana v. Ecuador,?* the tribunal
held that the economic effects of a legislative enactment were only secondarily relevant
to assess whether the enactmentis a taxation measure for the purposes of the tax carve-
out contained in the Canada-Ecuador BIT. Of primary importance is the legal operation
of the taxation measure at issue, namely whether it was established by law and whether
itimposes liability on classes of persons to pay funds to the State for public purposes.*°?

In light of the foregoing legal principles and of the evidence adduced in this case, the
Tribunal is not convinced by Claimants’ arguments that the TVPEE is a measure
enacted in bad faith.

First, the Tribunal is satisfied by the evidence presented that the proceeds of the TVPEE
are payable directly to the Kingdom of Spain and that the total revenue levied by the
Kingdom of Spain through the TVPEE is reported in the General State Budget of Spain.
The Tribunal is of the view that the TVPEE is in the nature of a taxation measure.

In the circumstances, Claimants bore the burden of proving that the TVPEE was
nonetheless enacted to achieve a purpose entirely unrelated to that of levying state
revenue and that this purpose is apparent independently of the economic effects of the
TVPEE.

The Claimants failed to discharge this burden of proof.

The Claimants have, at best, presented arguments and evidence regarding the
economic effects of the TVPEE which — even if accepted — fail to show that the TVPEE
was enacted for any other reason than to levy revenue for the state.

Even if the Tribunal were to accept that the TVPEE benefits the private actors that
operate in Spain's private electricity market, the tariff deficit remains nonetheless an
issue of public interest, which affects the finances of the Kingdom of Spain. It is obvious
that Kingdom of Spain incurs expenses as a result of the tariff deficit, including the
subsidies it undertook to pay renewable energy producers, among others. As such, the
reduction of the tariff deficit is directly related to the purpose of reducing expenses (and,
by extension, raising general revenue) for the Kingdom of Spain.

Similarly, even if the Tribunal were to accept that the enactment of the TVPEE is contrary
to sound environmental policy, such a finding would be of no assistance to the

Claimants. The qualification of the TVPEE as a taxation measure is not tributary of its
economic effects but rather of its legal operation.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the TVPEE targeted renewable and non-renewable energy
producers alike. The environmental effects of the TVPEE and its ultimate economic
effects on renewable energy producers like the plants at issue are of no direct relevance
for the qualification of the TVPEE as a taxation measure.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimants failed to discharge their
burden of proving that the TVPEE was enacted in bad faith and should not be considered
a taxation measure.

Scope of the claw-back — The Tribunal notes that the carve-out set out at Article 21(1)
ECT which excludes Taxation Measures from the purview of ECT obligations is phrased
in broad and general terms. So is the definition of the term “Taxation Measures” set out
at Article 21(7) ECT. The Tribunal is of the view that these broad and general terms are
in furtherance of the principle of state sovereignty enshrined (in its application to state
energy resources) at Article 18 ECT.

As regards the claw-back of certain types of taxes to bring them back within the purview
of ECT obligations (set out at Article 21(3) ECT), the issue in dispute is concerned with
the scope of the term “taxes on income or on capital’ (Article 21(7)(b) ECT) and whether
the TVPEE is part of this category of taxes.

If the TVPEE is a tax on income or on capital, then it remains unaffected by the claw-
back and any related to it are excluded from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

If the TVPEE is not found to be a “tax on income”, then the TVPEE would be included in
the scope of the claw-back and subject to the MFN obligation at Article 10(7) ECT, which
would bind Spain to extend to the Claimants the same FET, Umbrella Clause and MCPS
protections it extended to investors pursuant to other BITs.

The question is whether the term “taxes on income” at Article 21(7)(b) ECT includes only
taxes on net income (i.e. profits) or whether it also includes taxes on gross income or
revenues (i.e. sales). Since the determination of this issue requires the interpretation of
a provision of an international treaty, the Tribunal will therefore take guidance from the
interpretative canon provided at Article 31 VCLT.

The Tribunal is of the view that the Parties did not adduce any “instruments”,
“agreements” or “practices” which are useful to shed light upon the scope of the term
“taxes on income or on capital.” The Tribunal does not find the Reader's Guide published
by the Energy Charter Secretariat (and invoked by Respondent) useful to decide
whether the TVPEE falls into the category of “taxes on income or on capital,” if only
because the workings of the TVPEE transcend the dichotomy of “direct’ versus “indirect
taxation measures set out in that document. Based on that document, Respondent
argues that the TVPEE is a “direct tax’ and is hence a “tax on income or capital’ because
the taxpayers (i.e. the energy producers) cannot “recover the amount of the tax through

the repercussion of the amount of the tax to another person.”*°* However, Respondent
also submits that the energy producers can recover the amount of the TVPEE —
presumably from the consumers — by factoring it into the cost of the power produced
and sold.%95

The Tribunal finds equally inconclusive the definition given to the term “taxes on income
or on capital’ by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(“OECD”). Claimants argue that the OECD equates the term “taxes on income or on
capital’ with taxes levied on “net income or profits (gross income minus allowable tax
reliefs).”59° Should this limit the scope of the term “taxes on income or on capital’ to
taxes on profits as the Claimants seem to argue? The Tribunal does not think so.

Further to Article 31 VCLT, the Tribunal must interpret the term in accordance with its
ordinary meaning, its context and in the light of the underlying objectives and purpose
of the ECT. The term “taxes on income or on capital is defined in the excessively broad
terms to include, among others “all taxes ... on elements of income or capital ... or
substantially similar taxes.” [Emphasis added]

The Tribunal is of the view that such broad terms serve to restrict the scope of the claw-
back of certain types of taxes. This is in keeping with the purpose of the ECT,°°” which
explicitly incorporates the objectives and principles of the European Energy Charter,
which, in turn, cite state sovereignty as an important consideration.5%°

The Tribunal is of the view that even though the term “income” is not defined in the ECT,
the TVPEE is undeniably a tax on the energy producers’ gross income. As such, it is
“substantially similar’ — if not squarely identical — to a tax on income or on capital.

For these reasons, the Tribunal declines jurisdiction on the parts of Claimants’ claim that
impugn the enactment of the TVPEE.

THE ISSUES ON THE MERITS

In the light of the above-mentioned facts and given the Parties’ positions described
briefly above and further summarized below, the following issues (on the merits) are to

2. Did Respondent accord Claimants’ investment “fair and equitable treatment’
(“FET”) under Article 10(1) of the ECT? In particular:

Legal Standard for FET — What is the legal standard governing the
assessment of the “fair and equitable” nature of the treatment that Spain
was obliged to accord the Claimants’ investments? In particular:

. Is the FET obligation of a host state under Article 10(1) of the ECT
limited to a non-discrimination obligation, once the investment has
been made on the territory of the host state, as pleaded by
Respondent?

. What role, if any, does Claimants’ due diligence play in the context of
assessing Claimants’ legitimate expectations and the scope of
Respondent's FET obligation?

. In assessing Claimants’ legitimate expectations and the scope of
Respondent's FET obligation, how, if at all, should the Tribunal weigh
the (un)foreseeability of the regulatory changes at issue and the
public policy considerations pursued by Respondent in enacting
them?

Expectation of Stability — Did Claimants have a legitimate expectation that
the Original Regulatory Framework would remain fixed throughout the
operational lifespan of the Morén and Olivenza plants?

. Among other things, did the Purported Agreement, the waiver letters
and the December Resolutions, and the enactment of RD 1614/2010
give rise to a legitimate expectation that Respondent would not adopt
any changes to the remunerative regime applicable to the CSP plants
that were operational or had registered on the RAIPRE prior to
December 2010?

Expectation of Consistency -— Did Claimants have a legitimate
expectation that the precepts of the Original Regulatory Framework would
not be radically or fundamentally altered? Among other things, did such a
legitimate expectation arise regarding the following specific elements of the
Original Framework:

. The feed-in remuneration system based on the actual production and
distribution of electricity and the option to choose remuneration (in €
per MWh) based on a regulated tariff or on the “pool price” of
electricity supplemented by a premium?°%9

3. Does the answer to question 2 (above) dispose of the entire case on the merits?
If so, must the Tribunal rule upon the remaining issues?

If the Tribunal decides to rule upon the remaining issues:

4. Did Respondent breach the “umbrella clause” at Article 10(1) of the ECT by
enacting the Measures at Issue? In particular:

- Did the Purported Agreement and the exchange of letters of waiver and
December Resolutions constitute a unilateral or bilateral undertaking
binding upon Respondent not to revise the Original Regulatory Framework
or —at the very least — to carve out the Mordén and Olivenza plants from the
scope of application of any regulatory changes?

5. Did the enactment of the Measures at Issue constitute an expropriation or a
“creeping expropriation” of Claimants’ investment?

6. Did Respondent breach its obligation not to impair Claimants’ investment with
unreasonable and discriminatory measures?

7. Did Respondent breach its obligation to accord Claimants’ investment the most
constant protection and security?

8. If the Tribunal makes a finding of liability, what is the quantum of Claimants’
damages? In particular:

their investment, RD 1614/2010, which Claimants invoke as the source of their legitimate expectation of
regulatory stability, had already limited the number of hours of operation for which the CSP producers were
entitled to remuneration under the Special Regime. See in this regard Article 2(3) of RD 1614/2010 (C-0050t).
408 The Original Regulatory Framework did not limit the number of years of operation during which a CSP plant
could receive Special Regime remuneration. Annex VIII of MO IET/1045/2014 (C-0321t) established the
lifetime of CSP plants at 25 years and provided thus preventing the plants from receiving remuneration after
25 years of operation. According to Claimants, this is inaccurate since the lifetime of the CSP plants is at least
35 years. Both Parties produced expert reports to support their respective positions.

409 See Article 1 of RD-L 2/2013 (C-0322t).

410 The Claimants argue that Article 26(2) EPA 2013 (C-0311t) and RD 413/2014 (C-0328t) abrogated the
CSP producers’ rights to priority access. However, this is not immediately apparent from the text of these
provisions and Respondent argues that the Measures at Issue maintained the CSP producers’ right to priority
access. See in this regard Resp. Co-Mo, at paras. 594 and following.

VI. DISCUSSION
A. THE PLANTS’ INSTALLED CAPACITY

321. This issue, raised by Respondent in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, has a bearing
upon: i. the admissibility of the Morén and Olivenza plants under the Special Regime
established by the Original Regulatory Framework; and ii. quantum.

322. It is undisputed that CSP plants the “installed capacity’ of which exceed 50 MW would
not, in principle, be entitled to remuneration under the Special Regime.‘*'2

i, The Parties’ Positions

323. Claimants — Claimants first argue that — in keeping with Article 3(1) of RD 661/2007419
(in force when the plants were built and the generators installed) — the “installed
capacity’ must be interpreted as the capacity stated on the generator nameplate."
Claimants have produced as evidence the verification reports of Spain’s National
Commission on Markets and Competition — i.e. Comisién Nacional de los Mercados y la
Competencia (the “CNMC”) — which reproduce the inscriptions on the nameplates of the
turbines of the two plants and which on their face confirm that the nameplates specify a
capacity of 49,900 kW for Olivenza 14'S and 50,000 kW for Morén.416

324. Claimants further submit that the term “installed capacity’ should be interpreted as the
net capacity distributed to the grid, not the gross capacity produced by the generator
since:

i. According to Claimants’ technical experts, the term “installed capacity’ indeed
designates such net capacity. They testified that the common practice and usage
of the CSP industry both in Spain and abroad (in particular in California, the site
of the only CSP plants that have been in operation for more than 30 years)
equates installed capacity with the net delivery of energy to the grid;4"”

ii. The output of the generators is measured at the node connecting the CSP plant
to the grid, not at the terminals of the generators;418

412 Article 27 of the EPA 1997 (C-0047t).

413 See C-0049t.

14 It is noted, however, that Article 3(1) of RD 661/2007 does not mention “installed capacity’ but rather
“nominal capacity’ (i.e. “potencia nominal’): “La potencia nominal sera la especificada en la placa de
caracteristicas del grupo motor o alternador, seguin aplique [...J" [Emphasis added]

ii. | The capacity measured at the node connecting the CSP plant to the grid is the
measure remunerated under the Original Regulatory Framework;419

iv. According to the reports issued by the Electric Network of Spain (Red Eléctrica de
Espafia), the capacity measured at the node connecting each of the two plants to
the grid is 49.9 MW for the Moron plant‘?° and 50 MW for the Olivenza 1 plant‘?"

325. Claimants also point out that the Spanish authorities themselves registered the CSP
plants as having an installed capacity equal or less to 50 MW. They invoke the contracts
entered into between each plant and the Spanish electricity network operator, Endesa
Distribucion Eléctrica S.L. Unipersonal, which identifies the capacity of the Morén and
Olivenza 1 plants as 49.9 MW4 and 50 MW respectively.42°

326. Finally, Claimants assert that Respondent should be estopped from arguing that the
CSP plants do not conform with the 50 MW installed capacity requirement, since this
position is in direct contradiction with Respondent's previous actions and
representations, including the confirmation of conformity by the CNMC inspectors.*24

327. Respondent — Respondent argues that the calculation of “installed capacity’ must take
into account the plants’ own consumption of electricity, which is equivalent roughly to
10% of electricity production (49.9 MW and 50 MW respectively) with the result that their
installed capacity is actually 55 MW.425

328. Respondent contends that the documents invoked by Claimants, i.e. the CNMC
inspection reports, the contracts with the Spanish electricity network operator, Endesa
Distribucion Eléctrica S.L., and the reports issued by Red Eléctrica de Esapaiia reflect
administrative actions, not technical inspections or observations.*° Respondent
submits those documents are therefore irrelevant to the determination of the plants’
installed capacity.4?”

19 See in particular Article 20.1 of RD 661/2007 (C-0049t): “The facilities under the special regime may pass
into the system the totality of the net electricity energy produced, being understood as the gross electrical
energy by the plant less own use by the system for the ion of electrical energy.” [Emphasis

For his part, Respondent's expert opines that the installed capacity of the plants is over
52.2 MWe. To arrive at this conclusion, Mr. Casanova appears to have worked
backwards from the “net output delivered to the grid’ by the two (2) plants at issue, which
he conceded is “usually around 49.8 MWe.”49

In his report, Mr. Casanova opines that the gross output of the Plants is 55 MWe and
cites in support of his opinion the following documents:

- The turnkey contract between the plants and the service provider tasked with the
operation and management of the plants, pursuant to which the service provider
guaranteed a nominal power of 55 MWe;*2°

- The technical evaluation of the plants carried out by Garrigues Medio Ambiente,
which states as follows:

“As regards the nominal power of the plant, it is important to stress that it is 55
MW, and does not exceed 50 MW of power at the connection point. It should be
indicated that the nominal power of 55 MW does not comply with the limitation of
50 MW of the special regime according to Royal Decree 66/2007. In this regard,
we refer to the Legal Adviser of the project. ”**'

[Emphasis added]

Mr. Casanova further offers what can only be described as a legal opinion — without (it
seems to the Tribunal) explanation or justification — that, “according to the Spanish
legislation, in CSP plants the Installed Capacity is the nominal power of the electrical
generator, which should be only slightly lower that (sic) the nominal power of the steam
turbine due to mechanical losses and to internal losses of the generator{.]” on the basis
of which he states that “it can be concluded that actual installed or nominal power or
capacity of both Olivenza 1 and Morén CSP plants are certainly higher than 50 and 49.9
MW respectively.”452

is also the only published award that considers the changes to the regulatory framework
governing remuneration to Spain’s renewable energy producers in the CSP sector.

Both parties in Eiser made submissions substantially similar on this matter to those of
the Parties in the present case. The tribunal in Eiser dismissed the claimant's estoppel
argument. On the merits of the issue, the tribunal chose to interpret the term “installed
capacity’ for the purpose of admissibility to the Special Regime under article 27(1) of the
EPA of 1997 based on the interpretation of the term “nominal capacity."**4 This latter
term is defined at Article 3(1) of RD 661/2007 as the “... power [...] specified on the
specifications plate of the generator or alternator."4°5

The uncontroverted evidence adduced in that case was to the effect that the power
inscribed on the nameplate of the generators at issue was equal to or less than 50
MW.** The tribunal also noted that the CNMC inspected the plants and found that they
complied with the conditions for remuneration under the Special Regime.*®” For these
reasons, the tribunal in Eiser dismissed respondent's preliminary defense and
concluded that the plants were prima facie admissible for remuneration under the
Special Regime.*%°

iii. Discussion

The technical experts seem largely in agreement with respect to the technical concepts
at issue. In particular, both experts seem to agree on the definition of “gross installed
capacity,” which is measured at the terminals of the generator inside the plant, and of
“installed capacity,” which is measured at the nodes where the plant connects to the
electricity grid.“°° Both experts also seem to agree that the net installed capacity is
generally lower than the gross installed capacity as a result of power used by the
equipment inside the plant, which draws its electricity directly from the turbine.

The available evidence suggests that the net output — i.e. the power as measured at the
point of connection of the Morén and Olivenza plants to the grid - was 50 MWe or less.
The reports by the Red Eléctrica de Esparia confirms as much.*“° In cross-examination,
Respondent's expert attempted to cast doubt on whether those measures were actually
taken before or after the commissioning of the plants. But he did not deny that the figure
listed in those reports “measures the electricity going into the grid. So (...) what is useful
for actually the bill, is actually the electricity that goes into the network, not the actual
power.™“' In his own report, Mr. Casanova appears to admit that the net output of the

plants (i.e. “the electricity that goes into the network’) is lower than 50 MW, stating it is
“generally around 49.8 MWe."*42

On the evidence, the Tribunal cannot but accept that the net output of the plants is less
than 50 MW. Claimants do not contest that the gross output (measured at the terminals
of the generator) is slightly higher than 50 MW.

The question to be decided is whether the term “installed capacity’ at Article 27(1) of the
EPA of 1997 is properly interpreted as the net output or the gross output of the plants.

As did the tribunal in Eiser, the Tribunal relies on the capacity listed on the nameplate
of the respective generators and on the CNMC’s own confirmation that the plants’
installed capacity is equal to or under 50 MW.*48

Even if the Tribunal were to engage in a textual and purposive interpretation of the term
“installed capacity’ at Article 27(1) of the EPA 1997“, the result would be the same,
considering, among others, the following factors:

- The plants are remunerated for their net output. Article 20 of RD 661/2007 is
unequivocal in that regard;445

- For the operator of the grid, the “net output’ is the most relevant and important
variable, far more so than the “gross output’ measured at the terminals of the
generator. In this regard, both experts were at unison. Mr. Casanova,
Respondent's expert testified as follows:

“A. (Professor Casanova) Yes, the grid operator has to know what is the power
being delivered to the grid by each plant. In the case of thermosolar plant, he
would have to know whether, if a turbo-generator generates 50, and the final
transformer of connection with the grid may be delivering 45/46, depending on the
case, obviously he would have to know what that value is, because he has to
organise his grid and he would have to know how far he can go tapping into the
energy delivered from that particular plant.

So the answer: yes. he has to know what is the energy per unit of time that is being
delivered to the grid: 45 or 46, depending on the case.“

The Tribunal accords little weight to the excerpts of the Garrigues report and of the
turnkey contracts invoked by Respondent for the following reasons:

- The fact that the service provider guarantees a “nominal power’ of 55 MW does
not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the actual installed capacity is 55 MW,

especially if “installed capacity’ is to be interpreted as the net output of the plant
measured at the nodes of connection to the grid. In this regard, both experts were
in agreement that the power that the plant is able to generate must — in all cases
— be higher than the measurement at the connection nod to satisfy the plant's
“ancillary consumption.” On this matter, Mr. Casanova testified as follows:

“THE PRESIDENT: It the net power of a CSP plant at the interconnection point of the grid
is 50 megawatts, does it follow necessarily that the generator is able to generate between
10% and 15% more power than the megawatts of power delivered to the grid?

 

 

()
A. (Professor C : Yes. | would say that it would have to generate more than 50 in
order to that ancillary jon in the plant, yes."‘47

 

[Emphasis added]

342. The excerpt of the Garrigues report*“® cited by Respondent seems to be based on an
equivocation of the terms “installed capacity,” “gross outpuf’ and “nominal capacity.” It
seems at best a speculation of a possible legal interpretation of the term “installed
capacity’ which — it is suggested — is not binding upon the Tribunal.

B. THE ALLEGED BREACH OF SPAIN’S FET OBLIGATION
343. Claimants’ case with respect to Spain’s alleged breach of the FET obligation is threefold:

- Violation of expectation of stability — First, Claimants fault Respondent for
having violated their legitimate expectations that the Original Regulatory
Framework would remain stable (i.e. immutable) throughout the lifespan of the
plants or, at the very least, that the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants would not be
affected by subsequent regulatory changes (i.e. that the Original Regulatory
Framework would be “grandfathered’).*4°

- Arbitrariness (i.e. expectation of consistency) — Second - and in the
alternative to the above argument, it seems — Claimants submit that the Measure
at Issue violate Spain’s FET obligations because they constitute an arbitrary “mid-

Promovida por Iberedlica Solar en Olivenza (Badajoz) (R-0340), on p. 51.

449 This ground of liability overlaps with the one founded on the “umbrella obligation,” but remains distinct from
it in as much as the formation of a bilateral agreement or unilateral undertaking creating an obligational bond
specifically as between the host state and the investor need not be proven to show breach of the FET. See
the comparative analysis between the “umbrella obligation” and the FET standard in the case /solux (RL-
0107t), at paras. 767 to 772. The issue as framed in the context of the FET standard is not whether a distinct
legal obligation was created but rather whether a legitimate expectation has arisen from Respondent's
enactments, actions and representations leading Claimants to believe that future regulatory changes would

stream switch” or “paradigm shift’ that abrogated the essential elements of the
Original Regulatory Framework, upon which Claimants relied to invest.

- Lack of transparency — Third, Claimants submit that Spain violated its FET
obligations by enacting the Measures at Issue without due process, without
considering nor even disclosing in timely fashion, key expert reports it had
commissioned (and purportedly disregarded) to establish the new remuneration
values.

The issues arising in the context of Claimants’ case with respect to the FET obligation
are therefore the following:

i. What is the legal standard applicable in assessing a host state’s FET obligation?
In particular, is that standard limited strictly to an obligation of non-discrimination
or to accord the minimum standards of treatment under international law (as
Respondent seems to argue)*° and, if not, what role does the investors’ due
diligence and the (un)foreseeability of the disputed measures bear in the analysis?

ii. Did Claimants have a legitimate expectation that the Original Regulatory
Framework would remain unchanged — at least in its application to the Morén and
Olivenza 1 plants and, if so, was this expectation frustrated by the enactment of
the Measures at Issue?

iii. Did Claimants have a legitimate expectation that the Original Regulatory
Framework would not be modified in a fundamental or radical way and, if so, was
that expectation frustrated by the enactment of the Measures at Issue?

iv. Did Respondent enact the Original Regulatory Framework without due process or
without the requisite transparency?

Each of these issues is addressed in turn below, in the light of: a) the Parties’ positions;
and b) the authorities, including relevant recent arbitral awards.

i. The standards governing the assessment of the FET
a) The Parties’ Positions

Claimants — Claimants argue that the FET standard is the cornerstone of investor
protection, and that it imposes upon a host state a broad obligation, among other things,
to protect investors’ legitimate expectations. The assessment of these expectations is
made against the background of the information available to the investors at the time of
the investment, including the host state’s legislation and regulations in effect at the time,
as well as its public representations and actions. As regards the legal standards
applicable to assess Spain’s FET obligation, Claimants submit as follows:

- Scope of FET obligation: Claimants argue that the scope of the FET obligation
is not restricted to mere non-discrimination or to the international minimum

standard requirements, and extends to the protection of investors’ legitimate
expectations, the duty of good faith and of proportionality.*°' Claimants assert that
restricting the FET to mere non-discrimination would render redundant and
meaningless the specific non-discrimination prohibitions at Article 10(1), 10(3) and
10(7) of the ECT.*°? Claimants also argue that the conflation of the FET standard
with the international minimum standards of treatment (“MST”) runs afoul of both
the ordinary meaning and the object and purpose of Article 10(1) of the ECT.*°
They submit that the different words used to articulate the FET obligation indicate
that a different meaning attaches to them. Claimants also submit that limiting the
FET standard to MST would undermine the object and purpose of the ECT since
“[t]he promotion of investment and economic cooperation between ECT
Contracting Parties supposes positive obligations that go beyond MST."#54

- Legitimate expectation of stability: Claimants do not deny that the FET
obligation does not, in se, curtail the host state’s power to tailor its laws and
regulations to changing circumstances, including national or global economic or
political circumstances.*®® They argue, however, that under Article 10(1) ECT, the
host state is liable to foreign investors where the exercise of its legislative and
regulatory powers frustrates the investors’ legitimate expectations.*°° According
to Claimants, these expectations may comprise (based on the facts and
circumstances of the case) an expectation that a given regulatory or legislative
framework will remain stable (i.e. “frozen”) in time. Claimants argue that a
legitimate expectation of legal or regulatory stability can arise from the very
structure of the legislative framework at the time of the investment;*®” from
enticements to invest targeting investors in a specific technology;*®* or even from
“implicit state undertakings or assurances (which) need not be ‘specific’."4°° A
fortiori, Claimants say, a legitimate expectation of stability arises where a specific
commitment to that effect is given by the host state. In support of this last point,
Claimants invoke — among others — the following cases:

° Charanne B.V. and Construction Investments S.A.R.L v. Kingdom of
Spain,*©° where the tribunal dismissed a claim under Article 10(1) ECT
brought against Spain by foreign investors in the country’s photovoltaic
solar energy sector, based on a finding that the regulatory framework
applicable to the photovoltaic plants at issue did not contain a commitment
of stability. The regulatory framework in that case included RD 661/2007 but
not RD 1614/2010; nor (as explained above) did the case involve the
equivalent of the letters of waiver and December Resolutions specific to
Spain’s thermosolar industy. The tribunal in Charanne reasoned:
“According to the Arbitration Tribunal, in_the absence _of a_specific
commitment an investor cannot have the legitimate expectation that the
regulation in place is going to remain unchanged.™*' [Emphasis added]

State has the right to enact, modify or cancel a law at its own discretion.
Save for the existence of an agreement, in the form of a stabilisation clause

to the regulatory framework existing at the time an investor made its
investment.”4®3 [Emphasis added]

abrogation of certain tariffs were held to run afoul of specific commitments

Legitimate expectation of consistency: Even in the absence of a legitimate
expectation of stability, Claimants say that the basic FET standard comprises an
obligation that the state will not “arbitrarily’ modify the regulatory framework in
reliance upon which the investors invested. Claimants seem to derive two distinct
expectations from this obligation. First, they argue that investors legitimately
expect a host state not to enact regulatory changes affecting adversely the
investments at issue and which are not proportional with the requirements of
public policy or the public interest.4°° Second, Claimants also argue that, in all
circumstances, the FET obligation creates an expectation of consistency,

proscribing the adoption measures that fundamentally or radically change the
prevailing legislative or regulatory framework.4®

- Due diligence: Claimants appear to recognize that their due diligence prior to
their investment is a relevant factor in the analysis.4°” However, they submit that
this is a matter to be assessed in the light of the political and economic conditions
prevailing in the host state at the time of the investment.*® In any event, Claimants
argue that the scope of due diligence verifications to be undertaken by
international investors is limited to a familiarization with the relevant legal
framework and whether the proposed investment complies with local laws, without
a requirement to perform an exhaustive legal investigation.4°

Due process and transparency: Claimants argue that the FET standard imposes an
obligation on the host state to be forthcoming with information about intended changes
in policy that may adversely affect foreign investments, so that investors may plan and
manage their investments accordingly.4”°

347. Respondent — Respondent first argues that the FET obligation is limited to a non-
discrimination prohibition or, at best, is equal in content to the MST under international
law. This submission seems based on a formalistic interpretation of the text Article
10(1).471 Respondent argues that a host state is under an obligation to grant foreign
investors the conditions listed in the first and second sentences of that Article (including
the FET treatment) only during the ‘investment-making process;” that is — during the
period immediately preceding the investment.‘”? Respondent argues that once the
investment is made, the host state’s obligations are, as mentioned, limited principally to
non-discrimination and to the MST. Without stating so explicitly, Respondent appears to
imply that an investor bringing a cause of action under Article 10(1) ECT is bound to
prove that it was subject to a worse treatment than that accorded to other investors
(foreign or domestic) with investments on the territory of the host state.*”

348. As part of what the Tribunal understands to be a subsidiary argument, Respondent
engages with the merits of Claimants’ submissions on the FET. It does not, however,
appear to take serious issue with the purely legal underpinnings of Claimants’
submissions, except as regards the following aspects:

to curtail a host state’s sovereign power to modify its laws and regulations as required

by changing economic or political circumstances.‘ It argues: “The stability to which
the ECT refers admits the adoption of reasonable and proportionate macroeconomic
control measures|...J"475 Respondent argues that investors can have an expectation
that the regulatory framework would remain unchanged only where the host state
entered into a specific stabilization commitment promising that it would not enact any
changes to that framework.476

- Due diligence: Respondent submits that investors’ alleged legitimate expectations
are to be assessed based on an objective standard — that is, according to what the
investor knew or ought to have known of the laws and regulations of the host state at
the time of the investment.477 In this context, /acunae in an investor's due diligence
vitiate the legitimacy of an investor's expectations regarding the legislative or
regulatory framework at issue.‘7® According to Respondent, an adequate due
diligence verification must entail a thorough analysis of the legal framework applicable
to the target sector, including the jurisprudence of the host state’s highest courts.479

Respondent also submits that an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that
the host state would not enact changes which were foreseeable at the time of the
investment.4°°

349. It is noted that, other than the foregoing, Respondent does not appear to take issue with
the legal standards articulated by Claimants regarding investors’ expectation of
consistency (i.e. that the legislative or regulatory framework applicable to their
investments would suffer no fundamental or radical shifts), transparency and due
process. On these matters — and indeed on all other standards and norms related to its
FET obligation — Respondent contends that Claimants failed to prove its case on the
facts, as discussed in more detail below, at section VI.B. ii and

   

b) Relevant arbitral authorities

non-discrimination obligation or to the MST standard in international law, was not

which the tribunal is aware involving changes to Spain's renewable energy remuneration

regime. Rather, all of the awards in those cases have framed the analysis of the FET
standard according to the investors’ legitimate expectations (if any).*®"

351. The legitimate expectation of stability — The requisite legal conditions for the
formation of a legitimate expectation of stability are discussed in detail in Charanne,‘®2
an ECT award involving Spain and rendered against the backdrop of the regulatory
changes to the remuneration of renewable energy producers in which the issue of a
legitimate expectation of stability (i.e. immutability) is discussed in detail.

352. In Charanne, the tribunal articulated the legal test governing the assessment of such a
legitimate expectation as follows: “(...) in the absence of a specific commitment an
investor cannot have the legitimate expectation that the regulation in place is going to
remain unchanged.”*® The tribunal suggested that a “specific commitment’ of stability
(i.e. immutability) must identify with precision the regulation(s) at issue and include an
explicit promise not to alter that particular regulatory regime.*** General statements
enticing investments on the basis of an existing regulatory framework, without more, are
insufficient.4®5

353. In /solux Infrastructure Netherlands B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain, *®° the tribunal assessed
summarily whether Spain had made a commitment of stability to investors within the
context of the “umbrella obligation” set out at Article 10(1) in fine of the ECT, not the
FET standard.‘®”

354. The issue of Spain’s putative commitment of stability was only cursorily discussed in
Eiser Infrastructure Ltd. v. Kingdom of Spain,*®* where the tribunal limited its remarks to
the following statement of principle: “Absent explicit undertakings directly extended to
investors and guaranteeing that States will not change their laws _or regulations,
investment treaties do not eliminate States’ right to modify their regulatory regimes to
meet evolving circumstances and public needs.”#8° [Emphasis added]

355. In Novenergia Il - Energy & Environment (SCA) v. Kingdom of Spain,*®° the tribunal did
not assess the existence of an expectation of stability at all (at least not in the sense
discussed here). The tribunal rather assessed the existence of a legitimate expectation

of consistency (i.e. that any subsequent legislative or regulatory changes would not
fundamentally alter the existing framework).49"

356. The legitimate expectation of consistency — Three of the four awards rendered by
ECT tribunals in cases involving the solar energy industry in Spain explicitly recognized
investors’ legitimate expectation that the host state would not fundamentally or
“radically? change the key aspects of the prevailing legislative and regulatory
framework. The fourth award, /solux,4* dismissed the investors’ legitimate expectations
claim on the facts, finding that the investors in that case were in a position to know that
such fundamental changes were afoot before they invested.

357. In Charanne, the tribunal ruled that, even in the absence of a specific commitment of
stability, “an investor has the legitimate expectation that, when the State modifies the
regulation under which the investor made the investment, it will not do so unreasonably,
contrary to the public interest, or in a disproportionate matter.”*°4 The tribunal further
specified that “the proportionality requirement is fulfilled as long as the modifications (...)
do not suddenly and unexpectedly eliminate the essential features of the regulatory
framework in place.”*® [Emphasis added]

358. In Eiser, the tribunal framed the legitimate expectation that the prevailing regulatory
regime would not be fundamentally altered as follows: “Taking account of the context
and of the ECT’s object and purpose, the Tribunal concludes that Article 10(1)’s
obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment necessarily embraces an obligation to
provide fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of the legal regime relied
upon by investors in making long-term investments. This does not mean that regulatory
regimes cannot evolve. Surely they can. (...) However, the Article 10(1) obligation to
accord fair and equitable treatment means that regulatory regimes cannot be radically
altered as applied to existing investments in ways that deprive investors who invested
in reliance on those regimes of their investment’s value.”4°> [Emphasis added]

359. In Novenergia, the tribunal also recognized the existence of a legitimate expectation that
the regulatory framework at issue would not be “radically” altered, even in the absence
of specific commitments to that effect.49”

491 Novenergia (CL-0245), at para. 656: ‘The Tribunal will, thus, have to assess whether the Claimant's

expectations on the basis of RD 661/2007 and preceding legislation and conduct by the Respondent were

Finally, in /solux, the tribunal suggested (without explicitly stating) that a legitimate
expectation that the regulatory regime would not be fundamentally altered could
potentially arise, but that such an expectation did not in fact arise in the circumstances
of that case given the investors’ actual knowledge that Spain was about to enact
fundamental changes to the regulatory framework applicable to photovoltaic
installations.4%

Due Diligence — The awards rendered recently by ECT tribunals in the context of
Spain's reform of the remuneration regime applicable to renewable energy producers
show that tribunals generally: i) hold investors to a strict due diligence standard,
requiring a thorough review of the legislative framework, including the decisions of the
Spanish Supreme Court;4®° and ii) sanction an inexistent or faulty due diligence by
means of a finding that the alleged expectation is not legitimate®° unless it is shown
that even an adequate due diligence verification would not have revealed warning signs
of impending regulatory changes.5"'

 

The sanction for a faulty due diligence in these cases seems to be informed by an
assessment of the foreseeability of the measures at issue. Investors are effectively
imputed with constructive knowledge of reasonably foreseeable regulatory changes. In
other words, the central question for assessing the effects, if any, of a faulty due
diligence seems to be: could a reasonably prudent investor with the benefit of an
adequate due diligence verification have foreseen the measures at issue?5?

A positive answer generally precludes a finding of a legitimate expectation that the
impugned measures would not be adopted.°° A negative answer should allow the
analysis to proceed to the next step, at which the tribunal assesses whether or not the
measures at issue altered the prevailing regulatory framework to such an extent as to
frustrate the investor's legitimate expectations.

 

The p 1 of tr pi y and due pi — The legitimate
expectation of transparency and due process is not treated as a discreet issue in any of
the recent ECT awards involving changes to Spain's regulatory framework applicable to
renewable energy producers. In fact, after considering and ruling on the question of the
claimants’ legitimate expectations of stability and consistency, tribunals have generally

498 /solux (RL-0107), at paras. 774, 775, 777 and 804.

499 This is particularly so given the investors’ high degree of sophistication and the highly regulated nature of
the target sector. See among others Charanne (RL-0082), at para. 507: “To the Tribunal’s understanding, at
the time of making the investment in 2009 the Claimants could have carried out an analysis of their
investment's legal framework in Spanish law and understood that the regulations enacted in 2007 and 2008
could be modified. At least that is the degree of diligence that could be expected from a foreign investor in a
heavily regulated sector like the energy industry. In such a sector, thorough prior analysis of the legal
framework applicable thereto is essential to making an investment.” [Emphasis added].

refused to consider in detail further grounds of liability advanced by claimants that would
not have altered the award of damages.5*

c) Discussion

The scope of the FET obligation — The Tribunal does not accept Respondent's
submission that the scope of the FET obligation is limited to non-discrimination. The
clear language of Article 10(1) ECT belies such an interpretation. So too does what
might fairly be called a jurisprudence constante that is based on the understanding
shared by the Tribunal to the effect that the FET obligation is a distinct standard linked
(among others) to the legitimate expectations of investors as assessed on the facts of
each case.

The legitimate expectation of stability — The Tribunal does, however, accept and
agree with Respondent's position to the effect that a legitimate expectation of stability
(i.e. immutability) can only arise in the presence of a specific commitment tendered
directly to the investor or industry sector at issue. This finding is in keeping with the
recent decisions in ECT cases concerning the changes enacted by Spain to the
remuneration of renewable energy producers, °° as well as with other arbitral decisions
that assessed the issue of a legitimate expectation of stability, be it in application of
Article 10(1) of the ECT or of similar investor protection clauses contained in other
treaties.5° This finding is also in keeping with the principle of state sovereignty —
enshrined in the ECT and considered by tribunals as part of the balancing exercise
carried out when assessing an investor's bilateral relation with the state.°°” The Tribunal
is mindful of the significant limitation that a “stability” obligation would impose on the host
state’s sovereign legislative powers. The Tribunal cannot give effect to such a significant
limitation of state sovereignty in the absence of a specific expression of consent by the
host state.

Given the foregoing and the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal must determine whether the
Respondent tendered a specific commitment directly to the investors or to the CSP
sector as a whole that the regulatory framework applicable to the remuneration of CSP
producers would not be affected by future regulatory changes. In particular, the Tribunal
must determine whether such a specific commitment was tendered with respect to each
of the specific components of the Original Framework that the Claimants seek to
vindicate in this arbitration.°°® The Tribunal will also determine whether the Claimants’

expectation of stability was legitimate in light of the investors’ knowledge (actual and
constructive) at the time of the investment and in light of the due diligence carried out.

The legitimate expectation of consistency — Given the authorities cited by the Parties
and discussed above, and the apparent absence of a contestation on the purely legal
principles governing Claimants’ alleged expectation of consistency, the Tribunal is of the
view that an expectation of consistency, i.e., that the regulatory framework will not be
radically or fundamentally changed may arise even in the absence of such a specific
commitment, depending on the facts.5°° A valid public policy purpose does not
automatically foreclose a finding of breach of the FET standard since — in the balancing
exercise that tribunals are called upon to carry out — the consideration of a legitimate
legislative objective may be outweighed by the radical nature of the changes to the
legislative framework at issue.5'° Although a host state enjoys the sovereignty to modify
its laws and regulations, its liability towards investors may be engaged (again,
depending on the facts) if, in doing so, it fundamentally or radically alters a regulatory
framework upon which the investors legitimately relied to invest.5"'

The Tribunal will therefore determine whether the Claimants had a legitimate
expectation that Respondent would not fundamentally or radically alter the main
elements of the Original Regulatory Framework in light of the circumstances prevailing
in June 2011, including the Claimants’ due diligence and the (un)foreseeability of the
type of regulatory change at issue. The Tribunal will then assess whether the Measures
at Issue altered fundamentally or radically the essential elements of the Original
Regulatory Framework.

Due Diligence — The Tribunal notes that the Parties seem to agree that that the plants
in which Claimants invested derive the overwhelming majority of their revenue from state
subsidies.*"? It is equally uncontested that the regime of state subsidies (i.e. the “Special
Regime” under the EPA of 1997 or the “specific remuneration” under the EPA of 2013)
is heavily regulated. In these circumstances the Tribunal is inclined to follow the
approach taken by the tribunal in Charanne and hold Claimants to a stricter due diligence
standard in keeping with both the nature of the sector in which they invested and with
their own expectations as regards the main source of profit (i.e. state subsidies).

To rule on this question the Tribunal will assess whether the Claimants — or their legal
advisers — carried out an adequate review of the regulatory framework applicable to the
renewable energy sector in Spain (and in particular to CSP producers), including the
case law of the Supreme Court of Spain. The Tribunal will also consider whether the
Measures at Issue were foreseeable to a reasonably prudent investor with the benefit of
an adequate due diligence.

The legitimate expectation of transparency and due process — The legal standards
governing this issue do not appear to be disputed. Article 10(1) ECT provides as follows:
“Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty,
encourage and create (...) transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting
Parties to make Investments in its Area.”*'° [Emphasis added] The Tribunal understands
that the Parties do not disagree on the purely legal standards underpinning
Respondent's obligation of transparency and due process, although they are at odds as
regards the application of these principles to the facts of the case. As such, the Tribunal
is of the view that the issues to be determined to assess the alleged breach of
transparency and due process are whether Respondent sufficiently disclosed the
relevant information about the impending modification of Original Regulatory Framework
to allow: i) the various actors of the CSP sector to participate in consultation process
preceding the enactment of the Measures at Issue; and ii) to allow the Morén and
Olivenza 1 plants — and by corollary — the Claimants to plan and organize their
operations accordingly.5'4

ii. The alleged violation of Claimants’ expectation of stability of the
Original Regulatory Framework

a) The Parties’ Positions

Claimants — In a nutshell, Claimants submit that the enactment of RD 661/2007, the
discussions between Protermosolar and the government in the summer of 2010, the
Purported Agreement, the enactment of RD 1614/2010 and the exchange of letters of
waiver and December Resolutions constituted a specific commitment that the Original
Regulatory Framework would not be modified or at least that future modifications would
not affect the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants.5'5

Applying the legal position discussed above to the facts of this case, Claimants argue
that the following enactments, actions and/or representations by the Kingdom of Spain
constituted such a “specific commitment’ giving rise to a legitimate expectation that
regulatory changes subsequent to RD 1614/2010 would not affect the Olivenza 1 and
Moré6n plants:

- RD 661/2007 — The enactment of RD 661/2007 and the so-called “seven rights’ it
granted to CSP producers (see the detail in this regard above, at para. 26 and
following of the present Award);51°

- The May 2007 Press Release — The publication of a press release in May 2007,
shortly after the adoption of RD 661/2007 which mentioned that “any revisions of
tariffs to be carried out in the future shall not affect the facilities already in

518 Article 10(1) of the ECT.

operation. This guarantee provides legal certainty for the producer, providing
stability for the sector and promoting its development.’*'’ [Emphasis added]

- The Pre-Allocation Register — The enactment of RD-L 6/2009,5"8 the creation of
the remuneration Pre-allocation Register and the registration of the Morén and
Olivenza 1 plants on the Pre-allocation Register and the RAIPRE. Claimants
argue that this enactment guaranteed the application of the Special Regime to the
plants who registered on the pre-allocation register before the stipulated date (a
requirement that the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants fulfilled);5'°

- The November 2009 Resolution and Related Press Release — Claimants argue
that the resolution issued by the Council of Ministers on 13 November 2009 setting
the dates of entry into operation of CSP plants like Morén and Olivenza 1
“generated a further guarantee from the Respondent to the Claimants regarding
the future stability of the regulatory framework and the maintenance of a friendly
environment for investments in thermosolar energy.”>*°

- The Purported Agreement — Claimants argue that the formation of the Purported
Agreement is evidenced by the discussions that took place in the early summer of
2010, by the text of the Purported Agreement attached to the email issued by the
MINETUR and by the subsequent references to the “agreemenf’ in various
communications by both protagonists (ie. Protermosolar and MINETUR).°*' They
qualify the Purported Agreement as a “regulatory pact’ formed on the basis of a
quid pro quo, whereby the CSP sector accepted certain modifications to the
existing regulatory framework (i.e. a delayed entry in operation and a reduction in
the hours of operation) in exchange of a promise that any subsequent changes
would not affect the CSP sector.‘

Claimants also argue that Respondent failed to comply with documentary
production requests because it denied the existence of certain documents in
connection with the negotiation and internal discussions regarding the Agreement,
when in fact, the examination of Respondent's representative at the Hearing on
the Merits showed that he was not instructed to search in his files for those
documents.**5 On this basis, Claimants are requesting the Tribunal to issue a
negative inference.5** Claimants are asking the Tribunal to “infer that all
documents responsive to [the documentary production requests at issue] would
prove that the Respondent committed itself to keep Regulatory Framework No. 1

applicable for Morén and Olivenza 1 against any subsequent regulatory
change.’°°5

- RD 1614/2010 and Related Press Release — Claimants argue that Respondent
enacted RD 1614/2010 to crystallize the Purported Agreement into law. They say
that of the seven (7) points contained in the Purported Agreement, four (4) were
“converted into law’ by RD 1614/2010.°6 In particular, Claimants submit that RD
1614/2010 contains the following “specific commitments’ of stability:

. A commitment not to alter the number of operating hours for which the
Special Regime would be applicable to the plants registered on the RAIPRE
or on the Pre-Allocation Register;5*”

. A commitment extending the so-called “grand-fathering clause” of the
regulated tariff and pool plus premium options contained at Article 44(3) of
RD 661/2007 to the plants registered on the Pre-Allocation Register.5°°

Claimants also argue that a press release dated 3 December 2010,5°
foreshadowing the adoption of RD 1614/2010, confirmed that the MINETUR
intended to guarantee the stability of the Original Regulatory Framework.5°°

- December Resolutions — Claimants argue that the exchange of letters of waiver
and the December Resolutions constituted a declaratory contract (contrato de
fijacion juridica), whereby the plants agreed to delay their entry in operation (thus
“waiving” their right to start producing electricity and receiving remuneration by a
certain prescribed date) and, in exchange, the MINETUR guaranteed the stability
of the Original Regulatory Framework for the plants’ operational lifespan.5*'
Claimants argue that the declaratory contracts were formed when the MINETUR
issued the December Resolutions, thus tendering Respondent's acceptance to
the plants’ offers (i.e. the letters of waiver). Claimants argue that the declaratory
contracts were formed to convert the Purported Agreement into law, also on a
quid pro quo basis, whereby the plants waived their right to entry into operation
by a prescribed date in exchange of a binding promise of stability.5°

In the alternative, Claimants seem to argue that, whether or not declaratory
contracts (contratos de fijacidn juridica) were validly formed under Spanish law,
the exchange of waiver letters and December Resolutions is at the very least
evidence of “specific commitments” by Respondent giving rise to a legitimate
expectation of stability.

375. Claimants argue that they relied on all of the above legislative enactments and
understood that they guaranteed the stability of the application of the Original Regulatory
Framework to the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants.5°° Claimants argue that this legitimate
expectation does not run afoul of the principle of state sovereignty, nor of Spain’s
sovereign power to adjust the regulatory framework at large.®** But they invoke the
Purported Agreement, RD 1614/2010 and the exchange of waiver letters and the
December Resolutions to argue that Respondent deliberately decided to grant special
treatment to the CSP sector and to guarantee those CSP producers registered on the
Pre-allocation Registry that future regulatory changes would not affect them.5°5

376. Claimants argue that their due diligence verification was adequate since it had identified
the key aspects of the Original Regulatory Framework, including the elements which,
according to Claimants, guaranteed the stability of that framework (principally the
Purported Agreement and RD 1614/2010).5°° Claimants also submit that the findings of
their due diligence verification took account of Respondent's effort to curb the tariff deficit
but that — in the circumstances — nothing could lead them to foresee that Respondent
would alter the regulatory framework applicable to the CSP sector.

377. As regards the decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain, Claimants submit, as a general
principle, that domestic law should not be used to assess whether a state has breached
its international treaty obligations.*°” Even if the Tribunal decides to consider those
decisions, Claimants argue that they should have little bearing upon the assessment of
the legitimate expectations at issue. Claimants argue that these decisions were not
rendered specifically on the CSP sector. They submit that many of these decisions were
rendered after June 2011 (the date of the investment) and that those rendered before
June 201158 were issued prior to the “specific commitments” tendered by Spain to the
CSP sector under the Purported Agreement, RD 1614/2010 and the exchange of waiver
letters and the December Resolutions.®*° In any event, Claimants say that the evidence

witnesses, shows that their expectations were legitimate and that, moreover, Claimants
have taken the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court into consideration.5“°

378. Lastly, as regards EU legislation regulating so-called “state-aid’ measures, Claimants
acknowledge that EU documents show a concern by the EU toward Spain’s tariff deficit
and a request to address it in a “comprehensive way.”>*' However, Claimants argue that
none of the EU measures cited by Spain mandated, heralded or otherwise rendered
foreseeable the enactment of the Measures at Issue. 542

379. For all of these reasons, Claimants submit that their expectation of stability was
legitimate and that the adoption of the Measures at Issue violated of Respondent's FET
obligation.

380. Respondent — Respondent argues that the CSP sector is “not an is/and” but rather an
integral part of the SES and subject to the same rules as other renewable energy
producers. Respondent says that the SES is governed by a system of laws and
regulations which are in constant flux to enable the state to respond to the changing
circumstances of domestic and international markets.“

381. Respondent argues that the legislative framework and the actions and representation of
the Kingdom of Spain evince no stabilization clause or any specific commitment of
stability. Any purported expectation of stability on the part of Claimants was therefore
not legitimate. In Respondent's view, that is especially so given that Claimants’ due
diligence — deficient though it was — actually revealed that changes to the Original
Regulatory Framework were both legal and foreseeable.

382. Regarding the absence of a “stabilization clause’ or of a specific commitment of stability,
Respondent faults Claimant for taking an opportunistically narrow view of the Original
Regulatory Framework, one that is conveniently restricted to RD 661/2007 and RD
1614/2010.545 Respondent points out that these royal decrees are legally subordinated
to the principle of “reasonable return” for renewable energy producers set out in the EPA
1997, to the overarching principle of state sovereignty and to the public policy objective
of sustainability of the SES.54°

383. Against this backdrop, Respondent counters each of the elements invoked by
Claimants:

- RD 661/2007: According to Respondent, RD 661/2007 contains no specific
commitment of stability. In particular, Respondent argues that Article 44(3) of RD
661/2007 does not pre-empt any revisions to the premium and regulated tariff.
The revisions that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 was meant to pre-empt were only
those “referred to in this section."*4’7 Respondent says this means that the
premium and regulated tariff set out at RD 661/2007 were to be shielded only from
the revisions announced for 2010 and those to be carried out every four years
thereafter.°° In this regard, the text of Article 44(3) invoked by Respondent
provides as follows:

“8. During 2010, (...) there will be a revision of the tariffs, p iums, and
lower and upper limits defined by this Royal Decree, considering the costs associated with
each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the Special Regime in covering
the demand and its impact upon the technical and economic management of the system,
always guaranteeing reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the

capital markets. Thereafter, every four years. a new revision shall_be performed,
maintaining the same criteria as previous.’°*°

[Emphasis added]

- The May 2007 Press Release: Respondent attempts to cast serious doubt on
whether Claimants truly relied on this press release, given that it had been issued
more than four (4) years prior to the investment and that the evidence seems to
show that one of Claimants’ representatives was in fact distrustful of the press. 55°

- RD-L 6/2009: Respondent argues that RD-L 6/2009 was enacted explicitly to curb
the tariff deficit by restricting the criteria for access to remuneration under the
Special Regime.®*' In any event, according to Respondent, registration on the
RAIPRE and on the Pre-allocation Registry was but an administrative requirement
to be able to sell electricity. It did not grant CSP producers any right or formulate
any guarantee of a fixed remuneration stream.552

- The November 2009 Resolution and Related Press Release: Respondent
argues that the objective of the resolution by the Council of Ministers was to
stagger the entry into operation of the plants. As with the RD-L 6/2009,
Respondent argues that the determination registration deadlines for the RAIPRE
or the Pre-allocation Registry did not grant Claimants or CSP producers any right
or formulate any guarantee of a fixed remuneration stream.5°3

- Purported Agreement of 2 July 2010: Respondent says that the discussions
leading to the Purported Agreement were not contractual negotiations but rather
consultations under Article 24(d) of the Law on Government (Ley del Gobierno),°°*
which provides as follows:

"d) The procedure set forth in paragraph c) above shall not be necessary if aforesaid
organizations or associations have participated in the drafting process noted paragraph b)
above through reports or consultations.”°5>

Respondent argues that CSP producers participated in the consultation process
that led to RD 1614/2010 through queries which should not be qualified as
contractual negotiations.5°° Respondent's legal experts opined that Spain does
not have the power to transact upon its regulatory or legislative function.5°” In
testimony at the Hearing on the merits, Professors Vaquer and Santos were
adamant that no contractual or legal obligation could arise, under Spanish law,
from the Purported Agreement.°°°

At the Hearing, Respondent's counsel and witnesses insisted that there exists an
important distinction between the terms “acuerdo” (agreement), “consenso”
(consensus) and “convenio” (convention).*°° Respondent's witnesses further
insisted on the use of the term “consenso” to describe the negotiations that led to
the Purported Agreement and the Purported Agreement itself.5° Respondent's
experts further opined that, in Spanish, the terms “acuerdo” and “consenso” do
not connote a legally binding contract (“contrato’) or convention (“convenio”).5*

- December Resolutions: Respondent argues that the exchange of letters of
waiver and December Resolutions did not validly form a declaratory contract
(contrato de fijacion juridica) nor even an administrative agreement. Respondent's
legal experts opined that the valid formation of such contracts in the present
circumstances is impossible under Spanish law principally because: i) there was
no economic compromise tendered by the plants, since the plants would have
delayed their entry into operation anyhow, given construction delays;5® and ii) in

any event, the state’s regulatory power is not available for a compromise and may
not become the subject of a private contract.5®

384. Respondent further argues that Claimant would have been able to foresee the
enactment of the Measures at Issue had it carried out an adequate due diligence and
heeded the warnings of the due diligence it actually carried out before investing, deficient
though it was.

385. On the one hand, Respondent faults Claimants’ due diligence for having generally failed
to engage in a “thorough prior analysis of the legal framework applicable” to the
remuneration of CSP producers.°* More specifically, Respondent argues Claimants
and their legal advisors failed to review in detail the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court
of Spain. Had they done so, Respondent argues, they would have realized that Spain's
highest court considered similar changes to the remuneration available to electricity
producers a perfectly legal and valid exercise of state sovereignty designed to control
the tariff deficit.5°° By the same token, Respondent argues that Claimants failed to obtain
adequate legal advice on the formation of the Purported Agreement, on the alleged
declaratory contracts and on the effect of the so-called “grand-fathering’ clauses alleged
(i.e. Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 and Article 4 of RD 1614/2010).5°° Had Claimants
sought a legal opinion under Spanish law, Respondent argues they would have realized
that none of the above-mentioned items could have given rise to legal obligations
binding upon Spain or constitute a guarantee of regulatory stability.5°” Similarly,
Respondent argues that Claimants failed to adequately take account of EU legislation
which provides that subsidies to renewable energy producers constitutes “state aid”
revisable periodically by the state.5®

386. On the other hand, Respondent argues that Claimants’ due diligence — deficient though
it may have been — raised sufficient red flags to alert the investors that key the elements
of the Original Regulatory Framework were likely to change. For example, Respondent
argues that — shortly after the adoption of RD 1614/2010 and before Claimants invested
— the Kingdom of Spain enacted RD-L 14/2010, a royal decree which introduced an
access toll for all producers, thus decreasing the remuneration available to CSP

564 See inter alia the Resp. Rejoinder, at paras. 1224 to 1234. See Charanne (RL-0082), at para. 507: “To the
Tribunal’s understanding, at the time of making the investment in 2009 the Claimants could have carried out
an analysis of their investment's legal framework in Spanish law and understood that the regulations enacted
in 2007 and 2008 could be modified. At least that is the degree of diligence that could be expected from a
foreign investor in a heavily regulated sector like the energy industry. In such a sector, thorough prior analysis
of the legal framework applicable thereto is essential to make an investment.” [Emphasis added]

producers.°* Respondent also argues that Claimants had identified, in their investment
paper, the risk that the Kingdom of Spain could modify the CSP producers’ entitlement
to receive remuneration under the Special Regime even for the electricity produced with
non-renewable “back-up fuel.”57°

387. As regards the Purported Agreement and the declaratory contracts, Respondent argues
that Claimants were in a position to notice that no such agreements were listed on the
letter disclosing the agreements binding upon the plants sent by the seller of the plants
to the entities funded by Claimants which purchased the plants.9”!

388. Finally, Respondent points out that the following elements of the Original Regulatory
Framework were never subject to any regulatory clause or representation which could
even remotely be construed as a commitment of stability:

- The CPI Index;
- The TVPEE;
- The supplement for reactive power.

389. In fact, as regards this latter element, Respondent points out that Claimants’ witness

b) Relevant authorities

390. Charanne - As mentioned above, in Charanne,®” the tribunal dismissed a claim brought
under Article 10(1) ECT by Dutch investors who had invested in photovoltaic plants in
Spain. The tribunal assessed both the claimants’ purported expectation of stability and
their argument that the measures at issue constituted a fundamental upheaval of the
original regulatory framework.574

391. On the first issue, the investors invoked RD 661/2007 and a separate royal decree (RD
1578/2008) to argue that Spain had guaranteed the stability of the regulatory framework
applicable to the photovoltaic plants. In dismissing those claims, the Charanne tribunal
first concluded that the evidence did not disclose a “specific commitment entered into by

569 See Resp. Rejoinder, at paras. 1200 and following. Respondent also invokes the Sustainable Economy
Law 2/2011 adopted in March 2011. However, upon review, there is no provision in the excerpts produced of
that law produced by Respondent (R-0216) — and Respondent does not cite any — which could have arguably
tipped Claimants off to the impending enactment of the Measures at Issue.

Spain” promising that the regulatory framework existing at the time of the investment
would not change.%” The tribunal held that RD 661/2007 did not constitute such a
specific commitment even though it was addressed to a limited group of investors. The
tribunal also ruled that registration with the RAIPRE was a mere “administrative
requirement’ and not a source of vested rights to a certain remuneration.’ The tribunal
further ruled that the investors were in a position to carry out a “thorough” review of the
legal framework at the time of the investment, including the jurisprudence of the
Supreme Court of Spain. Such a review would have revealed to the investors that the
changes at issue were in fact possible, probable and legal. In this latter regard, the
tribunal ruled as follows:

“508. Although these decisions by the Spanish courts are not binding on this Arbitration
Tribunal, they are factually relevant to verify that the investor was unable, at the time of the
disputed investment, to have the ion that in the absence of a specific
commitment the regulation was not going to be modified during the lifespan of the plants.”57”

[Emphasis added]

The tribunal in Charanne held that the presentation The Sun Can Be Yours and other
similar documents in which the Spanish solar sector was promoted to prospective
foreign investors were too general to constitute a specific commitment of stability,5”*
finding that these materials did not specifically state that RD 661/2007 and RD
1578/2008 would not be modified.579

It is noted, however, that in Charanne no evidence was administered on discussions
between Spain and the photovoltaic sector that could have resulted in a purported
agreement similar to that alleged by Claimants in the present case. Nor of course did
the tribunal in Charanne rule on RD 1614/2010 or on the December Resolutions and
how these measures may have affected, if at all, the investors’ legitimate expectations,
given that they particular to the CSP sector.

Most importantly perhaps, the tribunal in Charanne did not rule on any of the Measures
at Issue in the present case; the impugned measures in Charanne were solely RD
1565/2010 and RD-L 14/2010.58°

Isolux — In Isolux,*' the tribunal dismissed a claim by a Dutch company that had
invested in Spain's photovoltaic sector. The investors had argued that RD 661/2007 and

a related regulation applying to the photovoltaic sector (RD 1578/2008) constituted a
specific commitment which gave rise to a legitimate expectation of stability that Spain
subsequently frustrated by enacting the measures at issue in that case. Like the tribunal
in Charanne, the tribunal in /so/ux ruled that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 do not
contain a specific commitment on stability.5°* The tribunal also ruled that, since the
regulations applied equally to domestic and foreign investors, any commitments they
may have contained could not be said to be “directed at investors’ or to “seek foreign
investment’ .58

It is noted, however, that the tribunal in /solux seems to have made that determination
in the context of its analysis of the “umbrella clause” at Article 10 ECT, not in the context
of a determination as to whether Respondent breached the FET obligation. This could
arguably be significant since a ruling that Respondent breached the “umbrella clause”
requires the formation of a legal obligation, whereas a commitment giving rise to a
legitimate expectation can be sourced in mere actions and representations which, in se,
need not have obligatory force.5°4

It is also noted that — as in Charanne — the tribunal in /solux was not asked to consider
RD 1614/2010 or the discussions that occurred between Protermosolar and the Spanish
government in the summer of 2010, the ensuing Purported Agreement or the exchange
of letters and December Resolutions. (As mentioned, these facts are particular only to
the Spanish CSP sector.)

Finally, solux is arguably distinguishable from the present case in that the investments
there were made in October 2012. By that date, RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 had
already been modified on several occasions. Most importantly, the impending changes
to the original regulatory framework applicable to the photovoltaic sector which started
with the enactment of Act 15/2012 (introducing the TVPEE, among other measures) had
already been publicly announced. Noting these particular circumstances and the date of
Claimants’ investment, the tribunal held that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 could not
have given rise to a legitimate expectation that the main tenets of the original regulatory
framework would remain unchanged.*® Quite to the contrary, the tribunal held that the
investors could have expected the type of fundamental changes that Spain ultimately
enacted. ®®

Eiser — \n Eiser,5®’ an ICSID tribunal granted a claim brought by investors in Spain’s
CSP sector on the basis of a violation of the FET obligation under the ECT for which it

published arbitral award of which the Tribunal is aware dealing with changes to the
regulatory framework applicable to CSP producers at issue in the present case. The
claimants’ case in Eiser was nearly identical, on the facts, to Claimants’ case against
Spain in the present arbitration.

The tribunal in Eiser dismissed the investors’ submission that RD 661/2007 constituted,
in itself, a specific commitment that the remuneration available to CSP producers would
remain immutable during the plants’ operational lifespan.5* It bears noting, however,
that the tribunal in Eiserdid not assess the impact — if any — of the Purported Agreement,
of RD 1614/2010 and of the exchange of letters of waiver and December Resolutions
upon the legitimate expectations of the investors in that case. That is likely because in
Eiser, Claimants committed its initial investment in October 2007, three years before the
enactments and representations upon which Claimants rely in the present case.5®

This said, the tribunal in Eiser found that the ECT protects investors among other things
“against the total and unreasonable change’ of the regulatory framework prevailing at
the time of the investment.5°° And it is precisely such a “total”, ‘radical’ change that the
Eiser tribunal determined that Spain enacted, starting with the adoption of RD-L 9/2013.
The Tribunal’s own views on the matter, are discussed below in section VI.B.ii.c).5%'

Novenergia — In Novenergia II Energy v. Kingdom of Spain,5® the tribunal granted a
claim brought by investors in the photovoltaic solar sector on the basis of violations of
Spain’s FET obligation under the ECT and awarded the investors €53 million in
damages.

While the tribunal ruled principally upon the same measures as those at issue in this
arbitration (i.e. the 2013-2014 reform of the remuneration regime for renewable energy
producers), the tribunal did not rule upon the effect of the Purported Agreement, RD
1614/2010 or of the December Resolutions. (As mentioned above, these measures are
specific to the CSP sector.)

As such, the tribunal did not engage with the issue of “stability” or “immutability” of all or
part of the regulatory framework applicable to photovoltaic producers. Rather, the
tribunal dealt with the issue whether the investors in that case held a legitimate
expectation that Spain would not “radically” alter the essential characteristics of the
regulatory framework in effect at the time of the investment; and, if so, whether the
measures at issue violated that legitimate expectation.*°°

The tribunal in Novenergia answered both questions affirmatively for the reasons

c) Discussion

By way of prefatory comment regarding the discussion that follows, the Tribunal notes,
first, that it does not consider that the evidentiary record in this case supports the
existence of a promise or commitment by Spain to “freeze” the Original Regulatory
Framework and all of its component laws, regulations, rules and remuneration variables.
Nor does the evidentiary record support the existence of a specific promise or
commitment by Spain to protect CSP producers such as Claimants from changes to all
aspects of the Original Regulatory Framework. As explained below, the representations
or enactments that could potentially be construed as a specific commitment by Spain in
this regard constitute, at best, a commitment to shield CSP producers from subsequent
regulatory changes to certain elements of the Original Regulatory Framework.

Second, as explained below, no enactment or representation by Spain before 2010
could reasonably be interpreted in se as such a specific commitment. The Tribunal
agrees with the tribunals in Charanne and Novenergia in this regard.5°4 Even though
Claimants argue that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 — in light of the language contained
in the May 2010 press release — may be construed as one such specific commitment, it
seems obvious that the regulatory changes subsequently enacted by Respondent (upon
which Claimants themselves rely in this arbitration®®°) preclude a finding that RD
661/2007 and/or its associated press release gave rise, in and of itself, to a legitimate
expectation of stability or immutability of the entire Original Regulatory Framework.

The same can be said for RD-L 6/2009 and the requirement for CSP plants to register
in the RAIPRE and the Pre-allocation Register.5°° As Respondent correctly points out,”
these enactments were part of Spain’s efforts to curb the tariff deficit and were meant to
restrict the conditions governing access to remuneration under the Special Regime, not
to guarantee immutable economic rights to all CSP plants or a steady flow of
remuneration over their operational lifespan.

In light of the above, the Tribunal is of the view that the questions central to Claimants’
alleged expectation of stability could be more fruitfully restated as follows:

- Did the Purported Agreement,5° the enactment of RD 1614/2010%°° and the
exchange of letters of waiver and December Resolutions,®° taken as a whole,
give rise to a legitimate expectation that CSP plants registered on the Pre-
allocation Register would be shielded from subsequent regulatory changes to any
particular element (if not all) of the Original Regulatory Framework?

584 Charanne (RL-0082), at paras. 507 and following, which ruled that RD 661/2007 and the requirement to
register in the RAIPRE or in the Pre-allocation Registry did not give rise, per se, to a legitimate expectation of
stability or to immutable economic rights. See Novenergia (CL-0245), at paras. 689 and 690.

- If so, what are these elements; were they modified by the Measures at Issue; and
did any such modification violate Claimants’ legitimate expectations?

For the following reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the Purported Agreement, RD
1614/2010 and the exchange of letters of waiver and December Resolutions did give
rise to a legitimate expectation that CSP plants registered on the Pre-allocation Register
would be shielded from subsequent regulatory changes to three specific elements of the
Original Regulatory Framework, and that this expectation was violated by Spain.

Relevance of Spanish law and EU law — The Tribunal is of the view that an analysis
of the enactments and representations identified above under Spanish law is arguably
not a fruitful avenue of inquiry. At issue is not the validity of the above-mentioned
measures and purported agreements under Spanish law. The question is rather
whether, as legally cognizable facts, these representations and enactments gave rise to
a legitimate expectation under international law, and in particular under the ECT. This
case presents the particularity of a substantial convergence existing between one
provision of a general regulation (Article 4 of RD 1614/2010) and two specific
commitments (the December Resolutions) addressed to the two plants at issue which
were about to become the very object of Claimants’ investment.

Objective content of the enactments and representations at issue — The
documentary record of the enactments and representations at issue contains clear
language emanating from Spain stating that subsequent changes to at least some
elements of the Original Regulatory Framework will not affect CSP plants registered on
the Pre-allocation Register.

For example, the Purported Agreement (even if Respondent is correct that it is devoid
of legal effect as a binding agreement under Spanish law) states in unequivocal terms
that: “... any future revisions of the premiums will not affect existing facilities, as it
currently established for regulated tariffs, and upper and lower limits, nor those that at
the time of approval of the review were already entered in the Feed-in Tariff Pre-
Assignment Registry created by Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, April 30, or that were
definitively entered in the REPE prior to May 6, 2009."°"' [Emphasis added]

Those terms are reflected in the text of Article 4 of RD 1614/2010, which states as
follows: “For thermosolar technology facilities under Royal Decree 661/2007, of May 25,
the revisions of tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits, to which Article 44.3 of said
Royal Decree refers, shall_not_affect (...) those facilities pre-registered _on_the
remuneration pre-allocation Register (...).”®°* In turn, Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 is
integrally incorporated in the December Resolutions.®° [Emphasis added]

The Tribunal is of the view that Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 specifically targets the CSP
sector: the text of that provision explicitly identifies “thermosolar technology facilities

Royal Decree 661/2007,” which includes the CSP plants at issue in which the Claimants
invested.

Respondent argues that, although Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 may have shielded some
CSP plants from some regulatory revisions, it did not shield them from the changes
enacted by the Measures at Issue.

Respondent points out that Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 mentions the “revisions ... to
which Article 44.3 of said Royal Decree [661/2007] refers.” [Emphasis added]
Respondent proposes an exceedingly rigorist interpretation that would limit the scope of
the term “revisions” strictly to the quadrennial revisions announced at Article 44.3 of RD
661/2007. Respondent seems to argue that, since the Measures at Issue were not
strictly enacted as part of such quadrennial revisions, Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 finds
no application in this case.*

 

The Tribunal does not agree. The Tribunal is rather of the view that the text of Article 4
of RD 1614/2010 and of Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 must be read in the legislative and
regulatory context of the time. Thus contextualised, these provisions suggest that
Respondent intended to shield CSP plants registered on the Pre-allocation Register
from future revisions of the tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits that were in
effect when Claimants invested.

 

First, it is clear from evidence emanating from MINETUR and contemporaneous with the
enactment of RD 661/2007 that the legislative purpose of its Article 44.3 was to shield
CSP facilities already in operation from future revisions of the tariffs and the upper and
lower limits (tellingly, this provision does not make any reference to “premiums’”).©°5 For
example, the press release accompanying the enactment of RD 661/2007 states in plain
terms:

“Any revisions of tariffs to be carried out in the future shall not affect the facilities
already in operation. This guarantee provides legal certainty for the producer,
providing stability for the sector and promoting its development."©°>

[Emphasis added]

The interpretation proposed by Respondent would render Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007
meaningless if the MINETUR discretionarily decided to change the timing of its
regulatory revisions (as it did in 2011), thus stripping the provision of any legislative
purpose.

What is more, Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 reiterated the “guarantee” set out at Article 44.3
of RD 661/2007 with even more specificity (explicitly identifying CSP plants), with a

broader scope and in the context of even more forceful contemporaneous
representations by Respondent.

In his testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Caravantes confirmed that Article 4 of RD 1614/2010
enshrined in law many of the elements of the Purported Agreement, in particular item 3
of the Purported Agreement, being the extension of the scope of Article 44.3 of RD
661/2007 to cover the “premiums” (i.e. the pool-plus premium remuneration option) and
the CSP facilities registered on the Pre-allocation Register.°°”

Mr. Caravantes also testified to the effect that the Purported Agreement was nothing
more than a dialogue with the CSP sector initiated by the Government in order to stave
off a public outcry at the upcoming regulatory revisions, among other reasons. It
remains that, even when assessed as a simple fact, and not as a binding act, the so-
called “dialogue” is replete with representations by the MINETUR that the Tribunal must
consider.

The Tribunal notes the many references, in contemporaneous documents emanating
from Respondent, to a “guarantee” of “stability’ for CSP producers that had registered
on the Pre-Allocation Registry. For example, a press release issued on 2 July 2010,
contemporaneously with the release of the Purported Agreement states as follows: “(...)
this agreement strengthens the visibility and stability of the regulation of these
technologies for the future, guaranteeing the current premiums and _ tariffs of RD
661/2007 for facilities in operation (and for those included in the pre-register) after
2013."6°9 [Emphasis added]

Similarly, a press release issued by the Council of Ministers on 3 December 2010 to
herald the adoption of RD 1614/2010 mentions that the imminent adoption of the royal
decree (i.e. RD 1614/2010) “involves reinforcement of the visibility and stability of the
regulation of these technologies in the future, and guarantees the present premiums and
tariffs of Royal Decree 661/2007 as of 2013 for installations in operation and for those
included on the pre-register.”*'° [Emphasis added]

Other contemporaneous documentary evidence reinforcing this assessment includes
public remarks by Dr. Pedro Marin Uribe, Spain’s Secretary of State for Energy in July
2010.®"' It is also telling that in public remarks tendered a few years later, Spain's
Minister of Energy referred to the “agreement’ purportedly entered into in 2010.62
Telling as well are the many references to mutual concessions between the CSP sector
and Spain, including the numerous emails exchanged between Mr. Crespo
(Protermosolar) and Mr. Caravantes (MINETUR) in November 2010 with a view to
finalize the language of the letters of waiver and the December Resolution.*'? This

suggests a mutual intention to arrive at a quid pro quo between the Respondent and
CSP producers based on mutual and consensual commitments. Whether this de facto
reality had legally binding effects under Spanish law or whether these exchanges were
part of a larger consultative process mandated by Spanish administrative law is not a
determinative issue for this arbitration. Even if Respondent's arguments on this matter
are accepted, at the very least, these exchanges suggest to the Tribunal that Spain
intended to grant the CSP sector a distinct and privileged status in the context of future
regulatory revisions and to extend to CSP producers specific assurances in that regard.

Respondent correctly points out that the witness presented by Claimants regarding the
Purported Agreement testified with some difficulty and at times somewhat
incoherently.* However, this does not contradict the evidence emanating from
Respondent which contains repeated, converging and clear mentions of a guarantee to
shield CSP producers registered on the Pre-allocation Registry from future regulatory
changes. As mentioned above, the Tribunal is not inclined to analyse the Purported
Agreement as a source of binding contractual obligations under Spanish law, but rather
as a legally cognizable fact, and in particular, as evidence of a representation by
Respondent to maintain some of the elements of the Original Regulatory Regime for
some CSP plants that satisfied certain administrative requirements.

Most importantly, the Purported Agreement (even when taken as a legally cognizable
fact, as opposed to a binding act per se) as well as the other representations, public
statements and enactments mentioned above culminated with the issuance of the
December Resolutions.*'5 Those resolutions were issued directly to the attention of —
and in response to inquiries by — the CSP plants at issue as regards their remuneration.
This is a key particularity of the present case. The substance of a general regulatory
provision (Article 4 of RD 1614/2010) was reaffirmed in two specific instruments (the
December Resolutions) sent by Spain’s competent authority to the two plants at issue.

Pursuant to the December Resolutions, Spain specifically represented to the CSP plants
that “at present ... the remuneration applicable to the facility is made up of the tariffs,
premiums, upper and lower limits and supplements established by RD 661/2007 (...).”°"®

 

Taken in isolation and out of the context of the contemporaneous representations and
enactments by Respondent, the December Resolutions could indeed be construed as
mere statements of the remunerative regime in effect strictly as at the date of their
issuance, i.e. 29 December 2010. However, placed in the context of the Purported
Agreement, of the adoption of RD 1614/2010 and of all the contemporaneous
declarations and public statements by Respondent, its agencies and representatives,
the Tribunal views the December resolutions as the clear expression of a specific
commitment to maintain, for the future, the “tariffs, premiums and lower and upper
limits’®"” to which the Mor6n and Olivenza 1 plants were subject.

The December Resolutions are Spain’s answer to the CSP plants’ clear and specific
request addressed to the MINETUR in the letters of waiver, for confirmation of the
remunerative regime applicable over the plants’ entire operational lifetime “[...] to have
the remuneration conditions for the facility during its operational lifespan communicated
[to them].”618

As such, the temporal horizon of the CSP plants’ inquiry (as clearly formulated in the
Letters of Waiver) forms a context indissociable from the response received in the form
of the December Resolutions. Spain in fact acknowledged the temporal horizon of the
CSP plants’ requests for information and explicitly set about to respond to those
requests:

“Finally, the applicant requests to receive communication of the remuneration conditions
applicable to the facility during its operational life.”°'9

The two sets of documents — i.e. the Letters of Waiver and the December Resolutions
— must be read together; and doing so makes clear the specific commitment by the
Government of Spain to the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants that these plants would be
shielded from any revisions to the “tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits” °°
during their operation lifetime.

This specific commitment is consistent with and confirms the clear terms of RD
1614/2010 as well as the promise contained in the press release accompanying the
issuance of that Royal Decree. It is a specific commitment issued not to the CSP sector
at large, but rather directly to the two CSP plants at issue.

This means that as of the date of the issuance of the December Resolutions (i.e. 29
December 2010), being less than six (6) months before investing, Claimants could
reasonably expect that the CSP plants at issue would benefit from the “tariffs, premiums
and lower and upper limits” established by RD 661/2007 for their entire operational life
time.

. The Tribunal finds this expectation reasonable and legitimate. The Tribunal finds no

evidence dated between 29 December 2010 and 23 June 2011 that could controvert the
reasonability or legitimacy of Claimants’ expectation in this regard.

Due diligence — Respondent strenuously argues that Claimants should have carried
out a more thorough due diligence verification of the Original Regulatory Framework. It
says that Claimants should have initiated their own due diligence efforts, rather than
taking the due diligence of the banks as a starting point. It argues that the nature and

value of their investment were such as to require a detailed legal opinion and not merely
verbal assurances from their counsel.

However, even if the Tribunal were to accept that Claimants could and should have
carried out the thorough due diligence verification of the Original Regulatory Framework
proposed by Respondent, this would not undermine the legitimacy of Claimants’
expectation of the stability of the “tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits” as
applicable to the CSP plants at issue.

Most, if not all, of the Supreme Court cases, EU laws and regulations as well as the
other factors that Respondent faults Claimants for not having sufficiently considered
before their investment were issued or came about before Spain's commitment of
stability crystallized in the December Resolutions on 29 December 2010.

In view of this specific commitment to the CSP plants at issue, the previous enactments
of Spain’s legal system and the pre-existing Supreme Court jurisprudence loses its
relevance for the present analysis.

As such, the evidence presented does not establish that a more thorough due diligence
would have rendered the Measures at Issue — in particular with respect to the abrogation
of the “tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits’®*! — reasonably foreseeable to
Claimants. As explained, the Tribunal is rather of the view that even the most thorough
due diligence would still have demonstrated that Respondent specifically committed —
by means of multiple representations and regulatory enactments, including those
discussed above — to shield CSP plants registered in the Pre-allocation Register from
future revisions of the “tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits” °°? applicable under
the Original Regulatory Framework. For the reasons expressed above at paras. 410
and following, the Tribunal considers that this conclusion would not have been altered
or invalidated even by a minute analysis of the Supreme Court case law or by an inquiry
into the binding effect of the Purported Agreement strictly under Spanish national law.

The Tribunal is of the view that even a perfect analysis of such jurisprudence could not
have led the Claimants to foresee that Respondent might abrogate the very tenets of
the Original Regulatory Framework (i.e. the premium and the lower and upper limits)
that it undertook to maintain unchanged for the CSP sector.

By the same token, there is no provision to be found in any of the EU laws or regulations
cited by Respondent which could have alerted Claimants to the impending enactment
of the Measures at Issue. The Tribunal is prepared to accept that remuneration under
the Special Regime may have been considered “state aid,” the purpose of which was to
provide investors with a reasonable rate of return.®*? But that is not relevant to the
analysis of the issue as to whether Respondent violated a specific commitment tendered
to the CSP sector.

Respondent has not pointed to any specific telltale sign that might have tipped Claimants
to the foreseeability of the Measures at Issue even had Claimants assessed the EU
regulations on state aid with the rigour proposed by Respondent. For these reasons,
and given the Tribunal’s finding (detailed above) that Respondent tendered a specific
commitment of stability with respect to certain elements of the Original Regulatory
Framework, the Tribunal is of the view that the content and interpretation of EU law and
regulations is largely irrelevant to resolve the merits of the present dispute.

In the Tribunal’s view, the same can be said about the tenets of RDL 14/2010,6%4 which
was enacted shortly after the adoption of RD 1614/2010. It is true that RDL 14/2010
enacted changes to the maximum hours of operations of renewable energy producers,
but these changes applied exclusively to the photovoltaic sector,®*° thus implicitly
confirming the Respondent's commitment to the CSP sector. It is also true that RDL
14/2010 subjects all renewable energy producers to new network access fees, 6 but
these new fees did not impact the “tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits.”°°7 As
mentioned above, these tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits in effect when the
Claimants invested were reinforced by Respondent's specific commitment of stability.
The fact that they remained unchanged further to the adoption of RDL 14/2010 implicitly
confirms Respondent's commitment and Claimants’ expectations in that regard.

The Tribunal also notes that Claimants chose to invest in the CSP sector in a period that
was marked by the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis and the efforts by the
Respondent to curb the so-called tariff deficit. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that
these elements should have been front and center for any diligent investor. Barred any
specific commitments, a reasonable investor could not have relied on the stability of the
remunerative regime set out in RD 661/2007. However, the importance of the 2008 crisis
and of Respondent's efforts to curb the tariff deficit was superseded by the specific
commitment tendered by Respondent to the CSP sector which culminated in the
enactment of the December resolutions.

In sum, the Tribunal is of the view that even a more thorough due diligence would not
have alerted Claimants of the impending enactment of the Measures at Issue, in
particular that the “tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits’®®° would be modified or
altogether rescinded even for the CSP plants that were registered in the Pre-allocation
Register, such as the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants.

Distinguishing Factors — The facts of this case distinguish it from Charanne, Isolux
and Eiser in which the tribunals held that the original regulatory framework applicable to
photovoltaic plants did not contain any “specific commitment’ of stability (i.e.
immutability). The tribunals in Charanne and in /solux were not called upon to assess
the effect of the Purported Agreement, RD 1614/2010 or the exchange of letters of
waiver and the December Resolutions (as mentioned, these representations and

enactments are particular to the CSP sector and the tribunals in Charanne and Isolux
dealt with claims by investors in the photovoltaic sector). Similarly, in Eiser, the tribunal
did not consider the effect of these enactments and of the contemporaneous
representations in that regard by Spain's high-ranking officials (possibly because, unlike
in the present case, the Eiser claimants’ initial investment preceded these enactments
and statements by three years, although other investments were made subsequently).

Scope of Respondent's Specific Commitment — In the light of the above, the Tribunal
finds that, by 2010, Respondent had in fact made a specific commitment to the CSP
sector that CSP plants registered in the Pre-allocation Register would be shielded from
subsequent regulatory changes at least as regards certain elements of the Original
Regulatory Framework.

It remains to consider which particular elements of the Original Framework were subject
to Respondent's specific commitment; and whether their modification or abrogation by
the Measures at Issue violated Claimants’ legitimate expectation?

Given the text of the Purported Agreement, of RD 1614/2010 and of the December
Resolutions, as well as the representations tendered contemporaneously with those
measures, the Tribunal finds that Respondent specifically committed that future
revisions of the values of the regulated tariff, the pool price premium and the applicable
upper and lower limits would not affect those CSP plants registered on the Pre-Allocation
Register. The Tribunal considers that inherent to this specific commitment is the
assurance that the regulated tariff and pool plus premium would continue to apply for
the operational lifespan of the CSP plants registered on the Pre-allocation Register. (The
duration of the plants’ operational lifespan is a hotly contested issue that is analyzed
below).

For the following reasons, however, the Tribunal is of the view that the same does not
hold for the remaining five (5) rights (or entitlements) that Claimants seek to vindicate in
this arbitration:

- The right to sell the full net amount of electricity produced — (Art. 30(2) EPA
1997): Not only is this right not guaranteed by the Original Regulatory Framework,
but it has also suffered significant modification by enactments invoked by
Claimants as the basis for other rights, including RD 1614/2010 which reduced
the number of hours of operation for which CSP plants would have access to
remuneration under the Special Regime;

- The right to obtain remuneration under the Special Regime even for

electricity produced using non-renewable “back-up fuel’ — (Art. 2(1)(b)(1) RD
661/2007): Not only was the future application of this provision not guaranteed by

Page 130

Respondent, but Claimants in fact contemplated the possibility of modifications to
this provision prior to investing.°°

- The updating of the feed-in remuneration scheme in accordance with the
general CPI index minus 0.25% per year until the end of 2012 and minus
0.5% per year thereafter — (Art. 44 of the First Additional Provision of RD
661/2007): No evidence was presented that could suggest that Respondent made
any specific commitment with respect to the stability of the updating method or the
ongoing application of the CPI index in that regard;

- The right to priority access to the transmission and distribution grid — (Art.
25(2) EPA 1997): Claimants fail to show where exactly or in what manner
Respondent guaranteed that they would be shielded from modifications to this
provision. In any event, Claimants did not show how this right was modified and
how such modification, if any, constitutes a violation of Respondent's FET
obligation. In fact, it is noted that Article 26(2) EPA 2013 seems to reassert the
priority access to the transmission and distribution grid granted to renewable
energy producers under the Original Regulatory Framework.®° Finally, it also
bears noting that both experts agreed that “no one has yet attempted to estimate
the financial impact (if any) associated with the elimination of the right to priority
access and that the likely impact would be minor at most,"

- The right to receive a supplement for reactive energy — (Art. 29(1) of RD
661/2007): Not only is the evidence silent on any specific comment regarding a
supplement for reactive energy, but the Claimant's own witness was not able to
describe or explain the supplement for reactive energy. In the circumstances, the
Tribunal is of the view that Claimant has not made its case regarding the
legitimacy of any putative expectation in this regard.

453. Finally, the Tribunal is of the view that the abrogation of the regulated tariff and the pool
premium and their replacement with a system based on a remuneration per unit of
installed capacity calculated according to an “efficient” standard plant of the type at issue
frustrated Claimants’ legitimate expectation. First, the uncontradicted evidence
produced in the record and administered at the Hearing shows that Claimants relied on
the values of the regulated tariff and of the pool plus premium (colloquially dubbed the
“FIT’ by Claimants’ witnesses at the Hearing). It is clear that Claimants forecasted that
these values would not change for the lifespan of the plants. For the reasons mentioned
above, the Tribunal finds this expectation reasonable and legitimate.

629 See Claimants’ Investment Paper, C-0560, on p. 41: “While the Spanish authorities allow CSP plants to
generate up to 15% of power from natural gas, there is no guarantee that this percentage will stay the same
for the duration of the life of the project. Speaking to Lahmeyer and industry stakeholders, there is a residual
risk that the level may either be reduced, as it may be considered too generous.”

630 See EPA 2013, at Article 26(3), C-0311t.

31 See the joint letter of Accuracy and Brattle quantum experts dated 19 July 2017, on pp. 2 and 3.

Second, it is clear that the change enacted by the Measures at Issue is significant. The
abrogation of the feed-in remuneration system and its replacement with the “specific
remuneration” under the EPA 2013 caused Claimants significant losses of up to €38
million (slightly higher than the value of Claimants’ investment).°2

For these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent breached its FET
obligation under Article 10(1) by frustrating a legitimate expectation held by Claimants
that future regulatory changes would not affect the CSP producers’ right to receive the
pool price premium set out at RD 661/2007 and reiterated by RD 1614/2010.

Given this finding, the Tribunal does not find it useful to rule on Claimants’ alleged
expectation of consistency. Doing so would not yield a different quantum of damages
since Claimants’ arguments with respect to the violation of its alleged reasonable
expectation of consistency could not serve to vindicate the rights (or entitlements) that
the Tribunal decided to exclude from the quantum calculation for the reasons outlined
at para. 452, above.

iii. The alleged violation of Respondent's duty of transparency and due
process

a) The Parties’ Positions

Claimants — The Claimants allege that the adoption of the Measures at Issue was
marred by a number of irregularities that had the effect of violating the investors’ right to
be heard on the proposed changes and plunged the entire CSP sector into a period of
harmful uncertainty as to the remuneration to be received by CSP plants.

In conducting itself as it did, the Respondent allegedly failed in its obligation —
encompassed within the scope of the FET standard — to be forthcoming with information
regarding upcoming regulatory changes so to allow investors an opportunity to plan
accordingly.°>

The Claimants fault the Respondent for allegedly disregarding and subsequently
concealing from the public and the industry certain critical reports issued by two
consulting firms — Boston Consulting Group (“BCG”) and Roland Berger (“RB”) — that
were retained to advise the MINETUR on the envisaged reform.®4 The Claimants argue
that Respondent persisted in its secretive conduct even in the course of this arbitration,
allegedly violating an order by the Tribunal to disclose spreadsheets showing financial
models exchanged between BCG and the IDEA that formed the basis of the new
remunerative parameters. The Claimants ask the Tribunal to draw a negative inference
from this conduct as regards the substance of the Measures at Issue, and to find that

Respondent “lowered arbitrarily the remuneration parameters for standard
installations.”"©°5

The Claimants also complain of excessive delays in the implementation of the regulatory
reform. For example, Claimants say that Respondent took nearly two (2) years to
complete the new regulatory framework, between the beginning of the legislative reform
in December 2012 (with the adoption of Act 15/2012) °° and its completion in the
summer and fall of 2014 (with the adoption of a set of ministerial orders, including MO
IET/1045/2014®°7 which established the new “reasonable” rate of return).6°°

According to Claimants, during this so-called “inter-regnum” period, CSP producers in
Spain allegedly operated without knowing what their exact remuneration would be.
Worse, Claimants say that further similar periods of uncertainty are likely in store, given
that the new regulatory framework provides for Spain’s discretion to conduct periodic
reviews every 3 to 6 years.9

Other purported irregularities raised by Claimants include: Respondent's decision to
implement some of the Measures at Issue through Royal Decrees and Royal Decree
Laws, thus “bypassing” Parliament; the excessive amendments enacted to the EPA of
2013; the excessive volume of a ministerial order that established key remuneration
parameters under the new regulatory regime (i.e. MO IE/1045/2014 which purportedly
contains 1,539 pages).®*

Respondent — The Kingdom of Spain submits that the regulatory reform at issue was
announced as early as December 2011 in a speech by the then president-elect, Mr.
Mariano Rajoy.®? This was followed by periodic announcements that provided
increasing details regarding the proposed changes.

Respondent argues that the enactment of the Measures at Issue complied with all
relevant public consultation procedures provided by Spanish administrative law. More
importantly, Respondent submits that the various actors in the CSP sector were given
an opportunity to participate in consultations in regard to every aspect of the Measures
at Issue. For example, Respondent points out that the first draft of RD 432/2014 contains
hundreds of submissions from CSP producers, which were considered by the MINETUR
as part of subsequent drafts of that royal decree.*4 Respondent produced evidence
showing that the industry association Protermosolar filed pleadings with the MINETUR
on key elements of the Measures at Issue. Respondent's witness on the enactment of

the Measures at Issue, Mr. Carlos Montoya, also testified that companies related to the
entities that own the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants participated in the consultation
process by submitting “claims” regarding the various proposed regulatory
enactments.

As regards the use of a royal decree (rather than legislation) to enact certain aspects of
the regulatory reform, the Respondent pleads the urgency of the Measures at Issue and
invokes a ruling of the Constitutional Court ratifying the method chosen.®°

Respondent also submits that it was not bound (and indeed was prevented, by
confidentiality obligations) to disclose the preliminary drafts of the RB and BCG reports.
It says that the final RB report was only issued after the completion of the regulatory
reform and that a final BCG report was never issued given that BCG’s mandate was
prematurely terminated.®4”

Finally, the Respondent says the voluminous nature of some of the ministerial orders at
issue and the delays in completing the regulatory reform were warranted by the
comprehensive nature of the reform and the complexity of the underlying subject
matter.o4

b) Relevant Authorities

It is noted that, to the Tribunal’s knowledge, there exists no published arbitral award
involving Spain, solar investors and the recent regulatory changes that addresses an
alleged breach by Spain of its transparency and due process obligations under the FET
standard in respect of the adoption of the Measures at Issue.

c) Discussion

The Parties seem to agree®® and the Tribunal accepts that the FET standard
encompasses an obligation by the host state to be “forthcoming with information about
intended changes in policy and regulations that may significantly affect investments, so
that the investor can adequately plan its investment and, if needed, engage the host
State in dialogue about protecting its legitimate expectations.”®°

After carefully reviewing the evidence presented by the Parties, however, the Tribunal
does not agree with Claimants that Respondent breached this obligation.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the enactment of the regulatory reform was announced
sufficiently in advance to allow the CSP sector investors and actors to react. The
Tribunal is also satisfied that the consultation process was carried out in accordance
with Spanish administrative law. Though this does not — in itself — necessarily entail

conformity with the transparency obligation under the FET standard, the Tribunal is
satisfied in this case that the CSP sector in general, as well as the industry association
(Protermosolar) and an entity related to the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants in particular,
in fact participated in the consultative process by submitting observations and requests
to MINETUR.

The outcome of this process — i.e., the enactment of the Measures at Issue — was
contrary to Claimants’ hopes and indeed to their expectations of stability (as detailed
above, at Sections VI.B.i and III.B.ii of the present Award). However, in the Tribunal’s
view, the process itself did not run afoul of Spain’s obligations under the FET standard.
Spain could have decided, for political reasons or for other considerations, to provide for
greater participation by industry actors in the reform process. It could have opted for
broader and earlier disclosure of the documents and information upon which it based
the regulatory reform, including the various RB and the BCG reports. But in the
Tribunal’s view, the announcements and the consultation process in place, imperfect
though they may have been, provided the CSP producers and investors with ample
opportunities to be heard, to react to the changes at issue, and to “engage the host state
in dialogue about protecting [their] legitimate expectations.”®*'

Given the Tribunal’s finding regarding the violation of the FET standard (see Section
VI.B.ii.c. of the present Award), the Tribunal is therefore of the view that the Claimants’
request for negative inferences on the arbitrariness of the substance of the Measures at
Issue has become moot.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent did not breach its duty
of transparency and due process towards Claimants.

In any event, even if the Tribunal were to find a breach, the Claimants acknowledged
that they could not quantify a direct and distinct prejudice arising from the so-called
“inter-regnum period” that allegedly spanned the period between the first salvo of
measures enacted in the fall of 2012 and those adopted in the fall of 2014.2

C. THE OTHER GROUNDS OF LIABILITY ASSERTED UNDER ARTICLE 10 ECT

Apart altogether from their claim for violation of the FET standard, Claimants advance
three (3) further claims under Article 10 ECT, alleging that Respondent:

i) breached the “umbrella obligation” set out at Article 10 ECT in fine, by enacting
the Measures at Issue in violation of various legal obligations of a contractual
nature entered into with the CSP sector;®&°

(‘MCPS”);° and
iii) failed to provide Claimants’ investment with protection against impairment by

“unreasonable” or “discriminatory’ measures.®>

The Tribunal is of the view that these claims effectively seek relief for the same acts as
give rise to Claimants’ cause of action under the FET standard, i.e. the abrogation of the
Original Regulatory Framework, the adoption of the Measures at Issue and the impact
of these regulatory changes upon Claimants’ investment. The Tribunal views these
claims as less suitable approaches by which to analyse and resolve the Claimants’
overall case than the analysis under the FET standard carried out above at Section VI.B,
which has the advantage of fully resolving the case asserted by Claimants under Article
10 ECT. Given considerations of procedural economy, and in keeping with the
observations of other investor-state arbitration tribunals in this regard,®* the Tribunal
considers that it need not address issues that are not essential to its decisions.°°”

Even if it were to rule on these other claims (which it expressly refrains from doing), the
Tribunal would likely be inclined — much like the tribunal in Novenergia, it appears®° —
to hold that Claimants’ MCPS and non-impairment claims are effectively “further
illustrations” of the FET standard which would not modify the compensation owed for the
violations of that FET standard. That is, the decision that Claimants violated the FET
renders these claims moot. As regards the “umbrella obligation” claim, the Tribunal
notes — again, in keeping with the views of the tribunal in Novenergia— that such a claim
may well require demonstration of a personal obligation entered into by Respondent
towards Claimants or their investments. Here, however, the Respondent's actions,
enactments and representations were directed generally at the entire Spanish CSP
sector, not directly or personally towards Claimants or their investments.

D. THE EXPROPRIATION CLAIM

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tribunal feels compelled to address Claimants’
expropriation claim under Article 13 ECT, if only because Claimants submit that the
Tribunal has jurisdiction to rule upon the TVPEE under Article 13 ECT, which it otherwise
lacks under Article 10 ECT.®° If the Claimants’ submissions in this regard are accepted,
the expropriation claim — if granted — could change the assessment of the quantum of
damages owed to Claimants. This said, for the following reasons, the Tribunal is inclined
to dismiss Claimants’ expropriation claim.

i, The Parties’ Positions

Claimants — The Claimants argue that, under Article 13 ECT, the abrogation of the
Original Regulatory Framework and the enactment of the Measures at Issue constitute
a creeping (or indirect) and illegal expropriation of their investment in the Morén and
Olivenza 1 plants.

Claimants submit that the Measures at Issue drastically reduced the flow of income of
the two (2) plants and resulted in a “substantial deprivation” of their investment — the
standard to be applied in assessing the existence of an expropriation.°©°

Claimants acknowledge that the Measures at Issue did not deprive them of their property
rights over the shares and the debt obligations they hold (directly or indirectly) in the
entities that own and operate the plants.°°' They argue, however, that the
implementation of the new regulatory regime “neutralized” the benefit of those shares
and debt obligations,®°? by impairing their ability to manage the plants (an ownership
attribute attached to their investment) and depriving them of the enjoyment of the
property of their shares and debt obligations.

Claimants contend that the new regulatory framework affected the financial stability of
the two plants to such an extent that Claimants were forced to devote almost the entirety
of their efforts to avoiding a default under the plants’ financing agreements, making it
impossible for them to manage the plants “normally’.°©*

Claimants further submit that the Measures at Issue directly caused a dilution of their
shareholding interest in the entities that own and operate the plants, from 16% to
14.81%, and a reduction in their subordinated debt interest in those same entities by
93%.°°5 Claimants say both entities teetered on the brink of bankruptcy — the Moron
plant remaining in a “cause of dissolution” as at the date of filing of Claimants’ Reply —
thereby preventing the plants from issuing a dividend in the “foreseeable future.”®°°

Finally, Claimants submit that none of the exceptions provided for at Article 13 ECT,
paras. (a) to (d) is met, such that the purported indirect expropriation of their investment
is illegal.°°”

Respondent — Respondent does not seem to disagree with the standard applicable to
assess whether an expropriation occurred, i.e. a “substantial deprivation” of the
Claimants’ investment. The Respondent counters, however, that the Claimants’ case

discloses no property or right that may be subject to expropriation®® and that, in any
event, Claimants failed to demonstrate that they have been “substantially deprived” of
their investment. ®°

Respondent argues that Claimants do not have an ownership right over the expected
return of their investment in the Moron and Olivenza 1 plants, which is not “appropriable
property’ that can validly form the object of an expropriation claim.

Relying on Electrabel v. Hungary,®”° Respondent also submits that Claimants failed to
meet the “substantial deprivation” test, which requires the demonstration of a loss of “all
significant economic value.”*"' According to Respondent the Claimants would have had
to show that the plants have become “financially worthless.”°”

Respondent points out that the plants remain in operation, in the possession and under
the control of the Claimants.6”? Respondent argues that the investors maintain the
capacity to administer the plants, as was abundantly shown when Claimants steered the
plants through the alleged financial troubles caused by the changes in the Original
Regulatory Framework.*”4 Respondent also points out that Claimants remain entitled to
earn a profit on their initial investment even after the enactment of the Measures at
Issue.°75

Finally, and in any event, Respondent submits that, even if the Tribunal were to consider
the Measures at Issue as an expropriation, such an expropriation would be justified —
that is, legal — under Article 13(1)(a) to 13(1)(d) of the ECT.®’° Respondent argues that
the Measures at Issue furthered the public interest in rebalancing the tariff deficit; were
not discriminatory since they apply equally to all CSP producers as part of a reform that
targets all renewable energy producers alike; and are reasonable and proportional since
the renewable energy producers remain entitled to keep a profit of approximately 7%
over and above their capital expenditures and operating costs.°””

ii. Relevant Authorities

Charanne — \n Charanne, the tribunal dismissed an expropriation claim by Dutch
investors arising from Spain’s overhaul of the remunerative regime applicable to
photovoltaic producers in 2010.

The tribunal recognized that the expropriation provisions of the ECT protect investments
but held that this protection does not extend to the “return on investment’ expected by

the investors.®”8 The Charanne tribunal held that the subject of claimants’ investment in
that case was not the returns expected, but rather the legal entities operating the plants.
For the purpose of the expropriation analysis, the tribunal held that the property
protected against expropriation is made up of claimants’ shares in those plants; and the
question guiding the tribunal’s assessment of expropriation centered on the investors’
rights as a shareholder.®’? The tribunal held that a finding of expropriation requires the
“destruction of value” of the investment.®°

No such destruction occurred in Charanne, the tribunal held, since the claimants
retained the property of the shares and — although the decrease in profitability could
entail serious consequences — the plants would continue to earn a return of 6.72% or
higher. °°

Isolux — In Isolux,® the tribunal also dismissed an expropriation claim brought by Dutch
investors in Spain’s photovoltaic sector.

The tribunal held that Article 13(1) ECT protects the investments of foreign investors
who invested in Spain’s renewable energy sector, including the indirect shareholding
interest in renewable energy plants.°®° However, the /so/ux tribunal determined that the
criteria for showing indirect expropriation could only be met if the measures at issue in
that case were shown to have caused a “substantial and significant’ decrease in the
economic value of the investment:®4 {T]hat is to say, the impact on the rights or goods
of the investor (...) must be of such magnitude that its investment loses all or a significant
part of its value, which amounts to a significant deprivation of its property.”6°5

The /solux tribunal held that the investors had failed to make such a showing, given that
they continued fully to control and operate the plants, the current profitability of which
was actually greater than under the original regulatory framework.®°

Eiser - As noted above, the tribunal in the Eiser case®®’ chose not to address the
investors’ expropriation claim for reasons of “judicial economy’ and in particular given
that the tribunal had already decided to grant claimants’ claim under the FET standard.

Novenergia — \n Novenergia,®* the tribunal dismissed an expropriation claim by a
Luxembourgish investor who had challenged the Measures at Issue as applicable to the
photovoltaic industry.

In the context of its assessment of Respondent's alleged breach of the FET standard,
the Novenergia tribunal ruled that the impugned regulatory changes constituted a
“substantial deprivation” of claimant's investment,®° viewed from the perspective of a
24% to 32% decrease in revenues of the photovoltaic plants and a correlative drop in
the claimants’ profits.°°

The Novenergia tribunal applied the same criterion (i.e. “substantial deprivation” of
claimant's investment) to assess the expropriation claim, but chose to do so from the
perspective of the investors’ property rights.°' The Tribunal ruled that the investors’
ownership rights in the photovoltaic plants and in the shares of the entities that operate
them were left unaffected by the impugned measures,®°* even though the underlying
assets diminished in value.®°?

In that case — as here — claimant retained ownership and control of its assets, its plants
remained operational and those plants were expected to generate a certain profits over
their operational lifetime, even though that profit was significantly lower than what the
claimant had initially expected.®* As a result, the tribunal in Novenergia ruled that the
investors failed to prove an expropriation case.

iii. Discussion
Article 13(1) ECT provides: “/nvestments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area
of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to a
measure or measures having the effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (...)

except where such Expropriation’ meets one of the conditions provided at Articles
13(1)(a) to 13(1)(d).6%

The Tribunal subscribes to the analysis of the Charanne tribunal and will therefore
assess whether an expropriation has occurred from the perspective of the rights of
Claimants as shareholders and debt holders in the Morén and Olivenza 1 entities.

There seems to be no disagreement between the Parties that the standard of
“substantial deprivation’ is applicable to determine the existence of an expropriation
purportedly brought about by the Measures at Issue. The Tribunal will therefore apply

that standard, as articulated in Electrabel v. Hungary,°*° to assess whether, in the
present case, the impugned regulatory changes constitute an expropriation.

505. In this regard, the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary stated that: “(...) in both direct and
indirect expropriation, consistently albeit in different terms, the requirement under
international law for the investor [is] to establish the substantial, radical, severe.
devastating or fundamental deprivation of its rights or the virtual annihilation, effective

neutralisation or factual destruction of its investment, its value or enjoyment.” °°”
[Emphasis added]

 

506. For the following reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimants have not met this
standard and that their expropriation claim must fail.

507. First, Claimants have clearly maintained control over their investment. This is evident
from the fact that Claimants admittedly oversaw the restructuring process that helped
steer the plants through the aftermath of the adoption of the Measures at Issue. Their
shareholding and debt interest may have been diluted as a result of the restructuring,
but that was at least in part the consequence of Claimants’ decision to engage with the
restructuring measures. The Tribunal observes in this regard that Claimants’ decision to
dedicate time, effort and resources to the restructuring effort is an implicit recognition
that the investment maintained some value to them, despite the overhaul of the Original
Regulatory Framework.

508. Second, and unlike the factual scenarios prevailing in certain of the cases concerning
indirect (or “creeping’) expropriation relied on by Claimants, the plants at issue remain
operational. Indeed, the new regulatory regime is premised upon the proposition that —
in principle — the Plants should earn a return on investment of 7.4% before taxes, and,
by Respondent's experts’ own reckoning that the Plants will earn a return on investment
of 6.2% before taxes. °°

509. Third, and most importantly, Claimants will continue to benefit from their investment, if
only marginally so. The calculations and forecasts of Claimants’ damages experts show
that, even after the adoption of the Measures at Issue, the investments in the CSP plants
retain some value” and that some measure of free cash flows will be available to the
investors throughout the first 25 years of operation.’”°' Respondent's experts forecast an
actual return on investment of 6.2% pre-tax.”°? Both forecasts are significantly lower
than the rate of return that Claimants expected. In the Tribunal’s view, however, although
this decrease in value may constitute a violation of Claimants’ legitimate expectations in

696 Electrabel (RL-0005).

the circumstances, it does not constitute an expropriation of Claimants’ shareholding or
debt interest.

E. DAMAGES
i, Overview

Both Parties seem to agree that, should the Tribunal find Respondent in breach of the
ECT, compensatory damages represent the appropriate remedy to compensate the
harm suffered by Claimants as a result, if any. Claimants argue — and Respondent does
not disagree — that the principle of full compensation set forth in the Chorzéw Factory
case”°S must then apply:7°*

“The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act — a principle
which seems to be established by international practice and in particular the
decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-
out [sic] all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation as if
it had not been committed.” 7°5

This said, the Parties disagree widely on almost all conceptual and economic elements
underlying the assessment of Claimants’ harm and the quantum of compensatory
damages. On the most fundamental level, the Parties disagree regarding the appropriate
method to assess Claimants’ damages.

Claimants and their experts propose a DCF method, based on the free cash flows lost
by the CSP plants at issue and the correlative decrease in Claimants’ returns as a result
of the enactment of the Measures at Issue. This method forecasts the free cash flows
that the CSP plants would have generated during their operational lifetime but for the
enactment of the Measures at Issue, and discounts those cash flows back to a pre-
established evaluation date. The DCF method is premised on the construction of a
hypothetical “but for’ scenario and of an “actual scenario, on an assessment of the
variation between the two and on the application of a series of discount factors based
on market risk and the time value of money. Relying on this method, the Claimants’
experts opined that the enactment of the Measures at Issue caused Claimants to incur
damages in the amount of €75.7 million.”

Respondent and its experts propose principally a regulated asset base (“RAB”) method,
based primarily on the variation between the value of the underlying assets of the CSP
plants before and after the enactment of the Measures at Issue. This method is based
on the premise that the investors’ sole entitlement under the Original Regulatory

706 CER-4. The quantum experts presented by Claimants initially assessed damages in the amount of €74
million in their first report on quantum dated 19 May 2015 (CER-2) but reviewed that estimate in October
2016 to account for the impact of the restructuring incurred in the interim.

Framework was a remuneration that covered the plants’ capital expenses, operating
expenses and yielded a “reasonable return” on the initial investment. Applying this
method, Respondent's experts concluded that the Claimants did not suffer any prejudice
— they opined that the Measures at Issue maintained a remuneration that covered the
plants’ capital and operating expenses and provided Claimants with a reasonable return
on their investment.

In the alternative to the above assessments, both Parties’ experts also engaged with
their counterparts’ preferred evaluation method, Respondent's experts undertaking a
subsidiary DCF evaluation and Claimants’ a subsidiary RAB evaluation.

Pursuant to Respondent's subsidiary DCF assessment, the enactment of the Measures
at Issue caused Claimants to incur damages in the amount of €7.7 million.”°” Applying
a subsidiary RAB method, Claimants’ experts opined that Claimants’ damages are in
the range of €50 to €57 million.”

 

 

The inconsistent results of the experts’ respective principal and subsidiary assessments
is explained by the fact that the disagreement between them also touches on the very
different values they each ascribe to the many variables inputted into their DCF and RAB
analyses to build the “but for and “actual scenarios, and the discount rate, among
others.

Given this wide-ranging disagreement and the need to render the damages analysis
sensitive to the Tribunal’s findings on the issue of breach of ECT, the Tribunal — with the
permission of the Parties — asked the experts to prepare a joint interactive quantum
model (the “Joint Model”) that would:

- Identify the issues in contention as regards the determination of quantum;

- Allow the Tribunal to assess the impact on the damages calculation (measured
in €) of the Tribunal’s decision in respect of each of the changes to the Original
Regulatory Framework brought about by the Measures at Issue that Claimants
contend constitutes a breach of the ECT (by “toggling”, so to speak, between “no
breach/no liability/no damages’ on the one hand, and “breach/liability/damages”
on the other);

- Allow the Tribunal to assess the impact on the damages calculation of a decision
in respect of each of the disputed assumptions and other variables factored into
the Parties’ quantum calculations (by “toggling” between the Parties’ respective
positions regarding these factors).

707 This is Respondents’ subsidiary DCF assessment presuming that the plants’ installed capacity does not
exceed 50 MW in actual fact, in keeping with the Tribunal’s finding above. See in this regard Accuracy Q-ER-
1, on pp. 11 and following.

518. The Joint Model was submitted by the Parties’ experts on 20 November 2017, followed

519.

520.

521.

by comments and additional submissions on damages filed by the Parties on 4
December 2017.

As discussed at paras. 452 to 454 above, the Tribunal has determined that the
abrogation of the pool-price plus premium element of the Original Regulatory Framework
by the Respondent and the imposition of a fixed term for the remunerative regime
constituted breaches of Claimants’ legitimate expectations, and hence a breach of the
ECT in the circumstances, but that the bulk of the other changes effected by the
Measures at Issue — the withdrawal of special remuneration for the energy produced
with non-renewable fuel; the abrogation of the supplement for reactive energy; the
updating of the CPI index; the right to receive remuneration for the full amount of
electricity produced; and the right to priority access to the distribution grid — do not. As
well, the Tribunal has determined that it does not have jurisdiction to rule on the TVPEE
claim. It is therefore only the impact of certain elements of the Measures at Issue that
must be assessed when calculating Claimants’ damages, which the Joint Model permits
the Tribunal to do by switching “on” or “off’ the toggle for each element.

The only outstanding matters of contention between the Parties and their experts that
the Tribunal must resolve to rule on the quantum issue are the following:

Whether the DCF method or the RAB method is most appropriate for calculating
Claimants’ damages?

If the DCF method is to be preferred, what value should the Tribunal ascribe to the
variables regarding the “Regulatory Risk Premium’ and the “Date of Valuation”
factored into that model?

- If the RAB method is to be preferred, what value should the Tribunal ascribe to
the variables regarding “Levelized Cost/Investment Base,” “After-tax Target
Return” and “Discount Rate for Actual Scenario"?

- Regardless of the evaluation method chosen, what value should the Tribunal
ascribe to the following variables common to both methods: “Plant Lifetime”;
“Liquidity Discount’; “Production”; “Management Costs”; “InfraRed Share
Dilution”; “Value of Debt’?

For the following reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the DCF evaluation method is
to be preferred. As regards the variables used in evaluating damages under that method,
the Tribunal is of the view that the evaluation should assume a 25-year lifetime for the
plants at issue, the lost cash flows for that period should be evaluated as at December
2014 and “Production Assumption” should be toggled to the value proposed by
Respondent's experts; for the rest, the Tribunal is inclined to prefer the assumptions
proposed by Claimants’ experts.

ii. Valuation Method
a) The Parties’ Positions

Claimants — Relying on the opinion of their quantum experts, the Brattle Group
(‘Brattle’), Claimants submit that the DCF method is the most appropriate means of
assessing their damages because the revenues and expenses of the Mordn and
Olivenza 1 plants are easy to calculate and to forecast. Brattle opines that the DCF
method has become a standard practice for valuing investments in power plants.” In
this case, they say, it allows for the most accurate modelling of the impact of the
enactment of the Measures at Issue on the plants’ cash flows:71°

“DCF analyses have become the primary valuation tool due to the reliability of
projecting future cash flows. Power stations have a relatively simple business,
producing electricity, whose demand and long-run value can be analyzed and
modeled in detail based on readily available data. Moreover, the costs and
operating performance of power stations are easy to predict. The relative ease in
predicting cash flows exists even for power plants not yet or recently completed
and without a significant history of operating performance. In such circumstances,
the cash flow forecasts can rely on well-established technical design
parameters.””""

Claimants and Brattle also submit that the DCF method has become a standard tool
used in international commercial arbitration to value the impact of international law
breaches on the value of a going concern.”'? This is so, they say, due to the accuracy
with which a DCF method can identify and isolate the economic impact of a specific
breach on the business's free cash flows — and hence the amount of the financial losses
caused by that breach.

Replying to the critique levelled against the DCF method by Respondent, the Brattle
experts state that the plants at issue present an operational track record of sufficient
duration (three (3) years of operation when the Claimants’ quantum report was filed and
five (5) years by the time of the hearing) to allow for the construction reliable forecasts.”">
Claimants’ quantum experts further opine that any uncertainty regarding the forecasts
inherent in a DCF approach can be — and is in fact — reflected and accounted for by the
application of appropriate discount factors.’'4 As regards what Respondent contends
are the overstated results yielded by Brattle’s calculations, Brattle acknowledges the
implied 76% premium between the book value and the market value of the investment
in the “but for’ scenario:’'® this premium is normal, it says, given the favourable

resolution of the construction risk and the decrease in interest rates that rendered the
remuneration provided for in the Original Regulatory Framework all the more valuable
after 2012.7" The same can be said for the internal rate of return (IRR) of 36.7 % implied
in the Brattle DCF model, which is admittedly higher than the Claimants’ expected return
(15.5 %) but is nonetheless reasonable given the favourable resolution of the
construction risk and the low rates of return at the evaluation date.”

Respondent — As a matter of principle, Respondent argues, in reliance upon the opinion
of its quantum experts, Accuracy Asesores de Empresa S.A.U. (“Accuracy”), that the
damages claimed by Claimants are so speculative as to be incapable of evaluation, and
still less of a DCF evaluation. Respondent submits that the plants at issue did not benefit
from a guaranteed income stream, nor were the specific values that formed part of the
remuneration scheme established in RD 661/2007 “frozen”. In Respondent's view, this
renders useless any model based on a “but for’ scenario constructed in reliance on
those values.7"®

Respondent also claims that the DCF method is ill-adapted to the specificities of the
present case: as demonstrated by Accuracy, CSP technology is too immature and the
track-record of the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants too short to allow for a reliable DCF
assessment.’!°

Respondent and its experts also state that Brattle’s DCF calculation is speculative and
unreliable, as demonstrated by the fact that it yields so-called damages that grossly
exceed both the plants’ net worth as reflected in their book value and the Claimants’
actual investment expectations. Accuracy points out that the “but for’ scenario in
Brattle’s DCF analysis results in an implicit book-to-market ratio of 76 %, which means
that Brattle’s assessment is 76 % higher than the book value declared in the plants’
financial statements.’2° Similarly, Accuracy points out that Brattle’s “but for’ scenario
discloses an implicit IRR of 36.7 %, which is more than double the Claimants’ expected
return on investment. 721

Respondent also argues that the result of the DCF assessment is tributary to
“macroeconomic conditions, which are not related to the Disputed Measures.”’?
Respondent cites a variation of €26 million in the quantum when shifting the date of
valuation from December 2012 (as proposed by Respondent) to June 2014 (as
proposed by Claimant), presuming all other assumptions and variables remain
unchanged.723

Respondent proposes instead the RAB method, which evaluates the underlying assets
based on the costs of construction of the plants plus a reasonable return that may accrue
to investors from the remuneration flowing to the plants.’4 According to Respondent,
this method allows the Tribunal to assess the plants’ fair market value before and after
the enactment of the Measures at Issue. Respondent argues that since the Measures
at Issue did not alter the underlying value of the assets, and since the remuneration
received by the plants covers the construction costs and provides investors with a
“reasonable” return, Claimants’ investments did not suffer any legally cognisable harm:

“538. Given that the current Spanish regulation specifically offers a reasonable
return on the capital invested, the FMV of a typical facility has not been altered
and therefore, there cannot be any claimable financial impact.””*5

[Emphasis added]
b) Relevant arbitral authorities

Eiser — \n Eiser,”° the Tribunal was similarly asked to choose between the DCF
approach proposed by the claimant and the RAB approach proposed by the respondent.
The tribunal opted for the DCF approach presented by claimants’ experts (also Brattle
in that case). The Eiser tribunal invoked arbitral practice and what it considered a
consistent application of the DCF model in international investment cases to value the
adverse impact of government action on a business operating as a going concern.’2”
The tribunal dismissed the concerns raised by Spain and its experts regarding the
alleged unreliability of the DCF model arising from disputed economic assumptions,
among other factors.” The tribunal acknowledged that certain of the assumptions used
by Brattle to construct the DCF model differed from the tribunal's findings on liability.
The tribunal nonetheless found that the model provided “a reasoned and reasonable
indication of the losses incurred by Claimants (...)."”° [Emphasis added] The tribunal
compared the amount awarded as damages in reliance on that model (€128 million) with
the amount initially invested by claimants (€126 million), and found that the
commensurability between the two served as a “reality check’ confirming the
reasonability of the DCF method.7°°

Novenergia — As did the Eiser tribunal, the tribunal in Novenergia also accepted the
DCF assessment proposed by claimants and their experts (in that case, Compass
Lexecon). The Novenergia tribunal held that the DCF method is a preferred method of
valuation for “income-earning assets” and that it is consistently applied by arbitral
tribunals to assess the value of going concerns impaired by government regulations.”°'

The Novenergia tribunal also ruled that the DCF method is particularly well-suited for
assessing regulated businesses with an income stream that derives principally from a
legislative and regulatory remunerative framework.’*? As regards the details of the DCF
calculation, the Novenergia tribunal dismissed critiques similar to those levelled in the
present case by Accuracy against certain of the assumptions used in Brattle’s DCF
model, in particular pertaining to regulatory risk”? and the illiquidity discount.754

c) Discussion

After having considered the Parties’ submissions and evidence, including principally the
Brattle and Accuracy expert reports, the Tribunal is convinced that the DCF method is
the most appropriate method for calculating damages in this case.

It is axiomatic that no model or methodology for assessing damages can determine with
absolute precision the loss visited on an investor by a regulatory change, given the many
uncertainties and variables inherent in projecting revenues, costs and risk over time.
The method used must rather be reasonable in the light of all the circumstances; 7°5 and
where opposing methods are proposed, their respective merits are to be assessed on a
balance of probabilities.

In this context, the Tribunal considers that the DCF assessment proposed by Brattle —
and used by Accuracy to elaborate its own alternative DCF model- provides the most
reasonably certain method of calculating the damages suffered by Claimants as a result
of Respondent's breach of the ECT.

The Tribunal agrees with Brattle that the plants at issue have a sufficiently long track
record both to permit a reasonably certain forecast of their future revenues and costs,
and to identify with reasonable accuracy the uncertainties inherent in the approach and
the discount factors to be applied to the calculation in consequence. The Tribunal
considers that the DCF model is all the more appropriate in this case given that the
plants derive the largest portion of their revenues from a regulated remuneration regime,
the values of which are well-documented and easily accessible.”°° This bolsters the
reliability and accuracy of the calculations underlying both the “but for’ and “actual”
scenarios.

Much of Respondent's critique of Brattle’s DCF model concerns what are primarily
liability issues. In the Tribunal’s view, this critique is addressed — intentionally — by the
interactive features of the Joint Model requested by the Tribunal, which allows the
Tribunal in effect to model the “but for’ scenario based on its specific findings regarding
Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations and the alleged breaches thereof.

For example, the Tribunal has found that Respondent is correct that the Original
Regulatory Framework did not “freeze” the remuneration regime in effect at June 2011,

nor did Spain’s enactments or other conduct give rise to a legitimate expectation of such
a freeze. Rather, as the Tribunal has determined, the enactments, assurances and other
representations tendered by Spain to the CSP sector prior to Claimants’ investment
gave rise to the legitimate expectation that the Moron and Olivenza 1 plants would be
shielded from revisions to the regulated tariff, the pool price premium and the applicable
lower and upper limits of that regime. No such expectation arose, and so no breach of
the ECT could have occurred, with respect to the balance of the provisions that made
up the Original Regulatory Framework. As explained, thanks to the work of the Parties’
experts, the Joint Model permits the Tribunal to exclude those other factors from the
damages calculation.

Respondent correctly points out that Brattle’s initial DCF model is based on the
assumption of immutability of the entire Original Regulatory Framework. But this critique
is also moot, again thanks to the Joint Model, which allows the Tribunal to re-model the
“put for’ scenario so as to exclude from the damages calculation the tenets of the
Original Regulatory Framework in respect of which no legitimate expectation arose.

The Tribunal is equally receptive to Respondent's concern regarding the market-to-book
ratio and the IRR implicit in Brattle’s initial DCF model. However, the Tribunal is of the
view that this critique too becomes academic given the re-modelling of the DCF
assessment under the Joint Model, which, as explained below, reduces both the market-
to-book ratio and the IRR to levels that obviate Respondent's critique.

The Tribunal does not agree with Respondent's statement that the damages calculated
by the DCF model vary randomly depending on the macro-economic circumstances
prevailing on the two competing evaluation dates proposed by the Parties. The Tribunal
is of the view that this variability is not altogether removed from the breach. The valuation
date (and the interest rate prevailing then) is rather directly related to the breach since
it is a function of the moment or period at which the loss caused by the breach
crystallized. In turn, the market circumstances prevailing at the time of the breach or
thereafter, including the interest rate, are necessarily relevant to calculate the value of
the future cash flows that Claimants lost as a result of Respondent's breach. The fact
that those market conditions exposed Claimants to a more precarious position than
when they first invested is largely due to the timing of Respondent's breach.

Finally, the DCF model ultimately put forward by the Joint Model allows the Tribunal to
tailor its assessment not only to the specificities of the breach, but also to other related
factors, such as the impact of the breach on regulatory risk and the liquidity in Spain (to
name only a few). This feature, in conjunction with the benefit of the discount rate to
account for future uncertainties (discussed above), satisfies the Tribunal that despite the
inherent uncertainties associated with forecasting future losses, the result of the DCF
assessment jointly proposed by Brattle and Accuracy pursuant to the Joint Model
provides a reasonably certain calculation of Claimants’ damages.

To the contrary, the RAB method does not sufficiently engage with the precise impact
of the breach on Claimants’ investment, and more specifically on the free cash flows
accruing to Claimants over time. The effects of Respondent's breach were not primarily

Page 149

Case 1:20-cv-00817 Document 3-1 Filed 03/25/20 Page 152 of 169

wrought on the plants’ underlying assets, but rather on the stream of income accruing
to the plants and, by corollary, on the free cash flows available to Claimants. An asset-
based valuation seems therefore ill-adapted to the economic reality of this case.

543. Similarly, the pith of the breach here does not consist in a variation of the reasonable
rate of return, but rather in the frustration of Claimants’ legitimate expectation that the
Mor6n and Olivenza plants would be shielded from revisions of the regulated tariff, the
pool price premium and the applicable lower and upper values contained in RD
661/2007. A valuation that is premised principally on the “reasonable” rate of return
without regard to the actual remuneration impaired by the Measures at Issue seems
equally ill-adapted to the regulatory and legislative landscape in the present case,
especially given that the actual rate of return that Claimants receive under the new
remunerative regime is inferior to Respondent's “reasonable” return target.’5”

544. As aresult, in keeping with the decisions in Eiser and Novenergia, the Tribunal will apply
the DCF approach for assessing Claimants’ loss. This does not fully resolve the quantum
issue since — as mentioned above — the Parties’ positions vary significantly on the
assumptions underlying the two (2) competing DCF assessments presented
respectively by Brattle and Accuracy.

545. The Tribunal will therefore address the disagreement regarding the plants’ operational
lifetime (ili), before addressing the remainder of the assumptions in dispute (iv), the tax
“gross-up’ claim (v) and the question of interest (vi).

 

iii. Plants’ Operational Lifetime

546. The operational lifetime of the plants is important to compute the timespan for
remuneration under the Original Regulatory Framework in the “but for” scenario. As
mentioned above, the Original Regulatory Framework did not establish a specific term
or limit for remuneration under the “Special Regime” pursuant to the EPA 1997 and RD
661/2007. That term, however, was necessarily limited by the operational lifetime of a
given plant. That changed in 2014 with the enactment of MO IET/1045/2014, which
fixed the lifetime for which CSP plants could receive “specific remuneration” under the
EPA 2013 at twenty-five (25) years.7°°

a) The Parties’ Positions

547. Claimants — Claimants argue that the plants’ operational lifetime is 35 years, in reliance
on the opinion of Mr. Jose Mesa-Diaz of ATA Renewables (“ATA”), who is of the view
that the plants’ “technical lifetime” ranges between 30 and 40 years.”°° ATA’s opinion is
based on forecasts contained in relevant literature, on the expected lifespan of the main
equipment items making up the CSP plants at issue and on data from comparable CSP

plants, the so-called SEGS plants, which were built and began operating in California in
the late 1980s.74°

The literature on CSP plants published between 2005 and 2015 and reviewed by Mr.
Mesa-Diaz contains lifetime forecasts ranging between 20 to 50 years. Mr. Mesa-Diaz
is of the view that — as a general trend — the more recent forecasts opt for a longer
lifetime, closer to 50 than to 20 years.741

Mr. Mesa-Diaz opined that almost all the main components of a CSP plant — except for
the turbines — have a designed lifetime of 25 years or less but can operate for at least
30 years if properly maintained. In particular, the ATA experts opined that:

- The solar collector was designed to operate for a period of 20 years or more but
could operate for 25 to 30 years if adequately maintained;742

- As regards the synthetic oil, its lifetime is “more than 25 years”;”3

- The heat exchangers were designed to operate for a period of 25 years, “but
provided that the equipment is properly operated and maintained during the entire
lifetime, 40-50 years can be met’;’*

- The solar collector was designed to operate for 20-25 years, but can “reach 25-
30 years” with the recommended maintenance;74

- The safety valves were designed to operate for 10 years but could reach 15 years
if properly maintained.”

Finally, Mr. Mesa-Diaz cited the experience of the SEGS plants in California — which
have been operating for more than 25 years — as support for his opinion that the more
recent CSP plants’ operating lifetime should range between 30 and 40 years: “The
SEGS Plants provide a real life example of SCP PT plants that have lasted in excess of
25 years. Considering that these plants were the first ones to be built, it is reasonable to
expect that with technological improvements that have been introduced in newer plants,
these newer plants will have an even longer lifetime."”*”

Respondent — Respondent argues that the plants’ operational lifetime is 25 years, at
most, and relies on the opinion of its technical expert, Dr. Jorge Servert.”48

Mr. Servert’s report analyses the “technical useful life” of the CSP plants at issue, in
other words “the number of years the plant can be operated reliably without the need for
significant additional investment."”4°

Mr. Servert first argued — based on supporting documents and data from U.S.
government sources — that the SEGS plants required significant additional investment
after 25 years, which means that the track record of those plants shows that CSP plants’
“technical useful life’ does not exceed 25 years.7°°

Mr. Servert also argued that the literature produced by Mr. Mesa-Diaz is unreliable to
assess the technical useful life of the CSP plants since most of the forecasts it contains
are either unsupported by hard data or are related to the SEGS experience, which — in
Mr. Servert’s opinion — belies Claimants’ position.’51

Mr. Servert analysed the engineering, procurement and construction contracts and
opined that the following category of components making up the Moron and Olivenza 1
plants were designed and manufactured for the following lifetime:

- 20 to 25 years for the main equipment items constituting the solar field, except
for the thermal receivers (i.e. the tubes containing the oils that is heated by the
solar power), which have a lifetime of 12 years “if the thermal oil is properly
maintained’ ;7°2

- 25 years for the equipment constituting the steam generation system;’°° and
- 25 years for the power block.’54

Mr. Servert also analysed the operation and maintenance agreement for the Olivenza 1
plant. He opined that — since that agreement is for a period of 18 years, subject to further
five-year renewals — it is uncertain at best whether the plants will benefit from a reliable
maintenance necessary to meet the design specifications or even to exceed them.755

For all these reasons, Mr. Servert opined that there is simply no evidence to suggest
that the CSP plants at issue will exceed the lifetime for which they have been designed
—i.e. 25 years — without significant additional investments.75°

b) The Technical Experts’ Joint Statement and Testimony

558. On 12 April 2017, in conformity with Procedural Order No. 12, the Parties’ technical
experts filed a joint statement setting out the matters of agreement and disagreement
between them (the “Joint Statement”).

559. The experts declared themselves in agreement on the definition of the term “technical
useful lifetime of a plant’ as meaning “the number of years the plant can be operated
reliably without the need for significant additional investment.””*’ [Emphasis added]

560. The experts also declared themselves in agreement that the SEGS plants needed
“major reinvestment’ after 23 to 24 years (for SEGS I-II) and ‘reinvestment’ after 17 to
22 years (for SEGS III-IX).78°

561. Finally, the experts also agreed that, in the case of the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants, the
engineering, procurement and construction contractors were requested to build CSP
plants to last 25 years.

562. The experts disagreed however on: the relevance of some of the literature containing
forecasts regarding the operational period of CSP plants; the assessment of the
technical useful lifetime of the various equipment components of the CSP plants at
issue; and the details of the operations and maintenance contracts entered into by the
plants as well as their relevance for the assessment of the plants’ technical useful life.

563. At the hearing, both experts confirmed their agreement that their respective analyses
were focused on the “technical useful life’ of the plants, and that the plants had been
designed to operate for 25 years.’°° While Mr. Mesa-Diaz restated his opinion that the
plants would last longer than 25 years if properly maintained, he also conceded that the
plants “may” need significant additional investment to remain in operation beyond 25
years. 76°

since these authorities were not invoked or commented by any Party on the merits of the case, the Tribunal
has not considered them in the context of its analysis of the operational lifetime of the CSP plants nor indeed
in the context of any other substantive or jurisdictional issue determined in this award.

In Eiser, the claimants had argued that the CSP plants at issue had an operational
lifetime of 40 years, while the Respondent relied upon the opinion of their expert in that
case, also Mr. Servert, to argue in favour of a period of 25 years.” The tribunal first
ruled that the claimants had the burden of proving the facts upon which they founded
their request for compensation, including the purported operational lifetime of 40
years.’® The tribunal held that the documents adduced in evidence which contained a
reference to the plants’ lifetime were essentially limited to a due diligence report by
Garrigues Medioambiente (also filed in this case), which mentioned a 25-year operating
lifetime.”** The tribunal held that the opinion of the claimants’ technical expert,
supporting a 40-year lifetime was equivocal and preferred Mr. Servert's views.7®°

d) Discussion

As a prefatory remark, the Tribunal takes note of the technical experts’ agreement on
the object of their respective opinions, the technical useful lifetime of the plants, that is,
the number of years that the plants can operate without significant additional investment.
The Tribunal’s analysis will therefore be guided by the term “technical useful lifetime” as
it was understood and defined by the technical experts.

As was the Eiser tribunal, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimants bear the burden to
establish their claim regarding the plants’ lifetime; and the Tribunal is not convinced that
Claimants discharged their burden to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the Morén
and Olivenza 1 plants will operate for longer than 25 years without significant additional
investment.

The evidence is rather to the effect that most of the plants’ essential components were
designed to operate for no longer than 25 years, and that certain of those components
were designed to operate for no more than 10 to 12 years. Both experts confirmed this
in their testimony.76°

The Claimants presented insufficient evidence to prove that it is more likely than not that
the Morén and Olivenza 1 plants will be able to operate longer than the lifetime for which
they were designed.

First, the Tribunal is not convinced that the body of literature presented by Mr. Mesa-
Diaz is directly relevant to determine the lifetime of the plants at issue in this case. Those
sources contain forecasts over disparate periods, founded on various assumptions,
many of which are not directly relevant for the plants at issue in this case, and yielding
inconsistent conclusions.

Second, the Tribunal notes that the evidence presented by Claimants and Mr. Mesa-
Diaz regarding the SEGS plants does not seem to corroborate, at least not fully, the
Claimants’ position on the issue of the plants’ lifetime. The disagreement between the

experts regarding the technical useful lifetime of the SEGS plants was at least partially
resolved by the joint statement issued by Messrs. Mesa-Diaz and Mr. Servert on 4 April
2017, in which they both confirmed that the plants “SEGS /-/] needed major reinvestment
around year 23 and 24” and that the plants “SEGS III-IX needed reinvestment between
year 17-22 after commissioning but the amount and global scope is no [sic] known.”7°7
This confirms Mr. Servert’s opinion that the SEGS plants’ technical useful lifetime was
not greater than 25 years.

Finally, as regards the effects of a proper operation and maintenance on the plants’
lifetime, the Tribunal does not have to resolve the technical experts’ disagreement on
the adequacy of the service providers presently retained by the plants. It suffices to note
that Mr. Mesa-Diaz did not point to any evidence directly relevant to the plants at issue
in this case to support his opinion regarding the effects of operation and maintenance.
In fact, Mr. Mesa-Diaz candidly acknowledged that the Mordén and Olivenza 1 plants
“may’ need significant investments after their 25" year of operation.”

For all these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants did not discharge
their burden to prove that the plants at issue will operate for 35 years without significant
additional investment. The Tribunal therefore opts to switch the “Plant Lifetime” toggle
in the Joint Model to “25 Years.”

iv. Other DCF Assumptions

Date of valuation — As mentioned above, the date of valuation is important to determine
the moment in time when the value of the revenue stream lost by Claimants is calculated
based on the time value of money and the economic conditions prevailing at that time.

Respondent and its experts propose December 2012 but do not provide much in the
way of principled justification beyond arguing that the date of valuation should be the
first date of the plants’ service life (25 October 2012 for Morén, and 1 February 2013 for
Olivenza 1).76° Claimants propose June 2014, when the parameters of remuneration
applicable to CSP plants were finally established and when the breach of the ECT
crystallized. Claimants argue that this allows for a coherent evaluation, without the use
of hindsight or extrapolation which might otherwise be necessary if the December 2012
date were chosen.’”° Claimants submit that, under international law, either the date of
the breach or the date of the award may validly be chosen as the date of valuation.
Claimants argue that moving the date of valuation closer to the date of the award would
yield a higher figure of damages due to decreasing interest rates, and hence, the June
2014 date they propose is both conservative and reasonable.””!

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the valuation date may be either the date of the
breach or the date of the award. Respondent has shown no principled basis for pegging
the valuation date at December 2012. The abrogation of the pool price plus premium
remuneration option did not even come to pass until 2013 and — as the Brattle experts
correctly point out — the new remuneration standards did not come into effect until June
2014.77? The Tribunal is satisfied that the breach of the ECT crystallized in June 2014,
and that this is the appropriate moment at which to value Claimants’ losses.

Regulatory risk and illiquidity discount — The assumption regarding regulatory risk
determines whether the actual regulatory environment presents a higher risk of default
by Spain on its obligations than the one prevailing when the Claimants invested and
whether this justifies a higher discount rate in the “Actual” scenario. The Brattle experts
are of the opinion that it does. They say the regulatory reform significantly increased the
risk that Spain might default on its payment obligations to electricity generators, lowering
the regulatory risk rating from A+, when the Claimants invested, to BBB- after the
adoption of the Measures at Issue.’’° For their part, the Accuracy experts say that the
Measures at Issue eliminated the tariff deficit and actually created a more stable
environment for investors, such that the regulatory risk should be assessed at BBB- for
the “But for’ scenario and AA for the “Actual” scenario.’

The quantum experts offered similar opinions on the issue of the illiquidity discount. The
Brattle experts opined that the Claimants’ interests became more difficult to sell in the
aftermath of the Measures at Issue, which justifies an illiquidity discount of 12% in the
“But For’ scenario and 25% in the “Actual’ scenario. Respondent and its experts argue
that, to the contrary, the illiquidity discount should be 35% in the “But For’ scenario and
16.7% in the “Actuaf’ scenario.

The Tribunal favours the opinion offered by Brattle. Respondent's position on regulatory
risk and the illiquidity discount is based on the premise that the Measures at Issue
fostered a more propitious environment for investors in the energy sector, in particular
in the CSP sector. The Tribunal is not convinced that this is so. The Tribunal rather
agrees with Brattle that although the Measures at Issue may have reduced the Tariff
Deficit, they nonetheless introduced greater uncertainty into Spain’s energy market, as
demonstrated by the country’s reduced credit ratings and the widespread unfavourable
commentary in the aftermath of its adoption the Measures at Issue.’’> It is clear to the
Tribunal that the Original Regulatory Framework attracted significant investments in the
solar energy industry in Spain and that its dismantlement caused significant turmoil in
that industry and market. The Tribunal agrees that these measures served to increase,

not decrease, the risk associated with Spain’s regulatory environment and the
correlative risk of illiquidity for investors such as Claimants as at the valuation date.

580. In coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal has carefully reviewed the opinion and the
methodology of the Accuracy experts and of the Brattle experts. For example, as regards
the regulatory risk, both teams of experts rely on the same set of figures which show a
steep decline in energy market indicators (i.e. the credit ratings of securitized collection
rights associated with the Tariff Deficit) as of December 2012 (from a rating of AAA down
to a rating of about A- to BBB+) and a slow recovery as of the late fall of 2013 (from lows
of A- to BBB+ up to A to A+).77°

581. Accuracy proposes a higher regulatory risk in the “Actual scenario (BBB) and a lower
regulatory risk in the “But For’ scenario (AA). Accuracy says the decline in the market
indicators is owed largely to the rising concern regarding the high levels of the Tariff
Deficit in 2011-2012 and that this concern was assuaged as of the late fall 2013, when
the Measures at Issue were fleshed out by the Spanish Government.’”” Accuracy is of
the view that — by curbing the Tariff Deficit — the Measures at Issue created a more
stable environment for investors in Spain’s energy sector.’”® Accuracy even suggests
that this view is shared by the Brattle experts, who ostensibly acknowledged the upsurge
in the market indicators as of late 2013 when the change of regulatory regime was in full
swing.””°

582. The Tribunal does not agree with the Accuracy experts. First, it is true that the Brattle
experts acknowledged the upsurge in the credit ratings in late 2013, but they cautioned
nonetheless that the market ratings “remain well below the levels at the time of issue [of
the securities surveyed], reflecting continued investor concerns with regulatory risk.”7®°
The Tribunal agrees with this latter assessment. Most importantly, the Tribunal agrees
with Brattle’s assessment that Accuracy’s opinion with respect to the salutary effect of
the Measures at Issue is based largely on data that succeeded the valuation date of
June 2014, and on projections into a temporal horizon well beyond that date.’°"

583. The majority of the Tribunal cannot accept to rely on such projections. ’® First, there is
no meaningful data entered in the evidence regarding the state of Spain’s energy market

782 Contrary to the majority of the Tribunal, Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy does not agree with the Brattle
experts on the issue of Regulatory risk and illiquidity discount; this is far for being a secondary issue, as
accepting Accuracy’s opinion instead of the Brattle’s one would have reduced the compensation to Claimants
from approximately €26,4 million to approximately €4.5 million. According to Professor Dupuy, attention is
indeed to be attributed to the opinion of two independent major credit rating agencies, Fitch and Moody's, on
the effective impact of the Measures at Issue on the tariff's deficit and more generally on the Spanish economy.
Accuracy Q-ER-1, at para. 623, it is in particular (and in Prof. Dupuy’s view) clearly shown that the credit
rating downgrade of the Spanish Tariff Deficit by Moody's in April 2013 was not caused by an increase in
regulatory risk, but, on the contrary, as established by Moody's itself, was due to the fear that the Measures
would not be sufficient to end the tariff deficits. As rightly pointed out by Accuracy in the same Report, “in April

beyond 2016. Even if such data were available, the Tribunal would be inclined not to
rely on it, since doing so would presume a hindsight incompatible with the exercise to
be carried out under the DCF analysis, which, in essence, requires a valuation of
Claimants’ lost cash flows and discounting them back to the valuation date. The Tribunal
agrees with the Brattle experts that the credit ratings prevailing as at the valuation date
reflect sufficiently the forward-looking assessment at that date.’®° By factoring in the
analysis ratings issued after the valuation date and projecting continued improvement
into an uncertain future — even if such a projection were to be borne out by the actual
data, which is in any event unavailable after 2016 — the Accuracy experts introduce in
the analysis other market variables unrelated to the Disputed Measures that may have
contributed to the upsurge in the credit ratings.”*4 The Tribunal agrees with the Brattle
experts that this skews impermissibly the DCF analysis.

584. In any event, the Tribunal is reminded that Measures at Issue replaced a regime that
provided producers with a guaranteed pool-price-plus-premium remuneration with a one
which not only provides for a lesser remuneration, but which is also prone to ongoing
fluctuations, since it is revisable every three (3) to six (6) years.’® If only for this reasons,
the Tribunal cannot agree with Accuracy’s views on regulatory risk and illiquidity.

585. For all these reasons, the Tribunal will switch the toggles “Regulatory Risk Premium’
and “Liquidity Discount’ in the Joint Model to the values proposed by the Brattle experts.

586. Production Assumption — The Parties’ quantum experts disagree as to the proper
assumptions regarding the production of electricity by the plants at issue. Brattle
proposes the production assumption espoused by the Claimants prior to investing and
set out in the Claimants’ investment paper,’®° while Accuracy proposes the production

2013, uncertainty was, in effect, high, not because the Government had taken measures to reduce the tariff
deficit, but precisely because it had not yet taken them and the unsustainable position of the Tariff Deficit,
which continued to grow, demanded clear, convincing measures for investors”. As a matter of fact, once the
last Measures were approved, the rating rose once more. Brattle itself recognizes it at para. 116 of its Report
on Financial Damage to InfraRed (CER-2) when saying: “Ratings for FADE and the Private Tariff Deficit
Securities have since stabilized and recovered by one notch since the end of 2013’. This recognition by Brattle
goes clearly against its own specific assumption according to which the absence of Measures would
necessarily result in better solvency. In its second special Report (Electric shock Il: Iberian Tariff Deficit
Analysis — Fitch Ratings 25 September 2015), Fitch explains that the Measures have indeed reduced the
deficit and brought the system to its sustainability level as illustrated by two graphics reproduced in the above-
mentioned Accuracy Q-ER-1 at para. 627 (Figure 6.7) and para. 628 (Figure 6.8). This again clearly
contradicts the opinion offered by Brattle according to which the regulatory reform significantly increased the
risk that Spain might default on its payment obligations. Contrary to the majority of the Tribunal, Professor
Dupuy does believe that the Measures at Issue fostered a more propitious environment for investors in the
energy sector, as further demonstrated by the actual evolution of the Spanish energy market, an evolution
which was already more than evident at the time of the valuation date selected by Claimant himself and
accepted by the Tribunal, i.e. June 2014. In order to get as much as possible a comprehensive perception of
the economic situation which prevailed at that time, the dissenting arbitrator finds it appropriate, as Accuracy
did, to reasonably introduce in the analysis variables not strictly related to the Disputed Measures, an approach
which is in no way incompatible with the DCF method.

assumption used by the financial institutions when they decided to lend.’8” Accuracy
notes that the financial institutions financed 70% of the construction cost of the plants,
and in its opinion, “the expectation of whoever invests less than the bank should be no
different.’”®° The Tribunal agrees with the Accuracy experts that it is more reasonable
to consider the assumptions actually used by the financial institutions when they decided
to lend, rather than using Claimants’ production assumption, which was approximately
15% higher than that of the banks.76° For these reasons, the Tribunal will switch the
“Production” toggle in the Joint Model to the value “Bank Case.”

. Share Dilution — Claimants argue that the dilution of their equity interest (from 16% to

14.8% at Moron and 14.17% at Olivenza 1) was directly caused by the Measures at
Issue, which reduced the plants’ cash flows and prevented them from meeting the ratios
stipulated in the agreements with the project lenders. This triggered the project lenders’
rights to withhold the cancellation of the shareholder guarantees at Morén and to
withhold the payment of the last tranche of the project finance loan at Olivenza 1. In turn,
this compelled the shareholders to inject additional funds in the plants, among others,
to allow the plants to pay the constructors. Claimants elected not to participate in the
issuance of new shares, invoking a waiver right that entitled them to sit out this equity
injection under a side letter entered into with the other shareholders when they initially
invested. Claimants and the Brattle experts defended this decision as a mitigation
measure. They say it allowed Claimants to avoid much greater loss given the
devaluation of the Morén and Olivenza 1 equity as a result of the Measures at Issue. As
a result, Brattle opined that the dilution of Claimants’ equity should be included in the
“Actual” scenario but not in the “But for’ scenario.

Respondent argues that Claimants are not entitled to claim damages resulting from the
dilution of shares given the absence of a causal link between the Measures at Issue and
the Claimants’ decision to sit out the issuance of additional shares. Respondent says
the dilution was caused not by the Measures at Issue, but rather by the web of private
agreements entered into between the various intervenors in the plants, construction
projects and equity financing.’°° To recover the amounts lost as a result of the equity
dilution, Respondent says that “/nfraRed should have demonstrated that diluting
themselves was the best option available among than other alternatives.”’"' In the
circumstances, the Accuracy experts opine that the share dilution should be included in
the “But for’ and in the “Actual” scenario.

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants and their experts that the Measures at Issue
triggered the project lenders’ rights and compelled additional injection of funds by the
shareholders. The Tribunal further agrees that this forced Claimants to choose between
an immediate additional investment and a dilution of their shares. As far as avoiding loss

altogether, this was a false choice. The Tribunal is convinced by Brattle’s well explained
and documented analysis to the effect that — in the circumstances that prevailed in early-
to-mid 2013 — any course of action other than a resigned acceptance of Claimants’
equity dilution would have exposed InfraRed to significant additional losses.’ In the
circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants were compelled to accept the
dilution and that their decision to do so was a reasonable (arguably the only reasonable)
decision. This outcome would have been avoided but for the enactment of the Measures
at Issue. The Tribunal is therefore inclined to switch the toggle “InfraRed Share Dilution
also in But For” to the value “No.”

Management costs — The Parties’ experts disagree on the calculation of the reduction,
if any, of Claimants’ equity interest in the plants corresponding to the proportion of the
management costs Claimants must shoulder. Brattle estimates a fixed amount, while
Accuracy opines that management costs should rather be calculated as a percentage
of the investment value.

The Tribunal notes that the documents cited in support of Brattle’s first expert report on
quantum refer to management fees as a percentage (generally 1% of portfolio or net
asset value).”°° Counsel for Respondent argued the same calculation of management
costs as a proportion of net asset value should also apply in the DCF model.794

This said, the Brattle experts have stated on at least two occasions that, in their opinion,
the management costs have no bearing on quantum, since Brattle’s DCF analysis
presumes that management costs remained unchanged after the enactment of the
Measures at Issue.’ Claimants argue that this is a generous assessment for
Respondent since the witness testimony shows that management costs in fact increased
as a result of the enactment of the Measures at issue.’

Switching the Joint Model’s “toggle” for management costs to the values proposed by
Accuracy reduces the total amount of Claimants’ damages by €2.5 million (all else
remaining constant). The Brattle experts argue’®” — and their counterparts at Accuracy
do not deny”®* — that this is because Accuracy’s alternative DCF analysis assumes that
management costs dropped as a result of the enactment of the Measures at Issue.
Claimants say no evidence whatsoever was adduced to support such an assumption,
and that the opposite is in fact true. Claimants say Brattle’s position on the issue of
management costs should therefore prevail.’°°

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants and will therefore switch the “Management Costs”
toggle in the Joint Model to the value “Brattle.”

Value of debt — The Accuracy experts opine that the book value of the plants’ debt
should be considered in the DCF assessment, while the Brattle experts opine in favour
of accounting for the market value of the debt. Neither Respondent nor its experts have
provided the Tribunal with a principled justification for their position, beyond stating that
the impact of using the book value of the debt is important.®°° Claimants’ experts, on the
other hand, explain that a “focus on market value is appropriate because of the potential
for the Disputed Measures to impair the value of debt.”®°' The Tribunal agrees and will
therefore switch the toggle “Use Debt Face Value or Estimated Market Value” in the
Joint Model to “Estimated Market Value.”

v. The Tax “Gross-Up” Claim

Claimants request that the amount of damages awarded by the Tribunal be
supplemented by an amount sufficient to offset any taxes that may be assessed by the
United Kingdom on the total amount awarded (the tax “gross-up” claim).®°? Claimants
argue that a tax “gross-up” is required to give full effect to the principle of full
compensation.®? Respondent counters with a battery of substantive arguments,
including a purported inability to bring a tax “gross-up” claim under the ECT, the
purported existence of a tax exemption in the United Kingdom, etc. °°

As was the case in Eiser,8 the Tribunal considers that it does not need to delve into
Respondent's counterarguments find that Claimants’ tax “gross-up” claim fails on its
face. Claimants have not adduced any evidence whatsoever of the taxation regime to
which they are subject in the United Kingdom, or of the tax liability, if any, that they might
incur as a result of a favourable award in this arbitration, or of need for a “gross-up” to
offset such liability. Indeed, their experts specifically noted: “We have not analysed the
tax consequences of an award to the aggrieved party and whether a tax gross-up on
damages would be needed to place the aggrieved party in the same financial position
as it would have otherwise enjoyed.’®°

In the circumstances, given the absence of evidence, the Tribunal is of the view that
Claimants have not discharged their burden to prove the facts supporting their tax
“gross-up” claim, which must therefore fail.

vi. Conclusion on quantum

Applying the decisions above and switching the “toggles” in the experts’ Joint Model as
described, the total amount of damages for which respondent is liable to Claimants
equals €28.2 million plus interest.

The Tribunal observes that this sum, calculated as described above, is roughly
commensurate with the €31 million invested by the Claimants. As did the tribunal in
Eiser,®°’ this Tribunal considers that this contextualisation serves as a form of “reality
check" regarding the reasonableness of the compensation awarded to Claimants in the
circumstances of the case.

vii. Interest

Claimants seek pre-award interest at the rate of Spain’s ten-year bonds (2%, as
assessed by Brattle).°°° Claimants are also seeking post-award interest at the rate of
Spain's ten-year bonds (2%) plus a “punitive or moratorium component’®® in the form
of a “moratorium differential of an [additional] 2%,"°'° which should, according to
Claimants’ counsel, incentivize a prompt voluntary execution of the award.®"'

Respondent agrees that both pre and post-award interest is due (in the hypothesis that
Claimants prevail on the merits) but disagrees with the rates proposed by Claimants.
Spain argues that pre-award interest should rather be fixed at the rate of Spain’s two or
three-year bonds (0.6% or 0.9%).°'2 Respondent also opposes the ‘punitive or
moratorium” component of the post-award interest sought by Claimants. It argues that
the purpose of post-award interest is purely compensatory and the punitive component
sought by Claimants has no demonstrable basis in law.°*$

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the purpose of awarding interest is not to
punish any party. There should not, in the Tribunal’s view, be any punitive or moratorium
component to the award of interest. As regards the rate of pre-award and post-award
interest, the Tribunal first notes that almost five (5) years elapsed between the
enactment of the first Measure at Issue (December 2012) and the completion of the
post-hearing submissions (December 2017, when the Parties filed their submissions on
the quantum experts’ joint model).°'4 The Tribunal also notes that Respondent has
acknowledged, in this arbitration, that it applied for the annulment of a recent award
rendered against it for having violated the ECT rights of other investors in Spain’s solar

industry®'S and that it sought remedy in the nature of rectification and clarification against
another recent award.®16

604. Given the foregoing, the Tribunal is of the view that the rate proposed by Respondent
for both pre-award and post-award interest is insufficient to compensate Claimants. The
Tribunal also notes that the rate proposed by Claimants (leaving aside the punitive or
moratorium component) would result in interest at the rate of 2% both pre and post-
award, which is less than the “LIBOR +2%” rate that is commonly used in international
arbitration.

605. For all these reasons, the Tribunal is inclined to award Claimants a pre-award and post-
award rate of interest of 2%.

viii. Costs

606. Claimants request an award saddling Respondent with 100% of the costs of the
arbitration including Claimants’ legal costs, which in turn include Claimants’ attorneys’
fees, expert fees and legal expenses. These costs add up to the following amounts
(reflecting the various currencies in which they were incurred): €4,949,247.57;
US$717,362.55; and GB£106,182.31.°"7

607. Claimants invoke the principles “costs follow the event’ and restitutio ad integrum to
claim the entirety of their legal costs even though not all the damages they sought will
have been awarded.®"® In any event, Claimants seek all legal costs associated with the
debate on the preliminary objections. Claimants say Respondent presented but
subsequently withdrew several preliminary objections which forced Claimants to incur
needless costs.

608. Respondent requests the Tribunal to order Claimant to bear all the costs of the
arbitration as well as the Respondent's legal costs (in the amount of €1,704,438.11).°"9
Respondent cites no legal basis for claiming its legal costs in a context in which
Claimants prevailed (at least partially) on the merits.

609. In response to Claimants’ claim for costs, Respondent argues that a portion of
Claimants’ legal costs were not demonstrably incurred in the context of this proceeding.
Further to the exchange of submissions on costs, Claimants withdrew certain of the
claims contested by Respondent.®° The only portion of Claimants’ legal costs that

remains in dispute (as to whether or not they were incurred in the context of this
arbitration) are professional fees Claimants paid to the Allen & Overy lawyers (£93,302),
who had advised Claimants prior to the commencement of the arbitration proceedings
but were otherwise not involved in the arbitration.®2'

Besides this specific contestation, Respondent also contests the reasonability of
Claimants’ attorneys’ fees more generally, including the total amount of hours
purportedly worked by Claimants’ attorneys (11,200) and the average hourly rate (€374)
they charged.®2

Claimants retort that the ECT required a mandatory cooling-off period before instituting
proceedings and that the Allen & Overy lawyers were involved in negotiations with Spain
during that period. As regards the reasonability of their attorneys’ fees, Claimants plead
that their lawyers’ hourly average hourly rate is commensurate to that charged by other
similar firms within the same market segment® and that the overall number of hours
worked on the case is reasonable given its length (four years and 8 months), its relative
complexity and the number of lawyers involved.®4

Despite the above-mentioned divergences, both Parties agree that the Tribunal has a
wide degree of discretion in issuing a costs award.®?5

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with
the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the
facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration,
including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

The arbitration costs, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal’s
Assistant, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US$):

Claimants as “Other Experts’ Fees and Expenses,” the Claimants withdrew their claim for those amounts. See

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal
parts.®26

Having considered the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimants are
entitled to an award of a reasonable portion of the costs they incurred in this arbitration,
among others because they have prevailed on both jurisdiction and liability, i.e. in
proving that Respondent violated the ECT.

The Tribunal does not find compelling Respondent's contestation of Allen & Overy’s
fees, nor Respondent's contestation of the overall “reasonability’ of Claimants’ fees.
While the attorneys’ fees incurred by Claimants are far greater than those incurred by
Respondent, these fees are commensurate with those of other firms in the same market
segment and with those of other investors who prevailed in similar arbitrations.

The Tribunal is sensitive to Claimants’ argument about the Respondent's untimely
withdrawal of several preliminary objections that it had asserted, thus forcing Claimants
to incur needless legal fees. The Tribunal is equally sensitive to the fact that Claimants
did not prevail on all the issues they brought before this Tribunal. In particular, even
though Claimants succeeded in proving a violation of the ECT, the damages awarded
(€28.2 million) are far less than the damages claimed (€75.7 million).

For all those reasons, the Tribunal is inclined to order Respondent to bear all of the
arbitration costs plus two thirds (66.66%) of Claimants’ legal costs in the amounts set
out above.

826 ICSID will provide a detailed final statement of the case account to the Parties. The remaining balance will
be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.
