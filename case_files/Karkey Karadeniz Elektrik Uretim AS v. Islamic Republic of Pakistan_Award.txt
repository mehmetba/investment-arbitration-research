On 16 October 2013, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional
Measures (“Decision on Provisional Measures”). The Tribunal’s Decision states at paragraph

187:

1. The State of Pakistan shall take all steps necessary to allow the
vessel, Karadeniz Powership Kaya Bey (‘the vessel’), to depart into
international waters and reach, before 1 November 2013, the dry
dock in Dubai for inspection and repairs as determined by the
Bureau Veritas (or other equivalent agency) to maintain the vessel’s
flag-registry and class certification.

N

To that effect, the State of Pakistan shall, in particular:

a. Cause Lakhra Power Generation Company Limited to take all
steps necessary to obtain the temporary suspension of the order
of the High Court of Sindh at Karachi dated 29 of May 2013 in
the Admiralty Suit No. 07 of 2013, which arrested the vessel, as
long as the Arbitral Tribunal shall not have informed the State of
Pakistan that the suspension is no longer necessary for the
purposes of enabling the vessel to obtain the vessel's flag-registry
and class certification.

=

Grant the Claimant all authorizations and clearance required for
the vessel’s departure including:

i. Clearance Certificates from Pakistan Customs;

ii. Clearance of crew members of the vessel by the immigration

authorities at Port Qasim;

Clearance from NAB, to be forwarded to all relevant

authorities, including the Pakistan Maritime Security

Agency, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Ports and Shipping,

Ministry of Water and Power and others necessary under the

law and procedure of Pakistan; and

iv. Clearance and facilitation from Lakhra, as Lakhra is the
‘importer for record’ in terms of the Amended Contract.

ii.

c. Take any other action necessary or required to allow the vessel
to depart lawfitlly into international waters.

w

Claimant shall proceed diligently and as rapidly as reasonably
possible to obtain the necessary certificates referred to, as stated
above.

x

Claimant shall: (i) inform the Tribunal of the date of departure of the
vessel from Pakistan, its date of arrival in Dubai, and (ii) keep the

vessel to safe anchorage in Karachi.

6. All other requests not granted herein are dismissed.

7. The Tribunal will decide on the costs related to the Request at a later
stage of the arbitral proceedings.>
Between 30 October and 9 December 2013, the Parties exchanged correspondence regarding the
Respondent’s failure to implement the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures. On 25
November 2013, the Tribunal noted that the Respondent had not complied with its Decision on
Provisional Measures and explained that, “wnless it is immediately complied with, the Tribunal
[would] draw all the consequences of that breach under International law.” On 11 December

2013, the Tribunal sent a further letter to the Parties to the same effect.

On 14 May 2014, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Sindh High Court had ordered
the release of the Karadeniz Powership Kaya Bey (“Kaya Bey”). The Claimant confirmed on 29
May 2014 that the Kaya Bey had arrived in Dubai on 21 May 2014 and that the dry-dock

inspection would begin on 2 June 2014.

On 8 July 2014, the Claimant submitted an application to modify the Decision on Provisional
Measures of 16 October 2013, together with Exhibits C-405 to C-411. In the application, the
Claimant requested that the Tribunal modify the Decision on Provisional Measures to provide
that the Kaya Bey “need not return to Pakistan once inspection and repairs in Dubai are

complete.”

By letter of 25 July 2014, the Respondent filed its response to the Claimant’s application to
modify the Decision on Provisional Measures, and stated that it neither consented to nor opposed

the application for the permanent release of the Kaya Bey.

On 1 August 2014, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 4, which: (i) modified the
Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures such that the return of the Kaya Bey was no longer
mandatory; (ii) permitted the Claimant the opportunity to modify its Memorial on Jurisdiction
and the Merits of 13 January 2014 in order to take into account the permanent release of the Kaya

Bey; and (iii) confirmed that the Respondent would have an opportunity to inspect the Kaya Bey

representing the Respondent.

On 26 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the confidentiality

On 28 February 2014, counsel for the Respondent notified the Tribunal that it had two more

In late 2007 and early 2008, Karkey began developing powership fleets for rental power projects.
Karkey developed its powership fleet in two phases. It began construction and engineering work

on the Phase I Powership in early 2008. The Phase I Powerships are:

i. Karadeniz Powership Dogan Bey (the “Dogan Bey” or “KPS 3”), which is a self-
propelled Powership of handymax size (188 meters long and 37 meters wide),
housing 12 installed medium speed diesel engines, with a combined power

generation capacity of 126 MW;

. Karadeniz Powership Rauf Bey (the “Rauf Bey” or “KPS 4”), a self-propelled
Powership of panamax size (242 meters long and 32 meters wide), housing 15
installed medium speed diesel engines, with a combined power generation capacity

of 179 WM;

iii.

Karadeniz Powership Kaya Bey (the “Kaya Bey” or “KPS 5”), a self-propelled
Powership of panamax size (242 meters long and 32 meters wide), housing 19
installed medium speed diesel engines, with a combined power generation capacity
of more than 216 MW.

iv. Karadeniz Powership Alican Bey (the “Alican Bey” or “KPS 1”), a non-self-
propelled power barge, 91 meters long and 30 meters wide, housing 10 installed
medium speed diesel engines, with a combined power generation capacity of more

than 104 Mw."?

In order to implement its Phase II plan, Karkey acquired five additional ship hulls in 2010 and
2011. In October 2011, Karkey deployed the first of its Phase II Powerships, the Karadeniz
Powership Irem Sultan (“Irem Sultan” or “KPS 6”) a self-propelled ship housing six installed

medium speed diesel engines, with a combined power generation capacity of 108.6 MW.'*

Karkey was not able to deploy the second of its Phase II Powerships until February 2013 — the
Karadeniz Powership Fatmagiil Sultan (“Fatmagiil Sultan” or “KPS 9”), a large power barge

housing, with a combined power generation capacity of 203 MW.
Karkey deployed the third of its Phase II Powerships, the Karadeniz Powership Orhan Bey

(“Orhan Bey” or “KPS 7”), in September 2013. The Orhan Bey has the same design as the

Fatmagiil Sultan and has a power generation capacity of only approximately 135 MW. Karkey
has four other Phase II Powerships (KPS 10, KPS 11, KPS 12, and KPS 2), the construction of

which was delayed.

In May 2009, the Private Power and Infrastructure Board of Pakistan (“PPIB”) published an
Invitation for Bids for 1,200 MW fast-track private power projects in local and international
newspapers (the “Invitation for Bids”).'> An Information Brochure was also released onto the
PPIB website and made available at Government offices.'° The Invitation for Bids comprised

two packages, i.e. Package A and Package B.

Parties that were interested in submitting a bid were required to pay US$100 to register as a bidder
for each package and US$2,000 to purchase a Request for Proposal (a “RFP”) for each project.!”
In total, 42 RFPs were issued to prospective bidders — 29 RFPs for Package A and 13 RFPs for
Package B.'*

The RFP for Package B is a lengthy document containing information for bidders, including, inter

alia:
i. An “important notice” regarding the need for bidders’ own due diligence
(Disclaimers);
ii. The basis on which bids would be “rejected” and the requirements for them to be
considered “responsive”;
iii. Instructions to bidders; and
iv. A number of exhibits, including a pro forma letter of award and a draft rental services
contract (a “Draft RSC”).!?

By letter of 4 June 2008, Karkey wrote to PPIB expressing its intention to register as a Package
B bidder.” According to the Claimant, Mr. Raja Babar Ali Zulqarnain was engaged as Karkey’s

local representative in Pakistan shortly thereafter.

On 12 June 2008, the Ministry of Water and Power (the “MoWP”) published a corrigendum to
the Invitation Bids in local and international newspapers. The corrigendum increased the
generation capacity that was solicited for bidding for Package B Projects from 200 MW to 500
Mw.2!

On 14 July 2008, Karkey submitted its bid to PPIB (“Bid”).”? Karkey represented in Proforma X
of its Bid documents that commercial operations could be achieved 180 days (six months) from

issuance of the letter of award (the “Project Schedule”):?>

Other details were also provided including information on the design basis, diesel engine
generator, cooling water system, steam generation system, fuel oil system, instrumentation and

controls and substructures (i.e. the barges themselves) of the “Barge Facility”.

On 27 August 2008, Karkey confirmed in writing to the Managing Director of PPIB (Mr. Fayyaz
Elahi) that: “/a/s it stands today, we are ready to launch the project as we have already made

the necessary investments so that we can meet the Proposed Project Schedule”2>

On 28 August 2008, the Committee constituted by the Cabinet to address all matters relating to
the Package A and B fast-track power generation projects met (the “Committee”). That meeting
was attended by (among others) Mr. Ashraf and Mr. Qureshi (from the MoWP), and Mr. Elahi
(Managing Director of the PPIB), who confirmed to the Committee that the two Package B
bidders who were declared responsive — i.e. Walters and Karkey — could meet the Target COD

“of February 2009”.*6

On 10 September 2008, the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet of Pakistan (“ECC”)

approved Karkey and Walters as qualified to receive a letter of award.’

Two days after the ECC approval, Mr. Fayyaz Elahi (PPIB) confirmed to Karkey that its bid to
set up a barge-mounted rental power project near Karachi had been approved “as per [the]
following details”, including that the Site would be Karachi and that “Commercial Operation

Date from issuance of LOA” would be 180 days as promised in Karkey’s Bid.?*
On 7 November 2008, the Letter of Award (““LoA”) was issued to Karkey.”?

In November 2008, the Legal Division of the PPIB noted in an inter-office memorandum sent to
Mr. Zuberi of the PPIB that Karkey and Walters “during negotiations proposed substantial
amendments and modifications to the standard terms and conditions of the Rental Services

Contract which are likely to affect the risk allocation between [the parties] and is deviation of

Rental Services Contract negotiated, agreed and executed in other rental power projects

undertaken by PEPCO.”*°

On 5 December 2008, Karkey signed a contract with Lakhra Power Generation Company Ltd.
(“Lakhra”) for the provision of 231.8 MW of barge-mounted rental power (“2008 RSC”).*! It is
undisputed that Lakhra was unable to secure a letter of credit as contemplated in the Draft RSC,
which prompted the Parties to revisit that provision. The Advance Payment was increased from
7% (as in the Draft RSC appended to the RFP) to 14.16% on 5 December 2008, immediately
before the signing of the 2008 RSC.*?

As summarized under Pakistan’s position below, Pakistan submits that the 2008 RSC was
procured in breach of Pakistani law. In a nutshell, the alleged breaches arose because of material
changes introduced to the contract after Karkey was issued with the Letter of Award, in alleged

breach of Rule 40 of Pakistan Public Procurement Rules (“PPRA Rules”).*

On 12 December 2008, Mr. Jamil (Lakhra) wrote to the General Manager of WAPDA Power
Privatisation Organization (“WPPO”) (copied to the Managing Directors of the Pakistan Electric
Power Company Limited (“PEPCO”) and the PPIB (Mr. Khan and Mr. Zuberi), amongst others),
setting out its concerns that the 2008 RSC had been signed with “material changes under the
instructions of Managing Director PEPCO”, which included the increase in the Advance

Payment, and requested the ECC approval.*4

On 18 December 2008, WPPO re-directed the enquiry to Mr. Zuberi (PPIB) and stated “Chief
Executive Office GENCO IV...requires ECC approval for the said changes in the Contract which
may please be obtained and conveyed to [the] concerned office [...]”*

The following day, Mr. Zuberi (PPIB) responded to WPPO that ECC approval was unnecessary
on the basis that the ECC had not approved the terms of the Draft RSC in the first place. Instead,

noted that “/Lakhra] may obtain approval from their own BOD for the changes to the draft RSC.

approval to the 2008 RSC subject to the concurrence of the Legal Advisor of PEPCO and
approval of PEPCO.**

On 23 April 2009, Lakhra and Karkey subsequently signed a new contract (“2009 RSC” or
“Contract’”) together with provision for a Sovereign Guarantee. The 2009 RSC replaced the 2008

RSC in its entirety, and provides, inter alia, that:

WHEREAS, the PARTIES entered into a Rental Services Contract on 5
December 2008, in terms whereof the BUYER [Lakhra] contracted with the
SELLER [Karkey] to provide Rental Services in relation to a 231.83MW

effect and no obligations or rights accrued to either PARTY there under.

The Advance Payment Guarantee:

Within 10 business days of the date of execution of the Sovereign Guarantee, Karkey
was to submit a bank guarantee to Lakhra, securing the payment of US$80 million
(14.16% of the Lump Sum Contract Price) (the “Advance Payment”) for
performance of Karkey’s obligations under the 2009 RSC (“Advance Payment

Guarantee”).

. The Advance Payment Guarantee — issued by Citibank N.A. (acting through its place

of business in Lahore) — was an on-demand guarantee for payment “not exceeding”

US$80 million, should Karkey default any of its obligations under the 2009 RSC.

on Lakhra’s behalf on 12 May 2009.45

104. On 24 July 2009, Mr. Ashraf (the MoWP Minister and Chairman of the PPIB) received a letter

from the Pakistan chapter of the international anti-corruption agency, Transparency International

105. In September 2009, the Pakistani parliamentarian, Mr. Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat, wrote
an open letter to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry
(“Chief Justice” or “Chief Justice Chaudhry”), stating that he “had raised the issue of corruption
in the award of RPPs before every forum, including the National Assembly of Pakistan, but his
voice was not attended to”."* Chief Justice Chaudhry opened a case the following day, 9
September 2009, directing Mr. Hayat to furnish evidence in support of his allegations of

Government corruption in connection with the RPPs.”?

106. On 26 September 2009, Mr. Hayat produced a nine-page letter highlighting a number of areas of
concern and making allegations that certain individuals involved in the RPP programme were
receiving “kick-backs”.*° On 7 October 2009, the Chief Justice ordered the Chairman of the Water

and Power Development Authority of Pakistan (“WAPDA”) to respond thereto.*!

107. In November 2009, WAPDA submitted comments on behalf of PEPCO and requested that the
Court dismiss the case.*? The Chief Justice decided to press forward, ordering that notices be
issued to various Ministries to appear and defend the Government’s rental power policy.
Exercising his prerogative as Chief Justice, Mr. Chaudhry constituted a bench of three Supreme
Court justices to hear the case, which he consolidated with another case, also styled as a “human

rights” case, relating to electricity prices (together, the “Rental Power Case”).**

petition on behalf of the executive branch of Pakistan.™4

On 25 November 2009, the Federal Bureau of Revenue (“FBR”) ordered the Lahore tax office to
refund Karkey the 6% withholding tax from the US$80 million Advance Payment which had

been deducted.**

On 8 December 2009 Lakhra and Karkey entered into Amendment No.1 to the 2009 RSC, which
recorded the substitution of the Project Site from Mauripur to Korangi and further extended the

deadline for the Target COD to 7 April 2010.°°

. On 2 January 2010, Karkey established a wholly-owned Pakistani subsidiary, Karpak (Pvt.) Ltd.

(“Karpak”), to handle activities related to the Powership project in Pakistan. With the express
prior consent of the PPIB. Karkey subsequently assigned to Karpak certain rights and obligations
under the Contract relating to operation and maintenance of the Powerships and fuel purchase

operations.*”

. In January 2010, the Asian Development Bank (“ADB”) published the findings of its independent

third-party audit of the RPP programme (“ADB Report”). The ADB Report concluded that there

had been “many inconsistencies’””* in the RPP contracts, noting that changes to the RFP had

“diluted the transparency, competition and equal treatment that an ICB [International

2959)

Competitive Bidding] process is intended to ensure”, and that a re-tendering “could have

resulted in better response and more competitive bids”.

On 30 January 2010, Transparency International wrote to Chief Justice Chaudhry, echoing the
concerns expressed by Mr. Hayat in September 2009 and enclosing one of its previous letters to
Mr. Ashraf. Transparency International urged Chief Justice Chaudhry to take suo motu notice
of the RPP case and “save the country from the biggest corruption fraud in the history of

Pakistan”.

There is no dispute that Karkey failed to achieve the Target COD of 7 April 2010.

. In September 2010, more than a year after the Supreme Court’s swo motu proceedings had

commenced, the Supreme Court ordered PEPCO to issue notice of the proceedings to the CEOs
of all the RPP sponsors. After receiving such a notice, Karkey entered an appearance through

counsel on 4 October 2010, as an interested non-party to the case.

. In December 2010, Mr. Brohi (Lakhra’s CEO) issued a work order to KEMA International B.V.

(“KEMA”), a Dutch company, as an independent engineer to certify the equipment and witness,
review and certify the results of the Operational Tests for the 231.8 MW Karkey Rental Power

Project, Korangi, Karachi.

The Equipment was assessed via KEMA’s site inspections of the Kaya Bey, the Alican Bey and
the work platform and fuel storage barge on 22 December 2010, 15 March 2011 and 8 April
2011.°°

. On 8 April 2011, KEMA issued the Certificate of Acceptance of the Equipment,’ and on 9 April

2011, it issued the Certificate of Guaranteed Electrical Output. The Reliability Run Test, which
was to demonstrate “uninterrupted reliable operation of the Equipment at the Guaranteed

that “the requirements of successful reliability run test were not met.” ”

On 12 April 2011, the Commercial Operation Achievement Certificate was issued by Lakhra,
notifying Karkey that COD would occur the following day, as follows:

Upon successful completion of the two hours operational test on 9" April
2011, in which Net Electrical output remained more than Guaranteed
Electrical output [231.8 MW], this is to certify that commercial operation of
231.8 MW Karkey Rental Power plant is achieved, as per provisions of

the ‘COMMERCIAL OPERATION ACHIEVMENT CERTIFICATE’.

Now it is notified that, as per clause 4.4 of RSC Commercial operation date
shall occur at 00:01 AM on 13" day of April 2011.”

. Following achievement of COD on 13 April 2011, Karkey wrote to Lakhra stating that pursuant

to Section 4.5(m) of the Contract, Lakhra had until 23 April 2011 to establish the Fuel Payment
Letter of Credit (“FPLC”), after which time Karkey would no longer continue financing fuel
purchases out of its own funds.”> Karkey reiterated this message on 21 April 2011, stating that it
would have to discontinue electricity generation if the FPLC was not established by 23 April,
and noting also that the Fuel Payment Invoices for January and February 2011 remained unpaid

and were overdue.”

By 23 April 2011, Lakhra had still not established the FPLC, and still not paid the outstanding

Fuel Payment Invoices. On 24 April 2011, Karkey ceased electricity generation.”>

On 6 May 2011, Karkey re-commenced power generation using Karkey’s own funds to purchase

fuel as an alleged gesture of goodwill and in hopes of saving the Project.”

On 8 February 2012, Karkey served on Lakhra a Final Notice of Default for failure to establish
the FPLC.”

On 30 March 2012, Karkey served Lakhra a “Notice of Termination effective immediately”
regarding the 2009 RSC. In such Notice, Karkey requested payment of the following amounts:”*

- US$161.856.018 as termination charges pursuant to Clause 4.6(d);

- US$12.000.000 as mobilization and transport charges to return the Equipment to
SELLER’s designated depot as per Clause 4.6(b); and of

- All receivables including but not limited all Monthly Rental Services Fees and all
Monthly Operation and Maintenance Services Fees and fuel invoices to date as per the

2009 RSC.

On the same date, after more than two years of proceedings, the Supreme Court rendered its
judgment in the Rental Power Case (“RPP Judgment”, “30 March 2012 Judgment” or
“Judgment’”), concluding that the RPP contracts of 2008 had been procured in breach of the
PPRA Rules. Accordingly, the Judgment declared void ab initio all RPP contracts (including the
2009 RSC), ordered that they be rescinded and ordered an investigation by the National
Accountability Bureau (“NAB”) into possible corruption by the RPP sponsors and by various
public officials.” It is undisputed that the Supreme Court made no explicit finding of corruption

anywhere in the Judgment, nor any specific finding of corruption against, or involving, Karkey.*°

Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s directions, the NAB began an inquiry into the RPP programme

immediately following the 30 March 2012 Judgment.

On 2 April 2012, on the basis of Section 23(1)*! of the National Accountability Ordinance

Agency (“PMSA”), that an investigation into Karkey had been launched under the NAO and that
Section 23(1) NAO was therefore operative.*? At the same time, certain individuals connected to
the RPP Programme (including Mr. Karadeniz) were placed on the Exit Control List (a list of

persons prohibited from departing from Pakistan),*? and Karkey’s bank accounts were frozen.*4

Between 30 March and 2 April 2012, the state-owned National Transmission & Despatch
Company Ltd. and Lakhra, respectively, instructed Karkey to cease electricity dispatch from the
Powerships. At the same time, Karachi Electric Supply Company (“KESC”) stopped supplying

lifeline power to the Powerships, leaving the crew on the Vessels without power.**

On 3 April 2012, Karkey received a notification issued by Port Qasim Authority stating that,
further to the inquiry initiated by NAB, a “caution” had been placed on the Vessels under NAO
Section 23. Purportedly relying on such “caution”, the Pakistani port authorities directed that the
Vessels not be moved from their moored position until the completion of the NAB inquiry and/or

clearance from NAB.**

. Karkey’s Kaya Bey Vessel remained forcibly idle from April 2012 through May 2014, when

Pakistan complied with this Arbitral Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures dated 16
October 2013 to allow the Vessel to depart Pakistani waters. For the Alican Bey Vessel and the
two support Vessels (the Jraq and the Enis Bey), the detention that began in April 2012 continues

to the present day.

For the entire period of this detention, because Pakistan cut off lifeline power to the Powerships,

the Vessels were (and still are) without power needed for operation and maintenance.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 43 of 310

. On 24 April 2012, the MoWP, on behalf of Pakistan, PEPCO, NEPRA, and the former Ministry

of Finance, filed a Civil Review Petition®’ before the Supreme Court in order to try to reverse

the RPP Judgment. These proceedings remain pending.

On 24 April 2012, and purportedly pursuant to the RPP Judgment, NAB demanded that Karkey
appear at NAB Headquarters and that, within 48 hours, it pay an alleged outstanding amount of
US$183.5 million to the Chairman of the NAB.‘* NAB’s demand for payment of US$183.5

million was reiterated on 9 May 2012.*
On 19 May 2012, Karkey delivered to Pakistan a notice of dispute under the BIT.”

On 7 September 2012, NAB, Lakhra and Karkey entered into a “Deed”, which provided for
payment by Karkey of US$17.2 million and declared that the parties had reached a resolution of
all the matters arising from the Contract, the Judgment, and the NAB inquiry.°! The Deed, which
was signed by the Director General NAB, also declared that “KARKEY has no liability, and there
remains no basis or evidence for proceeding(s) by NAB or any of the other Parties or GoP entities
against KARKEY and/or its project/investment and that NAB has completed and closed its
enquiry in respect of KARKEY” and that, upon payment of the agreed amount, NAB would
remove the “caution” against the Vessels (which had been detained since 2 April 2012); would
rescind the freezing order against Karkey’s bank accounts; and would allow free passage of

Karkey’s assets and personnel by withdrawing the forcible detention it had imposed on them.”

. In accordance with the Deed, Karkey tendered payment of the agreed US$17.2 million through

the Embassy of the Republic of Turkey in Islamabad, which acted as an escrow agent and duly

notified the Foreign Office of Pakistan.”

On 11 October 2012, NAB issued a “No Objection Certificate” (“NOC”) declaring that it was
satisfied that Karkey had reconciled and agreed account with Lakhra, and that Karkey had no

liability under the NAO. The same document stated that NAB had “completed and closed

inquiry” in respect of Karkey.°°

On 11 October 2012, pursuant to the terms of the Deed and the No Objection Certificate, NAB
lifted the caution on Karkey’s Vessels.” The Vessels, however, remained detained and under the

control of the GoP pending compliance with the directions of NAB.

On 1 November 2012, Mr. Hayat, the Parliamentarian acting as the petitioner in the Rental Power
Case, wrote a letter to the Chief Justice Chaudhry requesting that the Supreme Court prevent
NAB from allowing Karkey’s Vessels to sail outside of Pakistan before recovering the “full

amount” Karkey purportedly owned, which Mr. Hayat claimed to be US$227 million.°”

. On 2 November 2012, NAB reactivated the “caution” on Karkey’s Vessels, on the basis of NAO

Section 23. NAB once again instructed the port authority and PMSA to prevent the Vessels from

departing Pakistani territorial waters.”

By order dated 26 November 2012, the Supreme Court directed NAB to recover from Karkey
US$120 million, which according to the Court was the amount “re-calculated” by NAB at the
Court’s direction and in coordination with Petitioner Hayat, subject to “all just and legal

exceptions”?

On 29 November 2012, NAB notified Karpak that, pursuant to the Supreme Court’s direction,
Karkey was required to pay US$120 million to NAB within seven days.'°°

Karpak informed NAB that it had no authority to accept service of process on behalf of Karkey.
Therefore, on 3 December 2012, NAB notified Karkey that pursuant to the Supreme Court’s

directions, Karkey was required to make a payment — this time for US$128 million — to the GoP,

inter alia, as follows:

The clear line between the recognized authority of the Supreme Court to
monitor NAB investigations to the limited extent of ensuring fair
investigation, and itself becoming involved in guiding investigations,
appears to be becoming breached as a norm as the elections near. Contempt
notices, verbal orders that differ from written orders, and insufficient time
to prepare numerous progress reports, are placing extreme pressure on NAB
personnel who appear before the Honorable Judges. There is even a danger
that NAB personnel could lose their ind de and are unable to carry
out their investigations in an ind dent manner due to the pressure being
exerted on them by the Honorable Supreme Court to proceed along lines
which seem to be desired by the SC [Supreme Court]. In revealing this
pressure, to safeguard their jobs, and so as not to displease the Honorable
Court, there is danger of unfair investigation being resorted to [...]. I fear
that in the current direction that the Honorable Supreme Court appears to
be taking, I will not be able to perform my independent statutory role [...].'°

High Court issued an arrest order for Karkey’s Vessels.!°”

. On 16 October 2013, this Arbitral Tribunal issued its Provisional Measures Decision, in which

the Tribunal ordered the State of Pakistan, inter alia, to

‘take all steps necessary to allow the vessel, Karadeniz Powership Kaya Bey
[...], to depart into international waters and reach, before 1 November 2013,
the dry dock in Dubai for inspection and repairs as determined by the Bureau

steps necessary to obtain the temporary suspension of the order of the High
Court of Sindh at Karachi dated 29 May 2013 in the Admiralty Suit No. 07
of 2013, which arrested the vessel [Kaya Bey].\*

. Lakhra made an application to the Sindh High Court seeking a temporary modification of the

arrest order it had procured, to allow the Kaya Bey to sail to Dubai for dry dock inspection and

repairs, which Lakhra filed on 26 October 2013.!°

The Sindh High Court issued a notice to NAB, a non-party to the proceedings, to appear and state
its position with respect to Lakhra’s application.''® NAB appeared in the admiralty proceeding

Court, this time by Karkey’s Pakistani shipping agent, Bulk Shipping & Trading Limited (“Bulk
Shipping”). In its petition, Bulk Shipping made an ex parte application for the immediate arrest
of all four of Karkey’s Vessels on account of a purported claim of unpaid docking charges in the
amount of approximately US$1.1 million. Bulk Shipping further claimed that it had suffered

arrest of all four Karkey Vessels.!'

. By Order dated 23 December 2013, the Sindh High Court declined to grant Lakhra’s application

for temporary modification of the arrest order.!!*

. On 6 January 2014, Lakhra appealed the decision of the Sindh High Court.

. On 7 May 2014, the Sindh High Court Appellate Bench Division issued an order permitting the

release of the Kaya Bey.''>

. On 15 May 2014, the Singh High Court indicated that it would lift its arrest of Karkey’s Vessels

upon submission by Karkey of a pay order for the amount Karkey allegedly owed to Bulk
Shipping (approximately US$1,137,234). Karkey furnished the required pay order to the Sindh
High Court.''® Noting receipt of the pay order, the Sindh High Court revoked the arrest of
Karkey’s four detained Vessels in the Bulk Shipping case on 15 May 2014.'!” The proceedings
in the Sindh High Court are still ongoing.

On 1 August 2014, upon a request by Karkey and absent any objection from Pakistan, the Tribunal
modified its Decision on Provisional Measures to relieve Karkey of any obligation to return the

Kaya Bey to Pakistan following completion of it dry-docking inspection and repairs in Dubai.

IV.SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

16

162.

o

164.

. The following provides an overview of the Parties’ respective claims and defences. This summary

has been prepared to set in context the decisions made by the Tribunal in this Award, and is not
an exhaustive description of the arguments presented during this arbitration through the written
and oral submissions of the Parties. The fact that a particular submission is not expressly
referenced below should not be taken as any indication that it has not been considered by the

Tribunal.
The Claimant’s Position
(1) Jurisdiction

a. The Supreme Court Judgment does not Deprive the Tribunal of Jurisdiction

The Claimant submits that the Supreme Court’s holding that the contracts are void ab initio and
must be rescinded have no impact whatsoever on the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Such decision

came in any event after the Contract had already been performed and terminated by Karkey.!'?

. According to the Claimant, the Tribunal is required to assess the scope of Pakistan’s consent to

arbitration under international law. Accordingly, a Pakistani court holding regarding the status
of Karkey’s Contract under national law cannot be dispositive of — or even relevant to — the
Tribunal’s jurisdictional inquiry. Rather, it is the Tribunal’s obligation and prerogative to conduct
its own independent assessment of whether Karkey’s investment was made “in conformity with

the hosting Party’s laws and regulations” as required by Article I(2) of the BIT.!7°

The Claimant notes that despite acknowledging that the Tribunal “shall be the judge of its own
competence” to determine the scope of BIT jurisdiction over Karkey’s claims, Pakistan insists
that it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to undertake an independent jurisdictional analysis
in this case. Instead, Pakistan demands that the Tribunal defers to the Supreme Court’s Judgment,

unless the Tribunal finds that the Judgment constituted a denial of justice.'*!

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 49 of 310

However, according to the Claimant, Pakistan provides no basis for this asserted limitation on the

Tribunal’s authority. Pakistan’s heavy reliance on the award in Helnan v. Egypt'”* is misplaced,
as the tribunal in that case explicitly rejected the notion that a national court decision on the
legality of an investment could be determinative of a tribunal’s jurisdiction to entertain BIT

claims. The Claimant asserts that Pakistan actually fails to cite any authority that requires a

 

tribunal assessing jurisdiction over BIT claims to defer to the findings of a national court on the
legality of the claimant’s investment. According to the Claimant, the weight of authority instead
confirms that national court decisions of illegality cannot substitute for an ICSID tribunal’s
independent assessment under international law. The foregoing is also consistent with the basic
principle of international law expressed in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, that “/a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its
failure to perform a treaty.” Similarly, under Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, “/t/he characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is
governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of

the same act as lawfil by internal law.”'?>

In any event, the Claimant submits that its investment consisted of many elements other than the
Contract itself. Most notably, Karkey constructed permanent infrastructure to improve Pakistan’s

electricity grid; transported its Vessels into Pakistani waters; established a local subsidiary; set

 

up local offices; and employed local personnel. Karkey argues that there is no “domestic law”
magic wand that Pakistan can wave to make Karkey’s investment in Pakistan disappear:that

investment happened, and the reality of it is incontrovertible.'**

b. Karkey Made its Investment in Conformity with Pakistani Law

The Claimant submits that Karkey’s investment was made in good faith and in conformity with
Pakistani law. Karkey asserts that, under international law, non-conformity with the host State’s
law will vitiate jurisdiction only where it (i) constitutes a material breach of a fundamental
principle of host-State law, (ii) occurs in the making of the investment, and (iii) is committed

knowingly by the investor. Investment tribunals have applied this “serious illegality” standard.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 50 of 310

The Claimant argues that, even if Pakistan could meet this standard (which is denied), having
endorsed Karkey’s investment despite knowing of the alleged illegalities, Pakistan is estopped

from objecting to jurisdiction on this ground.!?°

168. According to the Claimant, Pakistan mischaracterized the legality requirement in Article I(2) of
the BIT, asserting that “it’s only if [Karkey’s] investment was in conformity with Pakistani law
that it qualifies as an investment entitled to protection under the Treaty.” Under Pakistan’s
proposed test, it would be enough for the State to claim that the investor “should have known”
of a legal non-conformity, whether or not the investor knowingly engaged in any wrongful
conduct in the making of the investment. However, the Claimant asserts that negligence based
violations do not rise to the standard of “serious illegality” under international law. Therefore,
any such alleged failures of due diligence by Karkey would be insufficient to deprive the Tribunal

of jurisdiction.!”6

169. Moreover, the Claimant argues that, as investment tribunals have explained, for purposes of
jurisdiction, illegality is assessed at the moment in which the investment is first established.
According to the Claimant, the purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether an investor has
unfairly gained access to the protection of the BIT. Because an investor gains that BIT protection
the moment it establishes its investment, any subsequent illegality in the operation of the
investment cannot vitiate BIT jurisdiction. Since the various alleged illegalities (which are
denied) would have occurred after the issuance of Karkey’s Letter of Award, countersigned by
Karkey on 7 November 2008, they could not in any event result in the loss of jurisdiction over

Karkey’s claims.!?”

170. The Claimant further submits that Pakistan is estopped from raising objections to the legality of
Karkey’s Project given the fact that for years Pakistan has fully ratified the legality of that very
investment, encouraged Karkey first to make and then to maintain the investment, and issued a

128

No Objection Certificate'** clearing Karkey of any liability for corruption. Karkey argues that

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 51 of 310

international law does not countenance this type of volte face by a State to the detriment of the

investor. !?°

Karkey’s position on each of Pakistan’s objections to the legality of Karkey’s investment is
summarized below and relates to the fact that (b.1) Karkey did not secure its investment through
misrepresentation and fraud; (b.2) Karkey did not breach Pakistan’s procurement laws or
international procurement norms; (b.3) Karkey did not secure its investment through corruption;
and (b.4) Pakistan’s disregard of its obligations under the Contract and Sovereign Guarantee

constitute breaches of the BIT.

(b.1) Karkey did not Secure Its Investment through Misrepresentation and Fraud

. Karkey rejects Pakistan’s argument that it has obtained its investment through fraud. In order to

succeed on a claim for fraud under international law, Pakistan must show (i) an intent by Karkey

   

; and (iii) detrimental reliance by Pakistan on the facts as presented.

 

(ii) a material fas

According to Karkey, Pakistan cannot demonstrate any of these elements.!*°

73. The Claimant asserts that Pakistan’s fraud claim fails to meet even the first element of the above-

referenced standard, as Pakistan has presented no evidence that Karkey acted with an intent to
deceive Pakistan. As Mr. Karadeniz explained at the Hearing, at the time of submission of its
Bid, Karkey believed it could in fact achieve commercial operations within 180 days of issuance

of the Letter of Award, as it had indicated in its Proposed Project Schedule.'*!

74. The Claimant submits that Pakistan also fails to meet the second element of fraud: a demonstration

that Karkey concealed a “material fact.” In submitting its Proposed Project Schedule, Karkey
merely made a commitment to meet a target or, failing that, to pay the contractual penalty for its
delays. Karkey argues that this was not a representation of fact that Karkey would achieve the
target irrespective of Pakistan’s actions or of delays beyond Karkey’s control. It simply was an
acknowledgment by Karkey that there was an agreed target date for achievement of commercial
operations and an acceptance by Karkey of the contractual consequences for failing to meet that
target. Those consequences included (1) the encashment of the performance guarantee, (2)

liquidated damages, and (3) a reduction of the contract terms. The Claimant asserts that the

39

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 52 of 310

inclusion of these contractual remedies for delay underscores the fact that Pakistan and Karkey
had a mutual understanding of the commercial operations date as a mere target.!*? Karkey’s
commitment thus was not an assurance of a particular outcome, but rather simply an
acknowledgment that it would either meet the target COD, or pay the relevant contractual

penalty.!3>

175. The Claimant submits that Pakistan also fails to satisfy the third element required for its fraud
claim: detrimental reliance. Pakistan does not dispute that to succeed on its misrepresentation
objection it must demonstrate that it reasonably relied to its detriment on Karkey’s commitment

to meet the target COD. However, Pakistan insists that such detrimental reliance can be inferred

 

because Pakistan awarded Karkey the Contract on the b: f Karkey’s commitment. According
to Karkey, this fails because Pakistan does not explain how awarding Karkey a contract on this
basis was detrimental to Pakistan. There were no other bidders who would have received
contracts had Karkey been disqualified.'** Nor can mere delay in achievement of COD be
considered a detriment flowing from reliance on Karkey’s commitment to the target schedule,

given that the Contract expressly provided for penalties in case of delay.'*>

(b.2) Karkey did not breach Pakistan’s procurement laws or international procurement

norms

176. Karkey rejects Pakistan’s allegation that by adopting certain changes to the tendered contract,
Karkey and Lakhra (and various Pakistani government agencies) materially breached Pakistani

procurement law and that the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction.'*°

177. According to the Claimant, the first among numerous defects in this argument is that Pakistan has

taken — and continues to take the opposite position before its own Supreme Court. There

54 According to the Claimant, Pakistan notes that aside from Karkey and Walters, the only other bidder in the RFP
was Cavalier Energy, which submitted a bid that was declared non-responsive. The Claimant submits that, although
Pakistan contends that Cavalier Energy was disqualified because, unlike Karkey, it did not pledge Target COD within
six months, in fact, a contemporaneously signed document on the record shows that as of 2 August 2008, Cavalier
did commit to achieving COD within 6 months. See C-127. Further, the Claimant submits that Pakistan ignores the
fact that the evaluation committee rejected Cavalier’s bid for other reasons, including Cavalier’s proposed fuel cost
component, tariff, and output all impermissibly exceeded project terms (C-127, p. 7). See footnote 76 of Karkey’s
Post-Hearing Brief.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 53 of 310

Pakistan continuously maintained that Karkey’s contract was procured in compliance with

Pakistani procurement law.!37

178. Pakistan argues that Karkey’s investment in Pakistan was established in breach of the PPRA
Rules. However, as explained by Karkey’s Pakistani law expert, Mr. Zafar, negotiations that take
place after a Letter of Award is issued are not governed by the PPRA Rules, since the
procurement process is complete upon the issuance of the Letter of Award. Therefore, there is
no question of Karkey’s non-compliance with the PPRA Rules, because the allegedly offending
contractual changes occurred after the Letter of Award. Even if the PPRA Rules were deemed
applicable to the contractual changes alleged by Pakistan, such changes are in fact permissible
unless they materially shift the transactional balance in favour of the private party. This standard
is consistent with international procurement custom and norms. None of the contractual changes

alleged by Pakistan offend either Pakistani or international procurement standards.'**

179. According to the Claimant, during negotiations, Pakistan informed Karkey that it was unable to
open a confirmed letter of credit. As a result, a package of changes was introduced into the Draft
RSC to provide alternate forms of security to Karkey. Specifically, the requirement for
confirmation of the Letter of Credit was eliminated, the amount of the Letter of Credit was
reduced from an amount equivalent to five years of rental services fees to an amount equivalent
to only three years and the terms of the Letter of Credit was reduced correspondingly. In
exchange for this less advantageous form of security for Karkey, the down payment was
increased from 7% to 14.16% and a fuel payment letter of credit was introduced.'*? Accordingly
to the Claimant, overall, these changes were to Karkey’s detriment. In accordance with Pakistani
and international procurement norms, such changes were permissible because they did not shift
the transactional balance in favour of the seller, and would not have altered the outcome of the

procurement.!4°

(b.3) Karkey did not secure its investment through corruption

180. The Claimant submits that like Pakistan’s allegations of fraud and misprocurement, Pakistan’s

18

claim that Karkey secured its investment through corruption is unsupported by either the factual
record or the law. Karkey argues that the standard of proof for allegations of corruption is high.
Specifically, an allegation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, as that standard is

defined under international law.'*!

According to Pakistan, because “corruption is endemic” in Pakistan’s political system, the
Tribunal, in balancing the probabilities, should start from an assumption that it is more likely
than not that Karkey was engaged in some form of corruption. Karkey argues that such
proposition is perverse, as Pakistan in essence is proposing that the well-accepted “clear and
convincing” evidence standard be supplanted by new standard of “presumptive corruption.”!%”

The Claimant asserts that this shift in the standard of proof is unacceptable.'**

182. The Claimant states that Pakistan has repeatedly and consistently admitted that it has no evidence

of bribery by Karkey but it insists that Karkey must have paid bribes to secure benefits under the
Contract. The Claimant notes that at the Hearing, Pakistan’s only witness on this subject, Mr.
Aslam, confirmed that he did not know of any bribes having been paid by, or on behalf of,

Karkey.'4 Despite Pakistan’s

 

sertion that Mr. Aslam’s testimony proves that Karkey engaged
in corruption, under cross-examination he failed to substantiate any of Pakistan’s speculative
allegations. This is unsurprising given that neither the Supreme Court nor the NAB found any

evidence of corruption by Karkey in the course of their investigation of those same allegations.'*5

183, The Claimant notes that the NAB itself concluded that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by

Karkey under the NAO, and entered into a Deed settling Karkey’s account and explicitly
concluding that Karkey had no liability under the NAO. In addition to signing the Deed with

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 55 of 310

Lakhra and Karkey, NAB issued a NOC, clearing Karkey from any and all liability under the
NAO (the very law which Pakistan now alleges that Karkey breached).'4°

184. Karkey argues that Pakistan attempts to elide the importance of the Deed and the NOC by
asserting that the Deed was later rejected by the Supreme Court because the value of the
settlement was too low. However, it points out to no ruling from the Supreme Court questioning

NAB?’s clearance Karkey of any liability under the NAO."

185. Moreover, the Claimant maintains that Pakistan’s assertion that Karkey has not adequately
explained Mr. Zulgarnain’s role in the Project is false. According to the Claimant, both the
documentary and testimonial evidence demonstrate that Mr. Zulqarnain played a legitimate role

as Karkey’s representative in Pakistan and there is no evidence that he engaged in corruption.'**

186. The Claimant argues that, attempting to make up with legal argumentation what it lacked in
evidence, Pakistan in its pleadings had invoked a single investment tribunal decision, Metal-Tech
v. Uzbekistan, which it insisted was analogous to the present case. According to Pakistan, Mr.
Zulgarnain’s role at Karkey was akin to that of two of the consultants in Metal-Tech, to whom
the claimant in Metal-Tech had paid millions of dollars via an offshore company in return for
their services of “lobbying” government officials. However, the Claimant asserts that, by the
close of the Hearing, even Pakistan itself admitted that the comparison was inapt: “Pakistan
accepts we are not in Metal-Tech territory”.!°

(b.4) Pakistan’s disregard of its obligations under the Contract and Sovereign Guarantee

constitute breaches of the BIT

187. The Claimant submits that the claims that Pakistan mischaracterizes as “purely contractual” —
including for example, Pakistan’s nullification of the Contract, failure to pay outstanding
invoices for rental services and fuel payments, refusal to honour the Sovereign Guarantee, and
failure to honour Karkey’s post-termination Contract rights — in fact amount to breaches of the

BIT!

188. The Claimant argues that Pakistan’s characterization of these claims as outside the scope of the

BIT — and in particular, the Umbrella Clause — is inconsistent with the weight of investment
jurisprudence. Nor does the forum selection clauses in the Contract and Sovereign Guarantee
deprive Karkey of recourse to ICSID for resolving its contract-related BIT claims. Because
ICSID Convention Article 26 establishes ICSID as the exclusive forum for such claims, an LCIA,
tribunal would have no jurisdiction to hear Karkey’s claims for breach of the BIT. In any event,
both the Contract and the Sovereign Guarantee are governed by Pakistani law. Applying that law,
the Sindh High Court determined that Karkey’s choice to pursue ICSID arbitration rendered the
LCIA arbitration clause “incapable of being performed” during the pendency of these ICSID
proceedings. Further, having objected to LCIA arbitration in the Sindh High Court proceedings,
Pakistan is estopped from claiming in these proceedings that LCIA arbitration is mandatory. The
Claimant therefore assets that this ICSID arbitration is therefore the only forum in which Karkey

can seek redress for its BIT claims relating to the Contract and Sovereign Guarantee.'*!

(2) Attribution

189. According to Karkey, the acts of the Ministry of Water, NAB, the Supreme Court of Pakistan and

other organs of the State of Pakistan, as well as Lakhra’s acts, in breach of the BIT are attributable

to Pakistan.'*

190. As set out under Section IV(A)(3)(c) below, Karkey rejects Pakistan’s attempts to avoid BIT

19

1.

liability by disclaiming responsibility for the acts of Lakhra and PEPCO. According to Karkey,

the record and Pakistan’s own witness:

 

confirm that these entities were squarely under the

direction and control of Pakistan’s MoWP.!*3

It is Karkey’s position that Lakhra’s acts are attributable to Pakistan, as there can be no dispute
that Lakhra acted at the behest and whim of MoWP, in the exercise of the latter’s sovereign
powers. Although Pakistan denied responsibility for the acts of PEPCO at the Hearing, it had
already conceded in its Counter-Memorial that PEPCO is a “Government department,” and it

failed to offer any rebuttal of the evidence on that point in Karkey’s Reply.!™4

(3) Merits

a. The Supreme Court Judgment Does Not Insulate Pakistan from Liability for Breaches of
the BIT
192. According to Karkey, the Supreme Court’s holding that the contracts are void ab initio and must
be rescinded only impacts the merits of the case insofar as the Judgment itself violates the BIT.
In any event, the Judgment does not preclude a finding of liability by Pakistan for its numerous

other breaches of the BIT.'°

193. Even if the Tribunal were to conclude that the Judgment was not deficient from the viewpoint of
international law, i.e. that the Judgment itself did not constitute a BIT violation, the Tribunal
would only owe a duty of deference to the specific findings of national law that the Judgment
actually reached. Under no circumstance could the Judgment, deciding liability under national
law, insulate Pakistan from responsibility for breaches of international law in the alleged
implementation (by executive authorities) of that Judgment, nor could it validate subsequent

directives from the Supreme Court.!°°

b. Pakistan’s has breached its BIT obligations, including those incorporated through the
MEN clause

194, According to the Claimant, Pakistan has unlawfully expropriated Karkey’s investment in breach

of Article III of the Pakistan-Turkey BIT, which provides as follows:!>7

Investments shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subject, directly or
indirectly to measures of similar effects except for a public purpose, in a non-
discriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation, and in accordance with due process of law

 

195. Karkey maintains that expropriation occurs where the State substantially deprives an investor of
the use and enjoyment of its investment, and such deprivation need not affect the Claimant’s
legal title. Accordingly, a State’s action may be considered tantamount to expropriation where
they interfere significantly with the use or reasonably expected benefit of the investment.
According to the Claimant, in the present case, Pakistan’s arrest and detention of Karkey’s

Vessels, seizure of Karkey’s bank accounts, and purported invalidation of Karkey’s contractual

rights under the Contract all have severely interfered with Karkey’s use and enjoyment of its
investment in Pakistan.'** Pakistan’s purported invalidation of the Contract and subsequent
seizure of Karkey’s Vessels and bank accounts in Pakistan have effectively expropriated

Karkey’s entire investment.!*?

196. Moreover, the Claimant submits that Pakistan’s mistreatment of Karkey’s investment has
breached several of Pakistan’s BIT obligations, including obligations incorporated through
Article II(2) (the “MFN clause”), which requires Pakistan to accord to “investments, once
established, treatment no less favorable than that accorded in similar situations to investments
of its investors or to investments of investors of any third country, whichever is most favorable.”
The Claimant asserts that, by virtue of the MFN clause, Pakistan must afford Karkey the same

treatment it accords investors under Pakistan’s other BITs.'°°

197. According to the Claimant, Pakistan attempts to prevent the importation of obligations from its
other BITs by asserting that the phrase in “in similar situations” requires the investor to
demonstrate a direct violation of the MFN clause before the favourable protection of other
treaties can apply. The Claimant argues that Pakistan attempts to bolster its restrictive
interpretation of the MFN clause by relying on the newly issued J¢kale v. Turkmenistan award,
which held that unless the term “in similar situations” was read to require the investor to point to

an actual comparator, the term would lack effet utile.'®!

Karkey submits that this reading is
contrary to the weight of prior investment jurisprudence, and Pakistan itself admits that the /¢kale
award “is the only investment treaty award” that has adopted Pakistan’s restrictive reading of the

MEN clause.'®

198. According to the Claimant, other tribunals, including that in Bayindir v. Pakistan (which analysed

the same BIT at issue in this case) have concluded that the MFN clause does allow importation

of protection from other treaties — even in the absence of an actual comparator investment.!©

ce. Pakistan’s Failure to Perform its Contractual Obligations Violated the BIT (Umbrella
Clause)

199, According to Karkey, Pakistan failed to observe the commitments it made to Karkey in the

Contract and the Sovereign Guarantee, and has thus violated Article 9 of the Lebanon-Pakistan
BIT, which, as incorporated by reference pursuant to the MFN Clause of the Turkey-Pakistan
BIT, requires Pakistan to “observe any other obligation it has assumed with regard to
investments” made in Pakistan by Karkey. The purpose of this type of clause — also known as an
“umbrella” clause — is to incorporate compliance with contracts and other agreements related to
investments into the scope of the treaty protections for investors and investments, regardless of

whether the host State has violated the other substantive provisions of the treaty at issue.'*

200. Karkey points out that a State’s obligation to observe commitments with respect to its contracts

20

is not limited to avoiding a breach of those contracts. The umbrella clause also imposes a broader
obligation on the State “to ‘ensure’ that state-owned entities conduct activities which, in general
terms of governance, management and organization, make them capable of observing [their
contractual] obligations.” In this sense, a State is obligated not only to perform its contractual
duties, but also to “respect specific undertakings” and in order to “protect[{] the investor’s
contractual rights against any interference which might be caused by either a simple breach of
contract or by administrative or legislative acts. . . .” Thus, even a State entity that is not a party
to a contract with an investor may violate the umbrella clause by failing to observe commitments

made by the State under that contract.!®

. According to Karkey, Pakistan failed to observe the obligations it incurred pursuant to the

Contract and the Sovereign Guarantee in its capacity not only as a commercial party, but also as

a sovereign, and actively interfered with and frustrated the ability of Lakhra to perform its

obligations under the Contract. This conduct violated Pakistan’s obligation to observe the

obligations it has entered into with respect to Karkey.!°

202. Karkey submits that it has duly performed its own obligations under the Contract and rejects
Pakistan’s attempts to question Karkey’s contractual performance. It is not disputed that, on 12
April 2011, Lakhra certified that Karkey had achieved Commercial Operations under the
Contract, following a successful Operational Test certified by an independent engineer. In the
ensuing months, Karkey performed its obligations under the Contract — including its obligation
to make available to Lakhra 231.8 MW of power generation capacity. At all times prior to
termination of the Contract, Karkey’s Powerships stood ready to meet the Guaranteed

Availability required by the Contract. '7

203. Moreover, according to Karkey, Pakistan frustrated its legitimate expectation that the RFP and
resulting contracts were legal and binding on Pakistan. From the very first advertisement for the
Rental Power Projects, and through various subsequent oral and formal written representations,
Pakistan assured Karkey that the Contract would be and ultimately was awarded in accordance
with law and was legally binding and valid. Indeed, Karkey was forced to rely on these
representations as the Contract was issued by Pakistan’s “one-window” procurement agency
established to provide just such assurance. Karkey relied on these representations when it entered
into the contract and then mobilized its Powerships to Pakistan. Pakistan’s subsequent
repudiation of these representations to avoid its obligations to Karkey has thus frustrated
Karkey’s legitimate expectations, in violation of Pakistan’s obligation to afford fair and equitable
treatment to Karkey.!® As Pakistan concedes, Karkey’s expectations must be evaluated at the
time Karkey made its investment, which means that the Supreme Court’s (incorrect) declaration
in March 2012 that the Contract was void ab initio and must be rescinded cannot negate the

legitimate expectations formed by Karkey at the time the investment was made in 2008.!°

204. Karkey further submits that Pakistan’s failure to honour the Sovereign Guarantee breached
Pakistan’s obligations under the BIT, including the obligation of fair and equitable treatment, the

umbrella clause commitment, and the obligation of full protection and security. Contrary to

166 K arkey’s Memorial, 554.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 61 of 310

Pakistan’s arguments, the claims arising from these Sovereign Guarantee-related breaches are
not purely contractual. Far from a simple commercial contract, the Sovereign Guarantee was
provided to Karkey by Pakistan as security in place of a letter of credit precisely because it put
the weight of the State behind Lakhra’s financial obligation (and thus served as a higher form of
security). It is nonsensical to assert that a sovereign guarantee is purely contractual: by definition,
a sovereign guarantee is an exercise of sovereign power. No private company can issue a

sovereign guarantee.'”°

205. Karkey also rejects Pakistan’s attempts to avoid BIT liability by disclaiming responsibility for the
acts of Lakhra and PEPCO. According to Karkey, the record and Pakistan’s own witnesses
confirm that these entities were squarely under the direction and control of Pakistan’s MoWP. In

addition to owning approximately 99.99% of the shares in Lakhra, MoWP inter alia:!”!

- Advertised the terms of Lakhra’s Contract and approved Karkey’s Bid;

- Directed Lakhra to enter into the Contract, even though it was apparent that Lakhra

lacked the financial resources or financial standing to fulfil the obligations;
- Determined Lakhra’s obligations under the Contract;
- Through PEPCO, deputized Lakhra with authority to sign the Contract with Karkey;
- Through PEPCO and the Ministry of Finance, released the Advance Payment to
Karkey;
- Controlled Lakhra’s board throughout the life of the Contract; etc.

206. Karkey concludes that Lakhra’s acts are attributable to Pakistan, as there can be no dispute that
Lakhra acted at the behest and whim of MOWP, in the exercise of the latter’s sovereign powers.
Although Pakistan denied responsibility for the acts of PEPCO at the Hearing, it had already
conceded in its Counter-Memorial that PEPCO is a “Government department,” and it failed to

offer any rebuttal of the evidence on that point in Karkey’s Reply.'”

d. The Supreme Court Judgment Violated Pakistan’s BIT Obligations

207. Karkey submits that it has established the following in relation to the Supreme Court’s RPP
proceedings and RPP Judgment:

- The Supreme Court disregarded its own procedural rules, which require allegations to
be supported by a sworn affidavit, to protect due process and prevent unfounded

accusations;!73

- The Supreme Court unconstitutionally usurped Executive authority in reversing the

RPP policy;'

- The proceedings were driven by the political agenda of Mr. Hayat and Mr. Asif, who

5

were afforded over half a dozen!” opportunities to present oral argument, while

Karkey was limited to one (spread over parts of two hearings);!7°

- The Court accepted Mr. Hayat’s plainly erroneous conclusion that Pakistan had
sufficient generation capacity, despite PEPCO’s demonstration that Mr. Hayat had
mistakenly “compar[ed] Power (MW) with Energy (MkWh), which are two different
things;”!77

- The Court misunderstood the structure of the RPP Contracts — pursuant to which the
RPP sponsor guaranteed it would make available a certain generation capacity, not a

certain output — in finding that Karkey was not producing at the contractual rate;'*

- The Court imposed the arbitrary requirement of a reserve price on the procurement of

electricity, a requirement entirely unsupported by Pakistani law;!”

- The Court imposed the same liability on all the RPP sponsors, despite material
differences between the procurement, financing, and operational statuses of the

different RPP programs;!®°

- The Court declared all RPP contracts to be both “void ab initio” and “rescinded
forthwith,” even though such holdings are mutually inconsistent under Pakistani
law;'*!

- Destroying any presumption of innocence, the Court held that Karkey, like all other
RPP sponsors, was “prima facie, involved in corruption and corrupt practices,” and
subject to prosecution by NAB, despite the lack of any evidence of corruption by

Karkey;!*

- The Court eviscerated Karkey’s rights without any right to appeal.'*? Lower courts in
Pakistan comply with the Supreme Court’s orders, no matter how defective — as the

decisions of the Sindh High Court have demonstrated; and

- Karkey’s position regarding the foregoing is supported by Pakistan’s own submissions
to the Supreme Court — not only those filed during the RPP proceedings, but also the
Civil Review Petitions that were filed after the Judgment was rendered. Such petitions
demonstrate the unlawfulness of the Judgment, and confirm the validity of Karkey’s

RSC.

Karkey submits that the Supreme Court’s arbitrary, unreasonable, and politically-driven factual
findings and legal conclusions, together with its failure to follow its own procedural rules,
violated Karkey’s BIT rights (as did Pakistan’s subsequent actions purportedly taken to enforce
such judgment).!*4

Moreover, according to Karkey, ICSID tribunals have recognized that “the substance of a

decision may be relevant in the sense that a breach of the standard [for denial of justice] can

also be found when the decision is so patently arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic that it
demonstrates bad faith.”'*> Similarly, States may breach a BIT when their courts administer
justice in a seriously inadequate way and when there is a clear and malicious misapplication of

the law.'8°

Karkey contends that the Pakistan Contract Act establishes a clear distinction between an
agreement that was never enforceable under the law, and is therefore void ab initio, and an
enforceable contract that becomes void and may therefore be rescinded. According to Karkey,
only an agreement which is unenforceable from its inception may be declared void ab initio.
Only a contract which is recognized as validly formed and enforceable by law is capable of
rescission. A judgment may not in the same breath declare an agreement to be unenforceable
from inception and find it to be a valid contract capable of being rescinded. The Supreme Court’s
decision to declare Karkey’s RSC an unenforceable nullity, but at the same time recognize the
RSC as a valid contract capable of rescission, constitutes arbitrary and unreasonable State action

and a denial of justice under the BIT.'*”

Karkey submits that the Supreme Court purported to invalidate Karkey’s RSC on the basis of
Pakistan’s procurement laws but failed to give effect to one of the most fundamental principles
embodied in the PPRA Rules: the principle that investment treaties and international law do not
allow a State to preclude an investor from seeking protection under the BIT on the ground that
its own actions are illegal under its own law.'** The Supreme Court based its holdings on the
purported failure of Pakistan’s own officials to conduct sufficient preliminary studies and to
obtain the necessary internal approvals, as well as the changes made to the RSCs once Pakistan

determined that it would be unable to secure the promised letters of credit.'*?

According to Karkey, Pakistan sought to rely on what it claimed to be an absence of any
documented record of objection by Karkey to the procedures of the Supreme Court, asking “when

you consider the evidence you have before you from Karkey about the alleged denial of due

process in the courts, [ask] if Karkey truly believed that these were serious due process failings,
why did it never raise them before the Supreme Court itself?” However, any expectation that
Karkey would have voiced such complaints before the Supreme Court is unreasonable in view
of the well-documented threats of arrest, prosecution, and contempt of court by the Supreme

Court.!%°

e. Pakistan’s Actions in Alleged Implementation of the Judgment Also Breached Pakistan's
BIT Obligations

Karkey submits that the majority of Pakistan’s actions giving rise to its BIT violations are
undisputed. Thus, Pakistan does not dispute that NAB forcibly detained Karkey’s Vessels despite
lacking any evidence of corruption, and despite its prior agreement to release the Vessels. Nor
does Pakistan dispute that the Supreme Court openly controlled NAB’s purportedly independent
corruption investigation and allowed the politician Mr. Hayat to intervene in NAB’s inquiry to
re-calculate Pakistan’s payment demands. It is similarly undisputed that the GoP instructed
Lakhra to initiate an admiralty action in the Sindh High Court seeking the same US$128 million
payment by Karkey that had been demanded by Mr. Hayat. It is also undisputed that it took
Pakistan over seven months to comply with this Tribunal’s provisional measures order to release
the Kaya Bey.'*!

Karkey rejects Pakistan’s only defence of its actions that it is excused from responsibility for any
action taken in furtherance of the Judgment. However, a State cannot avoid liability under a BIT
by claiming its actions were lawful under domestic law, especially given that, here, the Judgment

was itself a violation of international law.'°?

According to Karkey, NAB’s detention of the Vessels violated Pakistan’s obligations under the
BIT. First, NAB had no authority to detain the Vessels. The only statutory authority ever invoked
by NAB to justify its physical detention of Karkey’s Vessels is Section 23 of the NAO. But
Section 23 does not authorize physical detention, as admitted by Pakistan’s own expert Mr.
Karim. In Deutsche Bank AG v. Sri Lanka, a State organ issued an order to suspend an investor’s
contract, without providing a legal basis for doing so. The State’s ex post attempts at justification

were rejected by the tribunal because domestic law did not give the State organ this authority.

217.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 66 of 310

As in Deutsche Bank, the relevant State entity (here, NAB) acted in excess of its powers.
Accordingly, NAB violated Karkey’s rights under the BIT. This violation was all the more
egregious because NAB’s lack of authority to detain the ships was brought to the attention of
both NAB and the Supreme Court by Pakistan’s Attorney General and NAB’s own Prosecutor

General.!°

Karkey further submits that NAB acted arbitrarily in repudiating the Deed. When Pakistan,
through NAB and Lakhra, entered into the Deed with Karkey and agreed to release the Vessels,
it represented that “all actions contemplated herein have been duly authorized by all requisite

corporate, governmental or legal action,” and that the “Deed constitutes valid and legally
binding obligations of each Party, enforceable against it.” In accordance with the express terms
of the Deed, NAB proceeded to issue the No Objection Certificate, which concluded NAB’s
inquiry into Karkey’s project and affirmed that “Karkey has no liability under the National
Accountability Ordinance, 1999 and there remains no basis or evidence for proceedings by NAB
or any other entity against Karkey and/or its project investment [...].”'°4 At the Hearing, Mr.
Karim agreed that NAB has exclusive authority for the investigation and enforcement of the
NAO but he could not explain why the Supreme Court had allowed Mr. Hayat to overrule NAB’s
conclusions in the Deed and No Objection Certificate. The Supreme Court likewise gave no
explanation for its repudiation of the Deed, nor did it explain pursuant to what authority Mr.
Hayat was permitted to recalculate the amount purportedly owed by Karkey. Rather than provide
any legal reasoning to support its repudiation of the Deed — which was a fully enforceable
obligation entered into by Pakistan — and its implicit rejection of the No Objection Certificate,
the Supreme Court instead threatened personal liability by the NAB Chairman in the event that
NAB were unable to effect recovery of the amount demanded by Mr. Hayat.'*> Karkey concludes
that the repudiation of the Deed on the “application” of Mr. Hayat was part of a pattern of

arbitrary and unreasonable demands by Pakistan for payment by Karkey.!°°

In addition, according to Karkey, Pakistan’s initiation of proceedings in the Sindh High Court,
through Lakhra, violated Pakistan’s obligations under the BIT. Karkey submits that, apparently

recognizing the illegitimacy of its actions in relation to the Supreme Court Judgment, NAB

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 67 of 310

resorted to a new tactic: it instructed Lakhra to file an admiralty suit to secure an unlawful ex
parte arrest of Karkey’s Vessels. Pakistan, through Lakhra, asked that the Sindh High Court
“refer to and rely upon the judgment of the Hon ‘ble Supreme Court of Pakistan.” The Sindh High
Court obliged, and proceeded to treat the Lakhra’s suit as an action to enforce the Judgment, not
as a new case based on allegations that would need to be proven. Given that the Judgment was
not subject to appeal and that neither the Sindh High Court nor the Accountability Court has
authority to reject the Supreme Court’s holdings, as a practical matter Pakistan’s assertion that
“local proceedings remain ongoing” is meaningless. Pakistan therefore cannot argue that there
is no denial of justice by invoking the pending proceedings. The Sindh High Court’s ex parte
arrest order — based on an admittedly false affidavit filed by Lakhra — and its disregard of the
RSC’s mandatory LCIA arbitration clause also violated Karkey’s right to fair and equitable

treatment, and its right to freedom from arbitrary and unreasonable measures under the BIT.'°”

f. Pakistan’s Obstruction of the Tribunal’s Provisional Measures Order Violated Pakistan's
Obligations under the BIT
According to Karkey, the gravity of the Supreme Court’s influence and intimidation is further
demonstrated by Pakistan’s failure to abide by this Tribunal’s Order on Provisional Measures for
seven months after its issuance, despite the Sindh High Court’s recognition of the consequences
of doing so. NAB told the Sindh High Court that it must comply with the Supreme Court’s order
rather than with the order of this Tribunal, and Pakistan’s arbitration counsel openly
acknowledged that government officials would not implement this Tribunal’s decision out of fear
of retaliation by the Supreme Court. As a result, Pakistan and the Sindh High Court ignored this
Tribunal’s order to release the Kaya Bey, with the Sindh High Court even recognizing that its

order to continue the detention would expose Pakistan to liability under international law.!°*

From the Supreme Court’s RPP proceedings to the Sindh High Court proceedings and from the
Accountability Court proceedings to the ICSID proceedings, Karkey argues that Pakistan has
consistently denied Karkey justice and fair and equitable treatment, and has engaged in a

concerted and calculated effort to deny Karkey any forum in which to vindicate its rights under

the BIT. That, in itself and independently, constitutes a violation of Pakistan’s fair and equitable

treatment and full protection and security obligations.'”

(4) Damages

. In this arbitration, Karkey claims for damages resulting from the Measures, which are defined at

paragraph 610 of its Memorial as follows:

[...] the injuries suffered by Karkey were caused by the internationally
wrongful acts of Pakistan (the ‘Measures’), which include, inter alia:[i]
Lakhra’s failure to comply with the terms of the Contract (including its
obligations to pay Rental Service Fees, to cover confirmation charges, to pay
for fuel payments, and to pay termination charges and expenses upon
termination of the Contract on 30 March 2012); [ii] Pakistan’s failure to
honor the Sovereign Guarantee; [iii] the Supreme Court’s arbitrary and
unfounded presumption that Karkey participated in corruption; [iv] the
denial of justice committed by the Supreme Court in purporting to invalidate
the Contract on the basis of nothing more than a presumption of wrongdoing,
which was contrary to the evidence before the Court; [v] | NAB’s
investigation of Karkey, its arbitrary demands for payment from Karkey, and
its commencement of criminal proceedings against Karkey; [vi] Pakistan’s
detention and expropriation of Karkey’s ships; [vii] Pakistan’s harassment
of Karkey and its personnel, including through actions by Lakhra, NAB, and
the Sindh High Court in connection with proceedings before the latter court.

a. Key Legal Issues and Standards

(a.1) Ex Post Approach

. Karkey submits that there are two aspects of its damages claim with respect to which the Tribunal

should adopt an ex post approach: (1) the valuation date, and (2) the various inputs required for
modelling Karkey’s loss. The consequence of an ex post valuation date of 30 June 2015 (as a
proxy for present day) is that Karkey’s historical losses are not discounted prior to that date; and
the consequence of using ex post information for the inputs into the Discounted cash flow
(“DCF”) models used to calculate Karkey’s damages is, simply put, that such inputs are rendered
200

more accurate.

According to Karkey, the use of an ex post analysis turns on whether or not such approach is

able standard of ion. Pakistan does not

required in the cir by the appli

dispute that the applicable standard is that set out in the seminal Chorzow Factory judgment. In

9 Karkey’s Post-Hearing Brief, 195.

23.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 69 of 310

this regard, it is notable that Chorzow Factory itself recognized that an ex post approach might
be required to fulfil the standard, stating that in the case of unlawful expropriation, compensation

is not necessarily limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus

 

interest to the day of payment.”°!

 

The Claimant states that the Chorzow Factory standard was also important in the ADC v.
Hungary tribunal’s analysis, leading the tribunal in that case to choose the date of the award for
valuation. It is Karkey’s position that the circumstances that justified an ex post analysis in ADC

possible opportunity to award damages that are reasonably certain. In the present case, if ex ante
information were used in preference to ex post information that presents the most accurate picture
of the damages resulting from the Measures, the quantum of loss would be less. The Claimant
argues that the Tribunal should therefore rely on the ex post information rather than the ex ante

information; otherwise, it would not be compensating Karkey in accordance with the Chorzow

Factory standard.?

Karkey also relies on the Yukos decision, in which the tribunal assessed damages as of the date
of the award and held that investors must enjoy the benefit of unanticipated events that increase
the value of an asset. The Yukos tribunal also emphasized the link between restitution and
compensation under the Chorzow Factory standard, explaining that if restitution were possible,
it would occur at the date of the award. Accordingly, compensation in lieu of restitution must
also be assessed at the date of the award.?

The Kaya Bey and Alican Bey damages claims are distinct, and they will therefore be dealt

separately below.

Karkey submits that its claim in relation to the Kaya Bey is for lost profits, and is not at all an

expropriation claim. The Claimant states that Pakistan’s arguments that rely upon expropriation

jurisprudence are therefore simply inapposite.?°° Moreover, Pakistan’s damage expert accepted
that Iraq suffered from an electricity supply shortage, and thus, “when the Kaya Bey became
available, Iraq was happy to take it.” Accordingly, there is no need to discount for uncertainty

and risk, and using an ex ante valuation would be inappropriate.?°°

 

Moreover, the Claimant asserts that because Karkey’s claim in relation to the Alican Bey is one
that depends on projecting lost profits, the same principles discussed in relation to the Kaya Bey
above are applicable. The rationale for using an earlier valuation date based on the need to
discount for uncertainty has dissipated with respect to the historical lost profits. As Mr.
Haberman accepted in cross-examination, it is clear that both Alican Bey and Kaya Bey would
have been deployed to Iraq, where there has been an ever-increasing demand for rental power.
Karkey accepts that future lost profits must be discounted. However, no discount at all is

warranted in relation to historical cash flows and, thus, neither is an ex ante valuation date.2"”

(a.2) The Termination Charge is Enforceable

Karkey submits, relying on the United Kingdom Supreme Court decision in Cavendish,? that a
Termination Charge of US$165,200,000 to protect Karkey’s legitimate interest/expectation that
it would earn almost US$565,000,000 during the course of the RSC cannot be unreasonable,
particularly given that Pakistan itself proposed the Termination Charge provision, and that the
agreement was entered into by informed and legally advised parties at arm’s length. Moreover,

Section 74 of the Pakistani Contract Act permits contractual penalties.?”

(a.3) Karkey’s Right to Claim on Behalf of its Subsidiaries

Karkey submits that it is entitled to damages arising from Pakistan’s treatment of Karkey’s
subsidiaries, including Karpak and Karpowership. Pakistan does not dispute that “/a/s a matter

of international law, Karkey is entitled to make a claim in relation to its shareholding in

Karpak.”*'° The same must apply to claims implicating Karkey’s other subsidiaries, such as
Karpower International B.V. As the Siemens v. Argentina tribunal noted in its Decision on
Jurisdiction, “as regards ICSID case law dealing with the issue of the right of shareholders to
bring a claim before an arbitral tribunal, the decisions of arbitral tribunals have been consistent

211

in deciding in favor of such right of shareholders.

Instead, Pakistan argues that Karkey “...is not entitled to do so in relation to the contractual
rights of Karpak.”*'* Karkey contends that on Pakistan’s interpretation, a foreign investor (such
as Karkey) may “invest” in shares of a local company (Karpak or Karpowership), and has a right
to present claims in relation to such shareholding, but if the local company’s contractual rights
— which, depending on the particular company, may constitute its only valuable “assets” — are
impaired, the investor may not claim damages for the impairment. The Claimant argues that
Pakistan’s argument is untenable as a matter of logic, and is also contradicted by its own assertion
that “/a/s a matter of international law, a shareholder: [...] may assert claims based on the host-
State’s treatment of the contracts and assets of the company in which it holds shares, but ‘only
to the extent that those claims are related to the effect that the measures taken against the
company’s assets have on the value of the claimant’s shares in such company.””'? Pakistan is
arguing against a tide of investment treaty jurisprudence that takes a flexible approach to the
s2!4

claims of shareholder:

(a.4) Causation

According to Karkey, Pakistan sought to argue at the Hearing that foreseeability is a necessary
element of causation. The Claimant argues that the source that Pakistan’s counsel relied upon in
doing so, the ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility and their commentary, make clear that
it is not a necessary element. In any event, the Tribunal is not constrained by a strict formulation
or standard of causation. Karkey does not dispute that there must be a causal link between the

Measures and its loss; however, it argues that if the Tribunal were to impose causation

subsidiaries,

requirements that are unnecessarily inflexible or onerous, it would run the risk identified in the
Naulilaa Case that the victim would “bear the burden of damage.”?!*

(a.5) Reasonable Certainty and Differentiated Standard for Existence vs. Extent of Loss

Karkey submits that the reasonable certainty standard is the predominant standard for
hypothetical losses (e.g. the projection of lost profits that would have been earned but for the
breach) and has been applied in that context again and again by tribunals.?!

Moreover, Karkey asserts that tribunals and adjudicators have recognized that a lesser standard
applies with respect to the extent of loss, once the existence of loss has been established. Pakistan
disputes this, mistakenly citing the award in SPP v. Egypt, where the tribunal explicitly stated
that “it is well settled that the fact that damages cannot be assessed with certainty is no reason
not to award damages when a loss has been incurred.” Karkey submits that this principle has

been recognized by several other tribunals (i.e. in Vivendi v. Argentina, Tecmed v. Mexico and in

Petrobart v. the Kyrgyz Republic).2""

v. Canada (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4), Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012

for example the Kaya Bey repair costs; and the cost increase claims (insurance, shipyard costs and liquidated damages
payable under the Lebanon contract (NAV-050)) is typically held to be the “preponderance of the evidence” or
“balance of probabilities” (see, e.g., RA-113, Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, (ICSID Case

fact reasonably certain. Karkey’s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 580.

Source: Karkey’s Post-Hearing Brief, § 263
The Claimant’s damages claim is summarized below.

(b.1) Unpaid Invoices and Termination Charges

Karkey submits that it is owed US$57,400,000 in unpaid invoices under the RSC
(US$47,702,505 in outstanding Monthly Services Fees, and US$9,736,297 in unpaid fuel
invoices). Pakistan and Mr. Haberman seek to reduce that amount to US$28,923,000.7!° A large
portion of the difference between the Parties’ experts — US$18,000,000 — is attributable to Mr.
Haberman’s exclusion of amounts owing to Karpak.”?° According to Karkey, for the reasons
summarized under Section IV(A)(4)(a.3) above, this deduction is unwarranted as a matter of

law.”?!

Karkey claims US$165.2 million in Termination Charges pursuant to Clause 4.6(b) of the RSC.

(b.2) Transport and Mobilization Costs under Clause 4.6(b) of the Contract

At the Hearing, Karkey submitted that a reasonable approximation of the transport and
mobilization costs under Clause 4.6(b) of the Contract is US$2,000,000.?”? Clause 4.6(b) of the
RSC provided:

In the event the Contract is terminated by SELLER before the Contract

designated expiry date, due to BUYER default, the BUYER shall pay ...

mobilization and transport charges to return the Equipment to SELLER’s

designated depot and also will be responsible for the exportation of the

aforementioned Equipment from Pakistan, for which time shall be of the

essence.
Karkey submits that it was never afforded the opportunity to designate a depot in accordance
with Clause 4.6(b), and thus the US$566,000 in transport costs that Mr. Haberman has identified
— which are the cost of transporting the Kaya Bey to Dubai (which likely would not have been
Karkey’s “designated depot”) — do not necessarily reflect the costs that Clause 4.6(b) was
designed to cover. Similarly, much of Karkey’s “Equipment”? has never been returned to it. In
the circumstances, Karkey’s claim of US$2,000,000 is entirely reasonable, and even

conservative.?4

(b.3) The Appropriate WACC

Karkey’s expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, calculates a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of
9% for Karkey’s Powerships.??°
According to Karkey, Mr. Haberman, the Respondent’s Expert, made several important

calculation of WACC.”° Mr.

 

ons under cross examination that reveal the flaws in his

 

cone!
Haberman’s WACC is also contradicted by the WACC calculated for Karkey by Fichtner
Management Consulting, a third party engaged by Karkey’s lenders, which was 10.7%
(consistent with Mr. Kaczmarek’s WACC and other benchmarks introduced in this case).2?7
Karkey argues that Mr. Haberman’s attempts to deflect this were unavailing. At the Hearing, Mr.
Haberman attempted to confuse the issue by suggesting that the mix of debt and equity in the
capital structure, or gearing, assumed by Fichtner were wrong.”**> Karkey submits that Mr.
Haberman’s conclusion and calculation are simply erroneous. He starts with the unconvincing

premise that Fichtner miscalculated the WACC by more than 50%. On re-direct, Mr. Haberman

23 The term “Equipment” is defined under Clause 2.A(d) of the RSC, The “Equipment” was on the Powerships and
thus much of it remains in Pakistan on the Alican Bey. Karkey’s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 597.

further exacerbated the confusion by purporting to recalculate Fichtner’s WACC using a different
gearing.>”? This was miscalculated, however, as Mr. Haberman’s earlier testimony indicated that
one cannot simply change the mix of debt and equity without simultaneously changing the cost
of equity.?*° Performing the recalculation properly would require reducing the beta, which in turn
would reduce the cost of equity — a significantly more involved calculation than that which Mr.
Haberman performed on re-direct.>! Mr. Haberman’s calculation on re-direct therefore
232

overstated the resulting WACC. Karkey states that, performed correctly,** Mr. Haberman’s re-

calculation would have validated the Fichtner WACC.*¥

(b.4) The Kaya Bey and Alican Bey Losses

Karkey submits that it is owed US$240.1 million for losses related to the Kaya Bey and US$445.7
million for losses related to the Alican Bey.**

With respect to the Kaya Bey, Karkey submits that Mr. Haberman had earlier identified several

adjustments to be made to Mr. Kaczmarek’s modelling. According to Karkey, as it explained at

the Hearing and as summarized in a table accompanying its closing statement,”*> several of those

adjustments were shown to be unwarranted in light of the concessions Mr. Haberman made at

the hearing. Specifically, Karkey asserts that Mr. Haberman conceded that:?°6

2° Karkey’s Post-Hearing Brief 233, citing Tr. Day 6, 1827.

29 Karkey’s Post-Hearing Brief 233. Mr. Haberman recognizes that reducing the proportion of debt would reduce
the cost of equity. See Tr. Day 6, 1735:1.

231 These calculations are explained in detail in both Mr. Kaczmarek’s and Mr. Haberman’s reports (see Kaczmarek,
First Expert Report, J 199 and Haberman, First Expert Report, Appendix M).

22 Le, Taking the following steps: (1) calculating the unlevered beta implied by Fichtner’s cost of equity and Mr.
Haberman’s assumptions (Unlevered Beta = 1); (2) recalculating a levered beta using Mr. Haberman’s assumed mix
of debt and equity (25% / 75%) (Levered Beta = 1.27); (3) recalculating a new cost of equity using the Levered Beta
implied by Haberman’s debt / equity split (Cost of equity = 9.3%); (4) recalculating a WACC using the 9.3% cost of
equity (WACC = 8.9%). Karkey’s Post-Hearing Brief, 233 and footnote 607.

- it was reasonable to assume, based on the available evidence,’ that the Kaya Bey
would take only one month to redeploy to Iraq?** (rather than the eight months that
he had modelled);

- the site installation costs of US$15,000,000 that he had used in his calculations were

too high;?°? and

- because he had incorrectly calculated the unit price under the Iraq I contract, his
criticism that Mr. Kaczmarek had cherry-picked the highest priced contract was

wrong.”4?

Karkey submits that Mr. Haberman’s remaining complaints regarding Mr. Kaczmarek’s
modelling relate to the retrofitting of turbochargers and tax optimization, both of which are

addressed separately below.?4!

With respect to the Alican Bey, Karkey argues that replacement value has no role to play in the
valuation of the Alican Bey, and that the Tribunal should instead apply Mr. Kaczmarek’s method
of valuation, which uses only projected revenue. The validity of Mr. Haberman’s model was
called into question by his concession that ex post information indicating market growth means
that the Alican Bey is “more valuable today.” The Claimant states that this concession implicitly
recognizes that a static replacement value will not adequately compensate Karkey for the

increased value of the Alican Bey.”

According to Karkey, in the event that the Tribunal were to prefer Mr. Haberman’s proposed
method, a crucial adjustment would be required.” It argues that Mr. Haberman unrealistically
assumes that Karkey will have monetized an award (in order to purchase a replacement ship for
the Alican Bey) by August 2016. Several factors make that date unrealistic. The Claimant states,

for example, that if an award favourable to Karkey were issued, Pakistan could seek annulment

237 See, e.g., C-050 (CONFIDENTIAL), C-052 (CONFIDENTIAL).

28 Tr, 1619:22. As already noted, Mr. Haberman also conceded that “/raq was prepared to take these ships or wanted
these ships in October 2012.” (Tr. Day 6, 1612:5).

of the award, which could signify a delay of over two years in the collection of the relevant
Award proceeds.“ The Tribunal must take into account this factor, as well as the myriad other

contingencies that could delay receipt by Karkey of the relevant funds.”4>

Karkey accepts that one adjustment to Mr. Kaczmarek’s modelling regarding the Alican Bey is
required: that the Sri Lanka contract originally used as an input should be replaced with Mr.
Kaczmarek’s “New Country” contract, as it more accurately matches the terms of Karkey’s
current contracts."4° As with the Kaya Bey, two inputs remain in dispute — retrofitting of

turbochargers and tax optimization.”*”

(b.5) Cash Flow Impairment and Financial Constraint

According to Karkey, at the Hearing, Mr. Haberman accepted that the loss of revenue under the
RSC had a substantial impact on Karkey’s operations, agreeing that such impact was
approximately 60% of Karkey’s operating income.”** Mr. Haberman further accepted that for a
company with Karkey’s business model, it could reasonably be expected that operating income
would be reinvested into growth, such as ship-building.4? Mr. Colak, Karkey’s Chief Financial
Officer,?° gave a detailed account of the negative impact of the Measures on Karkey’s
relationship with its lenders,”*! explaining that the drastic loss of assets via the detention of the
Vessels, as well as its loss of the revenue under the RSC, severely impacted its ability to provide

half of our equity at that time and ratio, so making an impairment on those assets means that we are losing half our
equity and one-third of our all assets, and that it was a very bad impact financially for our group, actually”. See

Karkey submits that, to the extent it remains necessary given Mr. Haberman’s concessions, the
authorities on which Pakistan relies in this context can be distinguished. Pakistan highlights the
NAFTA case of S.D. Myers v. Canada? as “perhaps one of the most relevant cases,”*™* but the
situation addressed in that case was very different from that here. Karkey has provided detailed
evidence of the specific projects that were thwarted by the financial constraint imposed by the
Measures. By contrast, in S.D. Myers, the claimant had failed to make “clear what SDMI would

have done with the money if it were to have been earned. It had a number of options.”?*°

(b.6) The Delayed Construction and Rehabilitation of Karkey’s Powerships
- The Construction Program

Karkey submits that the loss of expected cash flows from the operation of the Kaya Bey and
Alican Bey in Pakistan hampered Karkey’s ability to enlarge its operational fleet, causing it
damages.?°6

According to Karkey, at the hearing, Pakistan complained that Mr. Kaczmarek had not modelled
Karkey’s construction program delay damages on the basis of the contracts under which the
vessels ultimately commenced operating.”*’ In response to that complaint, and in light of Mr.
Haberman’s concession in his second report that “prima facie there may have been a period of
approximately 15 months when no new vessels could be constructed,” Karkey has prepared the
sensitivity analysis shown in the table below. According to Karkey, that analysis (which excludes
KPS 2°58) demonstrates the conservative nature of Karkey’s construction delay claim. Excluding
KPS 2, that claim is US$309,000,000 (see the “Original Claim” column). Recalculated on the
bases that Pakistan suggests (or that its expert concedes) may be reasonable (i.e., using actual
contracts, and a 15-month delay period), that claim is actually higher by an amount between

US$87,000,000 and US$100,000,000.7

The Claimant argues that the sensitivity analysis set out above demonstrates the untenable nature
of Pakistan’s complaints — Pakistan cannot maintain that Karkey’s construction delay damages
claim is unreasonable, when it would be even higher if calculated on the basis that Pakistan

suggests.

26 [.e., the expected operation dates included in Mr. Kaczmarek’s original analysis, based on Mr. Karadeniz’s
evidence. See Kaczmarek, Second Expert Report, § 227, Table 24.

261 For commencement dates, see NAV-094 (Lebanon, 4 September 2013); C-717 (Ghana, 18 December 2015); C-
718 (Indonesia, 27 January 2016). As KPS 12 has not yet commenced operations, the “New Country” contract is
used. Earnings are calculated on the basis of monthly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(“EBITDA”), a common proxy for cash flow. The assumptions used (installed capacity, capacity factors, and
projected operating costs) are specific to each ship, and are drawn from Kaczmarek, Second Expert Report, Appendix
4.2. This calculation of damages differs from the calculation of loss that Mr. Kaczmarek originally undertook for
the construction delay claim, which had calculated the reduction in value of the vessels based on lost profits.
EBITDA differs in that it does not take into account, for example, capital expenditure, taxation on future revenue, or
interest on historical cash flows. However, although it is not an “apples to apples” comparison (since the premise
for the original claim was based on lost profits), EBIDTA can validly be used as a reasonableness test.

- Karkey’s Iraq Vessel Rehabilitation Program

Karkey claims US$44.5 million as damages related to the delay in the Iraq Powership

rehabilitation program.”

Karkey submits that Mr. Nickerson confirmed at the Hearing that the retrofit of turbochargers
increases engine efficiency by 15-20%. Karkey states that Mr. Nickerson’s testimony also
addressed several of Mr. Haberman’s and Mr. Waller’s complaints about the rehabilitation
program. Mr. Nickerson explained, for example, that the rehabilitation could take place with the
powerships in situ, thereby avoiding impact on available dispatch.?

The Claimant notes that Mr. Haberman also complains that he can see no causal link between
the Measures and the suspension of the rehabilitation. According to Karkey, the causal link is the
impact of the Measures on Karkey’s financing.?©’ Mr. Haberman, fixed in his ex ante world, also
asserts that there is inadequate evidence of how the rehabilitation program would proceed.
Karkey asserts that ex post information answers this question unequivocally: as Mr. Karadeniz
explained in his third witness statement, following the release of the Kaya Bey, Karkey

recommenced the rehabilitation program at a slowed pace.?*

This demonstrates not only the
causal link (once the Kaya Bey was released, the financial constraint that had halted the program
was alleviated, and the program could continue), but also that there is no uncertainty that the

rehabilitation program was always slated to take place.2

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 81 of 310

(b.7) The Delay to the Geothermal Project

270

According to the Claimant, Mr. Haberman’s own analysis of documents relating to the
geothermal project indicates that, except for the delay it experienced due to the Measures, it was
an active and ongoing project.?”! The project is underpinned by a 30-year concession,”” and as
explained by Mr. Karadeniz, it is “not exposed to market fluctuation but is instead a regulated
and secured cash flow project based on a guaranteed feed in tariff by the renewable power

992

generation legislation in Turkey.”?” Thus, there were no other external factors that could have
delayed the project, aside from the financial constraint that Karkey experienced due to the
Measures, which impacted the financing for the project (there is no dispute that the project was

financed by debt?”).?”°

The Claimant notes that Mr. Haberman’s complaints regarding Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculation of
the losses resulting from the delay to the geothermal project were raised only in his second report
(despite the fact that calculations for the geothermal project delay were fully set out in Mr.
Kaczmarek’s first report). Mr. Haberman has offered no alternative calculations. Karkey asserts

that those criticisms are invalid for, inter alia, the following reasons:?”°

a. Mr. Haberman criticizes the evidence upon which Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculations are
based, including a feasibility study that Karkey provided to Turkey IS Bank for

obtaining financing.?”’ This document, used by a lender to a:

 

s the geothermal

project, is in fact an ideal source of contemporaneous information about the project.

b. Mr. Haberman has misunderstood how Mr. Kaczmarek’s modelling accounts for tax,
which leads him to assume that an error has been made. There is no error. Mr.
Kaczmarek has simply not applied taxes to historical cash flows, an approach he made

quite clear?”

(b.8) Cost Increases
- Insurance

260. Karkey claims US$7.8 million for increased insurance costs.”*°

261.

According to Karkey, Pakistan has devoted considerable time to causation in its pleadings,
asserting that it was a disclosure issue that led to the cancellation of Karkey’s insurance
policies.”8! The Claimant submits that, even if such were the case (which it is not?*?), it is
irrelevant for present purposes. Karkey made a claim under its insurance policy as a result of the
Measures.”*? Following an attempt by the insurer to avoid coverage, there was a dispute, which
was ultimately settled with the insurer agreeing to pay Karkey US$55,000,000.7*
Unsurprisingly, Karkey’s policy with the insurer was not renewed and Karkey was forced to
obtain new insurance, at a higher cost. The Claimant states that these circumstances would not
have arisen had Karkey not been forced to make a claim as a result of the Measures. As Mr.

285 there is no

Karadeniz explained, Karkey’s risk profile has otherwise remained static;
explanation for the increased premia other than the Measures, which forced Karkey to claim
under its insurance policy. Karkey asserts that the pages of discussion that Pakistan devotes to

the purported disclosure issue are beside the point.?*°

Karkey states that Mr. Haberman does not dispute that Karkey’s insurance costs were in fact
higher after the Measures.”*” His complaints regarding Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculations appear to
be based in part on his inability to replicate them.** According to Karkey, this criticism is not a
valid one, as Mr. Kaczmarek’s reports were accompanied by Excel spreadsheets setting out his

calculations.?*

- Shipyard Costs

The Claimant submits that the damages experts are not in dispute over the amount of
US$12.5 million claimed in relation to the increased shipyard costs that Karkey incurred because
of its inability to pay the contractor SEDEF GEM INSAATI A.S. (“SEDEF”). These costs are
causally derived from the financial constraint detailed above. Karkey contracted with SEDEF for
repair and conversion work on KPS 7, KPS 9, KPS 10 and KPS 11. As a result of the Measures
and the resulting financial constraint, payment to SEDEF was delayed. SEDEF agreed to
complete the conversion of KPS 7 and KPS 9, but doing so meant that the vessels would be in

dry dock for longer than expected. The costs claimed reflect the additional dry docking costs.””°

Pakistan maintains that there is no evidence that the shipyard costs were caused by the Measures.
In this regard, the Claimant maintains that the Tribunal need look no further than the SEDEF
protocol submitted as Exhibit NAV-093. Karkey argues that this document, signed by a third
party with no interest in these proceedings, clearly states that “the Owner notified the Contractor
of its dispute with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and the payment difficulties that the Owner
faces as a result of lack of financing from its lenders and its increased costs...” and “[t]he
Contractor’s works for the conversion and repair of KPS 9 and KPS 7 were delayed because of
the Owner’s delay in Owner’s Supply and the Owner’s Works as a result of the Owner's dispute
with Pakistan as detailed in the Preamble. Therefore, additional costs were incurred by the
Contractor.”**! Pakistan also complains that this document cannot serve as evidence of the

payment difficulties by Karkey to which it refers.?°* Karkey submits that this

criticism, since the document shows precisely the dynamic that evolved — directly as a result of
the Measures — between Karkey and its contractor. In any event, the record contains ample

additional evidence of the financial constraint caused by the Measures.?%

- Lebanon Contract

The Claimant submits that it intended to deploy KPS 7 and KPS 9 under the Lebanon contract.*
As detailed above, SEDEF’s work on the vessels to prepare them for that deployment was
interrupted and the deployment was in turn delayed. Karkey was therefore forced to pay
liquidated damages per the terms of the Lebanon contract in an amount (US$5,668,350) that was
clearly set out in a letter from the Lebanese Ministry of Water and Power to Karkey of 5

November 2013.7°> This amount is not in dispute between the experts.?°°

(b.9) Kaya Bey Repair Costs

According to the Claimant, Mr. Kaczmarek included in his actual scenario for the Kaya Bey
US$43,000,000 in repair costs, consisting of US$29,600,000 in costs incurred to date, and
US$14,000,000 in estimated future costs (based on evidence from Mr. Nickerson?””). Although
the estimated costs have not yet been incurred, the loss which gives rise to them (the damage to

the Kaya Bey) has crystallized.

(b.10) Wasted Costs

According to Karkey, the essence of Mr. Haberman’s complaint regarding Karkey’s wasted costs
claim in the amount of US$23.9 million is that it is based on trial balances. Karkey argues that
this complaint is unreasonable given that (1) trial balances are output from Karkey’s SAP
accounting system, which is audited by a reputable international accounting firm;7? and (2) the
only way that Mr. Haberman’s complaint could be addressed would be to undertake the

unreasonably onerous task of reviewing hundreds of thousands of pages of invoices. As Mr.

Kaczmarek explained, this would effectively entail a technical and financial audit that would take

at least a year 3°

(b.11) Interest

The Claimant submits that the most appropriate rate of interest is that proposed by Pakistan and
agreed by the Parties in the RSC for delayed payments in the event of a “Dispute,” which was
12%.**' This rate is particularly appropriate concerning the damages that relate to Pakistan’s
specific contractual obligations (namely, the Termination Charge, the transport and mobilization
costs under Clause 4.6(b) of the RSC, and unpaid invoices), since a 12% interest rate for those
damages is required by the terms of the RSC.*” The same rate also should apply to the remainder

of Karkey’s damages.°”

According to Karkey, if the Tribunal were to disagree that the “Delayed Payment” rate should
be used, or were to conclude that it should only be used for part of Karkey’s damages, the
appropriate rate would be one that reflects Pakistan’s cost of borrowing. Mr. Kaczmarek has
calculated this to be 8.9%, and Mr. Haberman does not appear to disagree with how Mr.
Kaczmarek arrived at the figure of 8.9% (although he disagrees this is the appropriate rate). Such
rate takes into account the fact that Karkey in effect has been rendered an unwilling lender to
Pakistan. Karkey asserts that this should guide the Tribunal’s consideration of an appropriate
interest rate (rather than Karkey’s cost of borrowing (7%), which Mr. Haberman advocates,**

but which Pakistan itself does not appear to agree is appropriate).*°>

Karkey argues that, in any event, the Tribunal should not apply the “investments alternative” rate

that Pakistan argues for in extremely brief terms (but which is not supported by Mr.

 

Haberman).*°° According to the Claimant, the sole b: that Pakistan advances for the use of a
US Treasury bond rate as an “investments alternative” is that it was applied in Yukos.*°’ Without
more, this is neither a sound nor adequate basis for the Tribunal to apply the same rate here. The
Claimant notes that the Yukos tribunal itself highlighted that “the practice of past tribunals is
varied and inconsistent and does not provide clear guidance. Thus, as is well established, the
Tribunal has a wide margin of discretion to determine the rate of interest applicable.
Moreover, the award in Yukos turned on the particular facts and circumstances of that case>°?
Karkey states that it is insufficient for Pakistan simply to point to the fact that the Yukos tribunal
applied a US Treasury bond rate, as a purported justification for having such rate apply in the

present case.3!°

(5) Counterclaim

In a nutshell, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal cannot exercise jurisdiction over any of
Pakistani’s counterclaims. The Turkey-Pakistan BIT does not extend the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
to the arbitration of counterclaims, or for that matter, to any claims brought by the respondent-

State. Consequently, according to Karkey, the submission of its claims to arbitration cannot be

 

construed as an expression of consent to the arbitration of counterclaims; nor has Karkey

otherwise expressed such consent. The Claimant argues that Pakistan has no persuasive answer.
Instead, it reiterates its reliance on the so-called ipso facto theory of consent to counterclaim
jurisdiction, even though Karkey has demonstrated that such a theory (a) is contrary to the

overwhelming weight of the jurisprudence; (b) impermissibly ignores the effet utile of Article 46

of the ICSID Convention, which articulates the requirements for a tribunal’s exercise of

jurisdiction over counterclaims; and (c) in any event, fails under its own logic.*!!

Furthermore, Karkey argues that the Tribunal lacks competence to hear Pakistan’s counterclaims,
which seek, in essence, recognition and enforcement of the Judgment and orders of the Pakistani
Supreme Court. According to Karkey, an ICSID tribunal is not competent to recognize domestic
court judgments and is also not competent to enforce — through vague notions of unjust
enrichment — a domestic court judgment. Unjust enrichment is not a recognized “general
principle of law”, lacks concrete contours, and is not a claim suitable for adjudication by an

international tribunal?

Finally, and in any event, Karkey submits that Pakistan’s counterclaims fail on their merits. The
Tribunal cannot recognize the Supreme Court Judgment because it resulted from a grossly unjust
procedure, in which the court ignored material evidence and committed numerous other
procedural improprieties. Karkey states that Pakistan itself argued as much in its formal
submissions to the Supreme Court seeking reconsideration of the Judgment, and it should not be
heard to argue otherwise now. According to the Claimant, these gross procedural deficiencies
are underscored by the fact that in these ICSID proceedings Pakistan has failed — without
adequate explanation, and in breach of its disclosure obligations — to locate and produce the very
same material evidence that Pakistan had submitted to the Supreme Court during the RPP Case
(but that is not publicly available, or otherwise accessible to Karkey) and later faulted the

Supreme Court for failing to consider.>'>

With respect to Pakistan’s claim for unjust enrichment, Pakistan altogether failed to establish
that Karkey was in fact enriched, or that any enrichment — to the extent there were any, which is
denied — could be deemed unjust.?!*

In view of the above, Karkey requests the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction over Pakistan’s

counterclaims, or alternatively, dismiss such counterclaims on the merits.

(6) The Claimant’s Request for Relief

76. The Claimant’s latest request for relief was set forth at paragraph 264 of its Post-Hearing Brief,

and read as follows:

31s

[...] Karkey respectfully requests that the Tribunal:
c. Declare that it has jurisdiction to address all of Karkey’s claims;

d. Declare that Pakistan, through the various wrongful acts and omissions
described above and in Karkey’s Submissions, has violated its obligations
under the BIT with respect to Karkey and its investment in Pakistan,
including, as described in the Reply, Pakistan’s obligations to abstain from
expropriation of Karkey’s property; to afford Karkey’s investment fair and
equitable treatment and full protection and security; to refrain from
arbitrary or unreasonable treatment of Karkey’s investment; to observe the
commitments and obligations it entered into with respect to Karkey and its
investments in Pakistan; and to ‘permit in good faith all transfers related
to an investment to be made freely and without unreasonable delay. 3!°

e. Award compensation to Karkey for the harm that Karkey has suffered as a
result of Pakistan’s violations of the BIT with respect to Karkey and its
investments in Pakistan, in an amount of no less than US$1,482,200,000
plus interest, compounded annually at either

the monthly interest rate applied by NAB in its October 2012
calculation, which was I percent per month or 12 percent per year, until
the date of payment of the Award, or

the Pakistani sovereign bond yield (which has averaged 8.9% per year
fiom the beginning of April 2012 until the end of June 2015), until the
date of payment of the Award

ff. Decline jurisdiction over Pakistan’s counterclaims, or alternatively, dismiss

such counterclaims on their merits;

Issue an award in Karkey’s favor of all fees and costs of this arbitration,
including all fees and expenses of Karkey’s attorneys and external advisers;
and

og

h. Grant such other relief to Karkey as the Tribunal may deem fair and proper.

The Respondent’s Position
(1) Jurisdiction

a. Issue 1: Was Karkey’s investment established in accordance with Pakistani law, as
required by Article I(2) of the Treaty?

(a.1) Issue 1.1: What is the correct legal standard for determining the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

pursuant to Article I(2) of the Treaty?

According to Pakistan, illegality in the making of the investment will deprive the Tribunal of
jurisdiction pursuant to Article I(2) of the Treaty, which requires that Karkey’s investment was
established “in conformity with” Pakistani law. Karkey’s investment was not established “in
conformity with” Pakistani law as a result of: (a) breaches of Pakistani procurement and other
laws; (b) fraud; and (c) corruption and corrupt practices (including as defined in Section 9 of the

NAO).3!6

Pakistan submits that its principal claim relates to material changes to contract terms post-bid
which favoured Karkey in breach of any or all of the following fundamental principles of

Pakistani law:3!7
(i) Rule 40 of the PPRA Rules prohibits negotiations in a public tender;

(ii) Section 9(a)(ii) of the NAO, which defines what constitutes “corruption and corrupt
practices” as the obtaining of any valuable thing without consideration or for
inadequate consideration. This goes beyond the payment of bribe and captures many
if not all of the changes that occurred to Karkey’s contract because, as Karkey’s
Pakistani law expert explained, even if material changes are not captured by the
PPRA Rules, “there will be other laws which would take care of it. Q. What other

laws? A. Generally, corruption laws;”

(iii) Article 9 of the Constitution. The Khawaja case demonstrates by reference to earlier

Article 9 of the Constitution, which is a fundamental right pursuant to which “the

national wealth/resources must remain fully protected;” and

(iv) General principles of fairness and transparency, which are enforced pursuant to the

Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.

79. Each of the breaches of Pakistani law relied on by Pakistan occurred in the making of the
investment (which included the 2008 RSC, the 2009 RSC and Amendment No. | entered into in

December 2009), including at its inception:*!*

(i) The alleged fraud occurred between July 2008 (when Karkey submitted its Bid) and
September 2008 (when Karkey was notified that it was the successful bidder and

would be issued with a Letter of Award);

(ii) The alleged misprocurement occurred between 6 November 2008 (following the
issue of the Letter of Award to Karkey) and 9 December 2009 (when Karkey and
Lakhra entered into the First Amendment to the 2009 RSC, which contained further

extension of the Target COD in breach of Pakistani procurement laws); and

(iii) | The alleged corruption and corruption practices (as defined by Pakistani law)
occurred from at least 7 June 2008 (when Mr. Zulgarnain first held himself out as
being the authorized representative of Karkey, notwithstanding that he had no
agreement in place at the time), and throughout the lifetime of Karkey’s 2008 and
2009 RSCs (as many if not all of the changes secured by Karkey prior to and after
the 2008 RSC constitute not just a misprocurement but a breach of Section 9(a)(ii)
of the NAO because they were a “valuable thing” that was “obtain[ed]...without

consideration, or for consideration which he knows to be inadequate”).

280. Moreover, according to Pakistan, each of the breaches of Pakistani law (i) occurred as a result of
an act or omission by Karkey (fraud and corruption, including under Section 9 of the NAO, were
necessarily acts committed by Karkey); and/or (ii) was within Karkey’s knowledge or should
have been, had Karkey conducted the due diligence which it represented that it had when it

submitted its Bid.*!° The Respondent states that Karkey cannot rely on ignorance of those laws

(or on the PPIB’s involvement in the bidding process) to avoid a finding that its investment was

established in breach of Article I(2). Wilful or negligent ignorance of the law is not a defence.*?”

(a.2) Issue 1.2: In determining jurisdiction under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, what

role does Pakistani law play?

According to Pakistan, jurisdiction should be assessed by reference to the ICSID Convention and
the Treaty. However, the Parties’ consent to arbitration under (and the object and purpose of) the
Treaty is limited to (the promotion of) an “investment” within the definition provided in Article
I(2). The wording of Article I(2) requires a consideration of Pakistani law in order to determine
conformity with it?!

The Respondent states that the Supreme Court of Pakistan is the ultimate source of Pakistani law.
Thus, according to Pakistan, when conducting its jurisdictional investigation, the Tribunal should
treat the Judgment on the issues of Pakistani law relevant to Karkey’s investment as authoritative,
i.e. only if the Tribunal finds that there has been a denial of justice can the Judgment be
ignored.*” It follows that Karkey’s contract is void ab initio under Pakistani law in accordance
with the Judgment and its investment was established in material breach of fundamental

principles of Pakistani law and contrary to Article I(2) of the Treaty. As held in the Judgment:*>

The contracts of all the RPPs...were entered into _in contravention of

law/PPRA Rules, which, besides suffering from other irregularities, violated
the principle of transparency and fair and open competition, therefore, the
same are declared to be non-transparent, illegal and void ab initio>**

 

Pakistan notes that, among the factors relied on by the Supreme Court in reaching its conclusion,
were the increase in the Advance Payment of 14%, the deferral of the 6% withholding tax and
the delay in achieving Target COD (in the case of Karkey, that delay was nearly two years). The

Supreme Court relied on the independent review by and conclusions of the Asia Development

misprocurement that had already been voiced in 2009.575

(a.3) Issue 1.3: Was Karkey’s investment established in breach of Pakistani procurement laws

in breach of Article I(2) of the Treaty?

Pakistan submits that Issue 1.3 only arises if the Tribunal considers it necessary to determine the
issues already decided by the Supreme Court. The issues in this section relate to the period after
Karkey was issued with the Letter of Award (on 6 November 2008) and up to the signing of the
2008 RSC, the 2009 RSC and Amendment No. | in December 2009. Pakistan’s position on the
issue of fraud, which deals with the earlier period when Karkey submitted its Bid (July 2008)
and was declared the successful bidder (September 2009) is dealt with at Section IV(B)(1)(a.4(1))

below.

Pakistan states that the changes to Karkey’s contract (which includes the 2008 RSC, 2009 RSC

and Amendment No. 1) must be assessed by reference to the PPRA Rules (including Rule 40)

 

and by reference to Pakistani corruption laws, including Section 9(a)(ii) of the NAO. Moreover,

the Respondent asserts that the relevant test under Pakistani law for a:

 

sing whether a change
to the terms of a contract procured by way of public tender violates Pakistani law is summarized
in the Khawaja case, in which the contract in question was set aside and the relevant corruption

agency ordered to investigate on the following basis:*?”

(i) “if material changes are brought about...subsequent to the bidding, this will in fact
negate the notion of a fair and open competitive bidding process...all such changes as
have been discussed below were material in nature and had been made to benefit JJVL.
These changes were never available to other pre-qualified parties” which Karkey

appears to agree with; and

(ii) If a “material change...represents a significant loss to the State...and thus ultimately

to the People of Pakistan”.

Pakistan notes that Karkey’s witnesses have claimed that they were ready to sign the Draft RSC

in the form provided for in the RFP. This is disputed by Pakistan, as demonstrated below.*7*
- Letter of Credit

According to Pakistan, there is no dispute that the letter of credit provided for in the 2008 RSC
was changed to a Sovereign Guarantee in the 2009 RSC. The issue for the Tribunal is whether
the beneficial changes that were introduced in Karkey’s 2008 RSC were prompted by allegedly
detrimental changes to the Letter of Credit provision in Clause 4.5 of the 2008 RSC (Karkey’s
case) or whether a straightforward review of the changes to Clause 4.5 as between the Draft RSC
and 2008 RSC (and the track change versions in between) demonstrates that they were not
(Pakistan’s case). The Respondent asserts that it is for the Tribunal to determine under Issue 1.3
whether, as a matter of Pakistani law, the Draft RSC that went out to tender provided for a
confirmed letter of credit (i.e. bank guarantee, counter-guarantee by an international bank) or just

an irrevocable letter of credit.”

It is Pakistan’s position that, since there was no requirement for a confirmed letter of credit in
the Draft RSC, there is no justification for these or any other crucial changes to the 2008 RSC.
The alleged downgrading from a confirmed letter of credit to a letter of credit was, according to
Karkey, the “one critical change” from which “[a]Il of the other Contract revisions that Pakistan
discusses flowed...and can only be understood in relation to that change.” According to Pakistan,
it follows that, in the absence of any requirement for a confirmed letter of credit in the first place,
the changes to the 2008 RSC were to the material benefit of Karkey (including in particular the
doubling of the Advance Payment) and corresponding detriment to Pakistan. Moreover, and

contrary to Karkey’s assertion that they were in return for the downgrading of the letter of credit

 

from confirmed to unconfirmed, they were conferred in the absence of any consideration flowing

from Karkey.>*°

- Advance Payment

The 2008 RSC provided for a 14.16% Advance Payment, in place of a 7% Advance Payment
provided for in the Draft RSC contained in the tender documents. Pakistan submits that this
change was proposed by Karkey and that there is no contemporaneous documentary support for
Karkey’s claim that the increase was first proposed by Pakistan and no evidence of who is alleged

to have proposed it or when.**!

As the ADB Report makes clear, there was and is no justification for the increase from 7% to
14.16% in the Advance Payment, regardless of whether Karkey was ever entitled to a confirmed
letter of credit: “/t/he increase in down payment and provision of a sovereign guarantee changed
the financing cost and risk profile, particularly equity risk in favour of the potential Sellers [i.e.

Karkey]...[and was] contrary to good procurement practices.”

- FPLC (Fuel Payment Letter of Credit)

The Draft RSC did not provide for a FPLC (or the sharing of any associated confirmation
charges) and the letter of credit in draft Clause 4.5(c) referred only to the Monthly Rental Service
Fees. The FPLC (and related provisions) was a new term introduced to the 2008 RSC.**5 Pakistan
submits that the FPLC was a benefit to Karkey (as Mr. Zafar accepts in his Second Report), as it
removed a risk that Karkey knew from the outset it was required to bear (the risk of supplying
and paying for fuel in the first instance). It was a detriment to Lakhra, which had to fund 50% of
the costs of providing the FPLC, as well as to Pakistan if and when Karkey decided to cease
generating electricity for non-payment of fuel and/or for failing to establish the FPLC, regardless

of whether Lakhra was in fact paying for fuel. **
- Interconnection

According to Pakistan, Clause 2(d)(IX) of the Draft RSC provided that responsibility for
interconnection lay with Karkey. Clause 2(d)(IX) was removed from the 2008 RSC. The change

was a benefit to Karkey which avoided the majority of the cost of interconnection (it paid only

US$500,000) and, importantly, never reduced its tariff which was agreed before Clause 2(d)(IX)
was removed and which must have included a US$10 million assumption for the cost of
interconnection. Not to do so would have made no commercial sense in light of Clause 2(d)(IX),

as it would represent a cost recoverable through the tariff which was omitted or overlooked.***

Karkey’s own case is that its contribution to the cost of interconnection was only US$500,000.
The Respondent asserts that, judged at the time of the 2008 RSC (when misprocurement
occurred), Karkey therefore benefitted by providing for recovery of an additional US$9.5 million
through its tariff in relation to a cost that it never bore — while Lakhra (whose obligations were

guaranteed by Pakistan) was charged a higher tariff than it otherwise should have done.**°
- Definition of and extensions to Target COD

Pakistan submits that the RFP was clear, as was Clause 4.4(b) of the Draft RSC, that Karkey was
to achieve Target COD within 6 months from issuance of the LOA. Karkey understood this at
the time and it was the basis on which its Bid was declared responsive. Clause 4.4(b) of the 2008
RSC changed the definition of the Target COD, which was then extended further in 2009 RSC
and Amendment No. | in December 2009. Pakistan maintains that this was a change to the benefit
of Karkey (who had longer to achieve Target COD and whose third-party funding arrangements
were conditional on receipt of the Advance Payment from Lakhra). Pakistan further argues that
it was to the detriment of Pakistan, which urgently needed emergency power and which had
rejected Cavalier’s bid on the basis that it could not achieve the Target COD, thus reducing

competition.*°”
- Withholding Tax (“WHT”)

Pakistan submits that Lakhra was entitled (and obligated) to deduct 6% WHT from all payments
to Karkey, including the Advance Payment as per Clause 4.5(1) of the Draft RSC, Clause 4.5(0)
of the 2008 RSC, and Clause 4.5(0) of the 2009 RSC. Pakistan asserts that Lakhra, PEPCO and
the Federal Board of Revenue all confirmed that this was the correct legal position. The approval
of the ECC was therefore sought and obtained to this change, and payment was ultimately

deferred (although only after the FBR had been persuaded to change its mind that the ECC

decision even applied to Karkey — the reason why it did so is unexplained). According to the
Respondent, this change was to Karkey’s benefit, since it increased the cash amount Karkey
received. Further, receipt of the full Advance Payment is alleged by Karkey to have been critical
to its ability to draw down on third party funding for the construction of its ships. Yet the funding
for construction of Karkey’s ships was a matter entirely for Karkey and was not covered by the

contract with Lakhra.5**
- Conclusion

According to Pakistan, the changes introduced to the Draft RSC altered the transactional balance
in Karkey’s favour, were severely detrimental to Pakistan, were unsupported by consideration
flowing from Karkey and were a breach of Pakistani procurement and other laws.*°
(a.4.(1)) Issue 1.4(1): Was Karkey’s investment established by way of fraud in breach of
Article I(2) of the Treaty?
According to Pakistan, Karkey investment in Pakistan exists only as a result of its participation

a result of, a public tender. In other words,

 

in, and the issue of a letter of award and contract
Karkey could only ever have qualified as an investor if its Bid was responsive to the PPIB’s bid
documents — including the RFP. Any fraud committed during the tender process and which
induced the PPIB to issue Karkey with its Letter of Award would therefore deny the Tribunal
jurisdiction because Karkey’s investment would not be established “in conformity with”

Pakistani law.*“°

In order for a bid to be considered responsive and even potentially qualify for a letter of award,
bidders were required to confirm that they could meet a Target COD of “/80 days from issuance
of Letter of Award” (Milestone A). Any bids indicating a completion period later than the Target

COD would be rejected and the bidder could never become an investor.**!

Knowing this, Karkey represented that it could comply with Milestone A in Proforma X of its
Bid, its “Proposed Project Schedule”. Pakistan asserts that the evidence shows that Karkey’s
representation was knowingly untrue and/or that Karkey was reckless as to its truth because it
had no reasonable basis for believing in good faith that it could achieve Milestone A. Pakistan

concludes that the Tribunal therefore has no jurisdiction under Article I(2) of the Treaty.**”

Moreover, Pakistan submits that the relevant standard of proof which the Tribunal should apply
to Pakistan’s claim of fraud (and corruption) is the balance of probabilities (i.e. whether it is
“more likely than not”). Numerous tribunals have applied this standard specifically to claims of

fraud.

The Respondent asserts that the transgressions by Karkey in this case are on all fours with those
highlighted in the Inceysa v. El Salvador case. According to Pakistan, Karkey not only obfuscated
the facts relevant to assessing its Net Worth, it also misrepresented its ability to meet the Target
COD, which was the essential criteria on the basis of which a bid would be accepted or rejected
as non-responsive. This was a violation of the obligation of good faith (which was also expressly
imposed on all parties in connection with the RFP) as well as being fraudulent under Pakistani

law 34

Pakistan submits that at the time of submitting its Bid and making the representation in Proforma
X regarding its ability to achieve Milestone A, Karkey’s ship were not built. In order for Karkey
to satisfy the Tribunal that its representation was true, Karkey must therefore show that, at the
time of submitting its Bid, it believed in good faith that it could build, deliver and commission
its ships within “80 days from issuance of Letter of Award” in order to achieve the Target COD
referred to in Clauses 2.2.1 and 6.3.2 of the RFP and to which Karkey committed in its Bid.

Pakistan argues that Karkey makes no attempt in its written evidence to explain that it believed
in the truth of its ability to achieve Milestone A. The Respondent asserts that, in his third witness

statement, Mr. Karadeniz was clear that Karkey believed it could achieve only Milestone B

(further, that Milestone B was the deadline Karkey considered it had to meet).*4° Pakistan
respectfully requests that the Tribunal accept Mr. Karadeniz’s evidence in his third witness

statement and find, in respect of both the Bid and the 27 August 2008 letter,*4” that:*48
(i) the undisputed statements of fact that Karkey could achieve Milestone A were false;
(ii) Karkey had no belief that it could and would achieve Milestone A; and
(iii) Karkey had no intention to perform the promises it gave to meet Milestone A.

Alternatively, Pakistan submits that Karkey was reckless as to the truth of its representation*”
According to Pakistan, the evidence shows that an ordinary timeframe for construction, delivery
and commissioning of a powership is between 18 to 29 months. Bearing in mind that its ships
were not built at the time of submitting its Bid, Karkey could have had no good faith belief in its

ability to achieve Milestone A following an ordinary time frame for construction.>°°
Pakistan concludes that Karkey committed fraud under at least three heads of Pakistani law:*°!

(i) A false statement of fact, without belief (or reasonable belief) in its truth, with the

intent to deceive or induce another to enter into a contract;

(ii) A promise made without any intention of performing it, with the intent to deceive

or induce another to enter into a contract; and

(iii) A false statement of fact, in order to influence a procurement process or the

execution of a contract.

Moreover, to the extent the Tribunal determines it to be relevant, as a matter of international law
(on which Karkey relies), Karkey is required to act in good faith and without fraud or deceit.>>?
Karkey committed fraud under international law, through its representations in its Bid and the 27

August 2008 letter: 3

(i) _ By misrepresenting a material fact (its ability to achieve Milestone A, or even

Milestone B);

(ii) | Because Pakistan relied on a material fact (as evidenced by the contemporaneous

correspondence);>*4 and/or

(iii) | Because Karkey intended to deceive Pakistan, or was at least reckless, as to its
ability to achieve Milestone A (or even Milestone B) through its false

representations.

In its closing submissions at the Evidentiary Hearing, Karkey’s counsel suggested that (i)
Pakistan had not established any detrimental reliance on Karkey’s proposed Project Schedule
and, conversely, that (ii) any delays in achieving the target schedule would have been remedied

through the contractual mechanism that was explicitly established for that scenario.*°>

In light of the contemporaneous evidence, the Respondent argues that there can be little doubt
that Pakistan relied on Karkey’s representations in issuing Karkey with the Letter of Award. As
to “detrimental” reliance, Pakistan maintains that is not an aspect of the test for fraud under
international law and that Karkey has not put forward any persuasive evidence that it is. In any
event, according to Pakistan, it has suffered detriment as a consequence of its reliance on

Karkey’s representations:*°°

(i) The delays in achieving the target schedule, which Karkey’s counsel pointed to,
deprived Pakistan of the short-term emergency power it was seeking as the primary
rationale for the RPP and which Karkey had promised. In view of the lack of

available power from elsewhere, the “contractual mechanism” to which Karkey

refers, which provides only for damages, does not address the consequences for, nor

adequately compensate, Pakistan.

(ii) Pakistan will also suffer loss if Karkey is found to be an investor in accordance with
Article I(2) of the Treaty, despite Karkey’s investment having been established in

breach of Pakistani law.

(a.4.(2)) Issue 1.4(2): Was Karkey’s investment established by way of corruption in breach
of Article I(2) of the Treaty?

Pakistan admits that it bears the burden of proof in relation to its claim of corruption. However,
given the bilateral nature of corruption, it is practically impossible for Pakistan to have all the
relevant evidence. Accordingly, tribunals and commentators support the principle that the
responsibility to rebut specific allegations of corruption should be borne by the party possessing
the relevant information. In the words of one respected commentator, “plausible evidence of
corruption, offered by the party alleging illegality, should require an adequate evidentiary
showing by the party denying the allegation.”>*" As already noted above, the standard of proof
for corruption is the ordinary balance of probabilities — in other words, whether it is “more likely
than not” that corruption has occurred.*°* Moreover, given the difficulties with obtaining direct
evidence of corruption, it is widely accepted that circumstantial or direct evidence may be

sufficient for a finding of corruption on the basis of inference.”

The requirements for a finding of corruption under Pakistani law are set out at paragraphs 482 to
487 of the Rejoinder. The Respondent maintains that the payment of bribe is not a prerequisite
for a finding of corruption under Pakistani law. Rather, Pakistani corruption laws are wider and,
as confirmed at the Hearing by Karkey’s expert Mr. Zafar, cover, inter alia, irregularities arising
ina public procurement. Pakistan argues that a person (including Karkey and/or its directors) has
“committed the offence of corruption and corrupt practices” under Section 9(a) of the NAO,

inter alia if he accepts, obtains or offers any valuable thing for inadequate consideration to or

from a person he knows is (or is likely to be) concerned in a business transaction with him

(Section 9(a)(ii)).36°

Pakistan submits that Karkey’s alleged explanations for the employment of and scope of services
provided by Mr. Zulgarnain are unsupported by any contemporaneous evidence; and much of the

evidence there is contradicts Karkey’s claims. Karkey has also failed to provide any satisfactory

  

evidence justifying the sums paid to Mr. Zulgarnain. According to Pakistan, this all leads to the
inference that Mr. Zulqarnain was retained for purposes other than those described in his
engagement letter, namely the illegal lobbying and influencing of government officials in order
to secure (and ensure favourable treatment of) Karkey’s RPP in Pakistan. The evidence of Mr.
Zafar supports that the scope of Pakistani corruption laws extends to misprocurement. Pakistan

submits that other evidence relevant to this issue was excluded by the Tribunal.**!

The evidence concerning Mr. Zulqarnain relevant to the question of corruption broadly falls into
four categories: (a) the circumstances of this employment; (b) the services he is said to have

performed; (c) his alleged compensation; and (d) his alleged expenses.>”

Pakistan emphasizes that Karkey agreed to pay US$100,000 (later US$115,000) to someone it
contends was a part-time, administrative/logistics man in a country where the average annual
wage is less than US$1,000. The evidence available of Mr. Zulqarnain’s experience goes only to
his political connections.*° The engagement of a third party related to, or closely associated with
a foreign official is recognized as a common “red flag” of corruption by the FCPA, Woolf
Committee Report, and the TRACE Due Diligence Guidelines. That is relevant because there is
evidence that Mr. Zulgarnain was using his connections to secure favourable treatment for

Karkey.™

Pakistan submits that it is highly improbable that an individual not previously known to Karkey
would be hired as its country representative in the context of a Bid for a contract worth over half

a billion US dollars, without anyone checking whether he was experienced or suitable for the

role. Pakistan asserts that if he were experienced in the temporary power sector, Karkey would
have produced documents demonstrating this, as it was ordered to do (Request 9(a)).
Alternatively, Karkey could have tendered witness evidence from Mr. Karadeniz’s brother (who
he says “must have been” the one who met Mr. Zulqarnain) to explain why he was engaged. Yet
it has not. Nor has Karkey produced Mr. Zulgarnain, or indeed investigate his family connections
itself.

Pursuant to Article 9(5) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration,
it should therefore be inferred either that (a) any documents that do exist would be adverse to
Karkey’s interests; or (b) that such documents do not exist (because his sector experience was
irrelevant), and Mr. Zulgarnain was hired not for his alleged “business experience and
background managing construction projects,” but because of his political and/or family

connections.*°°

According to Pakistan, the absence of any documents evidencing the services actually provided
by Mr. Zulgarnain and the mechanism for his payment are further “red flags” of corruption.
Moreover, what evidence there is suggests that Mr. Zulqarnain was fulfilling a quite different
role — including using his political connections to influence public officials.*°”

Pakistan argues that the payments of US$300,000 (by Karkey) and US$11,111 (by Karpak)
allegedly made in respect of Mr. Zulqarnain’s purported expenses raise further “red flags” of
corruption. Karkey has produced no evidence to demonstrate that any expenses were actually

incurred by Mr. Zulqarnain — let alone over US$300,000 worth.>**

In sum, Pakistan submits that the dearth of evidence produced by Karkey, and the inconsistency
of what little evidence there is, renders it inherently more probable that Mr. Zulgarnain was being
paid for something other than the services outlined in his engagement letter, and that he was in

fact engaged for the reason described by Mr. Aslam — to use his influence with government

officials to obtain special treatment for Karkey, amounting to “corruption and corrupt practices”
under Pakistani law.>?

Furthermore, Pakistan submits that while there is no evidence on the record linking Mr.
Zulgarnain with the Scheme (as described below), the evidence regarding Mr. Zulgarnain should
inform the Tribunal’s decision as to whether it is more probable than not that Karkey was

engaged in the Scheme, which is described below.5”°

According to Pakistan, following the filing of Pakistan’s Rejoinder but at least two months prior
to the Hearing, Pakistan was informed by two previously unknown individuals, Mr. Samir
Tannous and Mr. Tarek Nahas (working with Mr. Mustafa Ramday, a lawyer in Pakistan), of the
existence of a sophisticated scheme implemented by Karkey, involving significant payments by
Karkey to secure Karkey’s contract in Pakistan (the “Scheme”). Pakistan and its counsel were
shown copies of the following documents (the contents of which were recorded in the Attendance

371 372
):

Note*”' taken immediately following the meeting by Allen & Overy’

(i) a copy of a document in the form of a consultancy agreement between Karkey and
a consultant (the Consultant), whose name was redacted (the Consultancy

Agreement);

(ii) acopy of a document in the form of a consultancy agreement, the date of which was
redacted, between the Consultant and a local consultant (the Local Consultant),

whose name was also redacted (the Local Consultancy Agreement).

These two documents were, according to their terms, directly linked to and for the purpose of

securing Karkey’s investment in Pakistan.”

The copy of the Consultancy Agreement (with date only redacted) stated, inter alia, that the
Consultant was responsible for appointing a local agent at its own costs and expense to assist

Karkey in securing the operation of the Contract in relation to matters related with certain local

authorities for the duration of the Contract. In return for securing the RSC, Karkey would pay
the Consultant 6% of the contract price under the RSC (over US$33 million) which was payable

in tranches linked to payments due to Karkey under the RSC.

According to Pakistan, the copy of the Local Consultancy Agreement (with date and names only
redacted) stated, inter alia, that the Consultant would pay over US$4.8 million (equal to 6% of
the Advance Payment under the 2009 RSC) to the Local Consultant, in return for successfully
facilitating the execution of the RSC. This amount was payable in two tranches, the size of which
depended on certain trigger events under the 2009 RSC and the Consultancy Agreement,
including whether the Advance Payment under the RSC would be paid inclusive or net of

withholding tax.37>

At the same time, Mr. Tannous told Pakistan and its counsel of reams of emails confirming the
existence of the Scheme. Pakistan states that as a sovereign state it had no choice but to pursue
all available options for establishing the legitimacy of the Scheme suggested by the Consultancy
and Local Consultancy Agreements. If genuine, those documents evidence that Pakistan has been
the victim of a large-scale fraud by Karkey (and others) which goes to the very heart of this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. No state in Pakistan’s position could ignore what it was shown and being

told.*”°

It was for this reason that Pakistan, reluctant to pay the millions of dollars requested by Messrs.
Tannous and Nahas for documentary and other evidence of the Scheme and because of timing
issues in these proceedings, sought the assistance of the Tribunal and made its application dated
11 December 2015 (just two weeks after the Scheme came to light), together with the witness
statement of Mark Levy (a partner at Allen & Overy LLP) and supporting documents, seeking
disclosure by Karkey. In particular, Pakistan sought disclosure of 70 backup tapes on which
Karkey had claimed that its electronic records were stored for the period up to April 2010 (the
“Backup Tapes”) — i.e. the exact period to which the Consultancy Agreement and the Local
Consultancy Agreement indicate the Scheme relate. Karkey had previously relied on these

Backup Tapes in resisting certain of Pakistan’s requests for disclosure. Pakistan’s previous

requests for disclosure of relevant documents on the Backup Tapes had been rejected by the

Tribunal.””

Pakistan states that Karkey simply denied the existence of the Scheme and argued that the
Scheme had been fabricated by a Pakistani government insider.>”* In Procedural Order No. 12,
the Tribunal declined to order any disclosure “/sJ/ince Karkey declares that the documents

requested in Pakistan’s Application do not exist” >”

During its Opening Statement at the Evidentiary Hearing, Pakistan renewed for a third time its
application for disclosure of the Backup Tapes by Karkey on the basis that the Tribunal had
accepted Karkey’s bare denial of existence of the documents as truthful without having given
Pakistan an opportunity to test it by requiring restoration and review of the Backup Tapes which
Karkey acknowledged it had not even reviewed. The costs of disclosing the Backup Tapes had
been estimated by an independent expert retained by Pakistan at £27,600, and they were costs

that Pakistan agreed to bear.**”

The Tribunal dealt with the application on Day 2 of the Evidentiary Hearing. The Tribunal
decided to admit the Nahas Document and Exhibit R-425 — the Attendance Note — but it did not
admit the witness statement from Mr. Rafi, on the basis that the Tribunal considered it could have
been submitted earlier. The Tribunal also refused all of Pakistan’s applications made during the

Opening Statement.**!

Pakistan noted at the closing of the Hearing that it is concerned by the Tribunal’s decision to
exclude what it believes to be relevant evidence. Pakistan is further concerned by the Tribunal’s
(a) rejection of Pakistan’s application regarding (and its apparent unwillingness to investigate the
veracity of) the alleged Scheme including the rejection of Mr. Khan’s statement (which also went
to the activities of Mr. Zulqarnain), as well as (b) the standards applied to requests for the

introduction of new evidence by Karkey, which differed from those applied to Pakistan.**?

In doing so Pakistan has not been able to test Karkey’s bare assertion that no documents relating
to the Scheme exist. Moreover, the Tribunal has excluded evidence that goes to the issue of

corruption and therefore to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.**>
As Karkey accepts, this is a matter of public policy. Pakistan argues that, as the matters stand,
the Tribunal will be issuing an award on the basis of an incomplete factual record as regards its

jurisdiction.

Pakistan submits that the Tribunal should nevertheless still infer from Karkey’s objections to the

 

admission of the Backup Tapes, the Witness Statement of Mr. Rafi and the other applications
made by Pakistan, as well as the available evidence on the record, that Karkey’s investment was,

more probably than not, procured by way of corruption.>*>

Furthermore, Pakistan makes the following submissions regarding the evidence on the basis of
which Pakistan invites the Tribunal otherwise to make a finding that it is more likely than not
that Karkey was engaged in “corruption and corruption practices” in the establishment of its

investment (other than as a result of the activities of Mr. Zulqarnain and/or the Scheme).

Shipyard visit in September 2010: In September 210, Karkey paid for flights for a delegation of
Pakistani government officials. Pakistan argues that payment for these flights is a “valuable
thing” offered by Karkey for inadequate consideration, to persons concerned in a business
transaction with Karkey (the RPP) in breach of Section 9(a)(ii) of the NAO. The fact that Pakistan
requested the visit and/or that it was for a valid purpose is irrelevant. There is no evidence that
Pakistan requested Karkey to pay for the visit, which was a breach of Section 9 of the NAO (and

in violation of the Establishment Code).**°

Misprocurement: Material changes were made to Karkey’s contract after the issuance of the
Letter of Award in circumstances where the MoWP pushed through approval of the RPPs put
out to tender in May 2008 (“including barge mounted”) in haste and without proper consultation.
Pakistan argues that each of these material changes is a “valuable thing”, accepted or obtained

by Karkey, without adequate compensation, from a person concerned in a business transaction

with Karkey, in breach of Section 9(a)(ii) of the NAO, as well as Section 9(a)(iv) (as each of
these material changes occurred in breach of Pakistani procurement laws). Any aid, assistance or
conspiracy by Karkey with holders of public office in their misuse of authority, or the issuance
of a directive or order granting an undue concession or benefit to Karkey in a taxation matter,

would also be a breach of Section 9(a)(iv), (vii) and/or (xii) of the NAO.?87

Fraud: Pakistan argues that Karkey procured and was awarded the RSC as a result of fraud in
relation to Karkey’s readiness to meet the Proposed Project Schedule set out in Proforma X of

its Bid, which breached Section 9(a)(ii) and (iv) of the NAO.5**

(a.5) Issue 1.5: Is Pakistan estopped from raising its jurisdictional objections?

Pakistan submits that the concept of estoppel prevents a party from exercising a valid legal right
in circumstances where it has clearly and unequivocally stated that it would not exercise that

right, and its counterparty has — in good faith — relied on this statement to its detriment.”

Pakistan rejects Karkey claims that Pakistan would be estopped from exercising its valid legal
right to claim fraud in connection with the delay to the Target COD because (i) “Karkey disclosed
the status of its Powership construction to Pakistan from the very beginning’”*™ and (ii) “because

for years Pakistan has had in its possession the same information on which it now bases its

 

allegation of misrepresentation concerning the Target COD.”*' This argument fails for a
number of reasons, inter alia, because Pakistan cannot be estopped from raising objections to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis of fraud and corruption because, as a matter of logic, Karkey
cannot have relied on a statement or course of conduct by Pakistan in good faith (as required by
Pope & Talbot) if it is guilty of fraud or corruption. Similarly, any statement by Pakistan was not

“voluntary, unconditional, and authorized” if such statement was induced in that manner.>””

Pakistan rejects Karkey’s claim that “the principle of estoppel bars Pakistan from asserting that

any alleged inconsistencies with Pakistani procurement rules in the bidding process deprives the

tribunal of jurisdiction of Karkey’s claim” °° According to the Respondent, Karkey’s claim fails,
inter alia, because none of the documents relied upon by Karkey in this respect contain a clear
and unequivocal representation that any breach of Pakistani’s procurement laws by Karkey (or
any bidder) would not be enforced or that the bidding process would be conducted in accordance

with law and principles of transparency.>**

Finally, Pakistan rejects Karkey’s assertion that, having previously accepted that the Letter of
Credit provided for in the RFP was a confirmed letter of credit, Pakistan would now be estopped
from adopting the contrary position. According to Pakistan, Karkey is mistaken because there is
no clear and unequivocal statement of fact. The only references that Pakistan has made to a
confirmed letter of credit make no references to Karkey, specifically, having been entitled to a
confirmed letter of credit. A general statement on what was available to the RPP sponsors
generally is not sufficiently clear and unequivocal to deprive Pakistan of the valid legal right to
plead its own interpretation of the RFP and subsequent contracts.*”° In any event, according to
the independent ADB Report, even if Karkey was entitled to a confirmed letter of credit, the
changes to its contract were “a major change under any prudent procurement guidelines” 3°
Therefore, Pakistan maintains that in the absence of a re-tendering, these “major” changes were
a breach of the PPRA Rules irrespective of whether the Letter of Credit was confirmed or

unconfirmed.>””

b. Issue 2: Does Karkey’s alleged investment meet the requirements of Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention and Article I of the Treaty?
According to Pakistan, in the event the Tribunal does not accept Pakistan’s overarching
jurisdictional objection that Karkey’s alleged investment was established in breach of Pakistani
law, it must also consider whether Karkey’s alleged investment meets the jurisdictional

requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article I of the Treaty.**

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 109 of 310

Pakistan notes that Karkey appears to disagree with Pakistan’s contention that the alleged
investment must undergo and pass jurisdictional examination under both the ICSID Convention
and the BIT, noting that the Salini criteria should only be used when there are “very strong
reasons” to set aside the State’s mutually agreed definition of investment. Pakistan maintains
that this is incorrect and submits that an investment must pass a “double keyhole” test for
jurisdiction?”

Moreover, Pakistan does not disagree that the Tribunal should assess Karkey’s operations in
Pakistan “globally” or “as a whole”, nor does Pakistan disagree that the meaning of “investment”
under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is potentially broad. However, as noted in the
Counter Memorial, Karkey’s attempt to present a tangled web of activities as a single investment
is unhelpful, particularly in the context of the Treaty’s expropriation clause, which applies only
to the “expropriation of ‘investments’, and not to each and every resource utilized in connection
with an alleged investment, but which is not itself an investment’“°° By way of example, if
Pakistan is correct that the 2009 RSC cannot form the subject matter of an investment because it
has been declared void ab initio, this has a knock-on effect on what Karkey is able to claim has
been expropriated (as well as what Karkey is able to claim as damages). Pakistan argues that it

is therefore necessary to analyse each aspect of Karkey’s alleged investment individually.4°!

In any event, Pakistan maintains its argument that Karkey’s activities, even when considered as
a whole, are akin to a sale of goods transaction and are not covered by the ICSID Convention.
Pakistan submits that Karkey does not succeed in distinguishing the rental of capacity from a

more traditional sale or rental of goods contract.4°?

For instance, Pakistan agrees that Karkey does not rent electricity. However, this does not address
Pakistan’s argument that a mere rental contract — be it for electricity or capacity — falls outside
the ICSID regime. Indeed, the fact that Karkey’s contract is a mere rental contract rather than a
sale contract supports, rather than detracts from, Pakistan’s argument. In sum, Pakistan argues
that Karkey has failed to distinguish its turnkey, plug-and-play business model from a simple

commercial sale or rental of goods contract. Therefore, like a commercial sale or rental of goods

contract, Karkey’s activities do not benefit from the protection of the ICSID regime. If the
Tribunal agrees, it need not go on to consider whether Karkey’s activities satisfy the Salini

criteria nor whether they fall within the definition of “investment” under the Treaty.*°?

Pakistan submits that it appears to be agreed between the Parties that the Sa/ini criteria are not
mandatory. However, they remain relevant in the sense that they represent the “benchmarks of

investment.”

According to Pakistan, even if one takes into account the value of the electricity actually
generated by Karkey over the entire course of the project (around US$28 million), Karkey has
nevertheless acted as a considerable net drain on the Pakistani economy, having procured a
contract whereby it would be paid almost US$10 million every month regardless of whether it

ever delivered a single kilowatt of electricity.4°°

Second, whilst Pakistan agreed that the fact that the majority of the investment forming Karkey’s
alleged contribution took place outside Pakistan may not be decisive, it is certainly relevant to

the Tribunal’s consideration of whether or not Karkey has made an “investment”.4°°

Third, Pakistan maintains that Karkey took none of the financial risks normally associated with

an investment.*””

Finally, Karkey claims that Pakistan argues that the impermanence of a project alone can destroy
its status as an “investment”. According to Pakistan, this misrepresents Pakistan’s argument and
overstates its importance. Rather, the impermanence of Karkey’s investment (which Karkey does
not deny) is merely one factor indicating that the project is akin to a simple sale or rental

transaction. On Karkey’s case, the central asset of the project is able to constitute an “investment”

 

despite spending only a fraction of its working life in Pakistan, before going on to become an

investment in Iraq, or Ghana, or elsewhere. This is what, to Pakistan’s knowledge, is

unprecedented in investment treaty arbitration.4°*

Moreover, Pakistan’s accepts that Karkey’s Vessels could be considered to be a dedication of
resources to Pakistan, albeit to a very limited degree. A delivery truck could also be considered
to be a dedication of resources. Like a delivery truck, the Vessels were not tailored to the

Pakistani market and indeed were intended to be located in Pakistan for only a short period.“

According to Pakistan, it is also not disputed that Karkey’s shareholding in Karpak is capable of
being an “investment” under the Treaty. However, for the purposes of the ICSID Convention,
Pakistan’s position is that the present dispute is not a dispute “arising directly” out of Karkey’s
shareholding in Karpak. Rather, the international dispute arises from the actions taken with
respect to a rental contract and the assets connected to that contract. Pakistan submits that the

mere establishment of a local entity to assist with sale of goods does not affect that or change the

  

nature of the alleged investment. Karpak had no purpose other than assisting with the execution

of the 2009 RSC.*!°

Pakistan further rejects Karkey’s claim that the funds in its bank accounts constitute an
investment for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention because they entail a
contribution, involve a risk, and have a significant duration of five years. Karkey does not explain
why the funds in its bank accounts have taken on anything other than the ordinary commercial
risk assumed by all those using Pakistani bank accounts.*!!

Pakistan maintains that, even if Karkey’s activities satisfy the definition of investment on a prima
facie basis, these items are not investments “in conformity with” Pakistani law, meaning they do
not truly fall within the definition of “investment” under the Treaty. Similarly, in the event that
the Tribunal finds that Karkey’s investment was procured through fraudulent misrepresentation

and corruption, the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction over the dispute.*!”

(2) Attribution
a. Issue 3: Are the acts of Lakhra attributable to the State of Pakistan?

Whilst it is accepted that acts of the Supreme Court, MoWP and the NAB are attributable to the
State, it is Pakistan’s position that Lakhra, PEPCO and KESC are separate legal entities with
autonomy from the State. As such, their acts are not attributable to the State of Pakistan unless
specifically and individually directed, instructed or controlled by the State. Only Lakhra’s
institution of the Sindh High Court proceedings, which was done at the specific request of the

NAB, is admitted as being attributable to Pakistan.*!>

Karkey argues that Lakhra is both structurally and functionally controlled by Pakistan. Pakistan
submits, however, that these arguments are not relevant for the purposes of Article 8 of the ILC
Articles, which turns purely on whether Lakhra was acting on the instruction, or at the direction
or under the control of Pakistan. Lakhra is an independent entity with legal autonomy from the
State. It has an independent legal personality, it can sue and be sued in its own name, and it is
owed fiduciary duties by its directors under the Companies Ordinance. Accordingly, as the
commentary to Article 8 makes clear, “prima facie [Lakhra’s] conduct in carrying out [its]

activities is not attributable to the State”.4\4

Pakistan submits that the burden of overturning this presumption is on Karkey. To do so, Karkey
must show that each specific act of Lakhra on which it relies was specifically instructed, directed
or controlled by Pakistan. According to Pakistan, Karkey has failed to demonstrate that Pakistan
issued any such specific instruction, direction or control to Lakhra in respect of each instance in
which Lakhra is said to have acted as Pakistan. Instead, it makes generalized claims without
properly linking those claims to specific instances of instruction, direction or control by Pakistan
which are said to go to individual claims advanced by Karkey.*!5

Pakistan also rejects Karkey’s argument that Lakhra’s entry into the 2009 RSC was effectively
controlled by Pakistan, noting in particular a letter from the PPIB stating that “the Competent
Authority has decided that Lakhra...will be the ‘Buyer”’. Pakistan submits that this argument is

relevant to Karkey’s Additional Claims regarding fair and equitable treatment, in particular

Karkey’s alleged legitimate expectations. If the entry into the 2008 and 2009 RSCs was not
effectively controlled by Pakistan, then the promises in the contract are not Pakistan’s, and they

are not capable of forming the basis of legitimate expectations.‘!®

Pakistan submits that the letter relied on by Karkey does not identify who the “competent
authority” is. It is therefore not possible to say whether it is Pakistan (the ECC or the MoWP) or
another, separate legal entity (like PEPCO). Moreover, the representations and warranties in the
contract — which ultimately form the basis of Karkey’s alleged legitimate expectations — contain
a clear representation that, “the execution, delivery and performance by [Lakhra] of this Contract
to which it is a PARTY constitute private and commercial acts rather than public and
governmental acts”. According to Pakistan, Karkey has said nothing about this key provision of
the 2009 RSC in any of its written or oral pleadings. Karkey accepted this representation when

it signed the 2008 and 2009 RSCs, and cannot now choose to ignore it.*!7

Moreover, Article 5 of the ILC Articles provides that the acts of entities empowered by law to
exercise elements of governmental authority are attributable to the State as a matter of
international law. Pakistan submit that, in arguing that Lakhra’s failure to comply with the 2009
RSC and attempts to have the Vessels arrested constitute governmental actions under Article 5
of the ILC Articles, Karkey fundamentally misunderstands the distinction between a commercial
and a governmental action. Any contractual counterparty can fail to comply with their contract,
and any party with standing can commence an action in the admiralty courts for the arrest of a
vessel. Accordingly, Lakhra’s actions do not represent the exercise of governmental power, and
are not attributable to Pakistan. For the same reasons, Lakhra’s acts are not governmental acts or

Supreme Court Judgement by the NAB, Lakhra, the Sindh High Court and the Supreme Court

itself was valid and proper.*!?

On the first issue, Karkey’s complaints concern: (i) the procedural protections afforded to
Karkey; (ii) the Supreme Court’s approach to evidence; (iii) the propriety of the Supreme Court’s
findings; and (iv) positions adopted by the MoWP in the Supreme Court proceedings. According

to Pakistan, in each case, Karkey’s complaints are unfounded.4”°

Pakistan submits that Karkey was accorded all the necessary procedural protections. At no point
during the proceedings before the Supreme Court did Karkey raise any of the matters of which
it now complains. Yet by their nature, they must have been known to Karkey. Having not done
so, it is not open to Karkey to do so now.””!

Pakistan rejects Karkey’s claims that the Supreme Court took an improper approach to evidence.
Pakistan argues that Karkey does not present any evidence that the length of its submissions was
in any way limited by the Supreme Court, nor does it present any documentary evidence to
substantiate its claim that its counsel was only allowed to speak 30 minutes. On the contrary, the
record shows that Karkey’s counsel made submissions on two separate days (as well as an

application for adjournment — which was granted).‘??

Moreover, Pakistan submits that the Supreme Court’s findings were all within its authority and
were based on proper (as opposed to prima facie only) evidence. Karkey claims that the Supreme
Court’s finding (that the RPP contracts had been awarded in a non-transparent manner) is
untenable in light of the substantial evidence of multiple breaches of Pakistani procurement laws
by Karkey. For example, it cannot be denied that Karkey’s RPP was delivered over two years
late — hence why delay was a factor in the Supreme Court’s decision. Moreover, Karkey’s
submissions to the Supreme Court must also be borne in mind, as Karkey failed to put before the

Supreme Court the 2008 RSC and obfuscated the sequence of the reasons for the increase in the

Advance Payment, the change in definition of the Target COD and introduction of the FPLC.
Any absence of evidence was at least in part attributable to Karkey.**

According to the Respondent, Karkey’s argument that the Supreme Court declared the RPP
contracts void ab initio on the basis of prima facie evidence misconstrues the Judgment. In fact,
the Supreme Court declared the RPP contracts void ab initio because they were procured in
violation of the PPRA Rules. Pakistan maintains that this finding was based on a full
consideration of the evidence tendered (which did not include the 2008 RSC). Moreover, the
Supreme Court itself did not make any specific finding of corruption — as Karkey admits.‘”4

As regards the second issue, it is Pakistan’s position that the implementation of the Supreme
Court Judgement by the NAB, Lakhra, the Sindh High Court and the Supreme Court itself was

valid and proper.

Pakistan submits that, contrary to Karkey’s allegations, the Supreme Court’s direction to the
NAB to investigate the RPP sponsors did not harm the presumption of innocence. In view of the
finding that the RPP contracts were entered into in breach of the PPRA Rules (and other Pakistani
law) and with a lack of transparency (and bearing in mind the broad definition of “corruption
and corrupt practices” under Section 9 of the NAO), the Supreme Court was entirely within its
rights to involve the NAB. According to Pakistan, it was precisely to maintain the presumption
of innocence that the Supreme Court stopped short of making a finding on “corruption and
corrupt practices” and instead indicated that the competent anti-corruption agency should pursue
the matter. In any event, the NAB itself does not make any findings of guilt. Rather, like any
prosecuting authority, it builds its case before presenting that case before the appropriate court.
The appropriate court in this case, the Accountability Court, maintains the presumption of
innocence — as required by Pakistani law — and is yet to reach its decision on the issue.‘?°

Pakistan maintains that, moreover, contrary to Karkey’s assertions, the Vessels were validly
detained under the NAO, as Section 23 NAO creates an automatic restraint on the Vessels, the
practical effect of which prevents the Vessels from leaving Pakistan. Section 23 of the NAO

creates the restraint, Section 12 gives the NAB the power to enforce that restraint.47° Pakistan

also rejects Karkey’s argument regarding the NAB’s demands for payment. The fluctuation in
the amount demanded represents an example of the State’s judicial system working to correct its
own errors, resulting in a demand of the amount it considered properly due of US$128 million.
Karkey has suffered no loss as a result of these corrections. In addition, whilst Karkey contends
that it was not present at the hearings at which these sums were calculated, the record reflects

that this was Karkey’s own choice.‘

Pakistan submits that there has been no denial of due process in the Sindh High Court
proceedings, which are yet to reach a conclusion. Karkey argues that Lakhra should not have
instituted the Sindh Court proceedings without a resolution from its board. However, no such
resolution is required to be appended where the pleading is signed by a director or principal
officer. In any event, a minor procedural breach like this does not amount to a denial of justice.
Pakistan also rejects Karkey’s argument that Lakhra’s commencement of the Sindh High Court
proceedings was a breach of the LCIA arbitration clause in the 2009 RSC. However, the Sindh
High Court proceedings are an action enforcing the Judgment. They therefore are not in
connection with or arising out of the 2009 RSC. The source of Lakhra’s claim is statutory, not

contractual.4”8

Pakistan rejects Karkey’s claims that the Accountability Court proceedings were unfair and in a
violation of Karkey’s due process rights because (i) a corporation cannot be a named accused in
a NAB reference, (ii) the NAO does not allow the NAB to file a reference against foreigners not
in Pakistan, and (iii) Karkey was not validly served with the proceedings. According to Pakistan,
these arguments do not succeed not least because there can be no denial of justice in respect of
proceedings that are still pending. Moreover, the NAO applies to all legal “persons” in Pakistan,
and a company is necessarily represented by its directors. The NAO also applies to foreign
nationals who were present in Pakistan at the time of the alleged offence. There is therefore no
denial of due process in the fact that Karkey and its employees were named as accused in the
Accountability Court proceedings. Finally, Pakistan submits that Karkey’s complaints about
service of the proceedings ring hollow in the light of the fact that it has been present through

counsel throughout the Accountability Court proceedings.‘”?

b. Issue 5: Did Pakistan expropriate Karkey’s investment in breach of Article III of the
Treaty?
According to Pakistan, there are two key threshold issues in relation to Karkey’s expropriation

claim:*°°

- First, Karkey is unable to show any substantial deprivation of its whole investment in
circumstances where its single most valuable asset — that is the Kaya Bey — has been

released and is now earning revenue elsewhere; and

- Second, the 2009 RSC has been declared void ab initio by the highest court of Pakistan

and therefore does not give rise to rights capable of being expropriated.

372. As regards the first issue, Karkey contends (and Pakistan agrees) that, when considering

37.

374.

3.

&

expropriation, the property rights in question should be viewed “as a whole”.**! An investor will
not be permitted to slice its investment into ever finer slivers in order to meet the substantial
deprivation threshold. Yet, this is what Karkey attempts to do. In a tacit acknowledgment that it
cannot successfully argue that its whole investment has been expropriated, Karkey now attempts
to slice off the Kaya Bey and remove it from the expropriation analysis altogether. As Karkey
noted on multiple occasions at the Hearing, “there is no claim for expropriation of the Kaya

29432

Bey” and “the ship’s released, it’s not actually expropriated”.

Pakistan submits that on Karkey’s own case this cannot be permitted. The Tribunal’s
expropriation analysis must include the Kaya Bey as part of the investment “as a whole” and, in
light of the fact that the vessel has been returned to Karkey and is generating a commercial return,
Karkey has not been substantially deprived of its investment because it is benefiting from revenue
generated by the Kaya Bey. Karkey’s expropriation claim must therefore fail and the Tribunal

need consider this Issue 5 no further.‘*

As regards the second issue (in the event the Tribunal disagrees with the above), Pakistan agreed

that — in the right circumstances — contractual rights are assets capable of being expropriated.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 118 of 310

However, in order to validly be the subject matter of an expropriation claim, the rights in question

must exist and be enforceable at law.*95

In the instant case, Karkey’s post-termination contract rights do not exist and are not enforceable
at law because the 2009 RSC was declared void ab initio by the Supreme Court on 30 March
2012. This is critical because, as noted by the tribunal in Arif v. Moldova, no wrongful taking
results from the legitimate application of the host-State’s legal system and the subsequent
invalidity of the rights at stake. As that tribunal put it, “/i/n light of the fact that the agreements
have been found to be invalid under Moldovan law this Tribunal is not persuaded that there can
be deprivation of invalid rights” °°

Pakistan submits that the real question is therefore whether the Supreme Court process and/or
decision itself violated international law by way of a denial of justice. If it did not, the Supreme
Court’s findings are legitimate and Karkey had no contractual rights capable of forming the

subject matter of an expropriation claim.*°”

c. Issue 6: Did Pakistan breach Article IV of the Treaty (free transfer)?

Pakistan rejects Karkey’s argument that the language of Article IV providing that “all transfers
related to an investment” necessarily encompasses the transfer of physical assets because those
assets are included in the definition of “investment” under the Treaty. This is because, inter alia,
Karkey erroneously conflates transfers related to an investment with transfers of an investment
itself. Pakistan submits that, in the context of the rest of the provision, which lists examples of
transfers relating only to funds, it is clear that the Treaty parties intended to obligate the free
transfer of funds related to an investment only. Karkey simply ignores Article I1V(2) of the Treaty
which provides that “/t/ransfers shall be made in the convertible currency in which the
investment has been made or in any convertible currency at the rate of exchange in force at the

date of transfer”.** According to Pakistan, this provision unquestionably demonstrates that the

word “transfer” in Article IV relates only to funds. Assets cannot be transferred in a convertible
currency.9?
Even in the event that the Tribunal finds that Article IV of the Treaty does obligate the free

transfer of Karkey’s assets, Pakistan maintains that there has nevertheless been no breach of the

 

Treaty because Pakistan’s obligation is to allow free transfer “without unreasonable delay”. In
this case, the delay in releasing the Vessels (an outcome which could be achieved at any time by
paying the amounts due pursuant to the Supreme Court Judgment) is entirely reasonable given

Karkey’s material breaches of fundamental principles in Pakistani law.*”°

(4) Merits of Karkey’s Additional Claims Brought under the MFN Clause
a. Issue 7: Does the Tribunal have substantive jurisdiction over Karkey’s Additional Claims?

Pakistan submits that Karkey is not entitled to rely on the MFN clause in Article II(2) of the
Treaty to bring the Additional Claims within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Pakistan does not
contend that the importation of substantive protections from other treaties via an MFN clause is
generally impermissible. Rather, Article II(2) of the Treaty places certain conditions on the
importation of other standards — namely, that there must be “established” investments of
investors “in similar situations” to Karkey. In order to be able to bring its Additional Claims,

Karkey must show that these requirements are met.“*!

The Parties agree that there are no actual investments “in similar situations” to Karkey’s RPP.
The Parties disagree only over the scope of application of Article II(2); namely whether it permits
importation of substantive protections from other treaties offered to: (i) potential investors (as

Karkey contends); or (ii) by actual investors (as Pakistan contends).‘47

Since the Parties agree that there are no such actual investors, it follows that, if Pakistan’s
contention is correct, the requirements of Article II(2) of the Treaty are not satisfied and the

Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Additional Claims. Significantly, this was precisely

the position taken by the distinguished tribunal in the recently published /¢kale v. Turkmenistan
48

awar
Indeed, according to Pakistan, the tribunal went further and stated that the words “treatment in
similar situations” could not sensibly be interpreted to include the protection of other investment
treaties. Even if the Tribunal does not also accept this second limb to the /¢kale tribunal’s analysis
that is not decisive, because it is common ground that there is no investor “in similar situations”
to Karkey with access to a treaty. Karkey’s attempt to import substantive obligations from other

treaties via the MFN clause must therefore fail.“

Pakistan submits, moreover, that it is well established that a State’s breach of contract does not
automatically give rise to an international wrong. Rather, a State’s breach of contract does not
give rise to an international wrong unless it involves a sovereign act which a private party could

not commit.

Pakistan argues that Karkey’s argument that Lakhra’s actions involved the exercise of public
power “such as failing to comply with the Contract, and seeking the arrest of the Vessels’
represents a misunderstanding of what constitutes sovereign power. Any commercial party is
capable of non-payment, and any commercial party with standing can seek an arrest order.

   

Indeed, those are quintessentially commercial acts. Therefore, even if Lakhra’s actions are
attributable to Pakistan (which is denied), there has been no breach of the expropriation provision

of the Treaty (or of the FET or FPS provisions of other treaties).‘*7

According to Pakistan, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Karkey’s purely contractual
claims by virtue of the umbrella clause. Karkey’s umbrella clause claims fail for four separate

threshold reasons:*4*

- First, Karkey may not rely on the umbrella clause from the Lebanon-Pakistan BIT
because there are no investors “in similar situations” for the purposes of Article II(2)

of the Treaty;

- Second, the 2009 RSC was legitimately declared void ab initio by the Supreme Court,

meaning there are no “obligations” to which an umbrella clause could attach;
- Third, Lakhra’s alleged breaches of the 2009 RSC are not attributable to Pakistan; and

- Fourth, the 2009 RSC contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause providing for LCIA
arbitration in respect of contractual disputes. Karkey expressly waived the right to other

dispute resolution procedures when it signed the 2009 RSC.

386. According to Pakistan, in arguing that each of its claims relating to the performance of the

38

388.

7.

oo

contract is properly a treaty claim, Karkey confuses the admissibility of umbrella clause (i.e.
purely contractual) claims on the one had with broader treaty claims where an underlying
contractual issue happens to be relevant on the facts, on the other. The former may not be brought
in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause. Further, if Karkey were correct that its contractual

claims were all treaty-based, it would not need to avail itself of an umbrella clause at all.“

b. Issue 8: Has Pakistan failed to accord Karkey fair and equitable treatment?
Pakistan submits that if the Tribunal agreed with Karkey that Lakhra’s actions are attributable to
Pakistan, the 2009 RSC is, by virtue of the entire agreement clause therein, the only source of

representations upon which Karkey can potentially found its alleged expectations.”

If, on the other hand, the Tribunal finds that Lakhra’s actions are not attributable to Pakistan, the
promises in the 2009 RSC are not representations of the State and they cannot give rise to
legitimate expectations. Moreover, none of the alleged non-contractual representations cited by
Karkey is capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations because, inter alia, the RFP and bid
documents contained a disclaimer, accepted by Karkey, by which Pakistan “expressly
disavow[ed] any obligation or duty...to any Bidder”.**' Also, as the 2009 RSC was held to be

void ab initio by the Supreme Court, Karkey’s alleged Post-Termination Contract Rights do not

exist and the Sovereign Guarantee (which is a secondary obligation inextricably linked to the

2009 RSC) falls away.**?

If, contrary to Pakistan’s arguments, the Tribunal finds that one or more of the above
representations is capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations, Pakistan submits that the
Tribunal must then ask whether those expectations have been breached by Pakistan. In the first
instance, even if Lakhra’s alleged breaches of the 2009 RSC are attributable to Pakistan, they do
not represent breaches involving the exercise of sovereign power because the actions taken by
Lakhra could have been taken by any private commercial party. Accordingly, they do not amount

to breaches of the Treaty.43

According to Pakistan, in order to be protected under international law, an investor’s expectations
must be (i) reasonable and legitimate at the time of the investment; (ii) existing and enforceable
at law; and (iii) balanced against the State’s right to regulate its public interest.4*

It is Pakistan’s position that Karkey’s alleged expectations were not reasonably and legitimately
held. Karkey’s expectations are also not existing and enforceable at law because they are all
based on the 2009 RSC, which was declared void ab initio by the Supreme Court. Whilst Karkey
argues that Pakistan cannot invalidate its legitimate expectations by pointing to information that
was not known to Karkey at the time of its investment, Karkey was (or should have been) aware
that the key changes from the Draft RSC (which were made at Karkey’s request) would result in

breaches of pre-existing Pakistani law, including the PPRA Rules.**°

Furthermore, the threshold for finding a denial of justice is very high and requires evidence of
the most convincing nature. An error of fact or law is not sufficient to found a denial of justice
claim. Even “the most perplexing and unconvincing national judgments are upheld on the

grounds that international law does not overturn determinations of national judiciaries with

respect to their own law” 46

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 123 of 310

Pakistan reiterates that there was no denial of justice in the Supreme Court. Karkey’s experienced
lawyers did not make any complaint regarding the Supreme Court’s procedure at the time. Unlike
a number of the other RPP sponsors, Karkey has not attempted to file a review of the Judgment
and therefore failed to exhaust the domestically available remedies and the Pakistani legal system

as a whole.*°7

Pakistan maintains that Karkey’s claim that it was denied justice by Lakhra, the NAB, the Sindh
High Court and the Accountability Court fails for a number of reasons. For instance, Karkey’s
allegations — even if taken at face value — amount to nothing more than complaints that there

were errors of law. This is insufficient to establish a denial of justice.4**

Finally, Pakistan disputes that its actions were in any way improper, and denies that any action
was taken in bad faith. In furtherance of the public interest, Pakistan has simply investigated
claims that the RPP projects were tainted by improper procurement and corruption. Moreover,
even taken at their highest, Karkey’s allegations do not constitute examples of bad faith because

Karkey has failed to show the requisite “egregious intent”.

c. Issue 9: Has Pakistan acted in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner?

Pakistan submits that the Parties appears to agree that the independent standard prohibiting
arbitrary and unreasonable conduct has the exact same scope and content as the prohibition under

the FET standard discussed above. The point is therefore moot.*°

d. Issue 10: Has Pakistan breached its obligations under the “umbrella” clause of the
Lebanon-Pakistan BIT?
Pakistan rejects Karkey’s argument that Lakhra’s alleged breaches of the 2009 RSC are
attributable to Pakistan, and that those breaches amount to violations of Pakistan’s obligation

under the BIT to observe its commitments to Karkey pursuant to the umbrella clause. *°!

398. Karkey’s claim for Post-Termination Contract Rights has already been addressed at Issues 5

(expropriation) and 8 (FET), above. There is no need for the Tribunal to consider it further in the

context of the umbrella clause claim, for the following reasons:*°

First, if the actions of the Supreme Court and the NAB did not violate international
law, it follows that Lakhra’s conformity with the Supreme Court Judgment and the
instructions of the NAB was not a violation of Karkey’s legitimate expectations or an
expropriation of its alleged contractual rights;4°

Second, if (contrary to Pakistan’s position) the actions of the Supreme Court and the
NAB did violate international law, Karkey’s claims relating to its Post-Termination
Contract Rights could and should nevertheless be heard exclusively by an LCIA
tribunal, as mandated by Article 28 of the 2009 RSc;*4

Third, if (contrary to Pakistan’s position) the Tribunal finds that the Supreme Court
and the NAB violated international law and that Karkey’s contractual claims are
brought in the correct forum, then (provided that Karkey’s investment “as a whole”
has been affected) Karkey will succeed on its claim in respect of the Post-Termination
Contract Rights as a result of the Supreme Court’s actions. In that case, the question of
whether Lakhra’s alleged breaches of the 2009 RSC are also capable of amounting to
a breach of the Treaty is moot because the property rights which have been
expropriated in this scenario (and Karkey’s corresponding losses) are exactly the same:

the Post-Termination Contract Rights.*°

399. In each of these scenarios, Karkey’s claim for Post-Termination Contract Rights will have been

dismissed (in which case its right to damages must fall away), considered in another forum, or

will already have been established (in which case the only outstanding issue is the amount owing,

which is addressed at the Damages Section below). Accordingly, there is no need for the Tribunal

to consider Karkey’s primary claim under the umbrella clause.4%°

Pakistan submits that Karkey accepts that its claim for Pre-Termination Contract Rights only
falls to be considered in the event that its primary claim for Post-Termination Contract Rights
fails. However, any claim for Pre-Termination Contract Rights cannot be properly advanced in

the alternative.4°”

Karkey will have failed in its primary claim by virtue of a finding by the
Tribunal that the Supreme Court Judgment did not violate International law, in which case the
2009 RSC is void. It necessarily follows that Karkey can have no right to any of the payments
claimed, pre- or post-termination. There is, therefore, no self-standing umbrella clause claim for

either Karkey’s Post-Termination Contract Rights or its Pre-Termination Contract Rights.*°*

In any event, even if the Tribunal finds that Lakhra’s alleged breaches of the 2009 RSC are
attributable to Pakistan (whether under domestic or international law), simple commercial

breaches are not within the protection offered by an umbrella clause.*°

e. Issue 11: Has Pakistan failed to accord Karkey full protection and security?

Pakistan rejects Karkey’s allegation that Pakistan have failed to provide Karkey with physical

and legal protection and security.

According to Pakistan, the Tribunal must first decide the scope of the full protection and security
(“FPS”) standard. The FPS standard is primarily concerned with protection against physical
damage and may be extended to legal security “only exceptionally”.“”° In the event the Tribunal
agrees, it need only consider the Parties’ arguments regarding physical protection and security.*”!
Pakistan submits that the Parties appear to agree that the obligation to provide full protection and
security is not one of strict liability, but one of due diligence. The Parties also agree that the scope
of this obligation requires the State to take reasonable precautionary measures to minimize the

risk of harm to the investor.4”

Karkey’s arguments regarding physical protection and security can be distilled down to two
alleged failures by Pakistan, which are rejected by Pakistan. First, Karkey alleges that
“Pakistan’s termination of the power supply to the Vessels” constituted a breach of the FPS
standard because it threatened the health and safety of Karkey’s crew, and prevented Karkey
from conducting proper maintenance leading to “corrosive damage”. Second, Karkey alleges
that Pakistan did not permit the Vessels to sail away, out of the jurisdiction, to avoid the risk of

monsoon conditions.‘”>

As to Karkey’s first argument, the Parties are in fact agreed that it was KESC — not Pakistan —
that terminated the power supply to Karkey’s Vessels. KESC is an independent and privately
held company and, as such, its actions are not attributable to Pakistan. Karkey does not dispute
this. Instead, it seeks to get around the issue by arguing that “Karkey sought assistance from
PEPCO with respect to the need for power and PEPCO undeniably ignored the request.”*" It is
correct that Karkey wrote to PEPCO — on just two occasions in the days immediately after the
Supreme Court Judgment.*’> Regardless of the reasons, the lack of response to just two letters

cannot possibly amount to a breach of Pakistan’s international law obligations.‘7°

As to Karkey’s second argument, aside from the fact that allowing the Vessels to leave Pakistani
waters would involve releasing the only security over the money owed by Karkey pursuant to
the Supreme Court Judgment, Karkey fails to allege that any damage was actually caused as a
result of the monsoon, nor does it claim for any damage. Accordingly, there has been no breach

of the FPS standard in this regard.*””

In the event that the Tribunal finds that there are exceptional circumstances permitting the
extension of the FPS standard to legal protection and security, Pakistan has nevertheless satisfied

its obligation of due diligence at all times:*8

- Second, as set out at Issue 3 (attribution) above, Pakistan did not breach its FPS
obligation by “permitting and sanctioning” Lakhra’s alleged breaches of the 2009 RSC.

Lakhra is an independent entity whose actions are not attributable to Pakistan; and

- Third, the Supreme Court’s decision that the 2009 RSC was void ab initio — and the
actions taken following that judgement — were legitimate and reasonable acts aimed at

achieving objectively rational public policy goals.

(5) Damages

409. According to Pakistan, even if the Tribunal were to determine that, contrary to Pakistan’s
position, it does have jurisdiction and Pakistan has breached the Treaty, then Karkey is not
entitled to anything like the sums claimed. This is because the losses that Karkey alleges: (a) are
not owing in the sums claimed (in respect of the Contract Claims); (b) have not been caused by
any alleged breach of the Treaty; (c) in respect of historic losses, are incorrect, exaggerated or
entirely unsupported by the evidence; and (d) in respect of future losses, are speculative, and fall

outside the categories of loss recoverable as a matter of public international law.*”

410. Pakistan’s submissions on damages are summarized below under the following headings: (a)
Issue 12 (Applicable legal standard); (b) Issue 13 (Key differences between the Parties’ experts
on the DCF models); (c) Issue 14 (Losses claimed in respect of the Alican Bey); (d) Issue 15
(Losses claimed in respect of the Kaya Bey); (e) Issue 16 (Consequential losses); and (f) Issue

17 (Claim for Post-Termination Contract Rights).**°

a. Issue 12: Applicable legal standards to Karkey’s claim for damages

(a.1) Measure of damages and causation

411.

Pakistan submits that the Parties agree that the State responsible for an internationally wrongful
act is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally
wrongful act. However, they disagree on the correct test for causation and therefore the

circumstances in which the obligation to make full reparation arises.**!

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 128 of 310

According to Pakistan, causation in international law requires that: (a) on a balance of
probabilities, the injury complained of has been caused by a wrongful act of the respondent-State
(factual causation or the “but for” test); and (b) that the losses complained of were caused as a
matter of law by the alleged breaches of the Treaty, meaning that the losses are not too remote
or speculative (legal causation). These requirements are well established and are supported by

the ILC Articles and their Commentary.***

Karkey has argued that a causal link may be presumed if it can demonstrate that “in the normal
course of events a certain cause [i.e. the alleged breaches of the Treaty] will produce a certain
effect [i.e. Karkey’s damages]”. *° Pakistan submits that Karkey’s approach to causation and
remoteness is incorrect and oversimplified. There are many reasons why the construction of a
vessel may be delayed or financing may be refused. It is not for Pakistan to prove what other

events might have caused any alleged loss. Instead the burden of proof is on Karkey.**4

(a.2) The requirements for a Loss Profits Claim
Pakistan submits that under customary international law, the State responsibility for an
internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused, which

“shall cover any financially assessable damage including lost profits insofar as it is

established” 4°

Several of Karkey’s claims are for lost profits: losses claimed in respect of the Alican Bey and
the Kaya Bey, losses claimed in relation to the alleged delay of the Powership Construction

Programme, losses claimed in relation to the Iraq Powership Rehabilitation Programme and

 

losses claimed in relation to the Geothermal Project.**°

According to Pakistan, Karkey fails in particular to satisfy the well-established legal
requirements for future lost profits: its claim in relation to the Alican Bey and the Powership

Construction Programme, which include lost profits until even 2031, are not supported by any

contracts nor a well-established history of dealings; and its claim for the Geothermal Project is

not supported by any contracts nor any history of dealings.**”

b. Issue 13: Key differences between Mr. Haberman and Mr. Kaczmarek’s DCF models
It is Pakistan’s position that if the Tribunal decides that Karkey’s claims are recoverable then it
must consider whether the sums claimed have been calculated based on the correct date of
valuation, reasonable assumptions, accurate documentary evidence and are appropriately

discounted for risk and any other uncertainties.***

This section addresses various assumptions, discounts and other inputs that differentiate Mr.
Haberman and Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculations, in particular their cash flow analyses. In sum, Mr.
Kaczmarek has (a) vastly underestimated the level of risk inherent in Karkey’s Powership
business and, as a result, has applied an inappropriately low discount rate; and (b) Mr. Kaczmarek

has not calculated Karkey’s alleged loss on the correct valuation date.‘*?

(b.1) Appropriate Discount Rate (WACC)

Pakistan submits that a major difference between the Parties’ experts was the appropriate

discount rate (WACC) for the purpose of calculating alleged lost profits.4°

The appropriate discount rate is determined by reference to various components: the risk-free
rate, beta, equity risk premium, country risk premium, size and project risk premium, cost of
equity, post tax cost of debt, percent of equity and percent of debt. According to Pakistan, the
most significant differences in opinion between the two experts in relation to these components
are the country risk premium and the size and project risk premium. Mr. Haberman applies these
premiums and Mr. Kaczmarek does not. If the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Haberman on the
application of a country risk premium as well as a size and project risk premium, then it follows

that it also agrees with Mr. Haberman’s discount rate.*?!

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 130 of 310

Mr. Haberman includes a country risk premium of 7.5% to 9%, which is incorporated into his
discount rate. Mr. Haberman calculated his country risk premium on the basis of sovereign credit

ratings, which reflect “a government’s willingness and ability to service its debt on time and in

full”. It is therefore commonly used by valuers as a basis for calculating country risk premium.

Given that Karkey enters into contracts with governments or government owned entities,

sovereign credit ratings are directly relevant to Karkey’s business.*””

Mr. Kaczmarek is of the view that this is unnecessary and therefore does not apply a country risk
premium because he claims that country risk is accounted or in the cash flows by way of
insurance payments and that political and legal risks are covered by investment treaties. This
position is rejected by Pakistan, which claims that the inclusion of a country risk premium is an
extremely common feature of investment tribunal’s calculations of compensation. Also, an
insurance policy does not eliminate all social, political, and legal risks. Otherwise, investors
could disregard any such risks in a host-State when investing, so long as they are able to obtain

insurance.4?3

Moreover, in order to reflect (a) the fact that Karkey is in essence a start-up company without an
established business model in the temporary floating power market, and (b) to account for
Karkey’s size, Mr. Haberman applies a size and project risk premium of 5% to this discount rate.
Mr. Kaczmarek does not apply such a premium and therefore significantly understates the risks

involved in Karkey’s Powership operations.4*

(b.2) Time between contracts

Pakistan points out that Mr. Kaczmarek has calculated lost cash flows for eight Vessels (the
Alican Bey, the Kaya Bey and five Vessels whose construction was allegedly delayed) on the
basis that there would only be a two-month gap between each contract. In other words, he
assumes a constant, uninterrupted supply of contracts with no room for delays. Pakistan argues
that, however, in the absence of a single precedent or an estimate from Karkey, Mr. Kaczmarek
has adopted the most optimistic approach and neglected to apply a discount to reflect that it might

not transpire that way.‘?

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 131 of 310

Mr. Haberman assumes an eight-month gap between contracts, which includes transportation to
a dry-docking facility (two months), transportation to the new operating site (two months) and a
period of delay (two months). Pakistan submits that this approach is much more reasonable
because it actually accounts for delay and maintenance. Ultimately, the Tribunal will have to

take a view as to what is a reasonable assumption to make in this regard.4°°

(b.3) The correct date of valuation

Pakistan submits that the correct date of valuation for a non-expropriatory breach or even for a
lawful or unlawful expropriation is the date immediately preceding the relevant measure or the
date immediately before the relevant measure became public knowledge. Since the date of
valuation is the same for expropriation as well as non-expropriatory breaches, Karkey’s decision
to abandon its argument that the Kaya Bey has been expropriated does not require the use of a
different valuation date. For example, in AAPL v. Sri Lanka, the tribunal adopted, without
discussion, the date immediately preceding the non-expropriatory breach as the date of valuation.
The Respondent argues that the vast majority of investment treaty cases have followed this
approach for expropriation as well and have only relied on information available on that date (ex

ante), as opposed to using information subsequent to the alleged taking (ex post).4°7

Mr. Haberman has used the date of the alleged non-expropriatory breach (or expropriation) as
his date of valuation in accordance with the overwhelming majority of cases. Mr. Kaczmarek has
not relied on a fixed date of valuation. Instead, he has elected to use “convenient” dates that are
close to the date of his reports. As far as Pakistan is aware, no tribunal has ever taken this

approach.*°*

Pakistan submits that the correct date of valuation is 30 March 2012.4”

(b.4) Karkey does not have a well-established history of dealings or track record
According to Pakistan, underlying Mr. Kaczmarek’s approach to calculating Karkey’s alleged
losses are two misconceptions: (a) Karkey’s purported past track record; and (b) Karkey’s self-

proclaimed position in the market. His misunderstanding of both leads him to fail to apply a size

and project risk premium. It also highlights the absurdity of treating the hypothetical losses of a

company without a well-established track record as historical fact.5°

(b.5) Mr. Kaczmarek’s valuation is not supported by sufficiently reliable information
Pakistan submits that it is reasonable and proportionate for a claim that was originally almost
US$2 billion to be supported by reliable and accurate documentary evidence verified by an
independent expert. However, Mr. Kaczmarek appears to have simply accepted any and all

information provided to him by his client. His approach is fundamentally unsound.*°!

c. Issue 14: Losses claimed in respect of the Alican Bey

Pakistan submits that before the Hearing, Karkey claimed damages related to the Alican Bey of
US$457.2 million, which consisted of: (a) US$320 million for the alleged fair market value of
the Alican Bey (described as the sum of future cash flows as of 30 June 2015); and (b) US$137
million for the alleged “historical lost cash flows up to 30 June 2015” i.e. lost profits. However,
on the last day of the Hearing, Karkey revised its claim for damages related to the Alican Bey

down to US$445.7 million.°°

It is Pakistan’s position that Karkey’s claim remains severely flawed in several aspects: for
example, it incorrectly quantifies the losses attributable to the detention of the Alican Bey and it

relies on Mr. Kaczmarek’s severely flawed DCF model.5

Pakistan has explained that Karkey could have avoided incurring the losses it now seeks as a
result of the detention of the Vessels by paying US$128 million to the NAB, and that it would
have been reasonable to pay this amount. But if the Tribunal decides to award Karkey
compensation in relation to the Alican Bey, Karkey is in principle only entitled to the following:
(i) restitution of the Alican Bey; (ii) if the Tribunal does not wish to grant restitution, the correct
fair market value of the Alican Bey, which is in fact the replacement cost of the Alican Bey of
US$120 million; and (iii) any lost profits until March 2018 when a new vessel will be

operational.°°+

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 133 of 310

. Pakistan’s position is that the appropriate remedy in relation to the Alican Bey would be

restitution — the primacy of which is long established as a matter of international law — together
with any costs of repairs and legally recoverable lost profits. The Tribunal may award restitution
in the same manner as other ICSID Tribunals have, namely by ordering restitution by a given
deadline and, in the event of non-compliance, requiring monetary compensation of a specified

amount.°°

If the Tribunal does not award restitution, it is relevant to the Tribunal’s assessment of damages

that Karkey does not seek restitution and is instead seeking exaggerated compensation.°°°

Pakistan rejects Karkey’s argument that the fair market value of the Alican Bey is determined by
reference to future lost cash flows because the Alican Bey is not an asset but an enterprise and is
therefore due the “enterprise value” of the vessel. According to Pakistan, if the Tribunal finds
that the Alican Bey was detained in breach of the Treaty, full reparation cannot exceed: (a) the
replacement cost of the vessel, which the Parties agree is approximately US$115 to US$120
million; and (b) any lost profits until March 2018 when a new vessel will be operational, subject
to the Tribunal deciding that those lost profits are legally recoverable. The latter approach is

correct as a matter of logic, law and economics.*°”

Although Karkey equates the Alican Bey’s “future lost cash flows” to its fair market value, the
amount it is claiming far exceeds the amount that a willing buyer would pay. Karkey is disguising
what is in fact a future lost profits claim. By characterizing its claim as one for the fair market
value of the vessel, Karkey is seeking to avoid application of the clear legal test for future lost
profits, which proscribes recovery of such profits unless they arise out of a legally protected
interest. Since the 2009 RSC has been terminated, future loss profits would only be recoverable
if Karkey could prove that such profits arise out of another contractually protected interest which
would ensure a continuous revenue stream for the duration of the Alican Bey’s useful life. Karkey
has not provided any evidence of a contract under which the Alican Bey could have operated

under following the termination of the RSC and up until the end of its operating life. Furthermore,

as demonstrated above, Karkey does not have a well-established history or dealings or track

record.5%

. Karkey’s claim for compensation of over US$445 million (excluding interest) for alleged

damages arising out of the detention of the Alican Bey also fails as a matter of simple economics.
Mr. Kaczmarek’s DCF produces an absurd measure of compensation that is out of all proportion
to the ship’s replacement value (and other comparable transactions). Compensation of
approximately US$445 million would provide Karkey with the financial resources to purchase

three new identical Vessels and potentially generate three times the revenue of the Alican Bey

d. Issue 15: Losses claimed in respect to the Kaya Bey
Pakistan submits that Karkey’s revised claim (as set out in its closing at the Hearing) for the Kaya
Bey comprises two components: (i) alleged physical damage and cost of repairs in the sum of
approximately US$36 million; and (ii) alleged lost cash flows under other contracts, from 31

March 2012 to December 2015, stated at the Hearing to be approximately US$240 millions"?

(d.1) Alleged damage to the Kaya Bey

According to Pakistan, there are four issues that need to be determined by the Tribunal in
deciding whether Karkey is entitled to damages in respect of the alleged costs of repairing the

Kaya Bey and restoring it to its pre-detention condition:!!

- First, has Karkey proven as a matter of fact that the Kaya Bey was damaged while

detained in Pakistan and the extent of any such damage?

- Second, has Karkey established that repairs to the Kaya Bey have been carried out

and how much those repair cost?

- Third, if the Tribunal finds that Karkey has proven that the Kaya Bey was damaged
while detained in Pakistan and that any such damage is attributable to a breach of the

Treaty by Pakistan, did Karkey take reasonable steps to mitigate its loss?

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 135 of 310

- Fourth, if the Tribunal finds that Karkey has proven that the Kaya Bey was damaged
while detained in Pakistan and that any such damage is attributable to a breach of the

Treaty by Pakistan, did Karkey take reasonable steps to mitigate its loss?

Pakistan submits that Karkey has failed to discharge its burden of proof that any “damage” to the
Kaya Bey was caused by an action of Pakistan in breach of the Treaty. Karkey has also failed to

discharge its burden of proving the cost of repairing any such damage.

Karkey also attempts to blame Pakistan for the alleged lack of power, manpower and resources
reaching the Kaya Bey during the 7-month period when it was at outer anchorage. According to
Pakistan, Karkey has to show: (i) that there was in fact a lack of power, manpower and resources;
and (b) if there was, that Karkey’s alleged inability to get all of these resources was caused by a

breach of the Treaty by Pakistan. However, Karkey has failed to do so in both respects.*!>

(d.2) Loss Profits Claim

In its closing submissions at the Hearing, Karkey summarized the amount claimed for lost profits
arising out of the detention of the Kaya Bey as being US$240.1 million. Mr. Haberman assessed
the quantum of this claim as US$91.2 million.*!* According to Pakistan, different assumptions
used in the two different models by the experts are the primary reason for the difference between
the two figures (in particular, the transition time between contracts). In addition to those different

assumptions, two further issues remain between the Parties.*!5

First, Karkey’s claim for lost profits arising out of the Kaya Bey’s detention for the period
between the date of the vessel’s release in May 2014 to December 2015 depends on whether the
Tribunal accepts that the Kaya Bey was in fact damaged to the extent Karkey alleges and that
any such damage was caused by Pakistan’s alleged breaches of the Treaty. If the Tribunal does
not accept this, then the element of Karkey’s claim for lost profits for the period following its
release from Pakistan to December 2015 should be dismissed: any loss from the date of the Kaya

Bey’s release was not caused by Pakistan but by Karkey’s failure to mitigate its losses.*'

Second, Karkey failed to explain at the Hearing why its claim for lost profits for the Kaya Bey
has now extended beyond the original June 2015 date (i.e. the date that Karkey first suggested
would the date the Kaya Bey would be returned to full operations) to December 2015. That delay,
based on Mr. Kaczmarek’s estimate, has resulted in a US$14 million increase in damages. There
is no evidence to support the suggestion that this delay was caused by the alleged breaches of the

Treaty and Pakistan should not be held liable for further losses.*!”

e. Issue 16: Consequential losses
Karkey’s original claim for the indirect losses allegedly caused by Pakistan’s alleged breaches

of the Treaty comprised the following:*!®
(i) Delays to the Powership Construction Programme: originally US$428.2 million;
(ii) Delays to the Geothermal Project: US$178.4 million;
(iii) Delays to the Powership Rehabilitation Programme: US$44.5 million; and

(iv)Costs increases (including insurance, penalty charges and shipyard costs): US$26

million.

According to Pakistan, these claims for consequential losses fail because: (i) Karkey has not
established the necessary causal link on the evidence; and (ii) they are too remote to be

recoverable.*!?

The correct test is not in dispute: Karkey has to show that but for Pakistan’s alleged breaches of
the Treaty it would not have suffered these losses. Karkey has to show the fact of is loss or
damage, and the necessary causal link. It has also to show that any damage is not too remote and

«52
speculative.>7°

In closing, Karkey downwardly revised its claim for the Powership Construction Programme by
US$116 million, as a result of removing the clearly untenable claim for damages for delay to the

conversion of the Jrag (KPS 2), based as it was on an absurd valuation of that deck barge — with

an accepted replacement cost of US$2 million — as being US$119 million. This retreat followed
Mr. Kaczmarek’s cross-examination in which he accepted that no willing buyer would pay nearly

US$120 million for a US$2 million barge.*!

Pakistan argues that, even with this adjustment, the claim for the alleged delays to the Powership
Construction Program is premised on the same flawed DCF calculations in respect of the various
Vessels that have resulted in an absurd valuation for the Alican Bey. According to Pakistan, there
is a further fundamental weakness in Karkey’s claim for consequential losses. Those claims
comprise almost a third of Karkey’s total damages claim, yet there still remains a complete

absence of any supporting evidence.*”

Karkey’s claim is based on its contention that Pakistan’s alleged breaches resulted in the
financing restrictions on Karkey that then caused delay to the projects it claims it was planning.
Pakistan maintains that Karkey does not get anywhere close to proving these financing
restrictions. Karkey has produced only four documents in order to establish a causal link between
Pakistan’s detention of the Vessels and the impact on Karkey’s planned projects. It therefore

relies on just four documents to support a claim of over US$700 million.*>

Pakistan submits that there is no evidential basis upon which this Tribunal could make any
findings that Pakistan’s alleged breaches caused the consequential losses that Karkey claims.
Karkey agreed to provide all documents responsive to several requests made by Pakistan in
respect of these projects and in several instances failed to produce any documents at all. The

Tribunal can therefore safely conclude that there is no evidence of the following:*~*

- First, in respect of the Geothermal Project, there is no evidence showing that the
actions taken by Pakistan caused negotiations with suppliers to be put on hold and/or
that the delay to the Geothermal Project occurred as a result of Pakistan’s actions, as

alleged by Mr. Karadeniz in his written evidence;>?>

Second, in respect of the Rehabilitation Programme, there is no evidence that it was
Karkey’s intention to rely on revenue from the Vessels in Pakistan to fund this
program, or that this program was suspended as a result of the alleged breaches of the
Treaty, as also alleged by Mr. Karadeniz in his written evidence.*”° There is also no

evidence that Karkey was unable to obtain alternative financing.

453. It is Pakistan position that the claims for increased insurance costs, increased shipyard costs and

a

penalty charges arising out of the Lebanon contract are equally untenable:°””

First, any increase in insurance costs was caused by the cancelation of Karkey’s
policies arising from the failure to disclose material facts relating to the Supreme Court
proceedings and a past corruption conviction. Mr. Kaczmarek accepted that this would

cause an increase in premiums;

Second, there remains a complete lack of evidence to show that the alleged breaches
of the Treaty in any way contributed to the US$12.5 million in increased fees to the

shipyards;

Third, the claim for penalty charges under the Lebanon contract is premised on an
alleged delay to the delivery of the Orhan Bey: if Karkey fails to establish the causal
link between Pakistan’s alleged breaches and the delay to the Powership Construction

Programme (which included the Orhan Bey), then this claim also fails.

Pakistan concludes that Karkey’s claim for consequential losses should be dismissed for the lack

of any evidence of causal connection to the actions of Pakistan. Even if that causal connection

could be inferred (which is denied) those claims still fail because they are entirely

unsubstantiated.***

f. Issue 17: Claim for Post-Termination Contract Rights

According to Pakistan, there are four amounts that Karkey claims in respect of its Post-

Termination Contract Rights, which are analysed below in turn:

Lakhra for Karkey’s failure to achieve the Target COD on time, allegedly amounting
to US$47.7 million;

(iii)Mobilization and transport charges, allegedly amounting to US$12 million; and
(iv) Termination Charges, allegedly amounting to approximately US$165 million.

(£1) Outstanding Monthly Rental Services Fees

456. According to Pakistan, there are four main issues between the Parties in this regard:

457.

458.

(i) Whether Lakhra was entitled to liquidated damages, thus reducing the amount owed,

as a result of Karkey’s delay in achieving the Target COD;
(ii) Whether the amount owed should be reduced due to a reduction in the contract terms;
(iii) Whether Karkey is entitled to recover amounts invoiced by Karpak; and

(iv) Whether Karkey is entitled to recover amounts even when it was not generating at

full capacity.
- Liquidated Damages

The first issue relates to the sums deducted by Lakhra as liquidated damages. This sum amounts
to US$3.98 million. The actual amount is not in dispute. Clause 4.4(b) of the 2009 RSC entitled
Lakhra to deduct liquidated damages if Karkey failed to achieve commercial operations within
30 days of 7 April 2010. Karkey however relies on Clause 2.A(aa). It argues that this clause
expressly excused Karkey from any delay (and the obligation to pay liquidated damages) arising
from the change of the project site. It also argues that it was relieved of its obligation to meet the

target COD due to force majeure.>*°

According to Pakistan, Clause 2.A(aa) properly construed can only refer to delay caused by the
change in site being the responsibility of Pakistan as buyer. In this case, any change in site cannot

possibly have caused the delay to the COD. This is because the ships in question had not even

been built. The Target COD was 10 April 2010. One was delivered in November 2010 and the
other in February 2011. So Karkey was not prevented from performing its obligation to achieve
COD by any change in site location. It did not perform its obligation to meet the COD because

it was not ready to perform it. Pakistan submits that this is a complete answer to this claim.**!

Moreover, the only two events that Karkey relies on as a Seller Force Majeure Event as defined
in Clause 14 of the 2009 RSC (rather than its original five) are monsoon conditions and
obstructions discovered in the dredging area. Pakistan maintains that neither of these qualifies as
a Seller Force Majeure Event as defined in Clause 14 of the 2009 RSC, not least because Karkey
failed to give notice of either of these events. None of the documents relied on by Karkey meet

the notice requirements under the 2009 RSC.*?
- Reduction in the rental term

If Pakistan is right that Lakhra was entitled to reduce the rental term of the 2009 RSC by 251
days, then Karkey is not entitled to recover the additional US$2.46 million claimed by Karkey
in this regard. It is not in dispute that Clause 4.4(b) of the 2009 RSC entitled Lakhra to make this

reduction, if the delay in achieving COD can be attributed to Karkey alone.*
- Is Karkey entitled to recover amounts invoiced by Karpak?

Invoices for Monthly Rental Services Fees were submitted by both Karkey and Karpak, its
wholly-owned Pakistani incorporated subsidiary. There is a dispute as to whether those invoices
submitted by Karpak are properly recoverable by Karkey in this arbitration. Pakistan’s position

is that they are not.34

According to Pakistan, the new version of the Deed of Assignment adduced in evidence by
Karkey less than 2 weeks before the Hearing is still not a valid assignment of rights. In addition
to seeking the original of this document, Pakistan also sought an explanation as to when this

document was created, by whom and for what purpose. No such explanation has been

forthcoming.*** In addition, as a matter of international law, Karkey is not entitled to make a

direct claim in relation to Karpak’s contractual rights.*°°

Deducting the sums owed to Karpak as part of the Monthly Rental Services Fees reduces

Karkey’s claim by US$17.86 million.>*”

(f.2) Outstanding Fuel Payment Invoices

Karkey claims for outstanding fuel payment invoices, allegedly amounting to over US$9.7
million. It is Pakistan’s position that the outstanding fuel payments are not owed to Karkey.
Rather, they were payable to Karpak, which is not a party to this dispute. The same arguments
apply to Karkey’s entitlement to payment of the two outstanding fuel payment invoices, invoiced

to Karpak, as applied above in respect of the Monthly Services Rental Fees.*3*

(f:3) Mobilization and transport charges

Karkey originally claimed US$12 million for mobilization and transport charges. In its closing
oral submissions at the Hearing, Karkey accepted that this claim is not fully made out on the
evidence. According to Pakistan, that is an understatement — the claim is not made at all on the

evidence.>”

Pakistan argues that Clause 4.6(b) of the 2009 RSC is clear: it refers to the buyer paying
mobilization and transport charges “to return the Equipment to SELLER’s designated depot” >"
It is clear that these charges refer to actual charges incurred by the seller post-termination in
moving the Vessels to a particular designated depot. The onus is on Karkey to produce sufficient
evidence to justify the actual costs it claims. It has failed to do so, despite being on notice by

Pakistan at the outset of these proceedings of the lack of sufficient supporting evidence.*"!

(f-4) Termination Charges

Pakistan submits that there are two issues in respect of the Termination Charges: the first is its
enforceability (a question of law) and the second relates to the proper amount due (essentially a

question of valuation).*”

As to enforceability, Pakistan argues that it is clear that the test under Pakistani law is whether
the Termination Charges represents a genuine pre-estimate of loss. The reference in Karkey’s
opening submissions at the Hearing to English Supreme Court judgment of Cavendish was

entirely irrelevant: no Pakistani court has applied Cavendish.

 

It is also clear that the Termination Charges cannot be considered a genuine pre-estimate of loss.

They are therefore unenforceable as a matter of Pakistani law.*44

. The actual amount of the Termination Charges claimed by Karkey is also too high. Clause 4.6(d)

of the 2009 RSC states that on termination the full, unadjusted amount of the Advance Payment
should be deducted from the Termination Charges. The dispute between the Parties centers on
what “unadjusted” means. It is clear that on a plain reading of this term, the unadjusted down

payment means the full US$80 million should be deducted.**°

Karkey attempts to argue that the figure can in fact be adjusted, to allow for sums already
recovered by Lakhra through Lakhra’s own deductions to the Monthly Rental Services Fees. Mr.
Kaczmarek has sought to argue that unadjusted merely means “unadjusted with respect to
deductions for any disputed amounts” and by attempting to refer to Clause 4.5(b) — which is an
entirely different clause dealing with payment terms. Pakistan argues that there is no legal basis
for implying these additional works into the contract, in a way that Karkey’s quantum expert has

sought to do.*4°

Pakistan’s submits that, as a matter of Pakistani law, the Tribunal must apply the plain meaning

of the work “unadjusted” — it means exactly what it says — the full figure of US$80 million, which

Pakistan paid as part of the Advance Payment. If Pakistan’s argument above is accepted then the
correct amount owing for the Termination Charge is US$149.8 million, not the US$165 million

claimed by Karkey.>47

(6) Pakistan’s Counterclaims

a. Issue 18: Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to hear the counterclaim?
According to Pakistan, Karkey’s principal argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over
Pakistan’s counterclaim is based on the consent of the Parties. Karkey argues that: (a) the dispute
resolution clause in the Treaty “is intended to enable arbitration only at the initiative of the

investor”’; (b) that the Treaty does not allow counterclaims for breaches of domestic law; and

(c) that the Treaty does not impose any obligations on the investor.*“*

Karkey fails to engage with the ipso facto consent theory utilized by the tribunal in Goerz v.
Burundi II, simply noting that it appears to be the only ICSID award to have adopted the theory
of ipso facto consent. Pakistan submits that this does not detract from the validity of the theory.”
Further, Pakistan maintains that Karkey’s arguments ignore the fact that the Tribunal’s
jurisdictional mandate is — pursuant to the plain working of the Treaty — extremely broad, and is
not limited to disputes concerning the host-State’s obligations under the Treaty. In the words of
Article VII(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal’s mandate is to determine “/d/isputes...in connection
with [the investor’s] investment”>°° This language does not limit the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to
affirmative claims by the investor, and the contracting parties’ use of such broad language is a

strong indication that their consent to ICSID arbitration is broad enough to encompa:

 

a
counterclaim by the host-State.**!

Pakistan agrees that the Treaty appears to enable arbitration only at the initiative of the investor.
However, having submitted this dispute to arbitration, Karkey has given the Tribunal the mandate

to determine all aspects of the dispute between the Parties — including Pakistan’s counterclaim.

It has therefore ipso facto given its consent to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and cannot complaint

that the Tribunal is now seized of the matter.°*?

b. Issue 19: If the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Karkey’s claims, does Karkey owe money to
Pakistan as a result of its conduct in the procurement of its alleged investment?

Pakistan submits that, having procured its alleged investment through breaches of the PPRA
Rules, Karkey was ordered by the Supreme Court to repay its Advance Payment plus mark-up.
It has never done so, meaning it has been unlawfully (and therefore unjustly) enriched by that

amount — over PKR11.632 billion. >

Karkey’s assertion that “/bj/ecause even Pakistan’s most favourable damages calculation
demonstrates a net investment loss suffered by Karkey, Karkey was not ‘enriched” is
demonstrably false. Pakistan’s most favourable damages calculation results in zero loss by

Karkey because the 2009 RSC was void ab initio and there has been no breach of the Treaty.**

Further, according to Pakistan, the unjust nature of Karkey’s enrichment is clear, as it has
withheld those moneys in defiance of the Supreme Court and in breach of Pakistani law. Contrary
to Karkey’s unsupported assertions, there is no justification for this continuing breach of
Pakistani law. Finally, given Karkey’s refusal to pay the amounts owing pursuant to the Supreme
Court judgment, it is highly unlikely that a favourable judgment in the Sindh High Court would

constitute a “remedy” for Pakistan.*°°

Moreover, in response to Pakistan’s request that the Tribunal declare the 2009 RSC void ab
initio, Karkey argues that this is a matter of national law which is beyond the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. This is rejected by Pakistan. The Treaty specifically refers to Pakistani law in
defining the scope of what constitutes an “investment”. It is therefore expressly part of the
applicable law on jurisdiction. Pakistan maintains that the Treaty itself requires the Tribunal to
determine compliance with Pakistani law in assessing its jurisdiction — both with regard to the

primary claim and with regard to the counterclaim.**°

Pakistan further argues that Karkey’s failure to comply with the Supreme Court Judgment
represents an unjust enrichment. In response, Karkey argues that the Tribunal does not have

jurisdiction to rule on Pakistan im for unjust enrichment because: (i) the Treaty does not

 

enable domestic law claims; and (ii) unjust enrichment is not a general principle of international
law. Pakistan rejects both of these arguments.>°7

First, Pakistan’s argues that its counterclaim is not made under domestic law. In fact, domestic
law process has (with the exception of a number of Civil Review Petitions) now reached its
conclusion with the result that Karkey has been found liable to repay its Advance Payment
together with mark-up. Karkey has not complied with this obligation. Pakistan now
counterclaims for that amount under international law, which is within the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction. 5°

Second, Pakistan maintains that unjust enrichment is a general principle of international law, as
the authorities relied on by Karkey show. Indeed, whilst Karkey notes that certain ICSID
tribunals have rejected defences based on unjust enrichment, those cases are distinguishable from
this case. In each such case, the defence was rejected on the basis that the alleged enrichment
was not unjust — not on the basis that the principle did not exist.

Finally, Karkey also alleges that “Pakistan is once again estopped now from asserting
counterclaims at ICSID for a simple reason, which is that their counterclaims clearly are purely
contractual or purely contract-based, which is a quality that Pakistan itself has said bars

jurisdiction by the Tribunal over such claims” 5

Pakistan submits that this allegation is incorrect for a number of reasons, inter alia, because
Pakistan counterclaims are made strictly without prejudice to its position that the Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction over any of the disputes between Karkey and Lakhra. The counterclaims
only arise if the Tribunal does not accept this position, and Pakistan cannot be estopped from

bringing counterclaims because they represent an alternative position.*°!

c. Issue 20: If the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Karkey’s Contract Claims, and if the
relevant actions of Lakhra are attributable to Pakistan, does Karkey owe money to
Pakistan as a result of Karkey’s misrepresentations and breaches of the 2009 RSC?

Pakistan submits that Karkey’s contention that Pakistan has abandoned the majority of its
counterclaims under Issue 20 is incorrect. If contrary to Pakistan’s arguments, the Tribunal finds
that Karkey’s claims in respect of its Pre-Termination Contract Rights are at issue (as Karkey
contends), Pakistan will maintain its alternative counterclaim as pleaded in the Counter

Memorial.*

At paragraph 1618 of its Counter-Memorial, Pakistan submits that if the Tribunal does find that
it has jurisdiction in relation to any of Karkey’s Contract Claims and determines that Lakhra’s
acts under the 2009 RSC are attributable to Pakistan, then Pakistan brings the following

counterclaims:

i. Pakistan seeks a declaration that the 2009 RSC (as amended) is void ab initio in

accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court dated 31 March 2012;

. Strictly in the alternative, Pakistan brings the following claims for damages and/or set-
off arising out of Karkey’s misrepresentations (fraudulent or otherwise) and Karkey’s

breaches of the 2009 RSC, as summarized below:

(i) Failure to meet the Target COD in breach of Clause 4.4(b) of the 2009 RSC (as

amended by Clause 3 of Amendment 1);

(ii) Failure to pay damages to which Lakhra was entitled under the Performance
Guarantee (adjusted for the amount of commission charges properly owing to
Karkey) as a result of Karkey’s failure to meet the Target COD, in breach of
Clause 4.4(b) of the 2009 RSC;

(iii) Failure to achieve Commercial Operations in accordance with Clause 8 of the

2009 RSC and in breach of the performance warranties given in that clause;

(iv) Reducing and/or ceasing the generation of electricity during the Rental Term in

breach of Clause 2.B(b) and 4.5(n) of the 2009 RSC.

(7) The Respondent’s Request for Relief
488. At paragraphs 498-500 of its Post-Hearing Brief, Pakistan requested the following relief:
[9498] For all of the foregoing reasons, Pakistan respectfitlly requests that the Tribunal:

(a) dismiss Karkey’s claims in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction, inadmissibility, or

on the merits;

(b) if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the dispute, award Pakistan a sum
of PKR11.632 billion plus simple interest at a rate of I1-month average KIBOR plus
2.15% per annum from 29 October 2015 until the date of payment;

(c) order Karkey to bear all costs and expenses incurred by Pakistan during the course
of this proceeding, including the fees and expenses of legal counsel and expert witnesses,
expenses of factual witnesses, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and administrative

charges of the Centre; and
(d) any additional or alternative relief as the tribunal considers just and appropriate.

[§ 499] In the alternative, if the Tribunal finds that it does have jurisdiction over the
dispute, that Karkey’s claims are admissible, and that Pakistan has breached the Treaty,

Pakistan respectfully requests that the Tribunal:

(a) order Pakistan to release the Alican Bey, Iraq and Enis Bey from the territorial
waters of Pakistan into international waters within 90 days (the Restitution Window) of

the dispatch of the Tribunal’s Award (the Restitution); and

(b) award damages to Karkey only insofar as those damages are caused by Pakistan

and reflect the temporary detention of (and actual damage to) the Vessels.

[9500] In the further alternative to the relief requested at paragraph 341 [sic 499] (or if
the Restitution is not made in full within the Restitution Window), Pakistan respectfully
requests that the Tribunal order compensation in accordance with the methodology

adopted by Mr. Haberman:

(a) within 90 days of the dispatch of the Tribunal’s Award (in the event of an order in

the alternative to Restitution); or

135

(b) within 60 days of the expiry of the Restitution Window (in the event Restitution is not

made).

V. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

489. The Tribunal first will decide below on (A) Pakistan’s allegations of corruption, which have an
impact both on its jurisdiction and on the merits of the case, which will be followed by an analysis
of (B) the effects of the Supreme Court Judgment, and (C) the issue of attribution of Lakhra’s
and PEPCO’s acts to Pakistan. The Tribunal will then analyse (D) its jurisdiction in view of its
findings under A, B and C as well as Pakistan’s allegations of misrepresentation/fraud and
misprocurement. If it upholds jurisdiction, the Tribunal will decide (E) whether Pakistan has
expropriated Karkey’s investment, (F) whether Pakistan breached Article IV of the BIT (free
transfer), (G) the Claimant’s additional claims brought under the MFN, FET and umbrella
clauses, and (H) the alleged damages. The Tribunal will then decide on (I) Pakistan’s
counterclaims. Finally, under Section VI the Tribunal decides on the allocation of the costs of

this arbitration between the Parties.

A. Is Karkey’s “Investment” Tainted by Corruption?

(1) Applicable Standard of Proof and Burden of Proof

- Standard of Proof

490. It is Pakistan’s position that the standard of proof for corruption is the ordinary balance of
probabilities, i.e. whether it is more likely than not that corruption has occurred.* According to
Pakistan, ICSID tribunals have routinely applied the balance of probabilities standard. It relies
inter alia, on the tribunal’s decision in Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine, in which the tribunal stated

that a party advancing a claim “must show that its assertions is more likely than not to be true.”°%*

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 149 of 310

According to Karkey, on the other hand, the standard of proof for allegations of corruption is
high. Specifically, an allegation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, as that

standard is defined under international law.**

The Tribunal finds that the seriousness of the accusation of corruption in the present case,
including the fact that it involves officials at the highest level of the Pakistani Government at the
time, requires clear and convincing evidence. There is indeed a large consensus among

international tribunals regarding the need for a high standard of proof of corruption.5

In any event, even if the Tribunal were to have applied the “balance of probabilities” standard

as suggested by Pakistan, the Tribunal’s conclusion would have been the same as set forth below.
- The Burden of Proof

Karkey submits that it is axiomatic that the burden of proving an assertion lies with the party
presenting it. According to Karkey, the time-honoured principle onus probandi incumbit actori
(the party that asserts must prove) is widely accepted in international arbitration. The principle
applies equally to a respondent as to a claimant. In the context of a jurisdictional objection, the

Pac Rim tribunal explained:

As far as the burden of proof is concerned, in the Tribunal’s view, it
cannot here be disputed that the party which alleges something positive
has ordinarily to prove it...[I]f there are positive objections to
jurisdiction, the burden lies on the Party presenting those objections, in
other words, here to the Respondent.>*"

Karkey points out that, according to Pakistan, Karkey must, in accordance with Metal-Tech v.

Uzbekistan, bear the burden of responding to Pakistan’s so-called “red flags”. According to

56 Karkey’s Post-Hearing Brief, § 81.

566 See, e.g., CA-082, EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania, (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13), Award, 8 October 2009,

that “/t/here is general consensus among international tribunals and commentators regarding the need for a high
standard of proof of corruption”), CA- 262, Oostergetel v. Slovak Republic, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 23 April

judiciary. The Tribunal notes that both Parties agree that the standard of proof in this respect is a high one...It is
not sufficient to present evidence which could po ly indicate that there might have been or even probably was
corruption. Rather, Claimants have to prove corruption”) (emphasis in original).

Karkey, however, shifting to Karkey the burden of proof on the issue of corruption is in
accordance neither with Metal-Tech nor with general evidentiary principles of international
law.5¢8

Pakistan agrees that it bears the initial burden of proof to establish fraud and corruption vitiating
this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. However, its position is that the standard of proving such allegations
is on the ordinary balance of probabilities as applied by previous ICSID tribunals. Further,
tribunals have considered that prima facie evidence may be sufficient to discharge this burden
where proof of a fact, such as corruption, presents extreme difficulty and there is an absence of

evidence in rebuttal. According to Pakistan, it has discharged such burden by establishing a prima

facie case of both fraud and corruption, through direct evidence for fraud and circumstantial

evidence for corruption. As a result, that burden now shifts to Karkey to rebut Pakistan’s prima

facie case based on relevant evidence in its possession.* Pakistan argues that its position on the

shifting of the burden of proof is not, as Karkey suggests, based on the case of Metal-Tech v.
Uzbekistan alone. To the contrary, Pakistan submits that its position is supported by both

commentators and case law.>”°

The Tribunal finds that Respondent bears the burden of proof with respect to its allegations of
corruption pursuant to the well-established principle onus probandi incumbit actori (the party
that asserts must prove). However, the Tribunal finds that it can shift the burden of proof with
respect to corruption and fraud to Karkey should the Tribunal be satisfied that there is

unequivocal (or unambiguous) prima facie evidence in this regard.

(2) Requirements for a Finding of Corruption under Pakistani Law

According to Pakistan, Karkey’s investment was not established in conformity with Pakistan’s
laws, as required by Article I(2) of the Treaty, because, inter alia, all the indications are that its
investment was established by way of corruption. Pakistan submits that corruption is
criminalized by a range of Federal and Provincial legislation, the most pertinent to this arbitration

being the NAO and the PPRA Rules.>”!

499, Karkey contends that it has not violated any Pakistani laws governing corruption, pointing to a

lack of evidence in this regard and to the fact that even the Supreme Court’s Judgment did not

make any finding that Karkey violated Pakistani laws governing corruption.°””

500. The Tribunal cannot ignore the Respondent’s allegations that Karkey’s investment was obtained

by way of corruption, thus not in conformity with Pakistani law, and not protected by the BIT.

501. Rule 2(1)(f) of the PPRA Rules defines “corrupt and fraudulent practices” to include:

502. Section

[...] the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of any thing of value to
influence the action of a public official or the supplier or contractor in the
procurement process or in contract execution to the detriment of the
procuring agencies; or misrepresentation of facts in order to influence a
procurement process or the execution of a contract, collusive practice
among bidders (prior to or after bid submission) designed to establish bid
prices at artificial, non-competitive levels and to deprive the procuring
agencies of the benefits of free and open competition [...] °°

9 of the NAO provides, inter alia, as follows:

9(a) A holder of a public office, or any other person, is said to commit or to
have committed the offense of corruption and corrupt practices:

(i) if he accepts or obtains from any person or offers any gratification
directly or indirectly, other than legal remuneration, as a motive or reward
such as is specified in section 161 of the Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of
1860) for doing or for-bearing to do any official act, or for showing or for-
bearing to show, in the exercise of his official functions, favour or disfavour
to any person, or for rendering or attempting to render any service or
disservice to any person; or

(ii) if he accepts or obtains or offers any valuable thing without
consideration, or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate, from
any person whom he knows to have been, or likely to be, concerned in any
proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by him, or
having any connection with his official functions or [from] any person whom
he knows to be interested in or related to the person so concerned; or [...]

(iv) if he by corrupt, dishonest, or illegal means, obtains or seeks to obtain
for himself, or for his spouse or dependents or any other person, any
property, valuable thing, or pecuniary advantage; or [...]

or any other person, or [renders or attempts to render] [or willfully fails to

(vii) if he has issued any directive, policy, or any SRO (Statutory Regulatory

person]; [...J°™

The Tribunal notes that Pakistani corruption laws may also apply to irregularities arising in a
public procurement. Indeed, a person (including Karkey and/or its directors) has “committed the
offence of corruption and corrupt practices” under Section 9(a) of the NAO, inter alia, if such
person accepts, obtains or offers any valuable thing for inadequate consideration from a person
he or she knows is (or is likely to be) concerned in a business transaction within which they are

involved. (Section 9(a)(ii)).

(3) Analysis of the Evidence regarding Allegations of Corruption

The Tribunal analyses below in turn (3.a) Pakistan’s allegations of corruption related to Mr.
Zulgarnain; (3.b) the alleged “red flags”; (3.¢) the Shipyard visit in September 2010; and (3.d)

the alleged corruption “Scheme”.

Pakistan’s allegations of fraud and misprocurement are addressed under Sections V(D)(1) and

V(D)(2) below.

a. The Involvement of Mr. Zulgarnain
Pakistan submits that Karkey’s alleged explanations for the employment of and scope of services
provided by Mr. Zulgarnain are unsupported by any contemporaneous evidence, and contradicted
by much of the evidence available. Pakistan argues that Karkey has also failed to provide any
satisfactory evidence justifying the sums paid to Mr. Zulgarnain. This would all lead to the
inference that Mr. Zulqarnain was retained for purposes other than those described in his
engagement letter, namely the illegal lobbying and influencing of government officials in order

to secure (and ensure favourable treatment of) Karkey’s RPP in Pakistan.*7>

507. Karkey rejects all of Pakistan’s allegations concerning Mr. Zulqarnain and related to the practice

of corruption.

508. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Zulqarnain was engaged as Karkey’s local representative in Pakistan
on 13 June 2008, which was formalized in a letter of the same date sent from Karkey to Mr.

Zulgarnain, and which provides, inter alia, as follows:

[...] This letter provides the terms of your engagement by Karkey as its local
representative, which shall be as under:

1. You will provide any required local logistic and office support during the
development and bidding phase of the project;

2. You will arrange for a suitable place for setting up office and also
responsible for arranging the boarding and lodging of personnel travelling
from Turkey to Pakistan, including local travel arrangements;

3. You will assist the Company in hiring of relevant resources, employees,
as may be required on the condition that you will have no conflict of interest,
and that you will disclose any relation with kith or kin that you may
introduce;

4. You will assist Karkey in opening bank accounts in Pakistan [...] You shall
forward statement of expenditures to Karkey from time to time;

5. You will participate in official ings with various government entities
involved in the Project along with designated personnel from Karkey, Turkey
(without the power to bind Karkey or its sponsors unless a specific power of
attorney is executed in writing);

6. You shall not have any legal authority to bind or enter into a contract with
any person or the Government of Pakistan unless specifically authorized in
writing; [...]

The Company will either make arrangements for you to be provided monies

for taking care of expenses upfront or you will be reimbursed any expenses
incurred by you from time to time. In addition, the Company shall pay you a
lump sum of USD 100,000/- on mobilization of vessels for Pakistan. In the
event our company is awarded the contract, then we will enter into _a
separate agreement for your d with our y, if
mutually agreed.>”°

 

509. It is reasonable to accept that Karkey, as a foreign investor going to a new country, needed a

  

local representative/agent at least at the outset of the project in order to 2

 

st in setting up local

office facilities, hire local personnel, coordinate site preparation activities, etc. The Tribunal is

satisfied that the evidence on the record demonstrates that the services provided by Mr.

Zulgarnain were indeed within the scope of his letter of engagement.

For instance, the Tenancy Agreement dated 12 November 2009°” concluded between Mr.
Zulgarnain and Syed Nasir Abbas for a property in Karachi, shows that Mr. Zulgarnain was
involved in setting up Karkey’s local operations. There are also letters and minutes of meetings
showing that Mr. Zulqarnain has scheduled and attended meetings related to the Project, *”* and
assisted with preparation of the Project Site.°”

Although the Claimant acknowledges that Mr. Zulqarnain’s role was reduced in 2010 when
Karkey recruited its own country manager and retained Berkeley Associates as a technical
consultant, documents in the record show that Mr. Zulgarnain continued to play a role in the

logistics and administration of the Project until his departure in August 2011.°°°

For his services over the course of three years, Mr. Zulqarnain was paid compensation of
US$115,000,>*! which the Tribunal finds reasonable for services of the extent and nature that he
provided. Although the compensation agreed between Mr. Zulqarnain under the letter of
engagement was US$100,000, the additional payment of US$15,000 is justified by the fact that
Mr. Zulgarnain continued to provide services after Karkey was awarded the contract. Karkey
also paid US$285,655 to Mr. Zulqarnain to cover expenses incurred in connection with the

Project, which primarily consisted of office rent, car and boat rental, and various other travel and

logistic expenses.*** Karkey incurred expenses of an overall total of more than US$250 million

in connection with the Project.**? When these amounts are put in context, the Tribunal notes that
the expenses incurred by Mr. Zulgarnain together with the compensation paid for his services

represent only a small fraction (i.e. less than 1 %) of the total investment.

Although not all the payments made to Mr. Zulgarnain are substantiated as pointed out by the

Respondent,*** and there are invoices missing, this lack of substantiation is not enough for a
finding of corruption, in particular in view of their relatively low amount and the fact that many

of them related to payments for which a receipt would not normally have been given.

Also, although Pakistan initially alleged that Mr. Zulgarnain’s role for Karkey was similar to that
of two of the consultants in Metal-Tech,*** to whom the claimant in Metal-Tech had paid millions
of dollars via an offshore company in return for their services of “lobbying” government officials,
at the end of the Hearing, Pakistan’s counsel acknowledged that such comparison was inapposite:
“Pakistan accepts we are not in Metal-Tech territory where the consultants included the brother

of the Prime Minister’°*° Although it was reported that Mr. Zulqarnain had some family

5 . . re
°87 there is no evidence in this case that

relationship with the then Prime Minister, Mr. Gilani,
they were so close to Mr. Zulqarnain as to give rise to a suspicion of corruption. In his Witness
Statement, Mr. Aslam, a witness proffered by Pakistan, refers to a “female relative” of Mr.
Zulqarnain having some relationship with the Prime Minister’s wife.*** No family ties with any

other official responsible for approving the Claimant’s investment were alleged.

There was also no witness expressly alleging, let alone, confirming the payment of bribes.

 

Although counsel for Pakistan repeatedly referred to “red flags” and suspicious circumstances
after Mr. Karadeniz had given evidence, no question regarding fraud or corruption was ever put

to Mr. Karadeniz in cross-examination.

Mr. Aslam, who was the Additional Secretary to the MoWP between August 2008 and November
2009, has stated his concerns about Mr. Zulgarnain’s conduct in his witness statement, as
follows: “/...] Lhave no knowledge of any bribes having been paid, however I was aware at the
time of a number of rumours due to the favorable treatment Karkey was receiving over other
projects.”>* At the Hearing, Mr. Aslam confirmed that he did not know of any bribes having

been paid by or on behalf of Karkey in connection with Karkey’s project.>”

In view of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that Mr.
Zulgarnain was involved in anything that could qualify as corruption, apart from alleged
suspicions and “red flags” which are not sufficient to indicate, far less prove, the occurrence of

corruption.

b. The “Red Flags”

1°! which would indicate that

Pakistan lists seventeen “red flags” in its Counter-Memorial
Karkey’s alleged investment was procured by corruption. Pakistan submits that, in the event that
Karkey fails to provide sufficient evidence to rebut the numerous “red flags” surrounding
Karkey’s project, this Tribunal should conclude that the 2009 RSC was procured via

corruption.*?

The Claimant rejects Pakistan’s allegation that Karkey secured its investment through corruption

which it sustains is unsupported by either the factual record or the law.

The Tribunal notes that the “red flags” mentioned by Pakistan consist only of questions regarding

Karkey’s investment that read as follows:

(a) Why did the Ministry to Water and Power (the MoWP) suddenly insert
a new proposal for ‘[r]jental projects, including barge mounted with
cumulative capacity of 200 MW’ on the day its proposal was to be put
forward for government approval before the Cabinet? Why were those words
not included in the draft circulated to all other ministries for comment?

(b) Why was the proposal rushed through in such haste, in a matter of just
days, by the Secretary and Minister to Water and Power, without giving any
time to other officials in the Ministry and PPIB to analyse the proposal?

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 157 of 310

(c) What moved the MoWP suddenly to increase the proposal for rental
power from 200 to SOOMW with no explanation and no apparent basis or
justification but creating sufficient capacity for the bids of both Karkey and
Walters to proceed (the only two bids which represented they could meet the
required project schedule)?

(d) Why was the evaluation criterion defining the basis on which a bid would
be declared responsive — Net Worth — changed just three days before
Karkey’s bid was submitted and in circumstances where Karkey’s Bid would
not have met the Net Worth criteria (as originally drafted)? Why does Karkey
not mention in its Updated Memorial that its Bid did not satisfy this
requirement?

(e) Why were all decisions in relation to the RPPs taken by the Minister to
Water and Power (Mr. Raja Ashraf) and the Secretary for Water and Power
(either Mr. Ismail Qureshi or Mr. Shahid Rafi) — all the subject of criminal
prosecution in Pakistan for their role in the corruption scandal — without
consulting the other officials in the Ministry?

(f) Why did the Minister, Mr. Ashraf, only reconstitute the Board of the PPIB
— usually responsible for approving the selection of bidders in all IPPs, but
not previously involved in the public tender of RPPs — the day after Karkey
was issued with the Letter of Award?

(g) Why were so many changes to the contract introduced, in favour of
Karkey (and in breach of procurement laws) following the Letter of Award?
Why did the MoWP and PPIB ignore the advice of the legal director that
these changes were ‘substantial’ and a ‘deviation’ from other RPP
contracts? Why does Karkey not mention that these changes included the
removal of its responsibility for interconnection (which was a substantial
obligation) and the imposition of an obligation on Lakhra to share in the
commission charges on the Advance Payment Guarantee, regardless of
termination? Why was there no corresponding reduction in the tariff when
the cost of interconnection was shifted from Karkey to Lakhra? Why does
Karkey not explain the content and progress of Karkey II?

(h) Why did Mr. Zuberi of the PPIB — of which Mr. Ashraf was Chairman —
ignore Lakhra’s early concerns about these ‘material changes’, which
Lakhra thought should be approved by the ECC? Why did Mr. Zuberi
suggest they did not need the approval of ECC?

(i) The ECC’s approval of the rental power projects was conditional on the
contracts being terminable if not delivered on time. This condition was
confirmed by NEPRA. Why was this condition not included in Karkey’s
contract?

(i) What persuaded the MoWP to press for a waiver (or deferral) of the 6%
withholding tax unquestionably due on Karkey’s Advance Payment of US$80
million? Why did the MoWP remove from its summary to the ECC the
opinion of the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) confirming that
withholding tax was due? Why did the MoWP persist in pressing for the

145

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 158 of 310

deferral, even afier the FBR had confirmed it did not apply to Karkey? What
persuaded the FBR to change its view?

(k) What is the link between Karkey’s unsolicited offer to deliver a further
220MW of power in July 2009 — which was immediately placed on fast track
by Mr. Ashraf — and the AED350,000, transferred just four days earlier from
Dubai to the personal account of Karkey’s country representative in
Pakistan, Mr. Zulgarnain (a close relative of the then Prime Minister, Mr.
Gilani)? Again, why does Karkey not address this proposal for Karkey II
(except once, in a footnote)?

(l) Why did Mr. Ashraf ignore the letter from Transparency International to
him personally, asking that he ‘review the awards of RPP, which in TI
Pakistan’s opinion were not complying with the PPRA Public procurement
rules 2004’ — a letter he received on the same day as he approved the fast-
tracking of Karkey’s unsolicited offer?

(m) What persuaded the MoWP to substitute Karkey’s site from Mauripur to
Korangi? What persuaded Walters Power (at the request of the MoWP) to
move — when it already owned the land at Korangi and had invested in its
design at that location?

(n) Why did Lakhra repeatedly fail to enforce its rights arising out of
Karkey’s continued failure to achieve commercial operations by the required
Target COD? Why did Lakhra simply keep extending the Target COD?

(0) Why did the CEO of Lakhra, Mr. Brohi, issue a Certificate of
Achievement of Commercial Operations in circumstances where Karkey’s
vessels failed the key Operational Test — the 2-hour Reliability Run Test
provided for in Clause 4.4 of the 2009 RSC — which was a condition of
Karkey achieving commercial operations? Why did Karkey not mention this
in its Updated Memorial? Why do Karkey’s witnesses — including Mr. El
Suudi, who, together with Mr. Brohi, signed the report in which this key
failed test is unambiguously recorded — not mention this in their statements
when they confirm that the Certificate of Achievement of Commercial
Operations was issued by Lakhra? Mr. Brohi’s suggestion at the time, that
he did not think the Reliability Run Test was required, ignores the clear terms
of the contract and is not remotely plausible.

(p) Why was this not raised before the Supreme Court by either Karkey
(through its lawyer) or Mr. Brohi? Why did Karkey’s lawyer produce only
the two certificates that were issued — and not the report confirming that the
third and crucial certificate was not because the Reliability Run Test failed?

(q@) Why does Karkey not mention in its Updated Memorial its insurance
claim (which revealed the conviction of one of Karkey’s directors, Mr. Nuri
Dogan Karadeniz, in Turkey in relation to the bribery of an official during
an unrelated public tender in order to secure preferential treatment for
Karkey)? This claim, now settled, was for the total loss of its vessels, and
any sums paid in furtherance of it are clearly of potential relevance to

146

521.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 159 of 310

Karkey’s damages claim in this arbitration — yet Karkey makes no mention
of it. 3
The Tribunal is not satisfied that these so-called “red flags”, consisting solely of questions, are
of sufficient weight and credibility to shift Pakistan’s burden of proving its allegations of
corruption to Karkey, so as to require Karkey to exonerate itself. Several questions raised by
Pakistan are based on alleged acts or omissions by Pakistani government officials which are not
proven and if such acts and omissions are established, they may have many other explanations
than corruption by Karkey. For instance, what is often described as haste of the Prime Minister
and of the Minister to Water and Power motivated by corruption may just as well reflect their
manner of exercising power. Likewise, what are presented as advantages obtained by Karkey
through contract modification may also be explained by the inability of Pakistan’s administration
to comply with some of its contractual obligations, such as the issuing of a guarantee, and the
consequent need to offer a reciprocal benefit to Karkey. In any case, Pakistan has failed to
demonstrate that Karkey would be in the possession of any evidence which could explain the real
motivation of Pakistani officials. Thus, the Tribunal would not be entitled to draw adverse
inferences against Karkey, such as to shift the burden of proof, and deduce that its inability to
prove such motivations must necessarily be explained by corruption. Moreover, suggesting, as
in question (k), that a Minister could have been corrupted by an amount of AED 350,000 (less
than US$100,000) in relation to a project ofa value of several hundreds of millions of US Dollars
is not convincing, in particular when it has been shown that it corresponded more or less to the
compensation of Mr. Zulqarnain to whom the amount was actually paid. The Tribunal is unable
to find in the elements included in Pakistan’s questions “red flags” suggestive of corruption, such

as to transfer the burden of proof, still less any positive proof of corruption.

c. Shipyard Visit in September 2010
Pakistan states that, in September 2010, Karkey paid flights for a delegation of Pakistani
government officials.*°* According to Pakistan, payment for these flights is a “valuable thing”
offered by Karkey for inadequate consideration, to persons concerned in a business transaction

with Karkey (the RPP) in breach of Section 9(a)(ii) of the NAO. The fact that Pakistan requested

the visit and/or that it was for a valid purpose is irrelevant. Moreover, Pakistan points out that
there is no evidence that it requested Karkey to pay for the visit, which was a breach of Section

9 of the NAO (and in violation of the Civil Establishment Code).5°

In September 2010, a delegation of representatives of the Government of Pakistan did indeed
travel to inspect the Kaya Bey at the shipyard for meetings at Karkey’s headquarters in

Istanbul.°°°

The Tribunal finds that there is nothing disproportionate in the payment of five plane tickets (in
the total of approximately EUR 3,000.00) for a delegation of Pakistani government officials in
the context of a visit to Karkey’s headquarters to accompany the development of the Project.
Such payment is not sufficient for a finding of corruption and/or as a “valuable thing” offered by
Karkey for inadequate consideration under Section 9 of the NOA. This is particularly the case
when the Pakistani Government itself requested the shipyard visit,°’ which was fully

documented and reported, including with respect to Karkey’s payment of the trip expenses.**

d. The Alleged Corruption “Scheme”

According to Pakistan, following the filing of Pakistan’s Rejoinder but at least two months prior
to the Hearing, Pakistan was informed by two previously unknown individuals, Mr. Samir
Tannous and Mr. Tarek Nahas (working with Mr. Mustafa Ramday, a lawyer in Pakistan), of the
existence of a sophisticated scheme implemented by Karkey, involving significant payments by
Karkey to secure Karkey’s contract in Pakistan (the “Scheme”). Pakistan and its counsel were

shown copies of documents (i.e. consultancy agreements the contents of which were recorded in

were allegedly linked to and for the purpose of securing Karkey’s contract in Pakistan.°!

According to Pakistan, the copy of a Consultancy Agreement stated, inter alia, that the
Consultant (whose name was redacted) was responsible for appointing a local agent at its own
costs and expense to assist Karkey in securing the operation of the Contract in relation to matters
related to certain local authorities for the duration of the Contract. In return for securing the RSC,
Karkey would pay the Consultant 6% of the contract price under the RSC (over US$33 million)

which was payable in tranches linked to payments due to Karkey under the RSC.°

The copy of the Local Consultancy Agreement (the date of which was redacted) stated, inter alia,
that the Consultant would pay over US$4.8 million (equal to 6% of the Advance Payment under
the 2009 RSC) to the Local Consultant (whose name was also redacted), in return for successfully
facilitating the execution of the RSC. This amount was payable in two tranches, the size of which
depended on certain trigger events under the 2009 RSC and the Consultancy Agreement,
including whether the Advance Payment under the RSC would be paid inclusive or net of

withholding tax.5°

At the same time, Mr. Tannous allegedly told Pakistan and its counsel of reams of emails
confirming the existence of the Scheme. If genuine, those documents would be evidence that
Pakistan has been the victim of a large-scale fraud by Karkey (and others) which goes to the very
heart of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.°% However Mr. Tannous and Mr. Nahas requested “millions
of dollars”®> to hand over the Consultancy Agreement and the Local Consultancy Agreement,

an amount that Pakistan was not prepared to pay.

According to Pakistan, it was for this reason that it sought the assistance of the Tribunal and
made its application dated 11 December 2015 (just two weeks after the Scheme came to light),

together with the witness statement of Mr. Mark Levy (a partner at Allen & Overy LLP who had

participated in the meeting with Mr. Tannous and Mr. Nahas) and supporting documents, seeking
disclosure by Karkey. In particular, Pakistan sought disclosure of 70 backup tapes on which
Karkey had claimed that its electronic records were stored for the period up to April 2010 (the
Backup Tapes) — i.e. the exact period to which the Consultancy Agreement and the Local
Consultancy Agreement indicate the Scheme relate. Karkey had previously relied on these
Backup Tapes in resisting certain of Pakistan’s requests for disclosure. Pakistan’s previous
requests for disclosure of relevant documents on the Backup Tapes had been rejected by the

Tribunal.°°°

In response to this, Karkey denied the existence of the Scheme and argued that the Scheme had
been fabricated by a Pakistani government insider.” In Procedural Order No. 12, the Tribunal
declined to order any disclosure “/s/ince Karkey declares that the documents requested in
Pakistan’s Application do not exist” ©

During its Opening Statement at the Evidentiary Hearing, Pakistan renewed for a third time its
application for disclosure of the Backup Tapes by Karkey on the basis that the Tribunal had
accepted Karkey’s bare denial of existence of the documents as truthful without having given
Pakistan an opportunity to test it by requiring restoration and review of the Backup Tapes which
Karkey acknowledged it had not even reviewed. The costs of disclosing the Backup Tapes had
been estimated by an independent expert retained by Pakistan at £27,600, and they were costs

that Pakistan agreed to bear.®

The Tribunal dealt with the application on Day 2 of the Evidentiary Hearing,°'” and decided to
admit several of the documents that Pakistan wanted to introduce in the record, including Exhibit
R-425 (i.e. the Attendance Note), but did not admit a witness statement of Mr. Rafi, on the basis

that the Tribunal considered it could have been submitted earlier.°"!

As noted at the closing of the Evidentiary Hearing, Pakistan raised its concern at the Tribunal’s
decision to exclude what it believes to be relevant evidence. Pakistan is further concerned by the
Tribunal’s (a) rejection of Pakistan’s application regarding (and its apparent unwillingness to
investigate the veracity of) the alleged Scheme including the rejection of Mr. Khan’s statement
(which also went to the activities of Mr. Zulgarnain), as well as (b) the standards applied to
requests for the introduction of new evidence by Karkey, which differed from those applied to

Pakistan.°!

The Tribunal has duly considered all the allegations made by Pakistan with respect to the
purported Scheme and its expressions of “concern”, which amount to a thinly veiled accusation
of lack of impartiality and of failure in the Tribunal’s “clear duty to address issues of bribery,
money laundering or serious fraud whenever they arise in the arbitration.”°'? The Tribunal notes
that, in the article from which this quotation was taken by Pakistan, the authors also say that
“[t]he Tribunal must guard against the tactical use of allegations to avoid making payments as
previously agreed, or otherwise deflect attention from one party’s own contractual non-

614 and, again, that “/t/he tribunal must proceed with care, and its task is not made

performance
easier by the risk that a party may reveal the corrupt purpose of a contract in order to avoid
sharing its benefits with the other party or otherwise to escape the consequences of its own
contractual non-performance.”®'> The statement as to “the clear duty” of a Tribunal must be

read in its context.

It is important to stress that Karkey’s Request for Arbitration was dated 11 March 2013. Pakistan
raised these allegations in an Application dated 11 December 2015, by which time a Hearing had
already been provisionally fixed for the week beginning 29 February 2016. The Tribunal had
therefore to consider whether the matters raised by Pakistan were such as to justify the making
of the extensive order sought by it, which would, almost certainly, have resulted in postponement

of the Hearing for an unpredictable length of time.

The basis for the Application was stated to be “new evidence of which Pakistan has only very
recently been made aware through an unsolicited approach by a Lebanese individual” — in itself,
a curious story. The documents allegedly newly available were themselves very suspicious. The
alleged Consultancy Agreements shown to Pakistan’s counsel were mere copies and had names
and dates redacted, making it impossible to verify their authenticity. It can also be noted from
paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Attendance Notes that Pakistan’s counsel themselves had serious
doubts about the authenticity of the alleged new evidence relating to the purported Scheme.*'®
Moreover, Pakistan’s explanation that it had continued its dialogue with Mr. Tannous but that
the latter withdrew his cooperation when he found out about Pakistan’s application to the
Tribunal,°'” together with the fact that Pakistan’s alleged informants were requesting a huge
amount of money to cooperate, are such as to destroy any semblance of credibility of the new
“evidence”. The submissions made by Pakistan at the hearing disclosed nothing beyond what

was already contained in the Application of 11 December 2015.

In reality, Pakistan was asking the Tribunal to embark upon an investigation as to the existence
of corruption two months before the Hearing and then at the Hearing, after almost three years of
arbitral proceedings. This request was based on allegations of suspicion of corruption and
declarations of informants of highly suspect credibility, after the Pakistani authorities, with
powers considerably greater than those of the Tribunal, had failed to establish the existence of

such corruption after several years of investigation.

It is important to note that the Supreme Court has made no specific finding of corruption in its
Judgment regarding Karkey. Following the Judgment of the Supreme Court, the NAB, which is
an Executive agency tasked with the authority to investigate and enforce the NAO and which has
been investigating allegations of corruption related to the Project for the past four years, has not

found any evidence of corruption related to Karkey.

In fact, the NAB itself concluded that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Karkey under

the NAO, “afier a detailed examination of all accounts and documents”.©'® Indeed, it entered

into a Deed on 7 September 2012 settling Karkey’s accounts wherein it expressly stated that

Karkey had no liability under the NAO:

NAB confirms that after having completed its enquiry, it is satisfied that

KARKEY KARADENIZ ELETRIK URETIM 4A.S., its wholly owned

subsidiaries and their respective affiliates [...] have settled the agreed

account between Karkey and Lakhra [...]. Resultantly, KARKEY has no

liability under the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, and there

remains no basis or evidence for proceeding(s) by NAB or any other entity

against KARKEY and/or its project/investment and that NAB has completed

and closed its enquiry in respect of KARKEY.5!
In addition to signing the Deed with Lakhra and Karkey, NAB issued a NOC in October 2012,
clearing Karkey of any and all liability under the NAO and reiterating its conclusion as stated in
the above paragraph.°°
The Tribunal is aware that Pakistan has tried to diminish the importance of the Deed and the
NOC based on the fact that these documents were later rejected by the Supreme Court because
the value of the settlement concluded was allegedly too low. However, as stated by the Claimant,
Pakistan points to no ruling from the Supreme Court questioning NAB’s clearing Karkey of any

liability under the NAO.

Moreover, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that the Civil Review Petition of the Judgement of
the Supreme Court filed by the Ministry of Water and Power on 24 April 2012! is still pending.

In this Petition the Ministry of Water and Power raises, inter alia, the following:

That the findings of the honorable Court that functionaries are prima facie
involved in corruption and corrupt practice is not supported by evidence or
material submitted either by the petitioner or by any other person and such
observations undermine the fundamental rights of the functionaries, in
particular Article IO-A of the Constitution.°
In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence of corruption on the record
related to Karkey’s alleged investment and that Pakistan’s last minute allegations related to the

“Scheme” are based on manoeuvres by persons who may or may not have been identified which

were more probably aimed at extorting money from Pakistan or at derailing the arbitration

proceedings than at genuinely allowing corruption to be established. This cannot lead to a finding
of corruption or even a shifting of the burden of proof. Even if the Tribunal were to apply the
“balance of probabilities” standard as proposed by Pakistan, the Tribunal finds that there is
insufficient evidence to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that Karkey was involved

in the practice of corruption.

The Effect of the Supreme Court’s Judgment

The Parties agree that the Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence in this arbitration.
As pointed out by Pakistan “the Parties further agree that the Supreme Court Judgment is not
binding upon the Tribunal’s determination of jurisdiction in this arbitration” 6?

However, the Parties disagree as to the weight and effect that the Tribunal should give to the
Supreme Court’s Judgment that declared the 2009 RSC void ab initio.

It is Pakistan’s position that the Supreme Court of Pakistan is the ultimate source of Pakistani
law. Thus, when conducting its jurisdictional investigation, the Tribunal should treat the
Judgment on the issues of Pakistani law relevant to Karkey’s investment as authoritative, i.e.
only if the Tribunal finds that there has been a denial of justice can the Judgment be ignored.°*4
According to Pakistan there has been no denial of justice in this case. It follows that Karkey’s
contract is void ab initio under Pakistani law in accordance with the Judgment and its investment
was established in material breach of fundamental principles of Pakistani law and contrary to

Article I(2) of the Treaty.°>

Karkey submits that the Supreme Court’s Judgment impacts the merits of this case only insofar
as the Judgment itself violates the BIT. The Judgment does not preclude the Tribunal possibly
finding liability by Pakistan for its numerous other breaches of the BIT.°*° According to Karkey,
Pakistan’s argument rests on the false premise that unless the Tribunal finds (i) a denial of justice
that (ii) arose from a procedural defect in the Judgment, the Tribunal is bound by the Court’s
finding that the Contract is void ab initio. Karkey submits that the Tribunal is not bound to defer

to a national court judgment made in violation of international law — regardless of whether that

violation takes the form of a denial of justice or of some other breach of Pakistan’s BIT
obligations. In any event, under no circumstances could the Judgment, deciding liability under
national law, inoculate Pakistan from responsibility for breaches of international law in the
alleged implementation (by executive authorities) of that Judgment, nor could it validate

subsequent directives from the Supreme Court.°?7
By way of reminder, the Supreme Court held in its Judgment of 30 March 2012, inter alia, that:

[para. 84(iii)] The contracts of all the RPPs [...] were entered into in
contravention of law/PPRA Rules, which, besides suffering from other
irregularities, violated the principle of transparency and fair and open
competition, therefore, the same are declared to be non-transparent, illegal
and void ab initio. Consequently, the contracts of RPPs are ordered to be
rescinded forthwith and all the persons responsible for the same are liable
to be dealt with for civil and criminal action in accordance with law.°*

As stated by the tribunal in Helnan v. Egypt:

An ICSID Tribunal will not act as an instance to review matters of domestic

law in the manner of a court of higher instance. Instead, the Tribunal will

accept the findings of local courts as long as no deficiencies, in procedure

or substance, are shown in regard to the local proceedings which are of a

nature of rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from the viewpoint of

international law, such as in the case of a denial of justice.°°
Indeed, in order to decide whether the Tribunal may rely on the Judgment, the Tribunal must
analyse whether the Judgment presents deficiencies which are unacceptable from the viewpoint
of international law. However, contrary to what is alleged by Pakistan, there is no need that such
deficiencies amount to a denial of justice which, as pointed out by the Helnan award on which
both parties rely albeit from different points of views,” is only one of the possible breaches of
international law to be taken into consideration. Deficiencies relating to the substance of the
Judgment, in certain circumstances, may amount to a breach of international law. In particular,
an international tribunal may decide not to defer to an arbitrary judicial decision which is, as

such, incompatible with international law.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 168 of 310

It is noteworthy that the International Court of Justice in the Diallo case®! has implicitly
indicated that an international tribunal is not necessarily bound by the finding of a national

jurisdiction in exceptional circumstances by pointing out: “Exceptionally, where a State puts

forward a manifestly incorrect interpretation of its domestic law, particularly for the purpose of

gaining an advantage in a pending case, it is for the Court to adopt what it finds to be the proper
interpretation.” If, in such circumstances an international tribunal may substitute its own
interpretation to that of a municipal court without having previously found a denial of justice, it
may a fortiori disregard the findings under municipal law of a municipal court decision which

are arbitrary and irrational.

It is against that background, that the Tribunal will now review the procedure and substance of
the Supreme Court proceeding and decide whether it must accept as binding upon it the finding
of the Supreme Court that Karkey’s RPP Contract was void ab initio. Accepting that Karkey’s
RPP Contract is void ab initio would, according to Pakistan, have the effect of depriving the

Tribunal of jurisdiction.

First, the Tribunal notes that the Supreme Court proceeded on the basis of Mr. Hayat’s erroneous
assertion that Pakistan had sufficient generation capacity, despite PEPCO’s demonstration that
Mr. Hayat had mistakenly “comparfed] Power (MW) with Energy (MkWh), which are two

29632

different things. Given the improbability that Pakistan’s authorities would enter into a

Contract for the supply of energy that was, on Mr. Hayat’s hypothesis, totally unnecessary, it is

 

reasonable to expect that a court acting ex proprio motu, and having had the point drawn to its
attention, would, at the very least, have sought independent confirmation of Mr. Hayat’s

assertion. This was not the case.

Second, the Court imposed identical liability on all the RPP sponsors, despite material
differences between the procurement, financing, and operational status of the different RPP
Programs.**? It is reasonable to expect that a Judgment having such serious consequences for
those concerned would have defined with some particularity the evidential and legal basis on

which each of them, considered separately, was liable to suffer such consequences. The Supreme

Court’s Judgment does nothing of that sort. In the opinion of the Tribunal, this makes its decision

arbitrary.

Third, the Court declared all RPP contracts to be both “void ab initio” and “rescinded forthwith”,
even though such holdings are mutually inconsistent. The Tribunal understands that it is a basic
principle of the common law, embodied in the Indian Contract Law 1872 (continued in force in
Pakistan, as well in as India and Bangladesh), that whereas a voidable contract is enforceable
(though it can in certain circumstances be rescinded), an agreement that is void is by its nature
unenforceable. To say that a void agreement must be rescinded is a contradiction in terms and is
irrational.°4 Such a fundamental inconsistency in the Judgment must raise a serious question as
to whether the Tribunal is bound to treat it as a definitive statement of the legal status of Karkey’s
RPP according to Pakistan law. In that respect, the Tribunal found unconvincing Justice Karim’s

explanation of this aspect of the Judgment.©> It is to be noted, moreover, when an agreement is

  

discovered to be void, or when a contact becomes void, any person who has received any
advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to make compensation for
it to the person from whom he received it.©° A finding that an agreement is void does not, by

itself, end the matter as far as the rights of parties are concerned.

The Tribunal notes that these criticisms as to the irrationality and arbitrariness of the Supreme
Court Judgment are supported by Pakistan’s own submissions (Civil Review Petitions)” to the
Supreme Court that were filed after the Judgment was rendered in order to obtain its

reconsideration.

For instance, in Civil Review Petition No. 101, filed by the Federation of Pakistan through the
Secretary, Ministry of Water & Power and others, dated 24 April 2012, Pakistan requested, inter

alia, the following relief:

In light of the aforesaid grounds and facts, the following submissions are

reconsidered and withdrawn, keeping in view the submissions made
hereinabove which shows that while arriving at such conclusion the Hon’ble
Court did not consider the material facts that were placed on record and as

such there was an error on the face of record;

2. That the Hon’ble court be pleased to withdraw the observations relating
to the non-submissions of record by PEPCO and Ministry of Water & Power
as the submissions made above reveal that the complete information relating
to demand, supply, cost of production of electricity by RPPs, IPPs, [...] were
place before this honorable Court. The adverse inference drawn by this

honorable Court is misreading of facts resulting in error on face of record.

 

4. That the conclusions drawn by this honorable Court in respect of the
functionaries of Ministry of Water & Power, PPIB, PEPCO and GENCOs
as being involved in corrupt practices is based on misreading of record as
has been illustrated hereinabove [...].

5. That the directives for taking criminal action is not in accordance with the

principles of natural justice nor in accordance with the letter and spirit of
Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

6. It is prayed that this honorable Court be pleased to review its Judgment
dated 30" March 2012 and recall/modify the same keeping in view the
submissions made in the review petition.°**

558. According to the principle of national and international law known as approbate and reprobate,°*?

Pakistan may not at the same time both rely on the Supreme Court decision and seek to have it
recalled or modified. (As far as the Tribunal has been informed, the procedure in Pakistan’s

Civil Review Petition has not been concluded.)

559. Inany case, since, as the Tribunal has held, corruption has not been proven, Pakistan cannot rely
on the Supreme Court Judgment in so far as it refers to the breach of procurement laws as it was
Pakistan’s officials who are supposed to have breached the law and/or decided not to apply the

procurement laws.

International Court of Justice in the Aegean Continental Shelf case as “a specific application of the principle of inter-
temporal law, tempered by the equitable doctrine of approbation and reprobation”: Sinclair, The Vienna Convention

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 171 of 310

Last but not least, the Tribunal notes that the Supreme Court played an active part in several of
the acts attributable to Pakistan and that are presented by Karkey as a general pattern of breaches

of the BIT.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal does not consider itself to be bound, as an international
tribunal, by the finding of the Supreme Court that Karkey’s RPP Contract was void ab initio. The
Judgment, however, will not be ignored, and it will be considered by the Tribunal as a fact. The
Tribunal therefore rejects Pakistan’s contention that Karkey’s investment was established in
material breach of fundamental principles of Pakistani law and contrary to Article I(2) of the

Treaty.

Attribution

It is Karkey’s position that the fact that Lakhra’s actions gave rise to contract claims does not
mean that they did not also give rise, separately and in parallel, to treaty claims. Lakhra’s actions
gave rise to treaty claims that are analytically distinct from any contract claim that Karkey could
assert, and it is the former rather than the later that constitute the subject of this arbitration.“
Karkey’s principal treaty claims relating to the alleged non-performance by Lakhra of obligations
under the Contract (i.e. not including claims relating to the non-performance by Pakistan itself
of the Sovereign Guarantee), are related to Pakistan’s alleged breach of fair and equitable
treatment, denial of justice-based FET breaches, failure to observe obligations under the Contract

pursuant to the umbrella clause, and failure to provide full protection and security.°!

Before considering whether Lakhra’s alleged non-performance of the Contract can give rise to
Pakistan’s alleged breaches of the Treaty and whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the
Claimant’s claims, it is first necessary to determine whether the acts of Lakhra complained in

this regard are attributable to Pakistan as a matter of international law.

(1) Are the Acts of Lakhra attributable to Pakistan?

According to Karkey, Lakhra’s alleged acts and omissions in breach of the Contract (and the

BIT) were controlled and directed by the Government of Pakistan, and as such are attributable to

the State.” Karkey submits that Lakhra’s acts are clearly attributable to Pakistan under Article
5 and 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Although Pakistan accepts that the acts of
the Supreme Court, MoWP and the NAB are attributable to the State, it is Pakistan’s position
that the acts of Lakhra are not, as Lakhra is a separate legal entity with autonomy from the

State.

Pakistan submits that Lakhra’s acts are not attributable to the State of Pakistan unless specifically
and individually directed, instructed or controlled by the State. Only Lakhra’s institution of the
Sindh High Court Proceedings, which was done at the specific request of the NAB is admitted
by Pakistan as being attributable to the State.“ Pakistan contends that Karkey has failed to
demonstrate that Pakistan issued any specific instruction, direction or control to Lakhra in respect

of each instance in which Lakhra is said to have acted as Pakistan.
Article 5 of the ILC Articles on State responsibility reads as follows:

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under
article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements
of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under
international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in
the particular instance.“®

Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State responsibility reads as follows:

[...] The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act
of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact
acting on the instructions of, or under the directions or control of, that State
in carrying out the conduct. [...]%"

As explained by the ILC Articles, acts of a State-owned entity will be attributable to the State

under Article 8 “where there [is] evidence that the corporation was exercising public powers or

that the State was using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order
to achieve a particular result.”°*

Moreover, the ILC Articles further explain that the “three terms ‘instructions’, ‘directions’ and
control’ are disjunctive; it is sufficient to establish one of them”.

Investment tribunals have recognized that sovereign instructions, directions or control in

contractual relations with an investor constitute cogent evidence of sovereign interference.°°

The Tribunal analyses below the entering into the Contract and its performance by Lakhra in

order to verify whether the acts of Lakhra in this regard are attributable to Pakistan.

a. The Contract

The Tribunal first notes that Lakhra itself has formally acknowledged in pleadings submitted in

judicial proceedings in Pakistan that it is “owned and controlled by the Government of
Pakistan.”®!

It stems from the evidence on the record that Lakhra did not enter the Contract with Karkey out
of its own free will and self-interest. It was Pakistan, through its organs and agents, which
selected Lakhra to be the Buyer under the Contract. This is evidenced by a letter sent from PPIB
to Lakhra on 6 October 2008:

Please be informed that the Federal Cabinet on 14 May 2008 approved
solicitation for fast-track power generation projects through International
Competitive Bidding, [....]

[...] The Projects will be issued a Letter of Award (the ‘LOA’) by PPIB after
approval of tariff by NEPRA. Subsequently, these rental power projects were
earlier to be further processed by GENCO-I. However, in view of on-going
privatization process of GENCO-I, the Competent Authority has decided that
Lakhra Power Generation Company Ltd. (GENCO-IV) will be the ‘Buyer’
for aforesaid approved projects of Karkey and Walters. [...]°

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 174 of 310

The Tribunal notes that Pakistan, and not Lakhra, solicited the RPPs®? and invited the RPPs to
invest. Moreover, the Solicitation for Fast Track IPP and Rental Power Projects Through

International Competitive Bidding, reads, inter alia, as follows:

2.1. Policy Features/Incentives

© Customs duty at the rate of 5% on the import of plant and equipment
not manufactured locally

e No levy of sales tax on such plant, machinery and equipment as the
same will be used in production of taxable electricity

© Government Guarantees contractual obligations of power purchaser,
provincial/AJK governments

e Provide protection against specified political risk, changes in taxes
and duties regimes

¢ PPIB to provide one window facility for projects above 50 MW.§*4
Pakistan also determined the bulk of Lakhra’s eventual obligations under the Contract (by way
of the Pro Forma RSC attached to the RFP). The RFP which contained the Pro Forma RSC,
provides on page 2 the following:
This Request for Proposal (‘RFP’) was prepared by the Private Power and

Infrastructure Board (‘PPIB’), Ministry of Water and Power, and
Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the ‘GOP’).*

The Tribunal notes that the following provisions were set forth in the Pro Forma RSC, and were

also incorporated in the 2008 RSC and 2009 RSC:

 

[Clause 11 —- BUYER Obligations] BUYER hereby covenants and agrees that
throughout the duration of this Contract.

(a) no direct or indirect expropriation, confiscation, compulsory acquisition,
or seizure of all or any part of the SELLER’s assets, business or operations
shall be done by a Governmental Entity and/or state entity or private person
or entity, any act, action, delay or omission of the Governmental Entity and/
or state entity;

683 c 138, P. 11 (“To cater for the immediate power shortages, the GOP has decided to issue a solicitation for
s ects through ICB as part of its Power Policy”) (emphasis added); C-136: (“[PPIB],

Pakistan’s Power Sector”) (emphasis added)

(b) BUYER shall obtain and maintain all permits and licenses required for
the operation, and maii of the Equip if applicable. BUYER

shall not revoke or terminate any permits required by any governmental or

other type of authority in Pakistan, except in the case of Termination; [...]

(d) grant any and all the necessary permits at BUYER’s cost and expense in
order to import and export any and all equipment and machines necessary
for the project to and from Pakistan; [...]°°°

 

 

577. Moreover, Clause 4.5(c) of the 2009 RSC provided that:

Within thirty days (30) Days from the date of signing of this Contract, the
BUYER [Lakhra] shall ensure that the Government of Pakistan issues and
the BUYER [Lakhra] delivers to the SELLER [Karkey], a duly executed,
irrevocable and unconditional guarantee, guaranteeing the payment of all
Monthly Rental Services Fees by the BUYER [Lakhra] to the SELLER
[Karkey], and the Termination Charges payable in terms of this
Contract..."

578. It stems from the above that Lakhra committed under the Contract, inter alia, that no State organ
would expropriate Karkey’s assets, and pledged to secure the issuance of the Sovereign
Guarantee.®* Such pledges could not legitimately have been made by a purely private sector

entity.
579. The Tribunal also notes the existence of the following disclaimer in the RFP:

[...] The GOP and PPIB expressly disavow any obligation or duty (whether
in contract, tort or otherwise) to any Bidder. No Bidder is entitled to rely on
the GOP’s or PPIB’s involvement in the preparation of this RFP or in the
solicitation process as a basis for preparing the Proposal or developing the
Project.

[J

In submitting a Proposal in response to this RFP, each Bidder certifies that
it understands, accepts and agrees to the disclaimers on this page. Nothing
contained in any other provision of the RFP nor any statements made orally
or in writing by any person or party shall have the effect of negating or

superseding any of the disclaimers set forth on this page.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 176 of 310

As pointed out by the Claimant, investment tribunals have found that a foreign investor is entitled
to rely on a State’s investment solicitation materials, even where those materials contain a

660

disclaimer.°” For example, the National Grid P.L.C. v. Argentina tribunal explained:

It is disingenuous for [Argentina] now to rely on the disclaimers in the
prospectus in order to distance itself from the information given therein. The
prospectus was prepared by respectable bankers on behalf of [Argentina]
and key Argentine government officials participated prominently in the road
show. If information in the prospectus had been incorrect or misleading, the

Tribunal has no doubt that [Argentina] would have had the prospectus

changed accordingly.

Tribunals have also determined that States have a “duty” to ensure that investment prospectuses
do not engender a false expectation by foreign investors, and this is even where the government

expressly disclaimed responsibility for the representations in the prospectus.°

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that Lakhra’s acts related to the conclusion and
execution of the Contract were directed, instructed or controlled by Pakistan, and are accordingly

attributable to Pakistan, irrespective of the disclaimer contained in the RFP.

b. The Performance of the Contract

Karkey submits that in the present case, compliance with the terms of the Contract — including
Lakhra’s obligation to pay the fees and charges that it owed to Karkey under the Contract — was
impeded by governmental acts, including the failure or refusal by Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance
and the State Bank of Pakistan to give timely approval to the relevant payments from Lakhra to
Karkey. Similarly, upon termination of the Contract, Lakhra failed to pay post-termination
charges owed contractually to Karkey because of the direct and explicit instructions from the
Government of Pakistan ordering Lakhra to initiate and prosecute judicial proceedings in the

Sindh High Court to collect funds from Karkey, and to detain Karkey’s vessels. Further, Pakistan

reneged on its obligations under the Sovereign Guarantee that it had issued for Karkey’s benefit

in connection with performance by Lakhra of the Contract.°?

With respect to the specific issue of Lakhra’s failures to comply with contractual payment
obligations, Pakistan contends that “/nJon payment does not involve any exercise of sovereign

authority.” °*

The Tribunal finds that although that could be true in situations in which the same entity does
not make a contractual payment on a commercial contract, the situation here is different, as the
Claimant contends. This is so not only due to the nature of the contract itself (i.e. concession for
a public service) and the existence of the Sovereign Guarantee, but also because the chain of
causation of the non-payment by Lakhra can be traced directly to the Ministry of Finance and the

State Bank of Pakistan.

The funds to pay Karkey under the Contract were released from PEPCO and the Ministry of
Finance. Mr. Dari — the current finance director of Lakhra, and a witness proffered by Pakistan
in this arbitration — described Lakhra’s two-step process for paying Karkey. First, Karkey would
submit an invoice to Lakhra. Second, Lakhra would request that PEPCO release the funds for
payment of the invoice. PEPCO was in turn dependent upon the Ministry of Finance and the
State Bank of Pakistan, which are both State organs, to release funds to satisfy the payments to

Karkey.

For instance, by letter of 19 December 2011 — with letterhead including Lakhra’s address and
PEPCO’s logo — Lakhra wrote to the Pakistan Ministry of Finance, to “inform that in spite of
our repeated requests the approval [for remittances to Karkey] has not yet been accorded by the
State Bank of Pakistan consequently this office is in default.”°°°

By letter of 2 January 2012 — with the same letterhead mentioned above — Lakhra again wrote

to the Pakistan Ministry of Finance:

[...] it is submitted that a meeting was held with [Karkey] [...] wherein they
have given the dead line that if the overdue Invoices of Rental Value are not

paid within 10 days M/s KARKEY will call the Government of Pakistan

This office if vigorously pursuing the matter with State Bank of Pakistan and
other concerned quarters for early remittance of Rental Service Fee.
Whereas, a part payment is laying awaited at Director, SBP, FEOD, Karachi
office for approval since long for the Rental Invoice period 13.08.2011 to
12.09.2011 as per detail given below [...]

It is therefore, requested to kindly take up the matter with Foreign Exchange
Operation Department, State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi_for_according

approval of the above noted amount at the “ earliest possible to avoid any call
on the GOP Sovereign Guarantee. [...].°°

 

Moreover, a letter sent from PPIB to Lakhra on 19 December 2012, evidences instructions by
PPIB to Lakhra for the filing of “/.../ an admiralty suit against M/s Karkey Karadeniz in respect
of the arrest/detaining their vessel.”*** This was confirmed by PPIB’s letter to Lakhra of 3 May
2013, the subject of which was “LAKHRA POWER GENERATION COMPANY, GENCO (IV)
TO FILE AN ADMIRALTY SUIT AGAINST M/S KAREY KARADENIZ IN RESPECT OF THE
ARREST/DETAINING THEIR VESSEL”, in which Lakhra was “directed to institute an admiralty
suit in the honourable Sindh High Court Karachi [...]”.°

The Tribunal also notes that Lakhra did not pay termination charges under the Contract to Karkey
as a result of the direct and explicit instructions from the Government of Pakistan ordering Lakhra
to initiate and prosecute judicial proceedings in the Sindh High Court to collect funds from

Karkey.

On 23 May 2013, just months after Karkey filed its Request for Arbitration, Lakhra instituted an
admiralty suit in the Sindh High Court to recover amounts allegedly owed by Karkey. Pakistan
admits that Lakhra’s institution of the Sindh High Court Proceedings, which was done at the

specific request of the NAB, is attributable to the State.°”°

The Tribunal further notes that in November 2010, MoWP ordered the boards of directors for

each GENCO ~ including Lakhra — to cease operations, further evidencing MoWP’s total control

and direction over Lakhra.’! The NAB, in its submission before the Sindh High Court, also
stated its understanding that Lakhra is under the control of the State: “/T/he Government of
Pakistan (GOP) though Ministry of Water and Power of which Lakhra Power Generating
Company (Lakhra) NAB understands is under its [i.e. MoWP’s] control also has a direct interest

in this suit [...].°°?

Based on the foregoing, even if the Tribunal were to find that Lakhra was an entity independent
of the State, the Tribunal concludes that Lakhra’s actions and decisions with respect to the
Contract (notably the decision to enter into the contract and amendments thereto, decision not to
pay Karkey under the Contract, and the filing of proceedings against Karkey requesting the arrest
of Karkey’s Vessels) were made under the instructions, direction and control of Pakistan, and are

therefore attributable to Pakistan.°”

(2) Are the Acts of PEPCO attributable to Pakistan?

PEPCO is a company that is wholly owned by the Government of Pakistan.

In the context of the RPPs, Pakistan represented from the very beginning that “/PEPCO] has
been mandated by the Government of Pakistan (GoP) for implementation and management of
the Reforms and Restructuring of Pakistan’s Power Sector under the GOP Policy to transform
[the GENCOs, including Lakhra] into commercially operational entities,” and that “PEPCO is
responsible for overall management of the [GENCOs].”°™

At all relevant times in its conduct with Lakhra and Karkey, PEPCO was therefore acting under

its mandate to manage Lakhra and facilitate the RPPs.

Although Pakistan submitted in its Post-Hearing Brief that PEPCO, as well as Lakhra, are

675

separate legal entities with autonomy from the State,°” for the same reasons stated above with

respect to Lakhra, the Tribunal finds that PEPCO was also following Pakistan’s instructions

67 C-472 (CONFIDENTIAL): (“[...] The working of the Board of Directors of GENCOs was ceased vide Ministry
of Water & Power (MoW&P) letter no. Adv/Misc. (BOD)/11/2010 dated 22.11.2010 ...]”).

when dealing with issues related to the Contract and its acts are therefore also attributable to

Pakistan.

Jurisdiction
Illegality in the making of the investment would deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction pursuant to
Article (2) of the Treaty, which requires that Karkey’s investment was established “in

conformity with” Pakistani law.

It is Pakistan’s position that Karkey’s investment was not established in conformity with
Pakistani law as a result of: (a) corruption and corrupt practices; (b) fraud; and (c) breaches of

Pakistani procurement and other laws.°”’ Such argumentation is rejected by Karkey.

Pakistan further alleges that, in the event the Tribunal does not accept Pakistan’s jurisdictional
objection that Karkey’s alleged investment was established in breach of Pakistani law, it must
also consider whether Karkey’s alleged investment meets the jurisdictional requirements of

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article I of the BIT.°*

The Tribunal found under Sections V(A) and V(B) above, that Pakistan has failed to prove
corruption and that the Judgment’s finding that the Karkey’s RPP Contract was void ab initio is
not binding on it. It now passes to the analyses of whether Karkey’s investment was established
by way of (1) fraud, and/or misrepresentation (2) in breach of Pakistani procurement and other
laws. The Tribunal will then analyse (3) whether Karkey’s investment meets the jurisdictional of

requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article I of the BIT.
(1) Was Karkey’s Alleged Investment Established By Way of Fraud or
Misrepresentation in Breach of Article I(2) of the Treaty?

Article I(2) of the Treaty reads as follows:

2. The term ‘investment’, in conformity with the hosting Party’s laws and
regulations, shall include every kind of asset in particular, but not
exclusively:

(a) shares, stocks or any other form of participation in companies,

(b) returns invested, claims to money or any other rights to legitimate
performance having financial value related to an investment,

(c) movable and immovable property, as well as any other rights in rem such
as mortgages, liens, pledges and any other similar rights,

(d) copyrights, industrial and intellectual property rights such as patents,
licenses, industrial designs, technical processes, as well as trademarks,
goodwill know-how and other similar rights,

(e) business concessions conferred by law or by contract including
concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources on
the territory of each Party as defined hereafter.6”

It is Pakistan’s position that Karkey’s investment in Pakistan exists only as a result of its
participation in, and the issue of a letter of award and contract as a result of, a public tender. Any
fraud committed during the tender process and which induced the PPIB to issue Karkey with its
Letter of Award would therefore result in the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction because Karkey’s

investment would not be established “in conformity with” Pakistani law.°°°

In order for a bid to be considered responsive and even potentially qualify for a letter of award,
bidders were required to confirm that they could meet a Target COD of “/80 days from issuance
of Letter of Award” (Milestone A). Any bids indicating a completion period later than the Target

COD would be rejected and the bidder could never become an investor.**!

Knowing this, the Respondent asserts that Karkey represented that it could comply with
Milestone A in Proforma X of its Bid, its Proposed Project Schedule. The Respondent contends
that the evidence shows that Karkey’s representation was knowingly untrue and/or that Karkey

was reckless because it had no reasonable basis for believing in good faith that it could achieve

Milestone A. Pakistan concludes that the Tribunal therefore has no jurisdiction under Article I(2)

of the Treaty.°?

Moreover, Pakistan submits that the relevant standard of proof which the Tribunal should apply
to Pakistan’s claim of fraud is the balance of probabilities (i.e. whether it is “more likely than
not”), and it submits that numerous tribunals have applied this standard specifically to claims of

fraud.

Karkey denies all of Pakistan’s allegations related to the occurrence of fraud and/or
misrepresentation. According to Karkey, in order to succeed on a claim for fraud under
international law, Pakistan must show: (i) an intent by Karkey to conceal; (ii) a material fact; and
(iii) detrimental reliance by Pakistan on the facts presented. Karkey submits that Pakistan cannot

demonstrate any of these elements.

The Tribunal notes that the scope, content and requirements for all bids were set out in the RFP.

Clause 2.2.1 of the RFP defined the Target COD as follows:

The Project(s) are required to be operational within 180 days from issuance

of Letter of Award (the ‘Target COD’)**
In order for Karkey’s Bid to be declared responsive and have an opportunity to receive a letter
of award, Karkey needed to be able to represent its ability to meet this Target COD, as defined
in the RFP. As set out in Clause 6.3.2 of the RFP, “Bids indicating completion period later than

the Target COD, shall not be considered and [shall be] rejected as non-responsive.”°*°

It is worth noting that other documents that were part of the bid package, e.g. the Draft RSC, also

referred to the Target COD being “no later than six months from latest of the date of Letter of
Award, Down Payment, handing over of the Site to SELLER and establishment of the Letter of

Under the 2009 RSC, Karkey was required to achieve the commercial operations date within six
months from the latest of the date of the Letter of Award, Advance Payment (referred to in the
2009 RSC and the “Down Payment”) and execution of the Sovereign Guarantee (defined as the
“Target COD”).°°

. There is no dispute that the letter of credit provided for in the 2008 RSC was never issued and

was changed to a Sovereign Guarantee in the 2009 RSC. The Sovereign Guarantee was executed
by the Managing Director of the PPIB on behalf of the President of Pakistan, for and on behalf
of Pakistan, on 24 April 2009.! Pursuant to an invoice issued by Karkey on 11 May 2009, the
National Bank of Pakistan released the Advance Payment (less the 6% withholding tax’) to
Karkey on Lakhra’s behalf on 12 May 2009.°%

On 8 December 2009, Lakhra and Karkey entered into Amendment No. | to the 2009 RSC, which
extended the deadline for the Target COD to 7 April 2010.9

There is no dispute that Karkey failed to achieve the Target COD of 7 April 2010.

616. The Tribunal finds that when submitting its proposed Project Schedule, Karkey made a

commitment to meet a target or, failing that, to pay the contractual penalties for its delays, subject
always to reciprocal performance by Pakistan of its obligations. Karkey did not represent as a
fact that it would achieve that target irrespective of Pakistan’s actions or of delays beyond
Karkey’s control. Karkey acknowledged that there was an agreed target date for achievement of
commercial operations and agreed to the contractual consequences of failing to meet that target.
Those consequences included (i) the encashment of the performance guarantee, (ii) liquidated

damages, and (iii) a reduction of the contract term.°”°

617. In any case, without the issuing of letter of credit (whether confirmed or unconfirmed) by Lakhra,

618.

619.

620.

the Target COD fixed under the 2008 RSC could not be reached, so that Karkey’s ability to have

the powerships built and in place according to the timetable was not, and could not be, tested.

Moreover, the Parties agreed to amend the 2008 RSC that resulted from the Letter of Award to
Karkey and to extend the Target COD for a date beyond the one Karkey had committed itself to
in its Bid.

The Tribunal accepts that it would probably not have been possible for Karkey to have
operational powerships in place and operational within the time table represented by Karkey
during the bidding process (i.e. that Karkey would meet a Target COD 180 days from issuance
of Letter of Award). However, it is not possible to conclude that there was fraud as there is no
evidence that the Claimant’s statement that it could achieve the Target COD within the time
frame indicated in its Project Schedule was made in bad faith and/or that the Claimant was trying
to mislead Pakistan with respect to its abilities in order to be awarded the Contract. It is
particularly the case since breaches attributable to Pakistan contributed to render impossible to

test Karkey’s ability to reach the contractual target.

For the foregoing reasons, although it seems that Karkey was overly optimistic with respect to
its capabilities to achieve the Target COD, Pakistan has failed to evidence the occurrence of fraud

or misrepresentation.

(2) Was Karkey’s Alleged Investment Established By Way of Misprocurement in Breach
of Article I(2) of the Treaty?

Pakistan submits that Karkey’s contracts were procured in breach of Pakistani procurement laws
(including the PPRA Rules) and international procurement standards. Each and every change to
the Draft RSC resulting in the 2008 RSC and subsequently the 2009 RSC was requested by
Karkey, and shifted the transactional balance substantially in favour of Karkey and/or to
Pakistan’s detriment. This resulted in material breaches of Pakistani procurement laws.°®
According to Pakistan, the issues related to its allegations of misprocurement concern the period
after Karkey was issued with the Letter of Award (on 6 November 2008) and up to the signing
of the 2008 RSC, the 2009 RSC and Amendment No. | in December 2009.”

Karkey rejects the occurrence of any breaches of Pakistani procurement laws and sustains, inter
alia that, in any event the principle of estoppel bars Pakistan from asserting that any alleged
inconsistencies with Pakistani procurement rules in the bidding process deprives the Tribunal of

jurisdiction over Karkey’s claims.°*

The Tribunal has duly considered Pakistan’s allegations regarding the changes to the Draft RSC
that allegedly shifted the balance of the transaction to the detriment of Pakistan in breach of
Pakistani procurement laws, e.g. (i) the increase in the Advance Payment; (ii) the responsibility

for interconnection; (iii) the definition and extensions to Target COD, among others.

However, a host State cannot avoid jurisdiction under the BIT by invoking its own failure to
comply with domestic law. All the contractual modifications that Pakistan alleges were made in

breach of its procurement laws were duly agreed by the contracting parties.
Notably, the Kardassopoulos tribunal stated that:

‘Protection of ii "under a BIT is obviously not without some limits.
It does not extend, for instance, to an investor making an investment in

breach of the local laws of the host State. A State thus retains a degree of

control over foreign il by denying BIT protection _to those

investments that do not comply with its laws. As noted by one scholar, ‘no
State has taken its fervour for foreign investment to the extent of removing
any controls on the flow of foreign investment into the host State’. This

control, however, relates to the investor’s actions in making the investment.
It does not allow a State to preclude an investor from seeking protection
under the BIT on the ground that its own actions are illegal under its own
laws. In other words, a host State cannot avoid jurisdiction under the BIT by
invoking its own failure to comply with its de ic law.

was procured in compliance with Pakistani procurement laws. Pakistan’s own witness, Mr. Khan,
admitted at the Hearing that Pakistan is defending the Contract before the highest court of

Pakistan, while at the same time attacking it in this arbitration.”

Moreover, throughout the RPP bid process Pakistan represented to Karkey that the procurement
was being conducted, and would continue to be conducted, in accordance with law, principles of
transparency, and international bidding standards.”°' Pakistan also represented in the 2009 RSC
itself that the terms thereof were legally binding and valid.” For instance, Clause 31 of the 2009
RSC reads as follows:

31. Authority and execution:
Each PARTY hereby represents the following: (i) the execution, delivery,
and performance of this Contract by such PARTY and the consummation of
all transactions contemplated therein have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate and governmental action; (ii) this Contract will
il valid and legally binding obligati of the PARTY, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms; and (iii) the execution, delivery and
performance by each PARTY of this Contract, and any other Contracts

provided for herein, and consummation of the transactions contemplated

hereby and thereby, do not as of the Effective Date and shall not at any time

during the Term (a) violate the provisions of any law, rule or regulation
licable to either PARTY, (b) violate any jud: decree, order or

award of any court, or of any governmental, judicial or regulatory authority
binding upon either PARTY, or (c) conflict with, breach, or violate the terms
of any other agreement or instrument by which either PARTY or its property
is bound. (Emphasis added)

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Pakistan has consistently maintained that
Karkey’s investment was established in accordance with Pakistani laws, and it is now estopped

from arguing that the investment must be deemed invalid on the basis of a breach of those laws.

invoking its own failure to comply with domestic law.

(3) Does Karkey’s Alleged Investment Meet the Jurisdictional Requirements of Article
25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article I of the BIT?

Pakistan does not disagree that the Tribunal should assess Karkey’s operations in Pakistan
“globally” or “as a whole”, nor does Pakistan disagree that the meaning of “investment” under
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is potentially broad. However, according to Pakistan,
Karkey’s attempt to present a tangled web of activities as a single investment is unhelpful,
particularly in the context of the BIT’s expropriation clause, which applies only to the
“expropriation of ‘investments’, and not to each and every resource utilised in connection with
an alleged investment, but which is not itself an investment’.” By way of example, Pakistan
asserts that if Pakistan is correct that the 2009 RSC cannot form the subject matter of an
investment because it has been declared void ab initio, this has a knock-on effect on what Karkey
is able to claim has been expropriated. Pakistan contends that it is therefore necessary to analyse
each aspect of Karkey’s investment individually (i.e. the Contract, the Vessels, bank accounts,
shareholding in Karpak).’"

In any event, Pakistan sustains that Karkey’s activities, even when considered as a whole, are
akin to a sale of goods transaction and are not covered by the ICSID Convention.”°> This
argument is rejected by Karkey, according to which the Project as a whole is an investment and

does satisfy the requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.”
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:

(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that
State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the
dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have
given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 188 of 310

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires the existence of a legal dispute arising directly
out of an “investment.” The drafters of the ICSID Convention did not define “investment,” and
instead purposely left the term to be defined by agreement of Contracting States when consenting

to arbitration under the ICSID Convention — in this case, when entering into the BIT.

The Tribunal finds it appropriate to take into account the four elements set forth by the tribunal
in the Salini v. Morocco case in order to identify an investment protected by the ICSID

Convention:

The doctrine generally considers that investment infers: contributions, a
certain duration of performance of the contract and a participation in the
risks of the transaction. [...] In reading the Convention's preamble, one may
add the contribution to the economic development of the host State of the
investment as an additional condition.”

The Tribunal takes note of Pakistan’s allegation that Karkey’s alleged investment is akin to a
sale of goods transaction and is not covered by the ICSID Convention. It also notes Pakistan’s
allegations, inter alia, that Karkey is a Turkish company which does not manufacture its assets
in Pakistan, that those assets maintain a foreign registration and were only intended to spend a

small fraction of their working lives in Pakistan.”

The Tribunal finds that Pakistan’s characterization of Karkey’s investment is artificial and
consequently unfounded. Investment tribunals have identified an “investment” even where no
permanent infrastructure remained in the host State at the conclusion of the relevant contract or
investment. For instance, the SGS v. Philippines tribunal determined that the provision of pre-

shipment inspection services (i.e. no permanent infrastructure) was sufficient to constitute an

 

“investment”, even where considerable aspects of the service were conducted outside of the host

State.”

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 189 of 310

The Tribunal is satisfied that Karkey made an investment in Pakistan within the meaning of
Article 25(1) as: (i) it contributed significant capital;”!° (ii) the Contract had a substantial duration
of 5 years; (iii) Karkey took a reasonable risk on the transaction;7!!and (iv) it contributed to the

economic development of Pakistan by providing electricity.”!?

Moreover, Article I(2) of the BIT provides as follows:

For the purpose of this Agreement: [...]

2. The term ‘investment’, in conformity with the hosting Party’s laws and
regulations, shall include every kind of asset in particular, but not
exclusively:

(a) shares, stocks or any other form of participation in companies,

(b) returns reinvested, claims to money or any other rights to legitimate
performance having financial value related to an investment,

(c) movable or immovable property, as well as any other rights in rem such
as mortgages, liens, pledges and any other similar rights,

(d) copyrights, industrial and intellectual property rights such as patents,
licenses, industrial designs, technical processes, as well as trademarks,
goodwill know-how and other similar rights,

(e) business ic conferred _by law _or_by contract ludii
concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources on
the territory of each Party as defined hereafter. (Emphasis added)

The Tribunal notes that the Contract is a “business concession [...] conferred by law or by
contract”, and, as an investment, is therefore protected under the BIT. The same applies to the
Vessels, which were necessary to the performance of the Contract by Karkey and qualify as

“movable or immovable property” under Article I(2)(d) of the Treaty.

70 The commitments and contributions specifically include Karkey’s Powerships, KPS Tower-I, dredging
operations, personnel, know-how, and generation capacity. As pointed by Claimant at § 300 of its Memorial: “Among
other contributions, Karkey expended substantial funds to construct, prepare, and transport its Powerships to
Pakistan, to erect permanent transmission infrastructure near Karachi, to undertake capital dredging works in
Pakistan, to conduct a navigation study for opening the Clifton-z Channel to marine traffic, and to finance from its
own funds fuel purchases for generation of electricity [...]. Karkey directly and indirectly employed a large number
of Pakistani residents

 

 

  

71! This is amply evidenced, for instance, by the fact that Karkey’s ships were seized by Pakistan.

72 Pakistan’s power crisis was severe, and there is no question that Karkey’s Project helped address such crisis,
thereby contributing to Pakistan’s economic development. See CA-291, Kardassopoulos, Decision on Jurisdiction,
117 (“Furthermore, there is no question that Claimant’s investment was intended to contribute to Georgia's
economic development”).

So

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 190 of 310

As for the argument that Karkey’s activities in Pakistan do not meet the conditions established
in Article I(2) of the BIT to be considered as a protected investment, because the contract by
which Karkey materialized its investment was allegedly obtained by corruption, the Tribunal has
already ruled under Sections V(A) and V(D) above that it has not been proved that Karkey’s

investment was tainted by corruption or obtained in violation of Pakistani law.

(0. In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims

related to the Project, which are addressed below.

Did Pakistan Expropriate Karkey’s Investment in Breach of Article III of the Treaty?

   

According to Karkey, in the Judgment, the Supreme Court purported to invalidate the Contract
and ordered it to be rescinded, following which various organs of the State (including, for
example, the Sindh High Court, NAB, and Lakhra) treated the Contract as if it were invalid.’5
In this way, Pakistan — acting via its judicial, executive, and administrative branches — deprived
Karkey of its post-termination rights under the Contract, including its rights to payment for
outstanding invoices, termination charges, and demobilization charges, totalling more than
US$237 million, excluding interest. This deprivation constitutes an expropriation of Karkey’s

contractual rights, in violation of Article III of the BIT.”!4
2. Pakistan submits that there are two key threshold issues in relation to Karkey’s expropriation
claim:7!5

- First, Karkey is unable to show any substantial deprivation of its whole investment in
circumstances where its single most valuable asset — that is the Kaya Bey — has been

released and is now earning revenue elsewhere;

- Second, the 2009 RSC has been declared void ab initio by the highest court of Pakistan

and therefore does not give rise to rights capable of being expropriated.

Pakistan contends that Lakhra’s treatment of the 2009 RSC as being void ab initio, the decision

not to pay out under the Sovereign Guarantee, the NAB’s detention of the Vessels, Lakhra’s

initiation of the Sindh High Court proceedings, the Sindh High Court’s arrest of the Vessels and
freeze on Karkey’s bank accounts all follow from the Supreme Court’s finding that the 2009
RSC was void ab initio.”'* In order to succeed in its expropriation claims, Karkey must show that

the Judgment itself violated international law.’!7

Article III(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:

In shall not be expropriated, lized or subject, directly, or
indirectly to measures of similar effects except for_a public purpose, in a
non-discriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and
effective compensation, and in accordance with due process of law and the
general principles of treatment provided for in Article II of this
Agreement.”'®

 

As decided by the Arbitral Tribunal under Section V(B) above, the Supreme Court Judgment
which declared the Contract to be void ab initio was arbitrary, and therefore has no effect in
international law, and the Tribunal is not bound by its finding that the Contract was void. For the
Tribunal, it is nothing more than a fact, attributable to Pakistan as admitted by the Respondent,’!°
which started a process leading to the deprivation of Karkey’s contractual rights, the arrest of its

Vessels and the seizure of its bank accounts.

The Tribunal notes that Pakistan agrees that contract rights, vessels, and bank accounts are
property rights capable of expropriation.””° However, in order validly to be the subject matter of
an expropriation claim, the rights in question must exist and be enforceable by law. As Pakistan
pointed out, and noted by the tribunal in Emmis v. Hungary, an investor “must have held a
property right of which they have been deprived. This follows from the ordinary meaning of the

72
term.”

. As it also follows from the Tribunal’s decision under Sections V(A) and V(D) above, there is no

evidence on the record that Karkey’s Contract was tainted by corruption, fraud,

misrepresentation, or misprocurement. Thus, there is no basis for denying that Karkey’s rights

derived from this contract or relating to its performance were not enforceable by law.

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Pakistan has expropriated Karkey’s investment
through the Judgment which declared the Contract to be void ab initio. This is because through
its Supreme Court, whose acts Pakistan accepts are attributable to it,” Pakistan deprived Karkey
of the use and enjoyment of its contractual rights, including Karkey’s right to terminate the

Contract and, as stated below, interfered with the free transfer of Karkey’s investment.

The assets identified by Karkey, namely the use and enjoyment of its contractual rights, as well
as the Vessels related to its investment were therefore subject to an interference of the host State
(through the Judgment which declared the Contract void ab initio and subsequent detention of
the Vessels) amounting to expropriation, as it had the effect of depriving Karkey of its investment
as a whole. Such deprivation cannot be considered as a legitimate regulatory taking as it stems

from the arbitrary 30 March 2012 Judgment.

The fact that one of Karkey’s vessels, the Kaya Bey, was eventually released on 1 August 2014
pursuant to the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures of 16 October 2013 amended by
Procedural Order No. 4, does not affect this conclusion. The arrest of the Kaya Bey was part of
the measures of expropriation by Pakistan and its eventual release has to be considered when
assessing the damages resulting of the expropriation and not in order to assess the extent of the

expropriation when it took place.

Did Pakistan Breach Article IV of the Treaty (Free Transfer)?

Karkey submits that Pakistan continues to detain three of Karkey’s Vessels, having released the
fourth (i.e. the Kaya Bey) only after Karkey fought for and obtained an order from this Tribunal
mandating its release and an appellate court in Pakistan reversed the Sindh High Court and
ordered Pakistan to comply with the Tribunal’s order. According to Karkey, Pakistan’s past and
ongoing detention of Karkey’s Vessels have violated its obligations under Article IV of the

Treaty to permit Karkey the free transfer of its investment.”>

Pakistan contends that Article IV of the Treaty relates exclusively to the free transfer of funds,

5 724

and therefore does not extend to physical assets,’** which is rejected by Karkey.

Article IV(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:

Each Party shall permit in good faith all transfers related to an investment
to_be made freely and without _unr delay into and out of its

territory. Such transfers include:

(a) returns,

hhh

(b) proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment,
(c) compensation pursuant to Article II,

(d) reimbursements and interest payments deriving from loans in connection
with investments,

(e) salaries, wages and other remunerations received by the nationals of one
Party who have obtained in the territory of the other Party the
corresponding work permits relative to an investment,

(f) payments arising from an investment dispute. (Emphasis added)

Article IV(1) of the Treaty cited above requires that each Party to the treaty are to “permit in
good faith all transfers related to an investment to be made freely and without unreasonable
delay into and out of its territory” (emphasis added) The definition of “investment” under Article
I(2) of the Treaty includes “movable and immovable property”.’> Moreover, the provision only

lists examples of transfers in a non-exhaustive way (“/...]. Such transfers [...] include: [...]””).

In view of the above, and considering that Lakhra’s initiation of the Sindh High Court
proceedings, the Sindh High Court’s arrest of the Vessels and freeze on Karkey’s bank accounts
all follow from the Supreme Court’s finding that the 2009 RSC was void ab initio — which is
acknowledged by Pakistan’ — the Tribunal finds that Pakistan has also breached its obligation
under Article IV(1) of the Treaty by depriving Karkey of the free disposal of its assets (i.e.
Vessels) part of Karkey’s investment under the Contract, including by violating Karkey’s right

to transfer assets related to its investment “without unreasonable delay.”

Moreover, even accepting for the sake of discussion the literal interpretation that Pakistan wants
to give to Article IV(1) of the Treaty, it is not disputable that by detaining the Kaya Bey, Pakistan

made its sale impossible and thus did not allow the transfer of any proceeds resulting thereof.

 

 

The Claimant’s Additional ims

In view of the Tribunal’s decisions regarding expropriation and breach of Pakistan’s free transfer
obligations under the Treaty/BIT, the Tribunal finds that it is not necessary to address Karkey’s
additional claims based on the MEN, FET and umbrella clauses, as the damages resulting from
these alleged breaches and from the expropriation/free transfer violation would be the same. It is
the case since the acts attributable to Pakistan constituting these others breaches alleged by
Karkey, are the same as those leading to the expropriation which, as stressed bellow, entitles
Karkey to damages that will erase the consequences of Pakistan’s wrongful acts and re-establish

the situation that would have existed but for such wrongful acts.

Damages
(1) Legal Standard

a. Standard for Compensation

Karkey submits that Pakistan has totally deprived it not only of the payment of outstanding
invoices Karkey was owed under the Contract, but also all of its post-termination rights and the
use and enjoyment of its revenue-generating assets (i.e. the Vessels). Karkey alleges that, as the
expropriation of Karkey’s investment was unlawful, and as the BIT does not articulate a standard
for compensation for violations of the BIT, the Tribunal should apply the Chorzow Factory
standard of reparation to compensate Karkey in order to place Karkey in the position it would

have been in but for Pakistan’s BIT violations.”7

According to Pakistan, as the BIT only stipulates the standard for compensation payable in case

of a lawful expropriation,”*

the Tribunal is required to apply the default standard in customary
international law for any breaches of the BIT, such as unlawful expropriation. Pakistan agrees

with Karkey that the customary international law standard for the assessment of damages is

727 Karkey’s Memorial, 608.

78 Article III(2) of the Treaty provides as follows: “Compensation [for expropriation] shall be equivalent to the real
value of the expropriated investment before the expropriatory action was taken or became known. Compensation
shall be paid without delay and be freely transferable as described in paragraph 2 Article IV.”

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 195 of 310

described by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Chorzow Factory case. The court
in that case established the principal standard of reparation in case of breach of an international
obligation as follows:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act — a

principle which seems to be established by international practice and in
particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as

 

 

far_as possible, wipe out all the of the illegal act and re-
blish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that
act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or,if this is not possible,

 

payment of a sum cori to the value which a itution in kind
would bear; the award, if need be,of damages for loss sustained which
would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it — such
are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of
compensation due for an act contrary to international law.”

 

Moreover, Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles of State Responsibility provides that “/7/he
responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the

internationally wrongful act.”7*°

As pointed out by the Claimant, Articles 35 and 36 of the ILC Articles provide that reparation
has two components. The first is an obligation to provide “restitution”, which requires the State
“to re-establish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed [...] to the
extent that restitution is not materially impossible.”"*! Second, “in so far that such damage is not
done good by restitution,” the ILC Articles recognize the State’s obligation to provide the

investor compensation for the damage caused by the State’s international wrongful act.”

The compensation owed for an internationally unlawful expropriation is not calculated in the

same way as for a lawful expropriation. As explained by the tribunal in the Siemens case:

They key difference between compensation [for a wrongful taking] under the
[ILC] Articles and the Factory at Chorzow case formula, and Article 4(2) of
the Treaty [for a lawful expropriation] is that under the former,
compensation must take into account ‘all financially assessable damage’ or
‘wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act’ as opposed to compensation
‘equivalent to the value of the expropriated investment’ under the Treaty.”>

In view of the above, Karkey is entitled to an award of damages that will erase the consequences
of Pakistan’s wrongful acts and re-establish the situation that would have existed but for such

wrongful acts.

As a consequence, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant must be compensated for the damages
and lost profits which Karkey would have earned had Pakistan not breached Articles II] and IV
of the BIT, namely resulting from the expropriation of its contract rights and detention of the

Vessels.

b. Standard of proof

As pointed out in Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine
Republic, “[...] it is well settled that the fact that damages cannot be fixed with certainty is no
reason not to award damages when a loss has been incurred. In such cases, approximations are
inevitable; the settling of d is not an exact science.” ™* The same Tribunal stresses the

“tendency and appropriateness of international tribunals to approximate damages.”"*°

Likewise, the Committee in Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan decided that the estimation of
damages is not an exact science and that it is of the essence of such an exercise that the tribunal
has a measure of discretion, since the final figure must of its nature be an approximation of the

claimant's loss.”*°

Consequently, the Tribunal will not require that that future revenues, expenses or profits be

proved with absolute certainty.”°” A sufficient degree of certainty or probability is enough and

c. Should the Tribunal use an Ex post or Ex Ante Valuation date?

According to Karkey, there are two aspects of Karkey’s damages claim with respect to which the
Tribunal should adopt an ex post approach: (1) the valuation date; and (2) the various inputs
required for modelling Karkey’s loss. The consequence of an ex post valuation date of 30 June
2015 (as_a proxy for present day) is that Karkey’s historical losses are not discounted prior to
that date; and the consequence of using ex post information for the inputs into the DCF models
used to calculate Karkey’s damages is that such inputs are rendered more accurate.’*°

On the other hand, the Respondent submits that the correct date of valuation for a non-
expropriatory breach or even for a lawful or unlawful expropriation is the date immediately
preceding the relevant measure or the date immediately before the relevant measure became
public knowledge. Since the date of valuation is the same for expropriation as well as non-
expropriatory breaches, Karkey’s decision to abandon its argument that the Kaya Bey has been
expropriated does not require the use of a different valuation date. The vast majority of
investment treaty tribunals have adopted the date immediately preceding the expropriatory
breach as the date of valuation. In the present case, Pakistan contends that the date of valuation
should be the date of the alleged expropriation, i.e. 30 March 2012. The vast majority of
investment treaty tribunals have also only relied on information available on that date (ex ante),

as opposed to using information subsequent to the alleged taking (ex post).°

The Tribunal is of the view that it does not need to enter into a theoretical debate as to the
appropriateness of an ex ante or ex post valuation. Each approach may be acceptable provided it
leads to full compensation of the damaged party. In this case, Mr. Kaczmarek (Karkey’s expert)
has opted for an ex post valuation and Mr. Haberman (Pakistan’s expert) has preferred to rely on
an ex ante valuation. Unfortunately, as it will be shown below, Mr. Kaczmarek’s opinion is too
often speculative and too often based on insufficient evidence to be retained as a basis for the

Tribunal’s own independent valuation. Consequently, the Tribunal has decided to assess the

8p this respect see RA-136, Mobil Investments Canada Inc. and Murphy Oil Corporation v. Government of
Canada, (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4), Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012, {f]

damages due to Karkey taking as a basis for its analysis Mr. Haberman’s valuation, not because
it is an ex ante valuation of the fair market value/lost cash flows of the expropriated rights at the
date of the expropriation, i.e. 30 March 2012, but because the Tribunal found it more reliable.
Obviously, Mr. Haberman’s valuation is just a starting point and as explained below, the Tribunal
reached its conclusion independently, after taking into consideration all the evidence on the

record and, more particularly, Mr. Kaczmarek’s expert evidence.

d. The methodology to calculate Karkey’s loss
The date of Pakistan’s expropriation of Karkey’s investment is 30 March 2012, namely the date
of the Judgment which declared the Contract void ab initio. It is also the date of Karkey’s Notice
of Termination of the Contract. As submitted by Karkey, Karkey’s investments are to be viewed
as a whole since the Judgment and Pakistan’s actions that followed have deprived Karkey of the

use and enjoyment of its investment as a whole.

As put by Mr. Haberman (Respondent’s expert), the starting point for quantifying Karkey’s loss

is to compare two scenarios, the difference between them representing the measure of loss:”4!

- First, what would have happened had the event which is being complained about not

occurred (the “Hypothetical Scenario”); and

- Secondly, what has actually happened to date and what is expected to happen in the future

(the “Actual Scenario”).

As explained below, the Tribunal finds that by declaring the Contract to be void ab initio the
Supreme Court (and therefore Pakistan) de facto terminated the Contract through its Judgment
dated 30 March 2012. However, had the Supreme Court not declared the Contract to be void ab
initio, Karkey would in any event have terminated the Contract through its Notice of Termination
dated 30 March 2012, and its Vessels would have been able to generate cash flows under new

contracts after such termination had they not been detained in Pakistan.

Therefore, Karkey is to be compensated for the expropriation of its contract rights (including its
right to terminate the Contract) and for the cash flows it was prevented from earning under new

contracts as a consequence of the detention of its Vessels in Pakistan following the Judgment.

Based on the above the Tribunal now proceeds to analyse Karkey’s damages.

(2) Karkey’s Request for Post-Termination Contractual Rights: (a) Termination
Charges; (b) Unpaid invoices; and (c) Mobilization and Transport Charges
Karkey submits that it has initiated this ICSID arbitration seeking to be put back in the position
in which it would have been were it not for the Supreme Court Judgment and subsequent
unlawful conduct by Pakistan (i.e. Karkey’s position on 30 March 2012, or the But For date).
Karkey does not seek to be put back in the position prior to Lakhra’s pre-termination breaches,
because Karkey already had elected and pursued a contractual termination remedy for those
earlier breaches. Nevertheless, Karkey also seeks (out of abundance of caution and without
prejudice to its primary claims) to preserve pre-termination contractual breach claims by also
pleading those claims as BIT violations — the legitimacy of which it asserts. However, Karkey is
not independently seeking damages for those earlier violations. Rather, Karkey seeks to be
compensated for such earlier violations by virtue of its termination rights, which entitle it to

recover amounts due for unpaid past invoices in addition to specified termination charges.”

It is Pakistan’s position that Karkey’s claims in respect of any rights under the 2009 RSC are not
within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Even if the Tribunal were to find that the Supreme Court
procedure and/or Judgment amount to a denial of justice, Karkey would have rights under the
2009 RSC which are capable of being enforced in the proper contractual forum (LCIA
Arbitration). There is no reason why a LCIA tribunal seated in London would not have
jurisdiction.”* If the Tribunal disagrees, then it must determine Karkey’s claims for damages
relating to Karkey’s post-termination Contract Rights.”

Before analysing Karkey’s claims, the Tribunal first notes that Pakistan’s allegation regarding
the LCIA clause contained in the Contract is inapposite to the present case and does not prevent
the Tribunal from deciding Karkey’s claims related to the expropriation of Karkey’s contract
rights. Indeed, the Tribunal is not requested to deal with contract claims and to condemn Pakistan
or even less Lakhra to pay damages for a breach of contractual obligations, but to assess the value

of contract rights that have allegedly been expropriated. It is therefore important to identify the

rights duly held by the Claimant under the Contract at the moment when the expropriation

occurred.

The Tribunal analyses below in turn Karkey’s claim for (a) termination charges, (b) the alleged
unpaid invoices (including the monthly rental services fees invoices and fuel payment invoices);
and (c) mobilization and transport charges related to the return of its investment assets from

Pakistan.
a. Termination Charges

Karkey claims US$165,243,287 million for Termination Charges.”5

According to Karkey, pursuant to the Contract, “/ij/n the event the Contract is terminated by
SELLER before the Contract _desi; expiry date, due to BUYER default, the BUYER

[Lakhra]_shall_pay_all Monthly Rental Services Fee to date, mobilization and_transport

 

charges.””*° The Contract also provided that “the BUYER [Lakhra] shall pay Termination
Charges [...]”.”"" Karkey performed its obligations under the Contract but then was forced to
terminate the Contract following uncured material breaches of the Contract by Lakhra. Because
Karkey terminated the Contract “due to BUYER’s [Lakhra] default’, Lakhra — and therefore

Pakistan — owe Karkey unpaid contractual fees and termination charges.”**

Pakistan counters that, even if the Supreme Court did breach the BIT, it would not follow that
Karkey is entitled to any Contract damages. It is necessary to determine precisely the position
Karkey would have been in, but for the Supreme Court’s declaration that the 2009 RSC was void.

Pakistan submits that this position is simple, but for the Supreme Court’s Judgment, Karkey

 

would — on its own case — have terminated the 2009 RSC for Lakhra’s alleged commercial
breaches in relation to payment of fuel and monthly rental services invoices and a commercial
dispute would then have arisen, which Karkey would have been required to pursue through LCIA
arbitration in accordance with Clause 28 of the 2009 RSC.”° In any event, Karkey would be

entitled to no damages in respect of the Termination Charge which is unenforceable as a matter

of Pakistani law.*° Also, Karkey would not be entitled to the Termination Charge and other
charges because, in any event, absent the Measures (as pleaded by Karkey, which includes lack
of payment under the Contract by Lakhra), Karkey would never have terminated the contract
with Lakhra.”*! Moreover, Pakistan sustains that if Karkey is entitled to recover the Termination
Charge (which covers the period of up to April 2014), then Karkey is not entitled to recover any

alleged lost profits for the same period (otherwise Karkey would be double counting).’>

First, as stated above, Pakistan’s allegation regarding the LCIA clause contained in the Contract
is inapposite to the present case and does not prevent the Tribunal from deciding Karkey’s claims

related to the expropriation of its contract rights.

Second, the Tribunal finds that by declaring the Contract to be void ab initio through its Judgment
dated 30 March 2012 the Supreme Court (and therefore Pakistan) expropriated the Claimant’s
rights under the Contract and de facto terminated the Contract. Had the Supreme Court not
declared the Contract to be void ab initio, Karkey would in any event have terminated the
Contract through its Notice of Termination dated 30 March 2012 due to Lakhra’s default and be

entitled to termination charges. It was deprived of that right by the expropriation.

Indeed, on 30 March 2012, Karkey served Lakhra a “Notice of Termination effective

immediately” regarding the 2009 RSC. In such Notice, Karkey terminated the Contract pursuant
to Clause 4.6(b) and requested payment of the following amounts:7*

- US$161.856.018 as termination charges pursuant to Clause 4.6(d);”**

- US$12.000.000 as mobilization and transport charges to return the Equipment to
SELLER’s designated depot as per Clause 4.6(b); and of

Kaczmarek, Second Expert Report, J 217, table 20).

686. As the Judgment expropriated Karkey’s rights under the Contract, including Karkey’s right to

terminate it, in order to assess the value of the contract rights which were expropriated, the

Tribunal will analyse the contractual provisions related to the termination of the Contract.

687. Clause 4.6, entitled “Contract Termination”, provides as follows:”°°

[4.6(a)] In_the event the Contract is terminated by the BUYER [Lakhra
before the Contract designated expiry date, due to the BUYER’s
convenience, the BUYER shall pay all Monthly Rental Services Fee to date,
mobilization and transport charges to return the Equipment to SELLER’s
designated depot and also will be responsible for the exportation of the
Equipment from Pakistan, for which time shall be of the essence.

itionally the BUYER shall pay Termination Charges as detailed in
Clause-d_of this Section. In the event of BUYER’s termination for
convenience, sixty (60) days written notice period is required, provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
contract, the BUYER shall not exercise such termination right until expiry
of one (1) year from the Commercial Operations Date.

convenience (Clause 4.6(a)) or by Karkey due to Lakhra’s default (Clause 4.6.b), Karkey would
be entitled, inter alia, to Termination Charges which are to be calculated pursuant to Clause

4.6(d) cited above.

The Tribunal notes that there are two issues to be decided in relation to the Claimant’s claim for
Termination Charges, namely (a.1) their enforceability under Pakistani law and (a.2) the

calculation of the proper amount under Clause 4.6(d), which are analysed below in turn.

(a.1) Are the Termination Charges enforceable under Pakistani law?

According to Pakistan, the Termination Charge is a penalty and cannot be considered a genuine
pre-estimate of loss, and accordingly is unenforceable under Pakistani law. Pakistan argues that
Clause 4.6(d) of the Contract clearly compensates Karkey for revenue it would have earned under
the Contract, not profit. The difference is significant — for the period up to April 2014, Karkey’s
profit under the Contract would have been approximately US$92.3 million. Yet, it claims
US$161 million, almost twice what it would have received by way of profit. It is no surprise that
Karkey elected to serve notice of termination of the Contract on the very same day as the

Judgment.” These allegations are rejected by Karkey.

691. The Tribunal notes that, as pointed out by the Claimant, Section 74 of the Pakistani Contract Act

692.

a

does permit the establishment of contractual penalties:

When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the
amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains any

other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of breach is
entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused
thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable

compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may be,
the penalty stipulated for.”*"

As noted by Justice Karim (Respondent’s Expert on Pakistani law), the only limit on contractual

penalties is whether the penalty is reasonable,’°* and “it is for the court to determine whether the

J > 759

/ amount qualifies as ‘r bl ion’ in the cir

Mr. Zafar (the Claimant’s expert on Pakistani law) further explained that liquidated damages

provisions are enforceable under Pakistani law under the following condition:”

Under Pakistani law, if the parties to a contract have agreed to an amount
in the contract clearly specifving that the breaching party shall be liable to
compensate other, the courts in Pakistan enforce such contractual
obligations where the amount specified does in fact represent a pre-agreed
and_genuine_pre-estimate of loss or damage to be ioned as a
consequence of breach.”*!

The Parties’ respective Experts on Pakistani law are agreed on this test, which mirrors the same

test under English law.”°?

In view of the above considerations, the Tribunal finds that the Termination Charge provision
set forth under Clause 4.6(d) the Contract is in accordance with Pakistani law, because such
provision sets forth a precise and rational method for calculation of a genuine pre-estimate of the
loss in case of termination of the Contract, which the Tribunal finds reasonable. This is because
the formula for calculating the amount of the loss is linked directly to the expected payments

under the Contract and therefore results in an amount that is foreseeable. The provision also gives

credit to Pakistan for the Down Payment received by Karkey. Moreover, the amount to be paid
upon termination declines over time in recognition of the fact that the further into Contract

performance the breach occurs, the more upfront costs Karkey will have had a chance to recoup.

A Termination Charge of US$165,200,000 (as calculated by Karkey) or of US$149,802,431 (as
calculated by Pakistan) to protect Karkey’s expectation that it would earn almost
US$565,000,000 during the course of the Contract cannot be prima facie considered

unreasonable.

It is worth noting that Clause 4.6 was drafted and inserted into the Contract by Pakistan itself. It
originated in the initial Pro-Forma Contract attached to the RFP,” and was neither negotiated
nor ever modified by Karkey. This is a clear indication that Pakistan also considered the

Termination Charges to be reasonable.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that Pakistan has failed to demonstrate that Clause

4.6(d) operates as an improper penalty under Pakistani law and is therefore valid.

(a.2) The amount of the Termination Charges under the Contract

Pakistan submits that if the Tribunal concludes that the Termination Charge is enforceable as a
matter of Pakistani law, this is in any event not recoverable in the amount claimed by Karkey.7*
It is Pakistan’s position that Clause 4.6(d) provides that on termination of the Contract the full
unadjusted amount of the Advance Payment (i.e. US$80 million) should be deducted from the

Termination Charges.”

Karkey, on the other hand, claims that it is not appropriate to deduct the entirety of the original
Advance Payment from the Termination Charges, because approximately US$16 million of that
payment already had been returned to Lakhra by Karkey through monthly invoice credits as of
the date of termination.” If adopted, Mr. Haberman’s interpretation of the Contract whereby the

down payment would remain fixed, and thus deducted from any Termination Charges, would

produce a negative Termination Charge in years four and five of the Contract —a result that could

not have been intended by the Parties if that clause is to be given any meaning.”7
The Parties’ experts’ calculation of the Termination Charges can be summarized as follows:

Experts’ calculations of Termination Charges

Calculation Mr. Mr.
element (US$) Haberman” — Kaczmarek’®
Amount relating to the first three years 338,784,026 338,784,026

Termination charges 149,802,431 165,243,287

The only difference between the experts’ calculation of the Termination Charges relates to the
way they have calculated the “unadjusted Down Payment”. Clause 4.6(d) of the Contract defines
the Termination Charges arising for termination during the first 12 rental months as being “100%
of the first three years balance Lump Sum Contract Price less the unadjusted Down Payment.”
(Emphasis added)

The Tribunal finds that based on Clause 4.6(d) the full “unadjusted Down Payment” of US$80
million should therefore be deducted from the balance of the contract price to calculate the
Termination Charges. The Claimant’s expert, Mr. Kaczmarek wrongly deducts only US$64.6
million, having excluded from his calculation amounts of the Down Payment that had been offset
against the Monthly Rental Services Fees in the first 12 months. The Tribunal finds that the word
“unadjusted” in Clause 4.6(d) is very clear and cannot mean “adjusted” by any type of

deductions.

In view of the above, the amount of the Termination Charges due by Pakistan to Karkey is

US$149,802,431.

b. Unpaid Invoices
There are two categories of alleged unpaid invoices claimed by Karkey, namely (i) Monthly

Rental Services Fees and (ii) Fuel invoices, which the Tribunal analyses below in turn.

(b.1) Outstanding Monthly Rental Services Fees

According to Karkey, it is owed US$57,438,8027” in unpaid invoices under the Contract (i.e.
US$47.702,505_in ding Monthly Services Fees, and US$9,736,297 in unpaid fuel
invoices). A large portion of the difference between the experts (i.e. US$18,000,000) is
attributable to Mr. Haberman’s exclusion of amounts owing to Karpak. For the reasons
summarized below, Karkey maintains that this deduction is unwarranted as a matter of law.”7!
Karkey also alleges that there is no basis for reducing the term of the Contract, for deducting
liquidated damages, or for deducting withholding tax from such amount, as claimed by

Pakistan.”

Pakistan submits that it is undisputed that Lakhra failed to pay the final six Monthly Rental
Services Fees (i.e. from October 2011 to March 2012). However, there is a dispute as to whether
the final six invoices, as well as the earlier invoices in respect of which some payment was made
by Lakhra (i.e. from April 2011 to September 2011), are properly owing to Karkey “in full”.””
According to Pakistan, there are four main issues between the Parties in this regard, namely (1)
whether Karkey is entitled to recover amounts invoiced by Karpak; (2) whether Lakhra was
entitled to liquidated damages, thus reducing the amount owed, as a result of Karkey’s delay in
achieving the target COD; (3) whether the amount owed should be reduced due to a reduction in
the Contract term; and (4) whether Karkey is entitled to recover amounts even when it was not

generating at full capacity.’ The Tribunal also notes that Pakistan alleges that (5) any payments

due to Karkey should be reduced to account for the deferral of Lakhra’s entitlement (and

obligation) to deduct withholding tax from the Advance Payment.’”>

710. Karkey submits that it is entitled to seek recovery for sums invoiced by its wholly-owned
Pakistan subsidiary Karpak. Karpak existed solely to service the Contract in Pakistan on
Karkey’s behalf. It was established by Karkey on 2 January 2010 to handle Project related
activities in Pakistan for Karkey, including maintaining and operating the Powerships and
purchasing fuel. With the express approval and full knowledge of the PPIB, Lakhra, and PEPCO,

Karkey assigned to Karpak certain rights under the Contract related to these maintenance

activities on 12 April 2011.7 On 15 March 2012, Karpak assigned all of its rights, interests, and
remedies in the Contract back to Karkey.’*° This included the rights to recover any unpaid
amounts from Lakhra.’*! Karkey submits that this assignment fully disposes of this issue in

favour of Karkey.

. According to Karkey, even without the assignment, international law allows Karkey to enforce

the contractual rights of its subsidiary Karpak. Tribunals have consistently rejected the argument
that a foreign parent (such as Karkey) may not assert claims under a BIT for injuries to its local
subsidiary (such as Karpak). Karkey’s loss of the amount due to Karpak was caused by Pakistan’s
wrongful actions and independently harmed Karkey’s investment in its subsidiary. Accordingly,
this loss is recoverable by Karkey as part of the damage to its investment from Pakistan’s

breaches of the BIT.”

Pakistan counters that the assignment agreement from Karpak to Karkey is not valid. Pakistan
further argues that Karkey is also not entitled under international law to make claims in this

arbitration with respect to contractual rights of Karpak.”*?

The Tribunal notes that the Deed of Assignment’*4 submitted by Karkey does not identify the
specific rights which were assigned to Karkey by Karpak. The agreement makes no reference to
the 2009 RSC or the Pakistan RPP, but simply refers to an assignment of “all its rights.” Karkey
seeks to avoid this issue by asserting that “Karpak existed solely to service the Contract in
Pakistan on Karkey’s behalf’ 7* and refers to Karpak’s certificate of incorporation.”*° However,
this certification also fails to make any mention of the 2009 RSC or Pakistani RPP.’*” It is thus

not clear from this Deed of Assignment which rights are purportedly assigned.

A new version of this same Deed of Assignment’** was submitted by Karkey less than two weeks
before the Hearing. The Tribunal notes that Pakistan sought an explanation as to when this
document was created, by whom and for what purpose, but no convincing explanation has been
given by Karkey in this respect. This new version of the purported assignment agreement still

fails to identify the specific rights which were being a:

 

igned, or the contractual relationships or

third parties to which these rights relate.

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the Deed of Assignment cannot be treated as a

valid assignment for the purposes of this arbitration.

Moreover, the Tribunal finds that Karkey is not entitled as a matter of international law to make
a direct claim in relation to Karpak’s contractual rights, as Karkey does not have standing to
assert claims based on the host-State’s treatment of the contracts and assets of the company in
which it holds shares. Investment tribunals have repeatedly found that “shareholders do not have

claims arising from or rights in the assets of the companies in which they hold shares”.”°

Based on the above, the Tribunal finds that Karkey is not entitled to recover any amounts

regarding the Monthly Rental Services Fees invoiced by Karpak.

(b.1.2) Was Lakhra entitled to liquidated damages, thus reducing the amount owed?

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Haberman, in his calculation of the unpaid invoices owed to Karkey,
deducted US$3.985 million”? relating to liquidated damages withheld from Karkey because of
Karkey’s delay in meeting the Target COD.”! According to Pakistan, this deduction is justified
by Clause 4.4(b) of the 2009 RSC, which entitled Lakhra to deduct liquidated damages if Karkey

failed to achieve commercial operations within 30 days of 7 April 2010.”

Karkey, on the other hand, rejects Pakistan’s argument that Lakhra would be entitled to deduct
liquidated damages from the amounts due. This is because Pakistan and Lakhra, not Karkey, bear
responsibility for many of the alleged Project delays, and others are attributable to force majeure

events outside of Karkey’s control.”>

The Tribunal first notes that there is no dispute that the Target COD indicated in the Contract, as
amended by Amendment No. | was not met, i.e. 7 April 2010.” The Parties do dispute, however,
which party bears responsibility for the delay and its consequences. This is because the Contract
provides built-in remedies for delays attributable to Karkey including, inter alia, liquidated
damages and the right to shorten the Rental Term (with a corresponding deduction in the Contract

price).
Clause 4.4(b) of Amendment No. 1 reads as follows:

The SELLER shall achieve the Commercial Operations Date within One
hundred and twenty Days (120) from the date of execution of this
AMENDMENT (‘Target Commercial Operations Date’). [...]

The SELLER has submitted a Bank Guarantee dated 27" October 2008 and
numbered TSU-GL-ISD-20080012 amounting to US$1,250,000 (at the rate
of US$5,000 per MW) en-cashable by the BUYER in case the SELLER fails
to_achieve the Target Commercial Operations Date within cure period of
thirty (30) days after the Target Commercial Operations Date and thereafter
the SELLER will be charged at the rate of US$191 per day per MW up to a
maximum amount equivalent to US$17,190 per MW for a delay of up to three
(3) months (90 days) after cure period.

Such amount will be charged from 1‘! Payment of Monthly Rental Services

Fee of the SELLER [...].’”°

The Tribunal notes that the amount of the liquidated damages calculated by Pakistan at

 

US$3,984,642 based on the above provision is not disputed by the Parties. However, it is
Karkey’s position that the delays in the achieving of the Target COD are not attributable to

Karkey and therefore no liquidated damage is due.

On 8 December 2009, pursuant to Amendment No. | to the RSC 2009, the site specified for the
project in the 2008 RSC, i.e. Mauripur, was substituted with Korangi.”"° Karkey claims that this
substitution was occasioned by Pakistan and that Karkey was therefore not responsible under the

Contract for any delays resulting thereof.

Clause 2.A(c) of the 2009 RSC provides that “/t/he selection, acquisition and foundation design
requirements of the Site shall be the responsibility of the SELLER and at its sole cost and expense,
however, BUYER shall provide due facilitation and assistance as may be required by the

SELLER.””"

By letter of 3 September 2009, the MoWP instructed PEPCO and WPPO to re-locate Karkey’s

plant from Mauripur to Korangi as follows:

[...] Since the Korangi site has been vacated by Walters Power International,
you are advised to re-locate Karkey’s Rental Power Plant Phase-I from
Mauripur to Korangi as already requested by them [Karkey].”*

The fact that PEPCO understood this request for the substitution of site had come from Karkey

is confirmed by its own letter to Karkey the following day, in which PEPCO stated that:

Please refer to your numerous requests regarding the relocation of the site

for the power-ships from 132 kV Mauripur Grid Station to 132 KV Korangi

Thermal Power Station (KTPS) at Karachi.[...]7°°
As a result of the above, the selection of the Site was under Karkey’s responsibility, and it stems
from these letters that it was Karkey which prompted the request for the site change, and therefore

Karkey is not excused from liability for delays to the Target COD in this regard.

Karkey also relies on Clause 14 of the 2009 RSC in support of its claim that it could avoid
“responsibility or liability for any failure or delay of performance [...] caused by a Force
Majeure Event, as defined in the contract.”*® Karkey further submits that two force majeure

events caused delays in the Project not attributable to Karkey, namely (i) unexpectedly severe

monsoon weather conditions and (ii) unforeseeable obstructions discovered in the dredging area

in Korangi Creek*"!, which would prevent Lakhra from deducting liquidated damages.

The Tribunal notes that Karkey is only entitled to rely on specific monsoon weather condition as
excusing performance if Karkey gave proper notice, in accordance with Clause 14.3 of the 2009

RSC, which provides as follows:

14.3 Notice of Force Majeure Event:

SELLER shall give written notice of the occurrence of a Force Majeure
Event to BUYER, each as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later
than three (3) Days afier such occurrence.

Karkey has failed to provide any written notice to Lakhra within the required three business days
of the events complained. The letter dated 4 June 2010 from Karkey to WAPPDA,*” relied on
by Karkey as its written notice in this regard, does not constitute a notice of Force Majeure under
the 2009 RSC. This letter makes no reference to the occurrence of a Force Majeure event. As
pointed by Pakistan, such letter in fact stated that Karkey was working with “marine experts [...]
to ensure the safe arrival of the Powership(s) to the mooring area particularly during the
monsoon season [...]”°° This actually constitutes a representation that the monsoon season
would not affect the arrival of the Vessels, and cannot be considered as the written notice required

under Clause 14.3 of the 2009 RSC.

In respect to the delays caused by alleged unforeseeable obstructions discovered in the dredging

 

 

 

area, Karkey submits that “the fact that [the sub-contractor’s] properly-condt d ling did
not uncover the sticky sludge and rocks in the Channel does not di ate an insufficiency in
the survey but rather simply ates Karkey’s inability to foresee these ob les despite

 

engaging in reasonable diligence to detect them.”*™ Karkey fails to explain how this could
constitute a force majeure event under the Contract. The Tribunal also notes that Clause 14 of
the Contract provides that “Force Majeure Events shall expressly not include [...] ii) a delay in

the performance of any contractor; [...]”.

Moreover, Karkey has also failed to serve the required notice within three business days in this
respect. The two letters sent by Karkey to MoWP and PEPCO on 30 March 2010 and 27 April
2010 relied on by Karkey in this regard do not refer to the sticky sludge and obstructions
discovered in the Korangi Creek Channel.** The letter sent by Karkey to PEPCO on 26 April
2010 also does not constitute the required written notice. In such letter Karkey made no mention
to a Force Majeure event, and although it mentioned delays caused by the “very sticky sludge
and concrete rocks in the basin”, Karkey only requested “a full coordination and support [...]to

avoid any further delay in the Project schedule.”*°°

According to Karkey, Lakhra’s failure to pay the full US$80 million Advance Payment (instead
it withheld US$4.8 million as withholding taxes) caused delays in the Project schedule and in the
construction of the Powerships for the Project,*”’ and that such delays could not be attributed to
Karkey under the Contract. Karkey’s CEO, Mr. Karadeniz, explained in his witness statement
that “Karkey arranged third-party financing for the Project on the basis of the financial terms of
the Contract, including in particular Lakhra’s obligation to pay an Advance Payment of USD 80
million (against a confirmed bank guarantee in the same amount). Karkey’s lenders did not
accept Lakhra’s remittance of US$75.2 million as satisfying this requirement.”*°S Karkey
concludes that Lakhra’s failure to pay the full US$80 million frustrated Karkey’s ability to draw
down additional financing from its lenders, leading directly to delays in construction works for

the Project.*”

Clause 4.5 of the 2009 RSC provides that “the BUYER [Lakhra] shall not deduct withholding tax
(so long as it is applicable) at more than 6% from the payments to be made to SELLER [Karkey].”
(emphasis added) Karkey has failed to demonstrate that the withholding tax amount related to
the Advance Payment was not due under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001 as submitted by
Pakistan. Therefore, the alleged consequences of the delay in achieving the Target COD related
to the payment of US$72.2 million as Advance Payment (instead of US$80 million) due to

85 See C-620 (CONFIDENTIAL).

withholding tax should have been expected by Karkey under the Contract and Lakhra cannot be

held responsible for any delays arising thereof.

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Karkey has failed to demonstrate that its failure
to meet the Target COD was not attributable to it, and liquidated damages in the amount of
US$3.985 million must be deducted*!® from the outstanding invoices for Monthly Rental
Services Fees, in accordance with Clause 4.4(b) of the 2009 RSC in order to assess the amount

of the corresponding contractual right which was expropriated.

(b.1.3) Was Lakhra entitled to reduce the rental term of the 2009 RSC, thus reducing the

amount owed?

According to Pakistan, if Lakhra was entitled to reduce the rental term of the Contract by 251
days due to Karkey’s delays in accordance with Clause 4.4(b) of the Contract, then Karkey was

not entitled to recover the additional US$2.46 million claimed by Karkey in this regard.*!!

Pakistan maintains that Clause 4.4(b) of the 2009 RSC provided that Lakhra was entitled to
reduce the rental term if Karkey failed to achieve commercial operations within four months of
7 April 2010, and this further delay was caused by Karkey. Pakistan alleges that it is not disputed
that Lakhra reduced the rental term by 251 days, with the corresponding gross decrease to the
Monthly Rental Services Fee to approximately US$9.4 million (subject to deductions for the pro-
rated Advance Payment and 6% Withholding Tax). These deductions were first applied by
Lakhra to Karkey’s May 2011 Monthly Rental Service Fees invoice.*!?

On the other hand, Karkey submits that Lakhra was not entitled to invoke Clause 4.4(b) and
reduce the rental term, because Lakhra could only do so if the delay in achieving the COD was

caused solely by Karkey, which Karkey denies.

The central issue for the Tribunal to decide is whether or not the delay in achieving the Target

COD is attributable to Karkey alone.

740. As decided by the Tribunal under Section V(H)(2)(b.1.2) above, the Tribunal found that Karkey
has failed to demonstrate that its failure to meet the Target COD was not attributable to it. As a

result, Clause 4.4(b) shall apply. According to Clause 4.4(b) of the 2009 RSC:

[...] if achievement of [COD] is further delayed solely due to SELLER, the
BUYER shall have the right to re-negotiate the Contract and the Rental Term
shall be reduced by that period of delay which occurs after the first four
months (120 days) delay covered by the guarantee mentioned hereinabove
and the Lump Sum Contract Price will be reduced by the corresponding
number of Monthly Rental Service Fee or part thereof accordingly. [...]*°

741. Considering that the actual COD date was achieved by Karkey on 13 April 2011, the Tribunal
finds that Lakhra has correctly reduced the Rental Term in accordance with Clause 4.4(b), as set
forth in Lakhra’s letter dated 9 May 2011, an extract of which is reproduced below:*'*

o As the delay was solely due to SELLER beyond “120 days delay” covered by the

guarantees discussed hereinabove. the provision of Reduced Rental Term as per
Clause 4.4 (b) is hereby applied which is worked out as under:

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 217 of 310

Therefore, as summarized above, Karkey’s failure to meet the Target COD resulted ina reduction
of the term of the Contract from 60 months to 51.784 months and the Lump Sum Contract Price

was reduced proportionately from US$565 million to US$487 million.

As explained by Mr. Haberman, the amount of the Down Payment (i.e. US$80 million) that is
deducted each month from the Monthly Rental Services Fees increases from US$1.3 million to
US$1.5 million a month, as it is spread over a reduced number of months. The Monthly Rental
Services Fees invoices issued by Karkey make no allowance for the amended term when

calculating the Down Payment deduction.*!®

In view of the above, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Haberman has therefore correctly taken into
account of the increased monthly deduction of the Down Payment and, as a consequence, Lakhra
was entitled to deduct US$17,903 million from the unpaid invoices (and not US$15,441 as
alleged by Mr. Kaczmarek*'®),

(b.1.4) Was Karkey entitled to recover amounts even when it was not generating at full

capacity?

It is Pakistan’s position that Karkey is not entitled to recover amounts for Monthly Rental
Services Fees when it was not generating at full capacity.*'’ According to Pakistan, invoices for
Monthly Rental Fees included the periods when Karkey was generating no electricity (24 April
2011 to 5 May 2011) and when Karkey had reduced its electricity generation (October and
November 2011).8!8

Pakistan alleges that it is not disputed that under the Contract, the Monthly Rental Services Fee

was due in full, each month, irrespective of the amount of energy Lakhra actually used.*! The

real question is whether the Monthly Rental Services Fee was due in full, each month,

irrespective of the amount of energy Karkey generated.*”°

According to Pakistan, Karkey had the right to cease generating electricity during commercial

operations and still claim the Monthly Rental Services Fee under the 2009 RSC as follows:*?!

(i) IfLakhra failed to establish the FPLC by 23 April 2011 (and regardless of whether Lakhra
actually paid for fuel), under Clause 4.5(m) of the 2009 RSC; and

(ii) Assuming the FPLC was established, and if Karkey was unable to draw down on it in
relation to amounts owing by Lakhra for fuel which remained unpaid after 75 days from

the due date of the invoice, pursuant to Clause 4.5(m) of the 2009 RSC.*”?
The Tribunal notes that Pakistan does not dispute that the FPLC was not established by Lakhra.

It disputes, however, that Clauses 4.5(m) and (n) of the 2009 RSC applies. Pakistan maintains
that Clause 4.5(m) is an unreasonable penalty as a matter of Pakistani law. Accordingly, Karkey’s
purported contractual right to receive the full Monthly Rental Services Fee, despite having

discontinued electricity generation, is unenforceable under Pakistani law.*??

After having duly analysed Pakistan’s allegations in this regard, the Tribunal finds that Pakistan
has failed to substantiate that provisions in Clauses 4.5(m) and (n) of the 2009 RSC are
unenforceable under Pakistani law. Accordingly, Lakhra was not entitled to make any deductions
in this regard. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Haberman has not made any deductions in this regard

when reaching his conclusions set out under paragraph 708 above.

752. The Tribunal notes that the fuel payments were not payable to Karkey, but to Karpak, which is
not a party to this dispute. As decided under Section V(H)(2)(b.1.1), Karkey does not have

standing to claim the invoices allegedly due to Karpak in this arbitration.

"5 This table is an excerpt of the table set out in Haberman, Second Expert Report, 3.16. The Tribunal notes that
Mr. Haberman has correctly not made any deductions for periods when Karkey was not generating at full capacity

above.

Karkey changed its position and submitted that a reasonable approximation of the mobilization

and transport charges it is owed under Clause 4.6(b) of the 2009 RSC is US$2,000,000.°?7

756. By way of reminder, Clauses 4.6(a) and 4.6(b) of the 2009 RSC provide as follows:

[4.6.a] In the event the Contract is terminated by the BUYER [Lakhra] before

 

 

 

 

the Contract desi: d expiry date, due to the BUYER’s convenience, the
BUYER shall pay all Monthly Rental Services Fee to date, mo: ion and
transport charges to return the Equi, to SELLER’s desi: d depot

 

and also will be r ible for the exportation of the Equi; from

Pakistan, for which time shall be of the essence. Additionally the BUYER
shall pay Termination Charges as detailed in Clause-d of this Section. In the
event of BUYER’s termination for convenience, sixty (60) days written notice

properly terminated the 2009 RSC for the uncured default of Lakhra (and where Karkey succeeds
on its Contract claims) and where the 2009 RSC is found not to be void, it is entitled to the
mobilization and transport charges, as these are not a penalty (as opposed to the Termination

Charges provision under the Contract).°8

Considering that the Supreme Court, through its Judgment of 30 March 2012, has de facto
terminated the Contract (and in any event Karkey terminated the Contract on the same date),
Karkey had the right to recover the damages it actually incurred in the mobilization and transport
associated with the return from Pakistan of the Vessels related to the Project. The expropriation

deprived it of the value of this right.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 221 of 310

. Pakistan disputes the amount claimed by Karkey by way of mobilization and transport charges

because: (a) in respect of the Kaya Bey, Karkey has produced no evidence to support these
charges; and (b) in respect of the Alican Bey, Karkey is not entitled to those charges because it is
already claiming for the value of vessel on the assumption that it is a total loss — therefore it

cannot and will not incur such charges.*??

The Tribunal shares Pakistan’s views with respect to the Alican Bey, and finds that Karkey is not
entitled to mobilization and transport charges in this regard, as they are not and will not be

incurred.

Neither Karkey’s original claim for US$12 million for mobilization and transport charges, nor
its reduced claim for US$2 million is substantiated by any evidence. The only document that
Karkey has produced is a spreadsheet adduced by Mr. Kaczmarek which shows transport costs
of the Kaya Bey to Dubai as being US$566,000.8" The Tribunal finds that although this
spreadsheet is not accompanied by supporting invoices, the amount seems reasonable for the

transport and mobilization of the Kaya Bey.

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Pakistan shall pay Karkey the amount of

US$566,000 for the mobilization and transport charges incurred with respect to the Kaya Bey.

The Tribunal now turns to the analysis of the Claimant’s claims for damages related to (3) the

Kaya Bey; (4) Alican Bey; (5) the Enis Bey and the Iraq; (6) delay damages, (7) costs increases;

 

(8) wasted costs; and (9) the applicable interest rate. A summary of the Tribunal’s findings on

damages and the application of interest thereon is set forth under Section V(H)(10).

(3) Damages related to the Kaya Bey
The Claimant’s claim for damages in relation to the Kaya Bey comprises two components:

(i) Alleged physical damage and cost repairs in the sum of approximately US$36 million;**!

(ii) Alleged lost cash flows under other contracts (i.e. lost profits): (i) from 31 March 2012
up to June 2015 (the time when Karkey claims that the vessel should reach full operational
capacity) in the sum of approximately US$240 million; and (ii) from July 2015 to
December 2015 (the period by which Karkey claims its repair works to have been

“delayed”) in the sum of approximately US$10 million.

a. Is Karkey entitled to Cost Repairs of the Kaya Bey?

765. Karkey submits that it has documented the extensive repairs to the Kaya Bey necessitated by its

76

a

detention in Pakistan. It asserts that Pakistan’s criticism of the Kaya Bey repair assessment is
based on a cursory and unqualified inspection of the Powership by Mr. Waller (Pakistan’s
industry expert), and unrealistic expectations about what Karkey should have done. While Mr.
Waller may be an expert in naval architecture, he is not an expert on the construction and
operation of the Powerships Karkey maintains, the engines those ships use, or the rental power

market in which they operate.**?

Karkey reject’s Pakistan’s allegation that Mr. Nickerson’s (Karkey’s industry expert) assessment
of the damage to the Kaya Bey is based on supposition and speculation. According to Karkey,
Mr. Nickerson’s inspection was thorough and he has thoroughly documented extensive damage
throughout the Kaya Bey, including the hull and marine equipment,**? fresh water cooling
837

system,**4 main propulsion plant,**> and power generation plant,**° among other components.

Mr. Nickerson explained his findings in detail in his report and concluded that they would cost

 

between US$37 million and US$47 million to lete. He adds that this amount could increase
up to US$68 million.“* These initial conclusions are supported by the US$16 million incurred

to date for partial repairs of the Kaya Bey which are now only partially complete.*”

According to Karkey, Pakistan’s detention prevented the required maintenance and led to

accelerated corrosion and decay, which could not reasonably have been avoided by Karkey.*”

Pakistan, on the other hand, submits that Karkey has failed to adduce sufficient evidence to show
whether any damage occurred during the period of the Kaya Bey’s detention, due to Karkey’s
failure to establish any sort of baseline against which the present condition of the Kaya Bey could
be compared against its condition at release by Pakistan.**!

Even where Pakistan agrees that there are repairs that are in fact required (based on the results of
the inspection of the vessel in September 2013 by its appointed expert), Karkey has failed to
show that these repairs are attributable to (or caused by) any actions of Pakistan in breach of the

BITS”

Pakistan further submits that Karkey admitted that it has already recovered significant amounts
from its insurer, namely US$55 million, in respect of the detention of the Vessels.*4? Mr.
Karadeniz expressly confirmed that Karkey believes that this amount would be “sufficient to
cover most, if not all, of the anticipated repairs”, relying on Mr. Nickerson’s estimated repair
costs of up to “USD 35 million for the Kaya Bey and USD 25 million for the Alican Bey.”**
According to Pakistan, this is relevant to the question of damages. Karkey cannot double recover
in respect of the alleged losses associated with its Vessels since the purpose of damages is full

reparation, not overly full or double reparation.*45

details of the costs of such work”: see Pakistan’s Document Request No. 96, Pakistan’s Redfern Schedule, Annex 2
to Procedural Order No. 8, dated 24 April 2015. Karkey produced in response five documents — of these, two are a
single dry-docking invoice from Drydocks World (R-399 and R-398A (CONFIDENTIAL)). One is an internal report
from Karmarine, a subsidiary of Karkey (R-399) and is not evidence of third party contractor servicing or repairs.
One document is a record from ABB of a regular turbocharger overhaul carried out in Dubai (R-418). The final
document (R-419 (CONFIDENTIAL)) relates to works to the main sea water pump whilst the Kaya Bey was in dry-
dock.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 224 of 310

The Tribunal finds that Pakistan is liable for any damage that has occurred since the date the
Kaya Bey was detained by Pakistan and which was caused by Pakistan. It should normally be

essential to establish what the condition of the Kaya Bey was just before it was detained.

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Nickerson summarized his methodology for establishing a baseline

of the Kaya Bey conditions in his Fourth Report, as follows:

In my First Report, I noted that in preparing that report I relied on
‘[cJonstruction and arrival photographs...to confirm the condition of the
vessels post-construction, upon arrival and over the course of the last year.’
I noted that these photographs ‘provided the baseline against which the
current conditions were measured’. In my Second Report, I similarly noted

my use of these and other photographs as ‘a baseline against which to

measure current conditions and forecast likely future events. **°

Mr. Nickerson alleges that he was able to assess the baseline condition of the Kaya Bey based
on, inter alia, arrival photographs and on his previous surveys of the Vessel.*47 However, as
pointed by Mr. Waller, Mr. Nickerson has not adduced sufficient evidence to substantiate this.
In particular, he has failed to produce surveys, reports, or photographic evidence that could
adequately substantiate this claim and provide a sufficient baseline against which the current

condition of the Kaya Bey can be assessed.

In response to Pakistan’s allegation that Mr. Nickerson’s assessment of damage of the Kaya Bey
was “based entirely on supposition and speculation,”*** Karkey responded that “Mr. Nickerson’s
inspection was thorough, his experience is on point and deep, and his damage assessment was
supported.”* Yet, the Tribunal notes that Karkey has not adduced adequate evidence to
substantiate the level of alleged damage and, most importantly, that these alleged damages were

caused by the detention of the Kaya Bey by Pakistan.

The Tribunal notes that Pakistan admits that the only evidence of any damage during the
detention of the Kaya Bey relates to one engine (the MAN No.19 Engine). However, Karkey has
failed to prove that this damage was caused by Pakistan. The Parties’ experts agree that it was

caused by water ingress, but Karkey has failed to establish what caused that water ingress or

suggested how the water ingress resulted from any actions of Pakistan in breach of the BIT. As
pointed by Pakistan, if the damage was caused by actions taken by Pakistan, it might be expected
that there would be evidence of similar damage to the rest of the engines, but Karkey has not

produced any evidence of that.

Mr. Waller considers that it may well have been caused by a failure to cap the exhaust stacks.
But even if it was a failure to cap the exhaust stacks, Karkey has not demonstrated that such
failure was the responsibility of Pakistan. Mr. Waller has explained in his Second Report the
steps that could have been taken to protect the engine systems during any period of lay-up as

follows:

222. If the engines had been laid up properly and the boilers drained, subject
to regular inspection and had been turned over regularly, as they should
have been during any period of lay-up, then any issue with water ingress into
the engines would have been detected early on before extensive corrosion
took place. I note that Mr. Nickerson himself states that ‘the lack of rust
inhibitors’ in the cooling water caused the corrosion. That suggests a failure
to use the right resources and equipment to prevent corrosion is the actual
cause of this damage.

223. Therefore, the fact that the vessel was at anchor, at least for a period
during the detention, in itself, would clearly not have prevented these lay-up
procedures taking place.*°°

However, the Tribunal is of the view that the fact that Karkey was not able to provide evidence
of a baseline for the Kaya Bey condition and to evidence that the damages shown by the vessel
were actually caused by its detention is not sufficient to dismiss its claim. When a party, such as
Pakistan, has unlawfully created a situation likely to generate damages - and the detention of a
vessel in outer anchorage is likely to do - it cannot be exonerated from liability only because the
damaged party was not able to evidence that the situation so created caused the expected
damages. Without a complete reversal of the burden of proof of the causation, the party whose
acts are likely to generate damages must at least establish that it took appropriate measures to

avoid or reduce the expected damages. Pakistan did nothing of that sort.

Moreover, Karkey maintains that the immediate cause of the damage to the Kaya Bey was its
inability to properly maintain the vessel due to (a) lack of electricity; (b) lack of manpower; and

(c) a lack of resources.**!

The Tribunal notes that the Parties do not dispute that a lack of maintenance may generate
damages and that the obligation to maintain the Kaya Bey and other vessels was Karkey’s, and
not Pakistan’s. However, Karkey asserts that the lack of maintenance arose from the conditions
of the detention which have allegedly severely limited the amount of maintenance Karkey was

852 The Tribunal is inclined to think that it is the case. Indeed, a

able to perform on the Vessels.
vessel which is suddenly detained and not released until seven months after the Tribunal renders
a decision ordering such release is not expected to be maintained as it would be in the ordinary
course of business. This is even more the case when the vessel remains forcibly idled and

subjected to inhospitable sea and weather conditions, as it was the case.*°?

It has not been seriously denied that Pakistan cut off lifeline power to the Vessels, including the
Kaya Bey, as from April 2012. Pakistan relies on the fact that Karkey did purchase its own
generating facilities at least as early as October 2012, close to the time when NAB issued its “No
Objection Certificate,” which would have resulted in the release of its vessel should such decision
have been implemented. According to Mr. Waller, these were sufficient to provide enough power
to maintain the Kaya Bey.*™ This is far from certain. It was convincingly explained in Mr. El
Suudi’s Witness Statement**> that maintenance requires the performance of the Powerships
which have been designed for being connected to the grid and that the small onboard emergency
generators cannot meet the internal consumption needs when the powerships are not performing.
Moreover, the crew who were deprived of electricity by decisions attributable to Pakistan could
be reasonably expected to use the onboard generators for their own benefit rather than for

maintenance of the vessel.

. It is true that there is no evidence that the detention of the Kaya Bey prevented Karkey from

making use of manpower to lay-up and maintain its vessel, despite Pakistan’s request for

disclosure of such evidence.**° On the contrary, it stems from the evidence on the record that
Karkey took a commercial decision to downscale the staff levels by at least 61% on the Vessels.
The e-mails between Karkey’s finance department and the staff contractor, Orient Power, in the
period following the detention of the Vessels contain no mention to Pakistan preventing staff
from reaching the Vessels. Instead, Orient Power was asked to provide a costs structure based on
a 61% reduction in personnel, as “during this period without any planned production, we need

to reduce workers from both side[s] until next fixed place and plans.”*5"

It can be noted from the above that Karkey actually chose to reduce the staffing level. However,
such decision appears to be reasonable in the circumstances where Pakistan’s unlawful decisions
had made the Vessels idle. It was a reasonable mitigation of damages anzd it is likely that Karkey

would be criticized if it had not done so.

There is no evidence of a lack of supplies/resources. To the contrary, Karkey’s claim for
approximately US$23 million for wasted costs incurred in maintaining the Vessels in Pakistan
includes significant sums for lubricating oil and spare parts. There is no evidence on the record
that these supplies did not reach the Vessels or that Pakistan prevented supplies from reaching

the Vessels. (See wasted costs claim under Section V(H)(8)).

Last but not least, the Tribunal is satisfied that Pakistan could not seriously expect Karkey to
maintain the vessels after it had shown its determination not to release them, even in breach of
an Order of this Tribunal. Karkey had no expectation to recover the Vessels because of Pakistan
behaviour and such behaviour is the main cause of their lack of maintenance which generated

damages, a fact that it is not seriously disputed.

Karkey is entitled to be compensated for such damages. In his third report, Mr. Nickerson
explains that the total estimated cost of repairs that would be required to return the Kaya Bey to
full operations fails in a range between US$37 million and US$47 million. He adds that this

amount could increase up to US$68 million.***

Mr. Waller has declared to be unable to comment on Mr. Nickerson’s estimate as he finds no
evidence sustaining it.**? As a matter of fact, Mr. Nickerson admitted under cross-examination
that he did not check in detail the accuracy of these figures provided to him by Karkey.5°
Likewise, the documents submitted by Karkey in this arbitration do not evidence that repairs for
such amounts will actually take place and even less that they actually took place. The Tribunal
notes that while Karkey’s burden of proof may be relaxed as far as the causation of the damages
suffered by the detained vessel (for the reasons set forth at paragraph 777 above), it is not the

case as far as the repairs and their cost are concerned.

In this respect, it results from Exhibit C-726, a spreadsheet submitted by Karkey summarizing
the Kaya Bey rehabilitation costs, that the works on the Kaya Bey would amount to
US$29,820,136, divided in two parts: (i) US$17,492,190 from May 2014 until the vessel starts
operating, and (ii) US$12,327,246 from that time until 31 January 2016. The first of these two
amounts is close to the amount of US$16.5 million of repair costs “over the 20 months between
the release of the Kaya Bey in May 2014 and December 2015, when it resumes normal operations
at full capacity” estimated by Mr. Kaczmarek.**! In his estimation, Mr. Kaczmarek includes an
amount of US$5.9 million corresponding to a rehabilitation program already planned for 2012

and not resulting from the damages suffered during the detention of the vessel.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the damages resulting from the detention must have been repaired
between the release of the vessel and its new start of operation. In light of the various statements

ss the

 

of the experts and of the documents on the file, the Tribunal is not in a position to as:
amounts of these repairs with certainty. Yet, bearing in mind that it cannot be seriously disputed
that repairs were effected before putting the vessel into operation for an amount of US$16.5
million, which includes the amount of US$5.9 million for the rehabilitation program
contemplated before the detention and which would have been performed irrespective of the
detention, the Tribunal assess the damages to the Kaya Bey resulting from its detention to US$10

million.

b. Is Karkey entitled to loss of profits related to the Kaya Bey?

The Tribunal will analyse Karkey’s claim for lost cash flows stemming from the detention of the
Kaya Bey following the expropriation of Karkey’s contractual rights on 30 March 2012, and

taking into account that the Kava Bey was provisionally released in May 2014.8

The Tribunal first notes that the Termination Charge under Clause 4.6 of the 2009 RSC does not
exclude Karkey’s entitlement to the loss of profits Karkey would have generated with its Vessels
had they not been retained by Pakistan following termination of the Contract. This is because
Clause 4.6 not only provides for the payment of Termination Charges to Karkey upon termination
of the contract, but also the return of the Vessels to Karkey. Had Pakistan not detained the

Vessels, Karkey would be able to generate revenue with the Kaya Bey under other contracts.

Karkey claims for lost profits arising out of the detention of the Kaya Bey for an amount of
US$240.1 million. Pakistan’s damages expert, Mr. Haberman, assessed the quantum of this

claim as US$91.2 million.
The Tribunal analyses the calculation of the lost profits related to the Kaya Bey below.

ce. Calculation of the lost profits related to the Kaya Bey

The Tribunal notes that both valuation experts agree that the lost profits stemming from the
detention of the Kaya Bey are best assessed using the DCF method. Both experts assume that the
losses begin in April 2012 following the termination of the RSC 2009, and that the Kaya Bey re-

enters operations in December 2014, reaching full capacity in July 2015.8

Despite the fact that there is broad agreement regarding the method of calculation and the period
over which damages are suffered, the experts disagree with respect to many of the significant

assumptions that underlie the DCF model.

8 The Kaya Bey was definitively released on 1 August 2014 only, but always remained under Karkey’s control
since its provisional release in May 2014.

and now claims that the Kaya Bey was to reach full capacity in December 2015. This issue is analysed further below.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 230 of 310

As put by Mr. Haberman (Respondent’s expert), the starting point for quantifying Karkey’s loss

is to compare two scenarios, the difference between them representing the measure of loss:

a) First, what would have happened had the event which is being complained

about not occurred (the “Hypothetical Scenario”); and

b) Secondly, what has actually happened to date and what is expected to

happen in the future (the “Actual Scenario”). *°°

When using the DCF approach, projected cash flows are brought to the valuation date by
discounting each cash flow at a rate commensurate with the expected risk of the cash flows (i.e.
risk being the likelihood that cash flows differ — whether higher or lower - from those forecast).
In the present case, the experts agree that Karkey’s future cash flows ought to be discounted to

the valuation date using Karkey’s estimated weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”).

The Tribunal will first analyse below (c.1) the appropriate discount rate to be applied in the DCF
calculation, which is followed by a decision on (c.2) the appropriate Hypothetical Scenario, and
(c.3) the Actual Scenario. The Tribunal then will state its (c.4) conclusion on the lost profits

suffered by Karkey in relation to the Kaya Bey.

(c.1) The Discount Rate: WACC

Mr. Kaczmarek calculates a WACC of 9% for Karkey’s Powerships with a valuation date of 30
June 2015.7 On the other hand, Mr. Haberman uses a WACC of 15 or 18 %, depending on the
location of the Powerships, with his valuation date of 31 March 2012.

The Tribunal notes that the appropriate discount rate/WACC is determined by reference to
various components, namely (i) the risk-free rate, (ii) beta, (iii) equity risk premium, (iv) country
risk premium, (v) size and project risk premium, (vi) cost of equity, (vii) post tax cost of debt,

(viii) percent of equity, and (ix) percent of debt.5°

866 Haberman, First Expert Report, | 3.21. See also Kaczmarek, First Expert Report, § 125: “Claimant's losses in
this case are equal to the difference between what Claimant's financial performance would have been but for the
Measures [...] (“But For Scenario”) and Claimant's actual performance (“Actual Scenario”).”

801. The most significant differences in opinion between the two experts in relation to the components

802.

of the WACC are the (c.1.1) valuation date, (c.1.2) country risk premium and (c.1.3) the size and

project risk premium, which are analysed below in turn. For the reasons set forth below, the

Tribunal accepts the opinion of Mr. Haberman with respect to the calculation of the discount rate

(ie. WACC).

(c.1.1) Valuation Date

As mentioned by the Tribunal under Section V(H)(1)(c) above, the Tribunal was not convinced

by the ex post valuation made by Mr. Kaczmarek (the Claimant’s expert). The damages due to

Karkey are therefore the fair market value/lost cashflows of the expropriated rights, evaluated at

the date of the expropriation, i.e. 30 March 2012.

The Tribunal accepts the DCF calculation prepared by Mr. Haberman in order to determine the
market value of the Kaya Bey, as well as his explanation that, as its DCF calculation was
“prepared on a monthly basis [he has therefore] discounted cash flows to 31 March 2012 rather
than 30 March 2012, thus 31 March 2012 is the valuation date I have adopted in my loss
calculations.” The Tribunal notes that the choice of 31 March v. 30 March 2012 has no

significant impact on the calculation of damages.

Mr. Haberman applied an ex ante approach to assess the losses attributable to the detention of

the Kaya Bey, and therefore only adopted data available at the date of detention.6”*

(c.1.2) Country Risk Premium

Mr. Haberman includes a country risk premium of 7.5% (Iraq) to 9% (Pakistan) into his discount
rate, bearing in mind that at the date of the expropriation Karkey had vessels deployed in Iraq
and in Pakistan only. He then discounts the cash flows under each of the contracts (i.e. First and
Second Iraq Contract and RSC 2009) at a country specific WACC. Mr. Haberman calculated his
country risk premium on the basis of sovereign credit ratings, which according to Mr. Haberman
reflect “a government's willingness and ability to service its debt on time and in full.”°7®
According to Pakistan, this is commonly used by valuers as a basis for calculating country risk
premium. Given that Karkey enters into contracts with governments or government owned

entities, sovereign credit ratings are directly relevant to Karkey’s business.°””

On the other hand, Mr. Kaczmarek is of the view that including a country risk premium is
unnecessary because “the underlying cash flows of the business or asset can be adjusted for
country risk.”*’> He does not therefore apply a country risk premium because he claims that
country risk is accounted for in the cash flows by way of insurance payments and that political
and legal risks are also covered by bilateral investment treaties. Mr. Kaczmarek states that in
April 2011, Karkey purchased a Marine War Risk Policy covering KPS 1 to 6. This policy was

in addition to a policy for coverage for the ship’s hulls. Coverage under the Marine War Risk

Policy included coverage of social risk, political and legal risk. For example, the following

elements were included in the policy: *”

disturbances, riots or civil commotions. [...]

1.6 confiscation, appropriation, expropriation, detention or wilful

or de facto) or public or local authority of any country.5*°

of equity because it is included as a cost element in the cash flows.**!

The Tribunal first notes that the inclusion of a country risk premium in investment tribunal’s
calculations of compensation is an extremely common feature. As noted by the tribunal in

Tidewater v. Venezuela:

The inclusion of a country risk premium is a very common feature of
tribunals’ calculations of compensation, since, as one tribunal observed ‘the
fundamental issue of country risk [is] obvious to the least sophisticated
businessman’®*? For example, in one recent decision concerning Venezuela,
the tribunal adopted a country risk rate of 18%.*°

Moreover, the Tribunal finds that an insurance policy does not eliminate all social, political and
legal risks. Otherwise, as pointed out by Pakistan, investors could disregard any such risks in a
host-State when investing, so long as they are able to obtain insurance. Mr. Kaczmarek himself
has acknowledged during the Hearing that an insurance policy has its limitations.**4 This includes
the fact that damages may surpass the amount covered under the insurance policy, only certain
defined risks are covered, and that insurance may be terminated. This is confirmed by the fact
that Karkey’s insurers cancelled its War Risk Policy due to its alleged failure to disclose, inter

alia, material facts relating to the Supreme Court proceedings in Pakistan. Karkey subsequently

brought legal proceedings against its insurers in the amount of US$265.5 million, which
represented the loss of the Vessels, and agreed to settle for US$55.5 million.’*> Therefore,
Karkey’s own experience in Pakistan shows that the existence of an insurance policy and/or of

other guarantees does not eliminate all country risks.

The Tribunal i

 

‘isfied with the calculation of Mr. Haberman’s country risk, who used Professor
Damoradan’s estimate of long-term country risk based on the credit rating (published by agencies
such as Moody’s and Fitch or Standard & Poor) for each country**®, i.e. 7.5% for Iraq and 9%
for Pakistan.**’ Although Iraq did not have a credit rating at Mr. Haberman’s valuation date, the
Tribunal approves his use of a shadow rating provided by the World Bank in 2011 and his further

adjustments, which is in line with standard valuation practices.***

. The Tribunal notes that in determining the appropriate risk premium, Mr. Haberman has correctly

removed Karkey’s Marine War Risk policy from the forecast cash flows to avoid double counting

certain of the country risks in his risk calculation.**

(c.1.3) Size and Project Risk Premium
According to Pakistan, in order to reflect the fact that (i) Karkey is in essence a start-up company
without an established business model in the temporary floating market, and (ii) to account for
Karkey’s size, Mr. Haberman applies a size and project risk premium of 5% to his discount
rate.*° Pakistan submits that, because Mr. Kaczmarek does not apply such a premium to his

calculations, he significantly understates the risks involved in Karkey’s Powership operations.*”!

The Tribunal is not convinced by the criticism made by Mr. Kaczmarek of Mr. Haberman’s

application of a premium to reflect small company and project-specific risks in this case.8°

814. The reasons why an additional project risk premium is justified in the present case is summarized

in the table below:*%

Unproven business model There are no other firms in the floating power market offering
power through self-propelled floating power _ stations.
Compared to power barges, they are more limited in locations
where they can be moored and need to be constantly manned,
increasing operating costs.

This was a new venture Prior to submitting bids to Iraq and Pakistan to provide rental
power, Karkey’s experience was exclusively in land based
power operations based in Turkey.

Inexperience Karkey had no prior experience of operating floating power
stations.

No evidence of future success Each Powership appears to have been constructed for the
purpose of a particular contract, and these vessels are still
operating under their original contracts. Karkey has not yet
been in a position where it has had to procure a new contract
for an idle vessel or move its Powership from one contract to
another. Other companies that have tried to enter the
speculative power rental market, have failed.

Limited market High transport and significant set up costs imply that smaller
contracts (e.g. below 100MW) would be uneconomical for
Karkey. It may be that, when a Powership is available for a new
contract, there will be no contracts available that use sufficient
capacity to make the new contract economical to operate. The
market is limited further, due to few ports in the world having
the direct transmission capacity to import large electrical
capacity

Source: Haberman, First Expert Report, Appendix C, para. C.51

815. In view of the above, and considering that Karkey only entered the market for floating temporary
power in 2008, and that on 30 March 2012 (date of expropriation), Karkey had only operated in

Iraq (for less than two years), it had limited operational experience on the date of valuation, the
Tribunal finds reasonable that Mr. Haberman’s included a premium of 5% in his discount factor

calculation to account for Karkey’s size and the fact that Karkey was not an experienced company

in the temporary market at the time.

(c.1.4) Tribunal’s Conclusion
816. In view of the above, the Tribunal finds Mr. Haberman’s calculation of the discount rate or
WACC is the most appropriate, and can be summarized as follows (bearing in mind that the

(c.2) The But For Scenario

817. As stated above, the starting point for quantifying Karkey’s loss is to compare two scenarios, the

difference between them representing the measure of loss:*°*

- First, what would have happened had the event which is being complained about not

occurred (the “Hypothetical Scenario”); and

- Second, what has actually happened to date and what is expected to happen in the future

(the “Actual Scenario”).

For the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Haberman’s calculation of the
Hypothetical Scenario is the most appropriate. The main differences between the experts are

addressed below.

(c.2.1) Contracts Assumed Under the Hypothetical or But for Scenario

Mr. Haberman assumes that the Kaya Bey would have left Pakistan on 30 March 2012 and would
have been available for new contracts from this date. At that time, Karkey had three Powerships
operating in Iraq, being KPS 3 and KPS 4 under the First Iraq Contract and KPS 6 under the

902

Second Iraq Contract.””’ At that date, no other contracts had been signed by Karkey and Karkey

had no experience of operating under any other contracts, apart from the 2009 RSC.

Mr. Haberman considers that the best approach is to model the cash flows that the Kaya Bey
might have generated under each of these existing contracts, taking into account actual operating

data where it existed.

The Tribunal approves Mr. Haberman’s approach and finds that modelling cash flows based on
actual contract terms and using actual operating assumptions provides the most realistic estimate

of cash flows that the Kaya Bey could have generated.

In respect of operations in Iraq, the First Iraq Contract (“Iraq I”) was entered into in December
2008 and an addendum was signed on 29 March 2011, which changed the pricing terms. KPS 3
and KPS 4 operated under this contract. A Second Iraq Contract (“Iraq II”) was signed on 29
May 2011 for 110 MW, for the Jrem Sultan (KPS 6).°° Given that Iraq II followed the payment
terms in the Addendum to Iraq I, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Haberman is correct to assume that
by 30 March 2012, a new Iraq contract would not have been made under the original payment
terms (which were fixed irrespective of the electricity delivered) and that it is thus appropriate to

adopt the terms and payment terms under the Addendum.

(c.2.2) Time between Contracts

The Tribunal notes that Karkey does not agree with the assumptions made by Mr. Haberman

  

regarding the time between Contracts. According to Karkey, Mr. Haberman would have
conceded during the Hearing that it was reasonable to assume, based on the available evidence,
that the Kaya Bey would take only one month to redeploy to Iraq (rather than the eight months
that he had modelled).°°> However, the Tribunal is not convinced of the existence of such

concession which, if undisputable, would not resolve the issue at stake. Indeed, the Tribunal

 

understands that Mr. Haberman expressed a view on the basis of a hypothesis made in the light
of an analysis of evidence of October 2012 which are not necessarily representative of what
would have occurred immediately after 30 March 2012. The findings in Mr. Haberman’s Second

Report, based on a thorough analysis of historical data, appear to be more reliable.

According to Mr. Haberman’s Second Report, given that at 30 March 2012, Karkey had no
experience of a contract term ending and another contract commencing, or of a contract being
extended, there is no evidence as to how long it would be before the Powerships would be able
to start generating profits under an alternative contract. Mr. Haberman made the assumption that
Karkey would enter into a new contract for each vessel one month after the 2009 RSC ended. He
deals with the risk that this would have taken longer within the project premium in his assessment

of the discount rate.°°°

In his report, Mr. Haberman considered the time taken historically to commence operations after
a contract is signed, as a proxy for the time between contracts, that would cover transport time,
time to conduct repairs, perform reclassification activities and conduct site preparation for the
new contract. To estimate this period, Mr. Haberman has observed the time between the signing
of Karkey’s existing contracts and commencing operations, which ranged between eight and 22

months, and averaged 17 months:°°7

Source: Haberman, Second Expert Report, paras. 5.9 — 5.10

The Tribunal accepts Mr. Haberman’s conclusions in his Second Report and finds that, given the

evidence available at the date that the vessels were detained, it is reasonable to consider that there

 

would be an eight-month gap between one contract ending and the next beginning. This is the
quickest that Karkey managed to start operations prior to 30 March 2012. The eight-month gap
between contracts includes transportation to a dry-docking facility (two months), dry docking
(two months), transportation to the new operating site (two months) and a period of delay (two

months). This approach is reasonable as it duly accounts for delay and maintenance. As pointed

 

out by Pakistan, Karkey has not yet completed any contractual cycle (whereby its

 

hips have left

one contract and moved to another) to provide any sort of precedent.

The Tribunal notes that the documents relied upon by Karkey to dispute Mr. Haberman’s

2908

assumptions are dated from October 201 and do not evidence that Karkey would be able to

start operations within the time-frame indicated in those documents. Actually, the four-month

delay to the commencement of commercial operations under the Second Iraq Contract suggests

that the two-month gap advocated by Karkey is overly optimistic.

Based on the above, the Tribunal finds that the eight-month assumed by Mr. Haberman in his

Second Report is reasonable.

(c.2.3) Unit Price

According to Karkey, Mr. Haberman has conceded during the Hearing that because he had
incorrectly calculated the unit price under the Iraq I contract, his criticism that Mr. Kaczmarek

had cherry-picked the highest priced contract was wrong.°”

However, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Haberman has not conceded that he had incorrectly
calculated the unit price under the Iraq I contract, ie. of 0.6 US$per kWh (as per 2011
Addendum).”!° Mr. Haberman has simply explained that he has used the 0.6 USS instead of the
0.8 US$per kWh (which was the unit price for the Second Iraq Contract) as we are in a situation
“trying to anticipate what a negotiation might have been like had the ships been released at the
end of March 2012. I would suspect that the Party more eager to enter into the Contract would
be Karkey rather than Iraq, and so, therefore it might be more likely that the lower price would

apply rather than the higher price.””'!

Based on the above, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Haberman’s assumption with respect to the unit

price used for the Iraq I contract is the most appropriate.

(c.2.4) Site installation costs

According to Karkey, Mr. Haberman has conceded during the Hearing that the site installation
costs of US$15 million used in his calculations were too high,?!? without providing any other

assessment:

Q. [...] And so you want to reduce the losses on the Alican Bey and the Kaya Bey by
31.4 million and 15 million, so that’s around 46 million, based upon the idea that the

reasonable assumption for site-preparation costs is not — is 15 million.

then that adjustment should be lower.

Q. Yes. And on reflection, do you think that it might be appropriate to pick a lower

figure?

installation costs was an assumption based on the available evidence.

This estimate was based on the US$30 million costs incurred in preparation of the mooring site
for the Powerships in Pakistan.?'4 This amount is consistent with Karkey’s own estimate as set
out in its original proposal to Ghana, which states “Mobilisation & Demobilisation including

infrastructure works US$15,000,000.”°!°

Mr Haberman has not indicated what would be the amount lower than US$15 million that it
would retain after reconsideration. The Tribunal is satisfied, in the light of the historical data,
that it must be higher than the US$5 million accepted by Mr. Kaczmarek for both transport and
site preparation, without any indication on the costs for site preparation only.°!® Considering the
historical data and the fact that the amount to be deducted from the losses relating to the Kaya
Bey, as assessed by the Tribunal, will not be spread over the eight-month period Mr. Haberman
has assumed between contracts,’!” the Tribunal assesses that amount to US$8 million. Since Mr.
Haberman had deducted an amount of US$15 million, an amount of US$7 million will be added

to Karkey’s loss.

In view of the above, Karkey’s request that this US$15 million amount should be reduced is

hereby partly granted.

(c.2.5) Corporate Tax Rate - Tax Optimization
Karkey submits that the issue of tax optimization can be dealt with quickly and easily using an
ex post analysis. Mr. Haberman accepts that in the “ex post world”, Karkey’s operations are
indeed tax-optimized (such that it pays a Dutch tax rate of 5% on dividends, and an additional
estimated 2% in local taxes, for a total of 7% - rather than the Turkish rate of 20% used by Mr.

Haberman).”!®

According to Mr. Kaczmarek, there are reasons why his damages analysis does not include a
deduction for taxes from historical cash flows. Chief among them is that if corporate income
taxes are deducted from a damage claim, there is a real risk of double taxation. The payment of
a damages award will require the damaged party to record the transaction in its accounting
records. That transaction will then form part of the entity’s year-end results which will be used
to compute the necessary income taxes. If the damages amount were determined on a post-
corporate income tax basis, the damaged party may be required to pay taxes on the award
twice.”!° Moreover, income taxes are amounts that should actually be paid, not “netted”out on
paper through a damages award as Mr. Haberman advocates. In the ordinary course of business,
all taxes are physically paid by the tax payer to the taxing authority. If taxes are merely “netted
out” in a damages award rather than being physically paid, the specific party that would
ordinarily receive the cash ultimately does not. Given the practical problems it creates, the
“netting” of taxes from a damages award should be rejected in favor of actual physical tax

payments being made in the ordinary course of business.””°

. Mr. Kaczmarek also states that in several prior investor-state cases in which corporate tax issues

have arisen, tribunals have opted to award damages based on pre-tax calculation.*”!

. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Haberman have assumed that Karkey pays corporate tax at 20% on

its taxable profits. Mr. Haberman has assumed that Karkey will receive a foreign tax credit
against its corporation tax in Turkey for the WHT that it suffers in Pakistan (or elsewhere), so

that its income is not taxed twice. This is based on the tax note in Karkey’s 2013 financial

As pointed by Mr. Haberman, this suggests that Karkey is taxed at 20% on its worldwide income,
this in the absence of evidence that the 2009 RSC was structured in such a way that Karkey did
not incur tax at this rate on its profits from Pakistan, Mr. Haberman has correctly adopted

Karkey’s tax rate of 20%. Mr. Haberman has also used this rate in his WACC calculations.°*

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Kaczmarek has only included tax in his cash flow projections from
his valuation date onwards (30 September 2014). He states that “profits from periods prior to
our valuation date are not taxed, as taxes will be owed on any sum awarded by the tribunal. To

tax past profits when calculating damages would risk subjecting Karkey to double taxation.”°”°

The Tribunal agrees with the principle that Karkey could suffer double taxation if a post-tax loss
is calculated and the eventual award was to be taxed. However, as pointed by Mr. Haberman,
Mr. Kaczmarek’s approach to dealing with this matter lacks evidential support. He has not

provided any evidence that Karkey would be taxed on any sum awarded by the Tribunal. The tax

treatment of damages awards differs between jurisdictions, are not necessarily taxed and, even

when they are, they may not be taxed at the same rate as a company’s income.

If Karkey were to be awarded an amount equivalent to its pre-tax profits, and then for whatever
reason did not have to pay tax on the award (or paid at a lower rate than it would have paid tax

on the profits), it would have been overcompensated.
The Tribunal also finds that an ex post approach is not appropriate in the present case.

In view of the above, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Haberman’s inclusion of an implied tax rate of
20% is reasonable, and Karkey’s loss should be calculated net of all taxes that Karkey would

have incurred — both in the historical and the future periods.

(c.2.6) Retrofitting of turbochargers

. According to Karkey, Mr. Haberman refuses to take into account the improvement that

retrofitting turbochargers (which was reasonably certain to occur for the Alican Bey and Kaya
Bey) would have represented for the generating capacity of those vessels. Prior to the planned
rehabilitation, Karkey expected the Alican Bey and the Kaya Bey to operate in Iraq at capacity
factors of 75% and 87%, respectively. Following the completion of the rehabilitation, however,
Karkey expected both vessels capacity factor to improve to 90%. As a result, the Powerships
would have been able to generate more electricity and more revenue. Of course, the benefit of
higher capacity factors comes with an associated capital expenditure requirement. Thus, Mr.
Kaczmarek’s model incorporates not only the benefits but also the costs of the planned
rehabilitation program. In contrast, Mr. Haberman assumes the rehabilitation program does not
proceed at all, and thus that the Powerships continue to operate at pre-rehabilitation capacity
factors. At the same time, however, Mr. Haberman does not remove the capital expenditure
associated with rehabilitation. Karkey concludes that Mr. Haberman incorrectly incorporates the

costs of the rehabilitation program, but not the benefits thereof.°”°

. Mr. Haberman, on the other hand, states that according to Mr. Kaczmarek a generator

Rehabilitation Programme was planned from January 2012. However, as explained in Mr.
Haberman’s Second Report, Mr. Kaczmarek does not explain where he gets this information
from and provides no evidence to substantiate the timing of the rehabilitation, or

contemporaneous budgets and plans. Neither does he provide adequate evidence of the cost of

rehabilitation.°””

. The Tribunal accepts the opinion of Mr. Haberman in this regard. Based on the evidence provided

at 30 March 2012, it is not possible to form a view as to whether Mr. Kaczmarek’s assumptions
around the rehabilitation program are appropriate. Accordingly, Mr. Haberman has correctly
assumed that the Kaya Bey and the Alican Bey would not be rehabilitated and have instead
assumed that electricity delivered under the Second Iraq Contract would be at a capacity of 74%
(of the Powerships’ maximum capacity) based on KPS 3 and KPS 4, and based his revenues

calculations on this capacity amount.?”*

(c.2.7) Lost profits shall be calculated until June 2015 or December 2015?

. Karkey initially claimed that the Kaya Bey would be ready to operate in June 2015, and later

claimed that the Kaya Bey would only be ready to operate in December 2015.

As submitted by Pakistan, the Tribunal finds that Karkey has failed to explain why its claim for
lost profits for the Kaya Bey has now extended beyond the original June 2015 date (i.e. the date
that Karkey first suggested would be the date the Kaya Bey would be returned to full operations)
to December 2015. That delay, based on Mr. Kaczmarek’s estimate, has resulted in a US$14

million increase in damages.

. As there is no evidence to support the suggestion that this delay was caused by the alleged breach

of the BIT, the Tribunal finds that Pakistan should not be held liable for further losses.

(c.2.8) Tribunal’s conclusion on the But For Scenario

856. Asa consequence of the above, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Haberman has correctly estimated the

cash flows for the Kaya Bey under the Hypothetical Scenario in the total of US$91.0 million

Haberman. As a consequence, the total of Karkey’s loss under the Hypothetical Scenario

amounts to US$98 million.

(c.3) The Actual Scenario

858. The Tribunal also finds that Mr. Haberman’s calculation of the Actual Scenario is the most

appropriate, as set forth below.

859. Mr. Haberman has adopted the same cash flow assumptions in his Actual Scenario as Mr.

Kaczmarek did in his Second Report, only with the following exceptions:

i. He has maintained Karkey’s original operating capacity projections, on the basis that

any delay after June 2015 is not Pakistan’s fault;

assumptions to 0.0608 US$per kWh up to 31 March 2012 and 0.0344 US$per kWh

thereafter:

iii. Mr. Haberman has updated his unit price assumptions in accordance with the revenue

actually generated.”*! To calculate this he has taken the actual revenue generated and
divided by the capacity delivered. This resulted in an effective unit price of 0.0696
USSper kWh up to 31 March 2012 and 0.0646 USSper kWh thereafter;?*

. Mr. Haberman has updated his transport cost assumption to include actual transport

costs of US$566,063.°3 He has divided the transport costs equally between the two

months’ transport to Dubai in May and June 2014 and January 2015;°**

He has updated his capacity assumptions to 80% throughout the period as opposed to

80% in winter and 76% in the summer months;

Mr. Haberman has excluded the rehabilitation costs. As explained in his First Report
(4 5.9), he was instructed that these amounts are not recoverable because Karkey has
failed to prove that the losses were caused by Pakistan, a point accepted by the

Tribunal; and

ii. Mr. Haberman has discounted these cash flows back to his valuation date at his

estimate of an appropriate WACC for the Iraq contract, being 17%.°5

According to Karkey, the Alican Bey is an operating asset that should be valued based on its
reasonably certain future cash flows. Pakistan’s argument that fair market value is equivalent to

replacement cost disregards the nature of Karkey’s business.™"!

Before the Hearing, Karkey claimed damages related to the Alican Bey of US$457.2 million,

consisting of:

- US$320 million for the alleged fair market value of the Alican Bey (described as the

sum of future cash flows as of 30 June 2015);°? and

 

- US$137 million for the alleged historical lost cash flows from 31 March 2015 up to 30
June 2015.8

866. The Tribunal notes that in Karkey’s closing statement on damages at the Hearing, Karkey

presented its revised loss related to the Alican Bey at US$445.7 million (pre-interest and as of 30

June 2015), as follows:?"4

 

Source: Kaczmarek, Second Expert Report, p.9

867. Karkey explained that the adjustment above is because Mr. Kaczmarek had initially calculated

some of the losses related to the Alican Bey on the basis of a fictional ten-year contract with Sri
Lanka and that now Karkey considers that the A/ican Bey would have gone to Iraq, which requires

an adjustment of US$11.5 million.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 251 of 310

On the other hand, Pakistan submits that if the Tribunal decides to award Karkey compensation

in relation to the Alican Bey, Karkey is in principle only entitled to the following:*°

Restitution of the Alican Bey;

- Ifthe Tribunal does not wish to grant restitution, the correct fair market value of the
Alican Bey, which is in fact the replacement cost of the Alican Bey of US$120 million;

and

Any lost profits until March 2018 when a new vessel will be operational.

According to Pakistan, the appropriate remedy in relation to the Kaya Bey would be restitution
together with any costs of repairs and legally recoverable profits. Although an injured party may
specify what form reparation for an internationally wrongful act should take, its preference is not
binding and the legal consequences of an internationally wrongful act are not for the injured party
to stipulate or define. The Tribunal may also order restitution by a given deadline and, in the

event of non-compliance, require monetary compensation of a specified amount.”

. Pakistan further submits that, if the Tribunal does not award restitution, it is relevant to the

Tribunal’s assessment of damages that Karkey does not seek restitution and is instead seeking

 

exaggerated compensation. Also, if the Tribunal finds that Karkey is due compensation for the
fair market value of the Alican Bey, then legal title to the Alican Bey should be transferred to

Pakistan. This was proposed in Pakistan’s Rejoinder and was agreed by Karkey at the Hearing."*

. For the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal finds that reparation of the damages suffered as a

consequence of the detention of the Alican Bey shall be equivalent to (a) the Alican Bey’s fair
market value based on its replacement cost, plus (b) the lost profits Karkey would have earned

with the Alican Bey until a new replacement vessel could be operational.

a. The Fair Market Value of the Alican Bey

The Tribunal first notes that according to Article 36 of the ILC Articles:

°4 Pakistan’s Post-Hearing Brief, {] 380.

°48 Pakistan’s Post-Hearing Brief, {| 382.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 252 of 310

(1) The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to

compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good
by restitution.

(2) The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of

profits insofar as it is established?”

The Commentary on Article 36 of the ILC Articles also provides that compensation reflecting
the capital value of property taken as the result of an internationally wrongful act is generally
assessed on the basis of the “fair market value” of the property lost. However, the method used
to assess “fair market value” depends on the nature of the asset concerned. When the property in
question is freely traded on an open market, value is more readily determined. In such cases, the
choice and application of asset-based valuation methods based on market data and the physical

properties of the assets is relatively unproblematic.”°

. According to Karkey, the fair market value of the Alican Bey is determined by reference to future

lost cash flows, because the A/ican Bey is not an asset but an enterprise and it is therefore due

the “enterprise value” of the vessel.

. The Tribunal notes that, as stated by Mr. Waller (Pakistan’s industry expert), although Mr. Waller

is not aware of any similar vessel to the Alican Bey being available on the open market, there is
nothing unique about the technology or plant used in the Alican Bey. There is no patented

technology or any other aspect which would make its replacement problematic.

. Even Mr. Nickerson (Karkey’s industry expert) has stated that he would determine the value of

the Alican Bey on the basis of its replacement cost. Mr. Nickerson has estimated the approximate
value of the Alican Bey to be US$115-120 million.**!' It is worth noting that Mr. Waller
(Pakistan’s industry expert) also agreed with Mr. Nickerson’s analysis that the replacement cost

of the Alican Bey is approximately US$115-120 million.

77. The Tribunal finds that the amount claimed by Karkey in relation to the Alican Bey is exaggerated

and does not correspond to what a willing buyer would pay for it. Indeed, the total amount
requested by Karkey for compensation regarding the detention of the Alican Bey (i.e. US$445

million) would be enough to purchase three new identical Vessels and potentially generate three

 

 

times the revenue of the Alican Bey. Mr. Kaczmarek’s estimate of the fair market value of the
Alican Bey is not acceptable. It represents more than the amount paid by APR for the entire power
rental business of GE, which included assets with a total generating capacity that was five times
the generating capacity of the Alican Bey.™*

In view of the above, the Tribunal finds that the fair market value of the Alican Bey is its

replacement cost evaluated at US$120 million.

As a consequence, Pakistan shall pay Karkey the amount of US$120 million and Karkey shall
transfer its legal title to the Alican Bey to Pakistan within 60 days from the date of payment of

this amount of US$120 million.°*

b. Detention Costs: Lost Profits until Replacement

The Tribunal finds that Karkey is also entitled to the lost profits it was prevented from earning

as a consequence of the detention of the Alican Bey by Pakistan.

However, such lost profits are not to be calculated from the detention date (30 March 2012) until
the end of its operating life (i.e. 2031) as claimed by Karkey. This is because, as the Alican Bey
can be replaced, the date when replacement is possible should be the limit to calculate Karkey’s
lost cash flows. Therefore, the lost profits in the period up to the time when the Alican Bey can
be replaced, assessed on a DCF basis, is the most appropriate manner of calculating such lost

profits.

In this regard, the Tribunal approves and adheres to Mr. Haberman’s DCF calculation of the lost

profits of the Alican Bey. Mr. Haberman models the cash flows that the Alican Bey might have

 

generated under new contracts after termination of the 2009 RSC, using an ex ante approach,

which has already been addressed by the Tribunal under Section V(H)(3) above.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 254 of 310

. Mr. Waller (Pakistan’s industry expert) has estimated that it would take approximately 18 months

for a replacement vessel of a similar specification to the Alican Bey to be commissioned.°*° Based
on this information, Mr. Haberman has considered in his DCF calculation that Karkey could
reasonably commission a replacement vessel for the A/ican Bey within 18 months from the date
of this award. He then estimated this award would be rendered in August 2016, and calculated

that the replacement of the Alican Bey could to be done by March 2018.

The Tribunal has difficulties understanding why it would take 18 months from the date of this
award for Karkey to commission a replacement vessel for the Alican Bey. Since the award is
rendered in August 2017, the Tribunal has no doubt that the replacement of the Alican Bey might
take place by March 2018, as contemplated by Mr. Haberman. Consequently, the Tribunal will
retain the date of March 2018 as the replacement date of the Alican Bey which it finds to be

realistic.

The Tribunal accepts Mr. Haberman’s Scenarios B and C calculations, as summarized below:?”

US$million Scenario A Scenario B Scenario C
Date from 12 April 2014 31 March 2012 1 August 2016

In view of the above, Karkey is entitled to the total amount of Scenarios B plus C (i.e. from 31

million.

(5) Other Detained Vessels: Enis Bey and the Iraq
a. Enis Bey

Karkey requests the replacement cost of the Enis Bey, the fuel tanker that served as a support
vessel in Pakistan and was also detained there, and which is assumed to be lost. Mr. Kaczmarek

estimated the replacement cost of the Enis Bey to be US$4 million.°**

Mr. Haberman, Pakistan’s expert, calculated that the Claimant’s damages for to the loss of the

Enis Bey are within the range of US$2-3 million, as per Mr. Waller’s estimation.”

The Tribunal notes that Karkey has stated in its Reply that the Enis Bey is actually owed by
Karpak, not by Karkey.*® As stated under Section V(H)(2)(b.1.1) above, the Tribunal finds that
Karkey is not entitled as a matter of international law to make a direct claim in relation to
Karpak’s rights, as Karkey does not have standing to assert claims based on the host-State’s

treatment of the contracts and assets of the company in which it holds shares.
In view of the above, Karkey’s claims in relation to the Enis Bey is dismissed.

b. Iraq

Karkey submits that the loss related to the /raq, the other support vessel retained in Pakistan,
should be calculated taking into account that the Jraq was to be converted into a power barge in
2014 (as the hull for KPS 2) according to Karkey’s fleet expansion plans. Therefore, the loss of
the Jraq is reflected separately under Karkey’s claim related to the “Delay to Karkey’s Vessels

Construction Program.” °°!

In order to assess the losses related to the Jrag, Mr. Kaczmarek (Karkey’s expert) has construed
a But For Scenario in which the /rag is converted to a Powership and commences operations

under a new contract in March 2014. In actuality (Actual Scenario), the construction program is

delayed, and the /rag does not begin operating under a new contract until January 2017. The

difference between these two scenarios yields lost cash flows of US$113 million.°

Mr. Haberman and Pakistan, on the other hand, submit that Mr. Kaczmarek’s assumptions for
calculating the loss related to the /rag are flawed. According to Mr. Haberman, the appropriate
approach is to value the Jraq at its replacement cost. Based on Mr. Waller’s expert evidence,

Mr. Haberman value the Jraq at US$2 million.°™

As pointed by Mr. Haberman, the Tribunal notes that Karkey has provided no evidence that it
planned to turn the /rag into a Power barge, prior to the date of expropriation. To support this
claim, Mr. Kaczmarek relies on an undated presentation to the African Development Bank, which
categorizes KPS 2 as “Powerships Under Construction”.°® As the Iraq would have been in
Pakistan at the date of this presentation, /raq could not have formed the base of a vessel already
under construction. Moreover, Mr. Kaczmarek has provided no explanation as to why the Jraq
would no longer be required as a support vessel and therefore would not need to be replaced if it
were to be converted into KPS 2. Even if the /raq were to form the basis of KPS 2, Karkey
appears to have made no attempt to mitigate its loss through procuring an additional vessel at a

cost of approximately US$2 million.

Moreover, Mr. Kaczmarek accepted during the Hearing that no willing buyer would pay nearly

US$120 million for a US$2 million barge.?

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the appropriate manner of valuating the Jrag it
to consider its replacement cost. Mr. Waller’s and Mr. Haberman’s valuation of the Jrag at US$2
million seems reasonable. Accordingly, Pakistan shall pay Karkey the amount of US$2 million
for Karkey’s losses related to the detention of the /raq in Pakistan and Karkey shall transfer its
legal title to the Jrag to Pakistan within 60 days from the date of payment of this amount of US$2

million.

(6) Delay Damages

. Karkey’s delay damages claim comprises three categories, namely alleged delays to its (a)

Construction Program, (b) Rehabilitation Program, and (c) Geothermal Project, which are

analysed below in turn.

a. The Construction Program

(a.l) Has Pakistan’s breach to the BIT caused delays to the Claimant’s Projects due to

financial constraints?

According to Karkey, as a result of the Measures”®’ and the financial difficulties that they created,
Karkey has suffered damages from delays in the construction and deployment of six other
Powerships in its fleet and planned fleet. Of these vessels, two Powerships have been deployed
to Lebanon, but were delayed from their originally planned timetable. The remaining four vessels

have not been deployed and are currently in different stages of construction and planning.°®*

Pakistan, on the other hand, submits that Karkey has failed to show that but for Pakistan’s alleged
breaches of the BIT it would not have suffered these losses. Karkey has also failed to show that

such damage is not too remote and speculative.

Pakistan submits that Karkey’s claim is based on its contention that Pakistan’s alleged breaches
resulted in the financing restrictions on Karkey that then caused delay to the projects it claims it
was planning. Karkey does not get anywhere close to proving these financing restrictions. Karkey
has produced only four documents in order to establish a causal link between Pakistan’s detention

of the Vessels and the impact on Karkey’s planned projects, but they do not support Karkey’s

injuries suffered by Karkey were caused by the internationally wrongful acts of Pakistan (the ‘Measures’), which
include, inter alia: Lakhra’s failure to comply with the terms of the Contract (including its obligations to pay Rental
Service Fees, to cover confirmation charges, to pay for fuel payments, and to pay termination charges and expenses
upon termination of the Contract on 30 March 2012); Pakistan's failure to honor the Sovereign Guarantee; the

committed by the Supreme Court in purporting to invalidate the Contract on the basis of nothing more than a
presumption of wrongdoing, which was contrary to the evidence before the Court; NAB’s gation of Karkey,
its arbitrary demands for payment from Karkey, and its commencement of criminal proceedings against Karkey;
Pakistan's detention and expropriation of Karkey , Pakistan’s harassment of Karkey and its personnel,
including through actions by Lakhra, NAB, and the Sindh High Court in connection with proceedings before the
latter court.”

claim. These are the two Yapip Kredi term sheets and two Board resolutions by Karkey

concerning decisions not to proceed with certain hydroelectric projects. According to Pakistan:°””

- These term sheets”?!

merely show that more onerous terms were imposed between
two dates. They do not show that they were imposed as a result of the detention of
the Vessels and, in fact, the second term sheet states that the amendments were

negotiated at Karkey’s request;?”” and

- The board minutes” refer to projects that do not form part of Karkey’s consequential
losses. Moreover, the board minutes post-date Pakistan’s alleged breaches by a year
and were even produced after Karkey’s claim against Pakistan was registered with
the ICSID. Importantly, they do not mention why the steps being proposed by the

board are being taken.

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Haberman (Pakistan’s expert) has accepted during the Hearing that
the loss of revenue under the RSC Contract had a substantial impact on Karkey’s operating
income, and agreed that such impact was approximately 60% of Karkey’s operating income.”
Mr. Haberman has also accepted that for a company with Karkey’s business model, it could
reasonably be expected that operating income would be reinvested into growth, such as ship-

building.*”>

The Tribunal finds reasonable the account given at the Hearing by Mr. Colak, Karkey’s Chief
Financial Officer. He detailed the negative impact of Pakistan’s breaches of the BIT on Karkey’s
relationship with its lenders, and explained that the drastic loss of assets via the detention of the
Vessels, as well as its loss of revenue under the RSC, severely impacted its ability to provide

security for financing:

At the time, the Pakistani assets was about one-third of our total assets, and the cash

flow kept coming from Pakistan was almost half of our revenues, and the amount the

Tribunal is satisfied with the example provided by Karkey in comparing the two Yapip Kredi
term sheets, one pre-dating the expropriation of the Contract and one post-dating the

expropriation.

The first term sheet, dated 11 May 2011, allowed Karkey to invest up to US$115 million annually
to construct up to two Powerships that were not under contract plus an unlimited amount on

Powerships under contract.°””

The second term sheet, dated 2 January 2013 (i.e. after expropriation and detention of the Vessels
by Pakistan), was from the same bank and had more limited financing conditions.°’* It is
reasonable to consider, as alleged by Karkey, that these limited conditions forbade Karkey from
pursuing any investment other than completion of a single Powership as alleged by Karkey,
which at that time was under the binding contract with the government of Lebanon.”” Such terms
also required extensive personal guarantees and mortgages on all assets and properties of Karkey

and its shareholders.”*°

It is also worth noting that since the release of the Kaya Bey, Karkey has been able to salvage
some of its financing relationships and secure additional financing. As put by Mr. Colak, “the
restrictions were imposed because of the increased risk from Pakistan’s detention of the Vessels,
and now have been relaxed somewhat because the Kaya Bey has been released.”°*! The Tribunal
is satisfied that the causal link described by Mr. Colak is plausible. Apart from release of the
Kaya Bey, the other criteria material to the lender’s financing decisions remained constant during

this period. The only relevant change was the partial release of Karkey’s assets by Pakistan.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 260 of 310

The Tribunal concludes that Pakistan’s breach of the BIT did have an impact on Karkey’s

projects due to the financial constraints it caused on Karkey.
(a.2) Damages calculation

Mr. Kaczmarek’s Report calculates the damages caused by the delays to the construction of the
six delayed Karkey’s Powerships (i.e. KPS 2, KPS 7, KPS 9, KPS 10, KPS 11 and KPS 12) in
four steps. First, it projects the cash flows that would have been generated by each vessel in the
But For Scenario. Second, it projects the cash flows generated by each vessel under the Actual
Scenario. Third, it brings each set of cash flows to present value as of a valuation date by
discounting future cash flows and bringing forward historical cash flows at Karkey’s WACC.
Fourth, it subtracts the value concluded under the Actual Scenario from the value concluded in
the But For Scenario. The difference is equal to the loss suffered by Karkey as a result of delays
in its vessel construction program, which amount to a decrease in value of the vessels of
US$325.4 million.°*? Mr. Kaczmarek, in his Second Report, updated the amount of the damages
allegedly suffered by Karkey due to the delay in the Construction Program to US$428.2 million
(he has considered that the construction and deployment timelines for KPS 10, KPS 11, KPS 12
and KPS 2 have slipped further, resulting in additional delay damages).°*°

Karkey further submits that at the Hearing, Pakistan complained that Mr. Kaczmarek had not
modelled Karkey’s construction program delay damages on the basis of the contracts under
which the vessels ultimately commenced operating.”™ In response to that complaint, and in light
of Mr. Haberman’s concession in his Second Report that “prima facie there may have been a

period of approximately 15 months when no new vessels could be constructed,’ Karkey has

 

prepared the sensitivity analysis shown in the table below. That analysis (which excludes KPS
2°85) demonstrates the conservative nature of Karkey’s construction delay claim. Excluding KPS
2, that claim is US$309,000,000 (see the “Original Claim” column). Recalculated on the bases

that Pakistan suggests (or that its expert concedes) may be reasonable (i.e., using actual contracts,

delay for each vessel (which, as noted, Pakistan’s expert concedes is the possible period of delay),

again using the terms of the contract under which it eventually commenced operations.”

°88 For commencement dates, see NAV-094; C-717; C-718. As KPS 12 has not yet commenced operations, the
“New Country” contract is used. Earnings are calculated on the basis of monthly earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), a common proxy for cash flow. The assumptions used (installed
capacity, capacity factors, and projected operating costs) are specific to each ship, and are drawn from Kaczmarek,
Second Expert Report, Appendix 4.2. This calculation of damages differs from the calculation of loss that Mr.
Kaczmarek originally undertook for the construction delay claim, which had calculated the reduction in value of the
vessels based on lost profits. EBITDA differs in that it does not take into account, for example, capital expenditure,
taxation on future revenue, or interest on historical cash flows. However, although it is not an “apples to apples”
comparison (since the premise for the original claim was based on lost profits), EBIDTA can validly be used as a
reasonableness test.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 262 of 310

Pakistan submits that Karkey, in its closing statement, downwardly revised its claim for the
Powership Construction Programme by US$116 million, as a result of removing the clearly
untenable claim for damages for delay to the conversion of the Jrag (KPS 2), based as it was on
an absurd valuation of that deck barge — with an accepted replacement cost of US$2 million — as

being US$119 million.°*! This retreat followed Mr. Kaczmarek’s cross-examination in which he

 

accepted that no willing buyer would pay nearly US$120 million for a US$2 million barge.”

According to Pakistan, even with this adjustment, the claim for the alleged delays to the
Powership Construction Programme is premised on the same flawed DCF calculations in respect

of the various Vessels that have resulted in an absurd valuation for the Alican Bey.

Mr. Haberman, Pakistan’s damages expert, states that the maximum loss that could be
attributable to Pakistan under this heading is US$11.5 million.°* A summary of his conclusions

is set forth in the table below:”>

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 263 of 310

The Tribunal addresses below each of the reductions made by Mr. Haberman to Mr. Kaczmarek’s

calculation.

(a.2.1) Substitution of the Libya contract for the Lebanon contract for KPS 7

On the basis that the contract with Libya does not exist, and KPS 7 has since been deployed to
Lebanon, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Haberman has correctly assumed that in the But For

Scenario KPS 7 would have been deployed to Lebanon along with KPS 9, in place of KPS 11.9

The Libya “contract” utilized by Mr. Kaczmarek has terms that are distinctly more favourable
than those of the Lebanon contract, such as unit price of 8.5 c/KWh, rather than 5.95 c/KWh in
the Lebanon contract.””?

If the Lebanon contract is substituted in place of the Libya contract in Mr. Kaczmarek’s
calculations, this reduces the loss suffered in relation to the KPS 7 to US$8,071,989, an 88%

decrease in the loss calculated by Mr. Kaczmarek in relation to KPS 7.!°°

The Tribunal accepts Mr. Haberman’s conclusions above with respect to the substitution of the
Libya contract for the Lebanon contract for KPS 7, thus reducing Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculations

in the amount of US$58,637,871, as indicated in the table under paragraph 914 above.

(a.2.2) Removal of the loss calculated related to the New Country contract in KPS 7 and 9

Mr. Kaczmarek has designed a hybrid “New Country” contract which, as pointed by Mr.
Haberman, is based on the average or median of the terms included in Karkey’s existing

contracts, along with “letter of intent” and “pending offers” made by Karkey.

However, the Tribunal finds that the inclusion of the “letters of intent” and “pending offers” in
this analysis may be misleading, as these are offers made by Karkey which have not materialized
into contracts. The reason why these offers have not been converted into contracts are not known

— it could be that the terms proposed by Karkey were unrealistic — and so the inclusion of these

°8 Haberman, Second Expert Report, § 9.42. Mr. Haberman notes that figure 19 of Kaczmarek, First Expert Report
shows KPS 11 as being in Karkey’s “construction pipeline” at 20 March 2012. Therefore, he has assumed that KPS
7, as it is not included in this pipeline, would have been completed prior to this date, and so would have been used
in preference to KPS 11.

options may skew the terms of Mr. Kaczmarek’s New Country contract. As a consequence, the
assumption that Karkey would have been able to obtain sufficient contracts to enable all of its
Powerships to operate at capacity once completed appears to be optimistic given the small
number of contracts obtained by Karkey over the period since it stated in the Powership

market.!°0!

The Tribunal accepts Mr. Haberman’s conclusions above with respect to the removal of loss
calculated as relating to KPS 7 and 9 regarding the New Country contract, thus reducing Mr.
Kaczmarek’s calculations in the amount of US$17,636,934, as indicated in the table under

paragraph 914 above.

(a.2.3) Removal of loss calculated as relating to KPS 2, 10, 11 and 12

The Tribunal first notes that Mr. Kaczmarek has accepted deleting the losses related to KPS 2.

With respect to KPS 10 and 11, as pointed by Mr. Haberman, !°°? a new contract has been signed
to provide electricity to Ghana.! It is likely that KPS 10 and 11 will be deployed there. On the
basis of this new contract, therefore, any loss that has been calculated by Mr. Kaczmarek in
relation to KPS 10 and 11 as part of the claim for consequential loss should not be claimable, as

it does not reflect the scenario that exists.

With respect to KPS 12, the Tribunal finds that Karkey/Mr. Kaczmarek have not demonstrated
that a contract would have existed for this vessel to be deployed once construction had been
completed and the projected cash flows is based on a theoretical New Country contract. Without
a specific contract to fulfil, any loss incurred in relation to KPS 12 is speculative. Therefore, the
Tribunal finds that no consequential loss can be said to have been incurred by Karkey in relation

to KPS 12.

The Tribunal accepts Mr. Haberman’s conclusions above with respect to the removal of loss
calculated as relating to KPS 2, 10, 11 and 12, thus reducing Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculations in

the amount of US$340,383,969, as indicated in the table under paragraph 914 above.

(a.2.4) Tribunal’s Conclusion

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Karkey’s losses related to the Delay of the
Construction Program totals US$11,497,965, as summarized by Mr. Haberman in the table set

out at paragraph 914 above.

b. The Rehabilitation Program

Karkey claims US$44.5 million related to its delayed Rehabilitation Program.

According to Karkey, in January 2012 it established a program to rehabilitate all of the Wartsila
12V generators to the vessels KPS 3 (Dogan Bey) and KPS 4 (Rauf Bey) which were employed
in Iraq (“Rehabilitation Program”). In 2011 two Wartsila 12V generators of the Rauf Bey had
been retrofitted with ABB Turbochargers resulting in an approximate 25 percent increase in
capacity relative to the old engines. This unexpected boost in efficiency prompted Karkey to

establish a program to similarly retrofit all the other generators used by Karkey in Iraq.!°4

1005

Karkey submits that, as a result of the Measures,'”” Karkey had difficulties obtaining financing

to execute the Rehabilitation Program and was compelled to suspend it. Mr. Kaczmarek’s Report
calculates Karkey’s losses due to the inability to implement the Rehabilitation Program by
examining hourly reports showing capacity of KPS 3’s and KPS 4’s generators. In particular,
Mr. Kaczmarek compares the average monthly capacity of the rehabilitated engines with the
average monthly capacity of generators awaiting the rehabilitation. Mr. Kaczmarek’s Report
considered that the eligible generators of KPS 3 and KPS 4 “would have increased capacity
factors in Iraq from 75 percent each to 80 percent for KPS 3 and 90 percent for KPS 4.” That
additional capacity in each Powership would have provided additional electricity demanded by

Iraq and consistent with the Iraqi contracts. The difference between the actual production

1005 By way of reminder, Karkey defined “Measures” at paragraph 610 of its Updated Memorial as follows: “(...] the
injuries suffered by Karkey were caused by the internationally wrongful acts of Pakistan (the ‘Measures’), which
include, inter alia: Lakhra’s failure to comply with the terms of the Contract (including its obligations to pay Rental

upon termination of the Contract on 30 March 2012). Pakistan's failure to honor the Sovereign Guarantee; the
Supreme Court's arbitrary and unfounded presumption that Karkey participated in corruption; the denial of justice
committed by the Supreme Court in purporting to invalidate the Contract on the basis of nothing more than a
presumption of wrongdoing, which was contrary to the evidence before the Court; NAB’s investigation of Karkey,
its arbitrary demands for payment from Karkey, and its commencement of criminal proceedings against Karkey;
Pakistan's detention and expropriation of Karkey’s , Pakistan’s harassment of Karkey and its personnel,
including through actions by Lakhra, NAB, and the Sindh High Court in connection with proceedings before the
latter court.”

multiplied by the hours of operations, and the production if the two vessels had been retrofitted
multiplied by the same number of hours, equals the lost production. This figure, multiplied by
the prevailing contractual rates each year is equal to the lost incremental revenue related to the

delayed Rehabilitation Program, which as of January 2014 totalled US$44.5 million.'0°°

Pakistan submits that there is no evidence that it was Karkey’s intention to rely on revenue from
the Vessels in Pakistan to fund its Rehabilitation Program, or that this program was suspended
as a result of the alleged breaches of the BIT, as also alleged by Mr. Karadeniz in his witness
statement.'°’ There is also no evidence that Karkey was unable to obtain alternative
financing. !°°8

Mr. Haberman states that he set out the evidence that he would expect to be provided in order for
the claim for interruption to the Rehabilitation Program to be substantiated. He then submits that

the following documents are missing:!°°

Contemporaneous financial plans or forecasts in support of the Rehabilitation Program;

- Evidence that Karkey intended to rely on revenue from the Powerships in Pakistan to

finance the Rehabilitation Program; or

Evidence demonstrating that Karkey was unable to mitigate its losses by finding

alternative financing for the Rehabilitation Program.

As mentioned under Section V(H)(6)(a.1) above with respect to delays to the Construction
Program, the Tribunal finds reasonable the account given at the Hearing by Mr. Colak, Karkey’s
Chief Financial Officer, detailing the negative impact of Pakistan’s breaches of the BIT on
Karkey’s relationship with its lenders and explaining that the drastic loss of assets via the
detention of the Vessels, as well as its loss of revenue under the RSC severely impacted its ability
to provide security for financing. Therefore, the Tribunal is satisfied that, provided Karkey
proves that it has suffered the losses arising out of the interruption of its Rehabilitation Program,

Pakistan should compensate them.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 267 of 310

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculation measures the incremental revenue lost due
to the delay in the Rehabilitation Program over the period of July 2012 to December 2013. He

relies on two estimates:
- The lost electricity production caused by the delay; and

- Arate (unit price) that would be applied to this lost electricity production to give the

revenue lost.

Mr. Kaczmarek estimates lost electricity production based on the following formula:!°'°

Electricity Production (MW) x Capacity Factor (%) x Contract Availability (90%) x
Hours in a year (8,760 hours)

Mr. Kaczmarek applies a rate (in US$ per kWh) to the difference between Production with
Rehabilitation Program and Benchmark Production to come to his assessment of lost revenue to

Karkey, as follows:!°!!

- US$44.5 million under the assumption that Karkey owns 100% of KPS 3 and KPS 4;

and
- US$8.9 million under the assumption that Karkey owns 20% of KPS 3 and KPS 4.

However, Mr. Kaczmarek provides two lost revenue values for the Rehabilitation Program as a
result of the change in ownership of KPS 3 and KPS 4 during the period under review.!°!? Mr.
Kaczmarek states that, prior to April 2013, 80% of the profits from KPS 3 and KPS 4 were paid
to_a subsidiary (“KPS MI”) that was not affiliated to Karkey.'°'? From April 2013, however,
there was a change in ownership of KPS 3 and KPS 4 to a 100% owned subsidiary of Karkey.'°!*
As decided by the Tribunal under Section V(H)(2)(b.1.1) above, when the entity suffering direct
loss is not Karkey - whether it be KPS MI up to April 2013 or Karpowership Iraq thereafter -

c. The Geothermal Project in Turkey

Karkey claims US$178,400,164 in relation to its delayed Geothermal Project in Turkey.

According to Karkey, on 25 November 2008, Karkey won a tender for operational rights to access
the largest auctioned geothermal reserves in Turkey. On 24 December 2008, Karkey signed an
agreement with Turkey’s Mineral Resources and Exploration Administration (“MTA”) for
subterranean rights until April 2039 (“Geothermal Project”). Karkey received financing from
several banks, and used the funds to finance the initial exploration and drilling. As of early 2012,
Karkey projected achieving completion of development of the reserves by 2015 (“Original
Projection”). !°'5

Karkey submits that, as a result of the Measures, supplier negotiations were put on hold and the
Geothermal Project delayed.!°!® Due to the delays caused by the Measures, a new project plan,
approved by the remaining banks, was prepared in January 2013, which projected completion of
the development of the project by 2020 (“Revised Projection”).'°!” Since the fourth quarter of
2013, the Geothermal Project has been proceeding in accordance with the Revised Projection.'°'*
However, it was not until June 2014, following the release of the Kaya Bey, that Karkey finally

was able to secure bank financing to continue the project.'°!

Pakistan counters that there is no evidence showing that the actions taken by Pakistan caused
negotiations with suppliers to be put on hold and/or that the delay to the Geothermal Project
occurred as a result of Pakistan’s actions, as alleged by Mr. Karadeniz in his written evidence.'°
The Tribunal reiterates its finding that Pakistan’s expropriation of Karkey’s contract rights in the
RSC Contract and the detention of the Vessels had a negative impact on Karkey’s relationship

with its lenders, and caused drastic loss of assets via the detention of the Vessels. However, the

Claimant has failed to demonstrate that the financial difficulties suffered by Karkey as a
consequence of Pakistan’s breaches of the BIT was the cause of the delays to the Geothermal

Project in Turkey.

The Tribunal also notes that, as pointed by Mr. Haberman, Mr. Kaczmarek’s approach to valuing
the alleged consequential loss from delays to the Geothermal Project is not only unsubstantiated,
but also technically flawed and inconsistent with source information disclosed in these

proceedings. '!

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses Karkey’s claim for alleged damages arising of

delays in its Geothermal Project in Turkey.

(7) Costs increases

Karkey submits that, as a result of the Measures, the cost increases incurred by Karkey include
(a) increased insurance costs, (b) increased costs at the shipyard, and (c) penalties that Karkey

had to pay to Lebanon.!°”? These claims are analysed below in turn.

a. Increase in Karkey’s insurance premium
Karkey claims US$7.8 million as a result of increased insurance costs allegedly caused by

Pakistan’s Measures. !°>

According to Karkey, in 2011, Karkey was covered by an insurance program for the primary
risks to its six operating vessels (including the Jrag — KPS 2). The policies included: (1) General
Coverage — for marine and operational risks, and (2) Protection and Indemnity War Risks and

Strikes (“War Risks”).!04

Karkey submits that, subsequent to the Measures, the War Risks insurer cancelled the policy for
the year 2012/2013 as of the end of March 2012. Although Karkey secured a new policy on 31
August 2012, the new policy was more expensive — representing, as explained in Mr.

Kaczmarek’s Report, a US$1.6 million annual increase or a 50% increase over the policy that

was in effect before March 2012, and the cancellation of a no claims bonus of 25% for Karkey,
which totalled an additional increase in costs to Karkey of US$543,668 a year. In addition, under
the new policy Karkey’s assets enjoy significant less coverage — for example, Karkey now bears
the risk of detainment, as it was not possible for Karkey to replace the War Risk coverage for the
vessels in Iraq and Pakistan.'°?>

Mr. Kaczmarek’s Second Report explains that the losses from increased costs of insurance of
US$5,140.854 related to KPS | through KPS 6 and the losses from increased cost of insurance
of US$2,611,616 for KPS 7 and KPS 9 total US$7.8 million.'”°

 

According to Pakistan, it was Karkey’s own behaviour, namely its failure to disclose material
facts relating to the Supreme Court proceedings and a past corruption conviction, that caused the
insurers to cancel the War Risks Policy.'°?? Pakistan submits that Karkey’s acceptance in its
Reply that it did not disclose these material facts and risks is material. It means that the only real
issue is whether Karkey was under a duty to disclose those facts, as the insurers clearly

considered Karkey to be.'°7

The Tribunal notes that by letter of 20 August 2012 from Talbot,!©”° the lead underwriter on the
Marine Risks Insurance Policy issued to Karkey for 2012/2013 for vessels KPS 1 to 6, Talbot
highlighted that by the time it “scratched the slip for the 2012/2013 Policy on 5 April 2012”,
Karkey was aware that:!3°

- The Pakistan Supreme Court had rendered the Judgment declaring the 2009 RSC to be

void ab initio;

- Karkey which was in dispute with Lakhra, had served a series of notices of default and

had terminated the 2009 RSC on 30 March 2012;

- The NAB had summoned Karkey’s local representative to appear before it as part of a

corruption inquiry; and

- The NAB had directed a Caution Notice to be served on Karkey’s vessels moored off

Karachi.
The letter further provides that:

these matters were self-evidently material to a Marine War underwriter

providing cover in respect of political risks [...] However, none of these

matters were disclosed to Talbot prior to inception of the 2012/2013 Policy

[...] Had there been full disclosure and a fair presentation of the risk, the

Insurers would not have written the 2012/2013 Policy in relation to the

Pakistan Vessels at all or, alternatively, on the terms on which they did write

it. Consequently, in light of the non-disclosures set out above, the Insurers

hereby inform your clients that they are avoiding the cover under the

2012/2013 Policy in respect of the Pakistan Vessels.'°*!
The Tribunal notes that, although Karkey had the duty to disclose such issues, the fact remains
that these issues occurred and were the reason of the insurers’ decision. The Tribunal finds that
Pakistan’s actions (i.e. expropriation of Karkey’s contractual rights and detention of the vessels)

were the reason why the insurance policy was cancelled in the first place.

As a consequence, Pakistan is liable to pay Karkey the increased insurance costs it incurred as a

result of Pakistan’s breach of the BIT.

However, the calculation presented by Mr. Kaczmarek shall be adjusted for the reasons pointed

out by Mr. Haberman and summarized below.

Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculation is based on a comparison of the terms of insurance offered for KPS
1 to KPS 6 under an insurance policy from Marsh Limited for the period of 8 April 2011 to 7
April 2012 (the “April 2011 policy”) and later policies for these and other vessels. There are
three elements to Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculation that were criticized by Mr. Haberman and are
analysed below in turn, namely (i) the additional insurance cost for KPS 1 to KPS 6 and the Enis
Bey after April 2012: (ii) the loss of Karkey’s no claims bonus; and (iii) the additional insurance

cost for KPS 7 and KPS 9.

(a.i) The additional insurance cost for KPS 1 to KPS 6 and the Enis Bey after April 2012

Mr. Kaczmarek compares the annual insurance premium under the April 2011 policy to the
weighted average of the terms offered on three insurance policies covering the same vessels for
periods after 31 August 2012. The insurance policies for the period post 31 August 2012 provides
cover for a lower total sum insured, so Mr. Kaczmarek calculates the premium as a percentage
of the (lower) sum insured and then applies that percentage to the higher sum insured under the
April 2011 policy. The difference between the two provides Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculation of the
annual loss, which he prorates to calculate a loss for the period of 1 September 2012 through 30

June 2015 in his Second Report.!°?

The Tribunal notes that, although Mr. Haberman states that he is not able to verify the calculation
made by Mr. Kaczmarek in this regard, he considers that the approach adopted by Mr. Kaczmarek

appears to be reasonable.

Mr. Haberman, however, notes that Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculations include figures for KPS 21
(Enis Bey). That vessel is not insured under the policies referenced in Mr. Kaczmarek’s Second
Report, and the source of Mr. Kaczmarek’s figures for the Enis Bey are unknown.!°> The

Tribunal finds that the figures related to KPS 21 should not be included in this calculation.

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal retains as a basis for calculation Mr. Kaczmarek’s
calculation of the increased costs for KPS 1 to KPS 6 (i.e. US$5,140,854!°*). However, this
figure includes the Enis Bey and the “no claims bonus”, to which Karkey is not entitled, and
should consequently be reduced to US$4,599,786.'*> The reasons for the exclusion of the “no

claims bonus” is set forth below.

(a.ii) No Claims Bonus

. Mr. Kaczmarek includes in his calculation a no claims bonus of US$543,668 that he states
Karkey lost as a result of his cancellation of the April 2011 policy (NAV-168) at 25% of the

premium on that policy.!°°°

. As noted by Mr. Haberman, page 3 of the policy!”

gives the no claims bonus as 22.5% and not
25%. Also, there is no evidence to suggest that this bonus was lost. The letter cancelling the
policy states that no premium payment had been received from Karkey and the replacement

policy from August 2012!°5§ provides for the same 22.5% no claims bonus.

. Based on the above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to establish that Karkey has
suffered any loss related to the no claim bonus and any amount claimed in this regard is

dismissed.
(a.iii) Increased costs for KPS 7 and KPS 9

. Mr. Kaczmarek estimates additional insurance costs in respect of KPS 7 and KPS 9 of

US$2,611,616.

. However, the Tribunal notes that the insurance contracts with respect to KPS 7 and KPS 9,
submitted as NAV-166 and NAV-167, list that the insured parties in this regard are Karpower
International B.V. and its subsidiary Karpowership Company Limited. As the Tribunal has
decided above, Karkey does not have standing to make claims in this arbitration on behalf of its

subsidiaries.

. In view of the above, the Claimant’s claim for the additional insurance costs in respect of KPS 7

and KPS 9 is dismissed.

(a.iv) Tribunal’s conclusion on increased insurance costs

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal is satisfied with Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculation of the

increased costs for KPS 1 to KPS 6, but as reduced to a total of US$4,599,786.!°

b. Increase in Shipping Yard Costs
According to Karkey, on 5 January 2012, Karpowership, a wholly owned subsidiary of Karkey,
entered into an agreement with SEDEF for the repair and conversion into floating power plants
of KPS 7, 9, 10 and 11.'° Karkey submits that rather than converting the vessels simultaneously
as planned in accordance with such agreement, SEDEF only agreed to complete the conversion
of KPS 7 and KPS 9, and halted the of KPS 10 and KPS 11. In addition, works on KPS 7 and

KPS 9 were delayed, as a result of Karkey’s financing difficulties caused by the Measures.!°*!

Karkey sustains that these delays resulted in additional costs incurred by SEDEF, which were
passed on to Karkey and paid by Karkey pursuant to invoices issued by SEDEF between August
2012 and August 2013. The total additional payments made by Karkey were US$12.59

  

million.'%

Pakistan submits that Karkey is not entitled to these costs as the entity named on the invoices in
question was Karpowership Company Ltd. Karkey has produced no evidence whatsoever to
show that the actions of Pakistan contributed in any way to the US$12.5 million in fees to the

shipyards building the powerships.!°

A Release Protocol was signed between Karpowership Company Ltd and SEDEF in August 2013

and reads, inter alia, as follows:

[...] 1. The Contractor's [SEDEF’s] Works for the conversion and repair of
KPS 9 and KPS 7 were delayed because of the Owner's delay in Owner's

Supply and the Owner's Works as_a result of the Owner's [Karpowership
dispute with Pakistan as detailed in the Preamble. Therefore, additional costs

were incurred by the Contractor, including overtime work by the Contractor's
employees and subcontractors.

2. The additional costs incurred by the Contractor, are as follows:
For conversion of KPS 9- USD 7,569,026.46
For conversion of KPS 7-USD 5,016, 775.14

These additional cost amounts were included in the invoices issued by the
Contractor in Annex 1.

3. The Owner agreed to reimburse the additional costs incurred by the
Contractor, and the payment of the above stated amounts were duly made by
the Owner and received by the Contractor.[...]'

The Release Protocol states that the above costs include overtime work incurred, although it is
not clear why overtime was required. Given that the conversion program was halted, it seems

surprising that incremental overtime costs have been incurred.

More importantly, the “additional costs” referred to by SEDEF above were paid by Karpowership
as part of invoices issued to Karpowership (and not Karkey) between August 2012 and August
2013.

As the Tribunal has decided above, Karkey does not have standing to make claims in this
arbitration on behalf of its subsidiaries, reason why the claim under this heading is hereby

dismissed.

c. Delay Penalties in Lebanon

Karkey submits that because the Measures delayed the construction of vessels KPS 7 and 9, they
were not deployed within 15 days of the contractually obligated Commercial Operation Date
(“Cure Period”) under Karkey’s contract in Lebanon. Karpowership was therefore required to
pay a stipulated penalty of US$1,000 per day per MW of capacity or US$82,150 per day (82.15
MW x 1,000 US $/MW). The penalty period spanned from June to September 2012 for a total of
69 days at which time KPS 9 started operations in Lebanon. The total penalty amounted to
US$5.7 million (US$82,150 x 69 days)!

Pakistan maintains that there is no evidence that the Measures caused any delay to the delivery
of the Orhan Bey (KPS 7). Karkey agreed to produce documents evidencing that the Measures

were the direct cause of the delay to the construction of the vessel, and hence the alleged penalty

104 N/AV-093 (emphasis added).

charges under the Lebanon contract. In any event, the contract was with Karpower, not with

Karkey. Again, Karkey is not entitled to recover any such penalties.!°%

As pointed out by Mr. Haberman, there was a loan finance in place for KPS 7 and 9, and it is not
clear why Karpowership Company Ltd.’s failure to meet the Commercial Operation Date can be

due to the actions of Pakistan.

In any event, the damages claimed under this heading were incurred by Karpowership (not
Karkey). As the Tribunal has decided above, Karkey does not have standing to make claims in
this arbitration on behalf of its subsidiaries, which is the reason why the amounts claimed under

this heading is hereby dismissed.

(8) Wasted Costs

Karkey claims US$23.9 million in wasted costs allegedly incurred in maintaining the Kaya Bey

and Alican Bey during their detention period,'"” which are objected by Pakistan.'**

According to Karkey, the essence of Mr. Haberman’s complaint regarding Karkey’s wasted costs
claim in the amount of US$23.9 million is that it is based on trial balances. This complaint is
unreasonable given that (1) trial balances are output from Karkey’s SAP accounting system,
which is audited by a reputable international accounting firm;! and (2) the only way that Mr.
Haberman’s complaint could be addressed would be to undertake the unreasonably onerous task
of reviewing hundreds of thousands of pages of invoices. As Mr. Kaczmarek explained, this

would effectively entail a technical and financial audit that would take at least a year.!°°

The Tribunal first notes that in order to succeed in a wasted cost claim of this magnitude, Karkey

must demonstrate that such costs were incurred, paid and related to the project.

Considering the allegedly high number of invoices involved in this claim, the Tribunal did not

expect Karkey to produce all of them. However, Karkey was expected at least to provide the

16 Pakistan’s Rejoinder, § 1265.

results of an inspection of a sample of supporting documents to these trial balances relied on by

Mr. Kaczmarek, such as invoices, purchase orders, payment records, material usage records,

 

payroll records, etc. The Tribunal relies upon Mr. Haberman’s explanation that, in response to
request 65 under Procedural Order No. 8, Karkey has provided time sheets and billing rates for
cleaners, welders, fitters, a fabricator and a translator in Karkey and Karpak. However, there is
no further description on the timesheets and he was not able to reconcile such amount to the
amounts in Mr. Kaczmarek’s wasted cost analysis.'°°!

The Tribunal finds that Mr. Kaczmarek has provided no transparency as to how he has arrived at
his numbers. In his Appendix 6,!° there is a table setting out a summary of the amount he
includes in the wasted costs claim, which contains no further narrative as to why these costs have

been included, what vessel they relate to and how he has ultimately arrived at these figures.

As concluded by Mr. Haberman, it is apparent from Mr. Kaczmarek’s analysis, that he has either
made no attempt to verify the validity of the numbers put forward in the trial balances provided

by Karkey and Karpak or that he has not disclosed this analysis.!°

 

In view of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that the
amount claimed under this heading has been duly incurred as a result of Pakistan’s breach of the

BIT.

(9) Interest Rate

According to Karkey, the most appropriate rate of interest is that proposed by Pakistan and agreed
by the Parties in the RSC for delayed payments in the event of a “Dispute,” which was 12%.!0™4
This rate is particularly appropriate concerning the damages that relate to Pakistan’s specific
contractual obligations (namely, the Termination Charge, the transport and mobilization costs

under Clause 4.6(b) of the RSC, and unpaid invoices), since a 12% interest rate for those damages

1054 See C-010 (CONFIDENTIAL), Clause 4.5(i) (“Upon the resolution of the Dispute, any amounts determined to
be owing to BUYER, which have been paid to SELLER shall be paid to BUYER together with interest charges based
upon Delayed Payment Interest Rate from the date the payment under the applicable invoice was made through the
date of repayment”). The term “Dispute” is broadly defined as “any and all disputes or disagreements of any kind
whatsoever between SELLER and BUYER in connection with or arising out of this Contract.”

990.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 278 of 310

is required by the terms of the RSC.!°5> The same rate also should apply to the remainder of
1056

Karkey’s damages.
If the Tribunal were to disagree that the “Delayed Payment” rate should be used, or were to
conclude that it should only be used for part of Karkey’s damages, the appropriate rate would be
one that reflects Pakistan’s cost of borrowing. Mr. Kaczmarek has calculated this to be 8.9%,
and Mr. Haberman does not appear to disagree with how Mr. Kaczmarek arrived at the figure of
8.9% (although he disagrees this is the appropriate rate). Such rate takes into account the fact
that Karkey in effect has been rendered an unwilling lender to Pakistan. This should guide the
Tribunal’s consideration of an appropriate interest rate (rather than Karkey’s cost of borrowing
(7%), which Mr. Haberman advocates,'°*” but which Pakistan itself does not appear to agree is
appropriate). !°58

According to Pakistan, the “investments alternative” approach is the most appropriate in this
case. This was endorsed most recently by the tribunal in Yukos. Pakistan submits that in line with
the authorities referred to in Yukos, the applicable rate ought to be a rate based on the 10-year

US Treasury bond rates as was applied in Yukos.!°°

Moreover, Mr. Haberman (Pakistan’s expert) has determined an interest rate (i.e. cost of debt)
for Karkey of 7%. In his opinion, this rate better reflects the interest rate Karkey would have
benefited from had the alleged breach not occurred. According to Mr. Haberman, interest should
be charged at this rate, on a compound annual basis, on any damages awarded to Karkey on

historical losses.'°

1055 Notably, the sovereign guarantee that Pakistan provided in connection with the RSC (C-011 (CONFIDENTIAL)
covers interest payments with its broad wording in Clause 1.1(iii) (“all present and future financial obligations of
the BUYER to the SELLER in respect of the Monthly Rental Services Fees and the Termination Charges payable by
the BUYER in terms of the Rental Services Contract” (emphasis added)).

on ten-year US Treasury bond rates.”

Karkey counters that the Tribunal should not apply the “investments alternative” rate that

Pakistan argues for in extremely brief terms (but which is not supported by Mr. Haberman).!°!

The sole basis that Pakistan advances for the use of a US Treasury bond rate as an “investments

 

alternative” is that it was applied in Yukos.!°° Without more, this is neither a sound nor adequate
basis for the Tribunal to apply the same rate here. The award in Yukos turned on the particular

facts and circumstances of that case.!°° It is wholly insufficient for Pakistan simply to point to

 

the fact that the Yukos tribunal applied a US Treasury bond rate, as a purported justification for

having such rate apply in the present case.!°

The Tribunal notes that neither the BIT nor the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provide
specific rules regarding how interest should be determined. As stated by the Yukos Tribunal, “the
practice of past tribunals is varied and inconsistent and does not provide clear guidance. Thus,

as is well established, the Tribunal has a wide margin of discretion to determine the rate of

interest applicable and whether it should be simple or compound.”!°*

Clause 4.5(h) and (i) of the RSC provides as follows:!°°°

(h) Any disputed amounts not agreed mutually by the PARTIES shall be paid
and the PARTIES may resolve the Dispute through the dispute resolution
process as defined later in the Contract.

(i) Upon the resolution of the Dispute, any amounts determined to be owing
to BUYER, which have been paid to SELLER shall be paid to BUYER
together with interest charges based upon Delayed Payment Interest Rate

from the date the payment under the applicable invoice was made through

the date of repayment.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 280 of 310

‘Delayed Payment Interest Rate’ — shall mean 1% per month on the unpaid
balance, which shall be calculated on a Daily basis, and payable in
equivalent Pak Rupees converted by applying the exchange rate parity of
Rupee and US Dollar prevailing on the date of invoice. For the purpose of
this section TT (Telegraphic Transfer) and OD (Over Draft) selling rate of
National Bank of Pakistan at the close of Business Day shall apply.

‘Dispute’ — means any and all disputes or disagreements of any kind

whatsoever between SELLER and BUYER in connection with or arising out

of this Contract.
The Tribunal notes that Mr. Haberman states that the 12% rate in Karkey’s rental service
agreement relates to “Delayed Payment Interest”. He further states that this is a specific
contractually agreed rate that may be relevant to late payment of unpaid rental invoices, but does
not have wider application to Karkey’s lost cash flows claim.!°°*
After considering the Parties’ arguments in this regard and based on the contractual provisions
above, the Tribunal finds that the applicable interest rates for damages related to the expropriation
of contractual rights (i.e. Termination Charges, unpaid invoices and mobilization costs) shall be

12%'° and shall apply as of the date of the expropriation, i.e. 30 March 2012.

Although the contractual 12% applies to late payments under the Contract, it has nothing to do
with the rate Karkey could have benefited from with additional cash flows had the alleged breach

not occurred.

As noted by Mr. Haberman, any damages awarded to Karkey should put it in the position it would
have been in if the breach of the BIT had not occurred. In 2012, Karkey was in a net debt position
and therefore any additional cash flow Karkey would have had in 2012 would have lowered net
debt, thus reducing (i.e. making a saving on) the interest due on Karkey’s borrowings. The
appropriate interest rate should reflect the saving Karkey would have made on its borrowings.!°”
The Tribunal finds that, as set out in Appendix O of Mr. Haberman’s 1* Report, the interest rate

determined by Mr. Haberman (i.e. cost of debt) in the amount of 7% is the most appropriate as

this rate reflects the interest rate Karkey would have benefited from had the breach not occurred.

Therefore, for damages related to the retention of the Vessels, including lost cash flows, a 7%
interest rate shall apply as of the date of the expropriation, i.e. 30 March 2012. Considering that
it is not possible to determine the date when Karkey incurred the total of the repair costs
concerning the Kaya Bey, which were incurred as of 15 May 2014 (i.e. upon the provisional
release of the vessel), a 7% interest rate shall apply on the amount of the Kaya Bey repair costs

as of 15 May 2014.

The interest awarded shall be compounded on a yearly basis, which the Tribunal finds is in line
with the majority of the decisions in investor-state expropriation cases and which is used by the
1071

damages experts of both Parties'®’' and will run until the date of full payment.

(10) Summary of the Amounts due to Karkey and Application of Interest

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s decision under Section V(H)(1 to 9) above, the Tribunal summarizes
below the amounts due to Karkey by Pakistan, and decides on the application of the interest rate

determined above.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 283 of 310

Pakistan’s Cc laims: Does the Tribunal have Jurisdiction to hear the C:

Pakistan submits that Art. 46 of the ICSID Convention provides for the admissibility of

counterclaims in the following terms:

[e]xcept as the parties agree otherwise, the Tribunal shall, if requested by
a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims
arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute provided that they are
within the scope of consent of the parties and are otherwise within the
jurisdiction of the Centre.!°
According to Pakistan, the tribunal in Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan found that there are therefore

two conditions which must be met for an ICSID tribunal to have jurisdiction over a counterclaim:

(i) the counterclaim must be within the jurisdiction of the Centre, which
includes the requirement of consent, and

(ii) It must ‘aris[e] directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute’, the

second requirement also being known as ‘connectedness’ requirement.'°
In the event the Tribunal finds (contrary to Pakistan’s position) that it does have jurisdiction over
Karkey’s affirmative claims, each of these requirements would be satisfied with respect to the
Counterclaim.'°
Pakistan submits that the conditions for the jurisdiction of the Centre are found in Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention. These conditions include “the existence of a legal dispute and of an

investment, nationality, and consent.”' In addition, as noted by the tribunal in Goetz v. Burundi

[Ul]:

When the States Parties to a BIT contingently consent, inter alia, to ICSID

jurisdiction, the consent component of Article 46 of the Washington
Convention is ipso facto imported into any ICSID arbitration which an
investor then elects to pursue.'°"®

Based on the above, Pakistan submits that by electing to pursue this arbitration, Karkey has ipso

facto consented to counterclaims “arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute”, and

1008.

1009.

1010.

1011.

the fact that the BIT does not make any express reference to counterclaims is irrelevant.!°””

Moreover, the Counterclaim arises out of the same contract as Karkey’s alleged investment.
Pakistan contends that in the event that (contrary to Pakistan’s position) the Tribunal finds that
Karkey has an “investment” for the purposes of the BIT, the Counterclaim therefore falls within
the broad language of Article VII(1) of the BIT, which applies to “/d/isputes between one of the

Parties and an investor of the other Party, in connection with his investment” .'°7

Pakistan concludes that the Parties have thus consented to potential counterclaims, which are
within the jurisdiction of the Centre. The first two requirements in Article 46 of the ICSID

Convention (as set-out in Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan) is therefore satisfied.!°”

Karkey objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Pakistan’s counterclaims. According to
Karkey, the issue of consent is critical and counterclaims are only permissible where there has
been an explicit manifestation of consent by both parties. Where the relevant consent by the
Respondent is expressed in a BIT, and the claimant’s consent in an acceptance of the
Respondent’s offer in the BIT to arbitrate, the possibility of counterclaims must be articulated in

the relevant BIT’s dispute resolution clause.!°°°

The Tribunal finds that, as stated by the tribunal in Roussalis v. Romania, “the first issue which
the Tribunal has to determine is whether — and irrespective of the particular counterclaims
advanced in these proceedings by the Respondent — the Parties consented to have the State’s
counterclaims arbitrated.”'°*' The Roussalis tribunal stressed that, in the context of a BIT
dispute, the issue of consent is determined by reference to the scope of consent in the relevant

BIT, !082

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 285 of 310

The Tribunal finds that the text of the BIT is decisive in determining its jurisdiction over the
counterclaims. In the present case, however, there is no provision in the BIT that contemplates

the possibility of counterclaims.!°* Article VII of the BIT provides, inter alia, as follows:

1. Disputes between one of the Parties and an investor of the other Party, in
with the ii , shall be notified in writing, including a

detailed information, by the investor to the recipient Party of the ii

As far as possible, the investor and the concerned Party shall endeavor to

settle these disputes by consultations and negotiations in good faith.

2. If these disputes cannot be settled in this way within six months following
the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the dispute can
be submitted, as the investor may choose, to (a) the international Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) set up by the ‘Convention on
Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of other
States’ (in case both Parties become signatories of this Convention.)'!°**
References to the “investor” highlighted above in the dispute resolution clause of the BIT means
that the BIT is intended to enable arbitration only at the initiative of the investor. The BIT

imposes no obligation on investors, only on the Contracting State.

The BIT contains no particular or general language that would enable the Tribunal to conclude,
if interpreted in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,'°** that the
arbitral agreement between Pakistan and Karkey includes consent by Karkey to the submission

of counterclaims by Pakistan.

The Goetz v. Burundi IT award relied on by Pakistan is the only ICSID award that has ever
adopted the ipso facto consent theory advanced by Pakistan in this case.!°°° Like this Tribunal,

most ICSID tribunals have not found the theory of ipso facto consent to be sufficient to conclude

that an investor’s consent to ICSID counterclaims is automatic.!°*7

A. Summary of the Parties’ Positions

1017.

1019.

(1) Summary of the Claimant’s Position
a. Applicable Rules and Principles

Karkey submits that ICSID Arbitration Rule 28 grants the Tribunal discretion to decide whether
costs relating to any part of the proceedings “shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by
one of the parties.”'** Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, for its part, empowers the Tribunal
to “decide how and by whom the expenses [incurred by the parties], the fees and expenses of the
members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be

paid.”

According to Karkey, the foregoing provisions confer wide discretion on the Tribunal to allocate
costs. In exercising such discretion in this proceeding, the Tribunal should take into account (1)
Pakistan’s multiple and egregious violations of the BIT; (2) Pakistan’s bad faith and dilatory
arbitration tactics; (3) Pakistan’s assertion of meritless and untimely jurisdictional objections.!°

(a.1) Pakistan’s Egregious Breaches of the BIT Warrant an Award of Costs to Karkey

According to Karkey, the starting point, general principle, and growing trend in investment
arbitration is for tribunals to award costs to the prevailing party, applying the rule that “the costs
follow the event”. Awarding costs to the prevailing party is consistent with the general damages
principles articulated in the Chorzow Factory case, which require that the injured party be

restored to the position in which it would have been, had the breach not occurred. Pursuant to

1088 [CSID Arbitration Rules, Rule 28. The Tribunal’s decision on costs must be included in the Tribunal’s award.
ICSID Arbitration Rules, Rule 47(1)(j) (“The award shall be in writing and shall contain...any decision of the
Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding”).

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 287 of 310

this principle, the Tribunal should award Karkey its costs and fees in the event that Karkey were
to prevail on one or more of its BIT claims.!°!

An award of costs to the prevailing party is particularly appropriate where the breach at issue
constituted an “egregious” violation of the applicable BIT. Examples of such violations have

included denials of due proce: 1092

 

and uncompensated expropriations.

Contrary to Pakistan’s claims, neither the language of the BIT nor the prevailing practice among
ICSID tribunals require an equal allocation of costs. To the contrary, here the BIT is silent on
costs. In such circumstances, an increasing number of tribunals are applying the “costs follow

the event” approach, and thus award costs to the prevailing party.!”

Karkey rejects Pakistan’s allegation that a majority of ICSID tribunals have ordered that parties
should bear their own costs. According to Karkey, this statement, which is based on a reference
to a 2010 award rather than empirical data or any sort, improperly marks: (i) that this “majority”
is very slight at best; (ii) that there has been a marked trend in recent years in favor of awarding
costs to the prevailing party; and (iii) that there is no consensus that an order that each party bear
its own costs is an appropriate or established practice.!°%

Karkey submits that in the present case, where Pakistan has committed multiple and egregious
violations of the BIT, has failed to collaborate in the efficient conduct of the arbitration, and has
lodged a series of time-consuming and meritless jurisdictional objections, Karkey should be

awarded its costs.!°

(a.2) Pakistan’s bad faith and dilatory arbitration tactics

Karkey submits that the Tribunal’s discretion to award costs includes the discretion to take into

account the Parties’ conduct during the proceedings. Pakistan has engaged in dilatory and

obstructive procedural tactics from the very institution of the case through the Hearing, and

should be appropriately penalized through an award of costs to Karkey.

1096

1025. In summary, according to Karkey, the following “dilatory and obstructive procedural tactics”

should be taken into account by the Tribunal:

substantial delay;!0”

(a.3) Pakistan’s assertion of meritless and untimely jurisdictional objections

According to Karkey, it should also be awarded the full amount of its costs and expenses because
it was required to defend against meritless and shifting objections to jurisdiction, which
considerably increased the costs and complexity of the arbitral proceedings. !!°5

For instance, Pakistan asserted three meritless objections to the legality of Karkey’s investment,
despite having (a) previously endorsed and encouraged that investment; (b) cleared Karkey of
any wrongdoing under Pakistan’s anti-corruption statute, the NAO, and (c) continued until the
present day to defend the legality of that investment in ongoing proceedings before the Supreme
Court in Pakistan.!!°°

From the very beginning of the arbitral proceedings, Pakistan has advanced the completely
frivolous and untenable jurisdictional objection that Karkey did not make any “investment”.
More remarkably still, Pakistan continued to advance that same objection — despite its manifest
lack of merit — even after the Tribunal had issued its Provisional Measures decision, in which it
had found prima facie that an investment did exist. The fact that Karkey found itself forced
through the arbitration to defend against this patently unsustainable argument further increased
Karkey’s legal costs, and thus constitutes an additional basis for the Tribunal to grant fees and
1107

costs to Karkey.

b. Karkey’s costs
According to Karkey, it has incurred the total of US$22.268,943.76 in fees and expenses. The

amount includes fees and expenses of four law firms and multiple experts over the course of four

 

years, as well as the time and effort of Karkey’s officers and legal team, starting from the lead-
up to the time Karkey sent Pakistan a written notification of dispute and request for friendly

consultations, dated 19 May 20121198

Ms. Ayse Nazli Dereli Oba stated that the table above includes an entry for estimated costs
incurred in connection with time spent by Karkey in-house personnel on this case. The estimates
of the number of hours spent by each Karkey officer is based on an average of two hours a day
dedicated solely to this matter, and multiplied by the 300 working days in a year, for four years,
for a total of 2400 hours per person.!!'! She assigned an hourly value of US$250 for these in-

house services. !!!?

c. Karkey asserts its costs were reasonable
Karkey submits that the legal fees it incurred are reasonable in light of prevailing conditions in
the legal market. Karkey contends that these fees are also reasonable in light of the length and
complexity of this case, which was exacerbated by Pakistan’s misconduct, including: (i) the fact
that Pakistan improperly caused delays; (ii) its refusal to release Karkey’s Vessels or to comply
with the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures; (iii) its unwarranted applications for
additional document production; (iv) its attempts to introduce evidence after the close of the
written phase; (v) its shifting theories of the case; and (vi) its unsubstantiated and defamatory

corruption theories.!!'5

The complexity of the issues in the case, including multiple questions of Pakistani law and

 

procedure, the specialized nature of the power ship market, and the substantial damages resulting
from Pakistan’s breach of the BIT, necessitated the retention of expert witnesses in these fields.
In addition, Pakistan’s introduction of allegations of violations of “international procurement
norms” in its Counter-Memorial required Karkey to retain international procurement expert, Mr.
Jerome Grand d’Esnon. The fees and expenses associated with Karkey’s retention of these
experts were reasonable, especially in light of the multiple and varied theories of jurisdiction and
14

quantum advanced by Pakistan in this case.

According to Karkey, when considered in proportion to the amount at stake in this arbitration,

Karkey’s legal fees and expenses are reasonable.!!!>

In addition to the counsel and expert fees and expenses that Karkey incurred, Karkey also seeks
compensation for the opportunity costs and expenses resulting from the intensive involvement
of Karkey’s own employees and officers in the case. As detailed in the declaration of Ms. Ayse
Nazli Dereli Oba, the time spent on tasks specific to these proceedings significantly diverted in-
house resources. The internal costs claimed by Karkey relate exclusively to the prosecution of
these proceedings, and are benchmarked against average rates for Turkish law firms. Those
amounts are reasonable in light of the hours and energy required by Karkey’s executive team and

legal team over the course of this four-year proceeding.'!'¢

d. Karkey submits that Pakistan has offered no evidence that its costs are reasonable
Karkey rejects Pakistan’s argument that Karkey should bear Pakistan’s legal fees if the Tribunal
were to decide to award costs based on relative success. Karkey submits that even if such were
the case, however, Pakistan would still be required to prove the reasonableness of its fees and

costs. 17

 

and here it offers no evidence to support any claim of reasonableness.

According to Karkey, whereas Karkey has accompanied its request for fees with declarations
from each law firm involved and a description of the fees that those attorneys incurred, Pakistan
has failed to provide any explanation at all of its fees, beyond a line-item schedule. Such schedule
includes over US$11 million in fees for Pakistan’s international arbitration counsel, Allen &
Overy LLP, for only two years of representation (February 2014 to April 2016), whereas
Karkey’s international arbitration counsel, Arnold & Porter, incurred only US$12.6 million in
fees despite conducting more than an entire additional year of work. While the Tribunal has not
asked for a detailed explanation of fees incurred by either party, Pakistan’s failure to provide any
data on how many attorneys worked on the matter during those two years, what type of work
they did, or what rates they charged, renders it impossible to gauge the reasonableness of those

fees,'!!8

e. Karkey’s Request for Relief regarding Costs

1039. Karkey requests that the Tribunal grant an award of costs directing that Pakistan reimburse

Karkey for the following costs:!'!”

a. Karkey’s portion of the Centre’s administrative fees and expenses in the amount of

US$750,000; and

b. the total costs incurred by Karkey in fees and expenses (including attorney’s fees and

expenses) in the amount of US$22,268,943.76.!!2°

(2) Summary of the Respondent’s Position
a. Applicable Rules and Principles
1040. Pakistan submits that the Pakistan-Turkey BIT provides in its Article VIII(7) that “/e/xpenses
incurred by the Chairman, the other arbitrators, and other costs of the proceedings shall be paid
for equally by the Parties. The tribunal may, however, at its discretion, decide that a higher
proportion of the costs to be paid by one of the Parties.”''?! Following the general rules of
interpretation of treaties as set out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the ordinary meaning
of “other costs of the proceedings” would naturally include any and all charges associated with
ICSID’s administration of the arbitration. Accordingly, it is clear that Article VIII(7) of the

1122

Treaty is addressing the Procedural Costs''”* of the arbitration. Unless a tribunal believes there

is good reason to decide otherwise, the Treaty requires equal sharing of Procedural Costs between

the Parties.'!23

1041. In view of the above, Pakistan submits that the Procedural Costs of this arbitration should be

shared equally between Karkey and Pakistan.''*4

1119 Karkey’s Reply Submission on Costs, J 31.
120 The Tribunal notes that the amount of US$22,268,943.76 already includes the US$750,000 asked under a. above.
121 C.001, Article VIII(7).

1122 Pakistan defines Procedural Costs as to include the tribunal’s fees and expenses and the expenses associated with
ICSID administration of the arbitration (including charges for the hearing facilities and court reporter, for example).

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 294 of 310

Pakistan submits, however, that the BIT is silent on the allocation of the Parties Costs (such as
legal fees, experts’ fees and other costs related to the proceedings). In summary, according to

Pakistan, ICSID tribunals have taken two approaches to cost allocation:!!5

- Each party bears its own costs, regardless of which party prevails; or

- “costs follow the event”, meaning that the tribunal shifts the costs in whole or in part

to the non-prevailing party.

Pakistan sustains that the majority of ICSID tribunals have adopted the first approach and
required each party to bear its own costs, regardless of whether the Claimant or the Respondent
was successful. Although tribunals have on occasion adopted this approach without providing
any specific reasons, several tribunals have explained that each party should bear its own costs
because the relevant case involved complex factual and legal issues, and there were no special
circumstances necessitating a different method of cost allocation.!!7°

In some more recent cases, ICSID tribunals have departed from the traditional approach of
requiring each party to bear its own costs and have shifted the costs in whole or part to the non-
prevailing party. Pakistan submits that this practice is far from generally accepted and has been
justified by tribunals in light of the existence of special reasons or circumstances.'!”’ In those
cases where tribunals have ordered costs against the non-prevailing party, they have typically
held that cost allocation should reflect the degree of success of the prevailing party. In other
words, even under the “costs follow the event” order, it is extremely rare for the non-prevailing

party to bear the entire burden of all costs and fees.!!?*

Pakistan submits that, having regard to the circumstances of this case, including the nature and

complexity of the questions raised by both Parties, each Party should bear its own costs regardless

of which Party ultimately prevails.!!° Whatever the outcome of the dispute, Pakistan has raised

a number of reasonable and meritorious arguments on issues which are far from clear-out.!!°°

1046. In the alternative, Pakistan submits that the costs should reflect the relative success of the Parties

 

and their reasonableness.'!?! When analysing the reasonableness of Karkey’s costs, the Tribunal

is invited to consider the following factors:

1132

- Karkey’s claims were inconsistent and lacked focus resulting in unnecessary costs:

1133

Pakistan has sought to minimize the costs of proceedings;

- Karkey opposed to the appointment of Mr. Waller without cause;!!™*

Karkey caused unnecessary expenditure of time and resources during document

production;! 135 and

- Karkey introduced unnecessary and irrelevant expert evidence.!!5°

c. Comments to Karkey’s alleged Costs

1048. Pakistan submits that, although the Tribunal requested a simple list of the costs incurred by each
party, Karkey has chosen to provide a detailed breakdown of the costs that it incurred in these
proceedings. A review of Karkey’s costs clearly demonstrates that they are unreasonable and

excessive in several respects, for the five reasons summarized below.!!38

1049. Firs

 

, Karkey incurred significantly more costs

 

and expenses than Pakistan in these proceedings.

The material difference between the amounts incurred by each party indicates that Karkey’s costs

18 Pakistan’s Reply Submission on Costs, § 89.

285

1051.

1052.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 298 of 310

were not reasonably or necessarily incurred. In the present case, Karkey is claiming almost US$7

million more in fees than Pakistan.!'5°

. Second, Karkey has instructed six law firms (Arnold & Porter, Baker & McKenzie, Hassan

Kaunain Nafees, Bird & Bird, AKT Law Office and Akinci Law Firm) to act for it, or advise it,
in these proceedings. Instructing several teams of lawyers in this manner over the course of
several years would necessarily result in inefficiencies as well as unnecessary duplication of

work, and inevitably contributed to Karkey’s inflated costs.!!°

Third, the detailed breakdowns of costs provided by Karkey’s counsel indicate that a

disproportionate amount of the work in these proceedings was done by the most senior members

of each team. In fact, the breakdown of legal fees provided by Baker & McKenzie, Bird & Bird

and Hassan Kaunain Nafees shows that the most senior member of each legal team billed the

most hours. This is a manifestly inefficient and costly manner to manage a case.!!4!

Fourth, Karkey has also sought to recover US$1.2 million in respect of costs allegedly incurred

by Mr. Karadeniz and Mr. El Suudi “in connection with time spent...on this case.” Pakistan

objects to these claims for the following reasons:!!4?

- Pakistan does not accept that the estimated two hours a day, for 300 days a year, for
four years, allegedly spent by Mr. Karadeniz and Mr. El Suudi in this arbitration is
reasonable, in light of the roles of these individuals (who are not in-house counsel),

and the activities Karkey claims they performed; and

- As the two individuals concerned were the CEO and Energy Trade Director of Karkey,
these costs actually represent management time. Such costs are generally not
recoverable as they are regarded as part of the normal cost of running a business
enterprise, rather than the recoverable costs of the winning party. It is not disputed that
management time may have been spent on these proceedings; however, directors,
officers, or employees of a company should not need to be paid additional sums in

order to give evidence on behalf of their company and/or do other work in relation to

the arbitration. This falls within the scope of their responsibilities. Pakistan has also
incurred significant management time in these proceedings, but has not claimed these

costs.

Fifth, Karkey appears to be operating under a contingency fee arrangement. Although
contingency fee arrangements are permissible in the US, they are not an accepted feature of the
arbitral landscape and indeed are prohibited in most civil law systems. While there is a debate as
to how such arrangements should be treated in international arbitration, Pakistan submits that

there are two key principles to be borne in mind:

- Costs are only recoverable if the successful party is actually obliged to pay them to

their legal representatives; and

- Only costs that are reasonably incurred in close connection with the conduct of the
arbitration proceedings are recoverable from the unsuccessful party. As costs incurred
under a contingency fee arrangement are not charged to the customer, the control and
attention usually exercised by a customer over sums invoiced to him is absent. The

reasonableness of cos

 

s incurred under a contingency fee agreement should be placed

under greater scrutiny.

Pakistan therefore objects to Karkey’s attempts to recover costs which Karkey itself has not

incurred or otherwise agreed to pay to its legal counsel in this arbitration.!'

d. Pakistan rejects Karkey’s allegations of bad faith and procedural misconduct

.In summary, Pakistan rejects Karkey’s allegations that Pakistan has acted in bad faith and

engaged in procedural misconduct.

Pakistan denies that the conduct upon which Karkey relies was in any way improper or that it
establishes the requisite intent for a finding of bad faith. Regardless of the outcome of these
proceedings, Pakistan maintains that its actions in relation to Karkey’s RPP in Pakistan were

taken in good faith.!!44

. Pakistan also denies Karkey’s allegations that Pakistan engaged in procedural misconduct.

Karkey fails to explain how any of its alleged grievances have led to additional costs being

287

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 300 of 310

incurred. Karkey also ignores that Pakistan, in addition to defending itself against claims which
concern the exercise of its sovereign right to determine and apply its own law, has in fact made
good faith efforts to anticipate and resolve issues and streamline these proceedings (for example,
by proposing the Parties agree upon a list of issues and submit skeleton arguments in advance of
the Hearing). Pakistan requests the Tribunal to assess Pakistan’s conduct not as Karkey would
14s

have it, but in an objective and measured way.

e. Pakistan’s Request for Relief regarding Costs

1058. Pakistan requests the Tribunal to order that:!!4°

B.

i. The Procedural Costs of this arbitration (i.e. the fees advanced to ICSID)
be paid equally by the parties; and

Each party bears its own costs (Parties’ Costs) regardless of which party
ultimately prevails;

or

iii.

‘costs follow the event’, with due regard to each parties’ relative success
in the arbitration as well as the reasonableness of the costs incurred;
and

iv. Any interest be applied at such reasonable commercial rate as the

Tribunal thinks fit, from the date on which such costs were incurred to
the date of payment.

The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs

a. Applicable Rules and Principles:

1059. The Parties disagree on the applicable principle/approach for allocation of costs. Karkey submits

that the Tribunal should apply the “costs follow the event” approach, and Pakistan claims that
each party should be ordered to claim its own costs. The Parties agree, however, that Article
61(2) of the ICSID Convention gives the Tribunal wide discretion to allocate the arbitration costs

between the Parties. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:

the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses
incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide
how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of

the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall

be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.
Applying the broad discretion conferred by Article 61(2), the Tribunal finds that the “costs follow
the event” approach is the most appropriate in the present case. As pointed by Karkey, awarding
costs to the prevailing party is consistent with the general damages principle articulated in the
Chorzow Factory case, which require that the injured party be restored to the position in which
it would have been, had the breach not occurred. The Tribunal also notes that investment tribunals

are increasingly favouring the “cost follows the event approach”.!!47

Moreover, while Pakistan claims that Article VIII(7) of the BIT!'*® sets a default rule that the
Parties should bear equally their Procedural Costs (which Pakistan defines as to include the
tribunal’s fees and expenses and expenses associated with ICSID’s administration of the
arbitration), the Tribunal finds that Article VIII(7) is not applicable to this case. This is because
Article VIII of the BIT governs disputes between the two State Parties signatories of the BIT (i.e.
disputes between Turkey and Pakistan) only. Article VII of the BIT, which governs disputes
between a State Party and an investor from the other State Party, does not contain a similar
provision.!!?

Moreover, when applying the “cost follow the event” approach, the Tribunal will not only
consider the fact that Karkey was the successful party in this arbitration in terms of claims, but
will also take into account the conduct of Pakistan during the proceedings and the reasonableness

of Karkey’s costs, as set forth below.

b. The conduct of Pakistan in these proceedings

For the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal finds that Pakistan did not cooperate in good faith
in the arbitral proceedings and such behaviour must be taken into account by the Tribunal in the

allocation of costs.

First, Pakistan engaged in dilatory tactics throughout these proceedings. For instance, at the

beginning of the arbitration:

(published online on 24 March 2014), p. 8 of pdf file.

Case 1:18-cv-01461-RJL Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 302 of 310

On 10 April 2013, Pakistan failed to file its Observations in Response to Karkey’s
Request for Provisional Measures in complete disregard of the deadlines set by the
Tribunal. Instead it waited nearly six months before filing its Observations only on 30
September 2013;

On 7 August 2013, Pakistan sought a 15-day extension to respond to ICSID’s request
to confirm its availability for the First Session and Hearing on Provisional
Measures.”!'*° The Tribunal granted the extension but “underscore[d]” “that it
remains reluctant to postpone the first session and hearing on provisional

measures;”!'5!

On 19 August 2013, Pakistan requested and was granted an extension of its deadline
for its Observations on Karkey’s Request for Provisional Measures Request until 29
September 2013 — nearly six months after the original due date for Pakistan’s
submission, and eight full months after Karkey submitted its urgent request_for

provisional measures;

 

On 22 August 2013, Pakistan requested that the Tribunal “extend the time [for the First
Session] at least for one month period from 16-09-2013,” in order for Pakistan to

engage a law firm.''*? The Tribunal rejected Pakistan’s request.!!*4

1065. Also, it took seven months for Pakistan to comply with the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional

Measures, dated 16 October 2013. The Decision on Provisional Measures directed Pakistan to

“take all steps necessary to allow the vessel [Kaya Bey], to depart into international waters and

reach, before I November 2013, the dry dock in Dubai.”''*> It also included an order to Pakistan

to grant “all authorization and clearance required for the vessel’s departure”, including

clearances from NAB, as well as “any other action necessary or required to allow the vessel to

depart lawfully into international waters”.''*° However, Pakistan did not release the Kaya Bey

within the deadline determined by the Tribunal. Instead, and in direct defiance of the Decision
on Provisional Measures, NAB appeared in the admiralty proceedings before the Sindh Court to
oppose Lakhra’s application for a modification of the arrest order on the Kaya Bey that would
have permitted the Vessel to leave Pakistan.'!*’? Moreover, NAB requested that Karkey be
required to post a bank guarantee in the amount of US$128 million as a condition for the Vessel’s
release.'!°8 In these ICSID proceedings, Pakistan asked the Tribunal to revise its Decision to
require such security, but the Tribunal refused, observing that it had “already expressed its
position very clearly...and expect[ed] its Decision to be complied with by the Parties.”!'? Even
in face of this renewed directive from the Tribunal, Pakistan failed to authorize the release of the
Kaya Bey for seven months. The Tribunal finds that the delays caused by Pakistan in this regard

were unjustified and are taken into account in this decision on costs.

Moreover, Pakistan requested the introduction of additional evidence only at the end of these
proceedings causing unnecessary disruption and expenses, in an attempt to uncover evidence to

substantiate alleged “red flags” or suspicions of corruption.

For instance, it sought to introduce evidence of redacted copies of documents it claimed to have
seen when meeting with a Lebanese individual who wished to sell the alleged evidence to
Pakistan.''® It attempted to support this application with a witness statement and notes from its
own counsel, but admitted that it could not authenticate the documents or even the signatures on
the documents its counsel claimed to have seen.'!°! Mr. Nahas, the individual who allegedly
approached Pakistan with the alleged “new evidence”, has apparently disappeared, and
Pakistan’s own counsel admitted that Mr. Nahas had ignored Pakistan’s request and the
Tribunal’s order that he appear at the Hearing.''® There was nothing on the record that
established the existence of the documents Pakistan’s counsel claimed to have seen. The notes
from its counsel that Pakistan introduced suggested that Pakistan’s counsel had its own doubts

about the authenticity of the purported claims, and revealed that they had merely filed the

application as a “hook” to resurrect the previously unsuccessful application for restoration of the
back-up tapes.!!°

In addition, Pakistan conducted a raid of the home of Karkey’s former country representative,
Mr. Zulgarnain, and sought to introduce the testimony of a NAB officer concerning documents
he claimed to have seen during that raid.'!* This application was made only three weeks before
the Hearing, and months after Pakistan’s 29 October 2015 Rejoinder. The Tribunal denied
Pakistan’s last-minute application, and declared the evidence inadmissible.'!®

Second, Pakistan also made the Tribunal spend a large part of the Hearing on unfounded and

suspicions arguments of corruption.

At the Hearing, Pakistan raised a series of additional applications in relation to the alleged
documents that Mr. Nahas purportedly had offered to sell to Pakistan. Insisting that Karkey must
be in contact with Mr. Nahas, Pakistan demanded that Karkey produce “/t/he mobile phone
records of Mr. Orhan Remzi, Mr. Osman Murat, Mr. Nuri Dogan Karadeniz, Ms. Atacik and Mr.
El Suudi from 11 to 15 December 2015;” and that Karkey produce “/a//l email and other
communications by or among any employee, consultant, or affiliate of Karkey (whether on
Karkey or an internet email account) with or relating to Mr. Tannous, Mr. Nahas, and/or Mr.
Raja Ali Babar Zulgarnain.”''© Yet, Pakistan itself admitted that its request for phone records

and emails “may not reveal [...] evidence of anything.”!'7

Pakistan coupled its demand for these records with a request that the Tribunal “/i/invit/e]
Pakistan to commence proceedings under Article 1469 of the French Code of Civil Procedure
[in French court]” in an attempt to obtain copies of the documents its counsel claimed to have
seen which it believed, but could not verify, were in the possession of one of Mr. Nahas’s

associates in France.'!®* Pakistan admitted that the discovery process in France “typically take[s]

a few weeks.”''® The Tribunal denied this application, which would have delayed the

proceedings.

1072. There were long discussions at the Hearing about the confirmed letter of credit, when in fact no

letter of credit at all was issued.

1073. In view of the above, considering that Karkey was the winning party in this arbitration coupled
with the fact that Pakistan seemed to be trying to delay and disrupt these proceedings, the

Tribunal finds that Pakistan shall contribute to Karkey’s reasonable arbitration costs, as set out

 

below.

1074. However, when assessing such contribution, the Tribunal must also take into consideration that
part of Karkey’s costs were undertaken with no final success as while Karkey was asking for
more than US$1,400,000,000 in damages it is awarded less than US$500,000,000, i.e. less than
40% of the amount of its claims. There is no reason for Pakistan to fully contribute to costs that
were undertaken in vain. This is particularly justified when some of Karkey’s costs includes a
contingency fee. Considering this fact and Pakistan’s lack of cooperation in the proceedings, the
Tribunal decides that Pakistan will bear 50% of Karkey’s reasonable costs and will bear its own
costs. This finding applies as well to the advances paid to ICSID, and Pakistan will have to

reimburse to Karkey 50% of Karkey’s share of the ICSID fees eventually paid by Karkey.

c. Were Karkey’s costs reasonable?

1075. Karkey submits that it has incurred the total of US$22,268,943.76 in this arbitration. Pursuant to

2016, Karkey’s fees and expenses are broken down as follows:!!7!

1076. The Tribunal notes that Karkey’s arbitration costs (i.e. US$22,268,943.76) are significantly

higher than those incurred by Pakistan (i.e. £10,372,878.77 or approximately US$13,432,505.2).
Even though the parties are free to choose their lawyers (including the number of their lawyers)
and incur such expenses as they deem fit, they cannot expect the non-prevailing party to pay for
this choice. Therefore, only Karkey’s reasonable expenses must be reimbursed. The Tribunal is
satisfied that, in view of the characteristics of the case, Karkey need not to have utilised six law
firms and could have been efficiently represented and advised without spending more than
US$20,000,000 (excluding the ICSID fees). Consequently, Pakistan will be condemned to pay
50% of that amount to Karkey i.e. US$10,000,000.
