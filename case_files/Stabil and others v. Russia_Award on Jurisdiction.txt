THE PARTIES AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES

The claimants are Stabil LLC, Rubenor LLC, Rustel LLC, Novel-Estate LLC, Pll
Kirovograd-Nafta LLC, Crimea-Petrol LLC, Pirsan LLC, Trade-Trust LLC, Elefteria LLC,
VKF Satek LLC, and Stemv Group LLC, all companies incorporated and existing under
the laws of Ukraine (the “Claimants” or the “Petrol Companies”). The Claimants are
represented in these proceedings by: Messrs. John M. Townsend, James H. Boykin,
and Vitaly Morozov of Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP, 1775 | Street NW, Washington,
D.C. 20006, United States of America (“USA”); and Messrs. Marc-Olivier Langlois and
Leon loannou of Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP, 8 Rue de Presbourg, 75116 Paris,
France.

The respondent is the Russian Federation (“Russia” or the “Respondent,” and
together with the Claimants, the “Parties”). The Respondent has not appointed any

agents or representatives in these proceedings.
OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

The Claimants seek declaratory and compensatory relief from the Respondent for “a
series of measures that disrupted and eventually destroyed Claimants’ Crimean
operations,” culminating in the dispossession and nationalization of the Claimants’
network of petrol stations and associated assets in Crimea.‘ According to the
Claimants, the Respondent's “interference with and eventual expropriation of the Petrol
Companies’ properties in Crimea was closely related to” the identity of Mr. Igor
Valerievich Kolomoisky, one of the “beneficial owners” of the Claimant companies.”
The Claimants submit that, as a result of these measures, their investments in Crimea

“have been wiped out, without the payment of any compensation.”*

The Claimants submit that the Respondent has violated the following provisions of the
Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine on the Encouragement and Mutual Protection of Investments,
dated 27 November 1998 (the “Treaty” or “BIT”):

e Article 2, which provides that each Contracting Party “guarantees, in
Claimants’ Statement of Claim, dated 15 January 2016, § 1.3.

Claimants’ Statement of Claim, dated 15 January 2016, § 1.4.
Claimants’ Notice of Arbitration, dated 3 June 2015, § 59.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 8 of 80

accordance with its legislation, the full and unconditional legal protection of
investments by investors of the other Contracting Party”;*

e Article 3, which prohibits the Contracting Parties from undertaking measures
“discriminatory in nature that could interfere with the management and
disposal” of protected investments and requires each Contracting Party to
“ensure in its territory for the investments made by investors of the other
Contracting Party, [...] treatment no less favorable than that which it accords
to its own investors or to investors of any third state”; and

e Article 5, which provides that an investment “shall not be expropriated,
nationalized or subject to other measures equivalent in effect to expropriation
[...], except in cases where such measures are taken in the public interest
under due process of law, are not discriminatory and are accompanied by

prompt, adequate and effective compensation.”

Although invited by the Tribunal to do so, the Respondent did not file a Statement of
Defense or otherwise participate in these proceedings. Its only communications in the
context of these proceedings were a letter dated 12 August 2015 from the Ministry of
Justice of the Russian Federation and a cover letter dated 15 September 2015 from the
Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Kingdom of the Netherlands (the
“Respondent’s Letters”). In its letter dated 12 August 2015, the Ministry of Justice
wrote as follows:

We return you herewith the Notices of Arbitration on the arbitration proceedings
initiated under Article 9 of the [Treaty] before the Permanent Court of Arbitration

by [the Petrol Companies] vs. the Russian Federation [...].

It is manifest that such claims cannot be considered under the [Treaty] mentioned
above and, therefore, the [Treaty] cannot serve as a basis for composing an

arbitral tribunal to settle these claims.

In accordance with paragraph | Article 1 of the [Treaty] the term “investment”
means every kind of movable and immovable and intellectual property invested

In general, when quoting the provisions of the Treaty, the Tribunal adopts the language of the
Claimants’ second translation of the Treaty’s Russian original version (CLA-129). Other
translations of the Treaty are referred to in this Award as necessary. This said, it does not seem
that any decision would turn on the differences between the Claimants’ translation in CLA-129
and that of Mr. Vesler, the Tribunal-appointed translator (regarding the latter translation see §§
30-31 and fn. 168 below).

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 9 of 80

by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting
Party in accordance with the legislation of the latter Contracting Party. The
property in question which is the matter of the claims is situated in the territory of
the Crimea and Sevastopol, i.e., in the territory that was a part of Ukraine but at
the present time pursuant to the will of people forms an integral part of the

territory of the Russian Federation and cannot be regulated by the [Treaty].

On the basis of the above mentioned the Russian Federation does not recognize
the jurisdiction of an international tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in

settlement of the abovementioned claims.”

In his cover letter dated 15 September 2015, the Ambassador of the Russian

Federation to the Kingdom of the Netherlands stated:

Nothing in the attached letter of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation
can be interpreted as consent of the Russian Federation to constitution of an
arbitral tribunal, participation in arbitration proceedings, or as procedural actions
taken in the framework of the proceedings, mentioned therein, or as waiver by
the Russian Federation of the jurisdictional immunities in respect of itself and its
property in relation to any judicial or administrative proceedings or procedures,
connected directly or indirectly with these claims, including immunity from court
jurisdiction and immunity from any measures of constraint that can be connected
directly or indirectly with these claims, regardless of the jurisdiction (national or

supranational) under which they are initiated.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 3 June 2015, the Claimants submitted a Notice of Arbitration (the “Notice of
Arbitration”), invoking Article 9 of the Treaty and the Arbitration Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules’).
According to the Claimants, the Notice of Arbitration was served on Russia on 15 June
2015.5 On the same day, Ukrnafta, a Ukrainian entity, represented by the same
counsel as the Claimants, also filed a notice of arbitration against Russia under the
Treaty (see PCA Case No. 2015-34, PUSC Ukrnafta v. The Russian Federation (“PCA
Case No. 2015-34’)).

Notice of Arbitration, § 30.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 10 of 80

In their Notice of Arbitration, and pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the
Claimants appointed Mr. Daniel M. Price as the first arbitrator.

The Respondent did not appoint an arbitrator within thirty days of the Claimants’
notification of the first arbitrator. Accordingly, on 17 July 2015, the Claimants requested
that the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”) designate
an appointing authority for the appointment of a second arbitrator pursuant to
Article 7(2)(b) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

On 6 August 2015, having sought comments from the Respondent but received no
reply, the Secretary-General of the PCA designated Mr. Michael Hwang as the
Appointing Authority in this matter for all purposes under the UNCITRAL Rules, and

communicated this decision to the Parties.

On 18 September 2015, the PCA received the Respondent's Letters. Their content is

set out in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.

On 22 September 2015, the PCA wrote to the Parties on Mr. Hwang’s behalf, inviting

the Claimants’ comments on the Respondent's Letters.

By letter dated 25 September 2015, the Claimants stated that the Respondent's Letters
showed that it “does not intend to participate in these proceedings.” Referring to
Articles 7(2) and 28(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimants suggested that “nothing
stated in the Respondent's [Letters] should prevent the Appointing Authority from

proceeding with the appointment of a second arbitrator in this case.”

On 28 September 2015, Mr. Hwang appointed Professor Brigitte Stern as the second

arbitrator in these proceedings.

The Tribunal was constituted on 7 October 2015, when the co-arbitrators agreed to the
appointment of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as the Presiding Arbitrator
pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. A tribunal composed of the same
members was constituted on the same date in PCA Case No. 2015-34. The PCA
informed the Parties of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler’s appointment in both cases on
13 October 2015.

By letter of 3 November 2015, the Tribunal (i) accepted the Claimants’ proposal for the
PCA to act as registry in the present proceedings; (ii) invited the Parties to comment on
draft terms of appointment and a draft procedural order (which included the PCA’s

tasks as fund holder and registry); (iii) proposed dates for a first procedural conference;

20.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 11 of 80

and (iv) proposed that Ms. Eva Kalnina be appointed as the Secretary of the Tribunal,
her tasks being set out in that same letter.

On 6 November 2015, the Claimants agreed to the appointment of Ms. Kalnina as the
Secretary of the Tribunal and to the PCA serving as the depository of funds, and
welcomed a procedural meeting with the Tribunal. On 16 November 2015, the
Claimants submitted additional comments on the draft terms of appointment and

procedural order.

On 3 December 2015, the Tribunal held a first procedural teleconference. The
Claimants in this matter and the claimant in PCA Case No. 2015-34, as well as Russia,
were invited to participate. The claimants in both cases were represented at the
teleconference by Messrs. John M. Townsend, James H. Boykin, Vitaly Morozov,
Marc-Olivier Langlois and Leon loannou of Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP. The

Respondent did not participate in the teleconference.

On 14 December 2015, the Tribunal wrote to His Excellency Mr. Alexander Vasilievich
Shulgin, Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Netherlands, and advised him
that, “failing receipt of other instructions [...], the Tribunal and the Parties will serve all
documents in relation to these proceedings by email on [Mr. Shulgin] as the sole
representative of the Russian Federation in [this matter],” with a copy to the e-mail

address of the Russian Ministry of Justice.

Subsequent to the teleconference held on 3 December, on 16 and 17 December 2015,
the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders Nos. 1 and 2 (“PO1” and “PO2”), in which it
fixed Geneva (Switzerland) as the seat of the arbitration, appointed the PCA as
registry, set forth provisions concerning the PCA’s remuneration, and established a
procedural timetable (the “Procedural Timetable”). The Procedural Timetable
provided for two distinct scenarios, anticipating that the Russian Federation might or
might not participate in the proceedings. In PO1, the Tribunal also indicated that, “[i]n
light of the commonalities of fact and law involved [...] and of the identical composition
of the Tribunal in [this matter and the related PCA Case No. 2015-34],” the Tribunal
would “seek to structure both proceedings [...] in such a manner as to minimize
duplication and avoid unnecessary costs whenever possible.” © Accordingly, the

Tribunal determined that correspondence and hearings would in principle be common

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 12 of 80

to both cases, while written submissions, as well as the Tribunal’s awards, would

remain separate.

On 15 January 2016, the Claimants submitted their Statement of Claim (the
“Statement of Claim”), which included: (i) exhibits C-1 to C-119; (ii) legal authorities
CLA-1 to CLA-128; (iii) the witness statement of Mr. Uriel Laber, dated 6 January 2016,
with accompanying exhibits; (iv) the expert report of Professor Peter B. Maggs, dated
8 January 2016 (the “First Maggs Report”), with appendices; and (v) the report of
Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA, dated 15 January 2016, with appendices. The
Claimants included among their exhibits English translations of the BIT from both its

Ukrainian and Russian original versions.

On 8 February 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it “consider[ed] that it may
assist the resolution of the jurisdictional issues to have available the travaux
préparatoires” of Articles 1(1), 1(4), and 12 of the Treaty, and invited the Parties to
comment on the prospect of seeking the travaux from Russia and/or Ukraine. In a letter
dated 12 February 2016, the Claimants undertook to inquire whether copies of such
materials were available. On 7 March 2016, they informed the Tribunal that they had
been able to locate “at least some of the travaux from the Ministry of Economic
Development and Trade of Ukraine” and filed electronic copies of these documents as
exhibits C-120 to C-126.

On 16 March 2016, the Claimants submitted an additional copy of the signed
Russian-language original version of the BIT published by the Russian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, together with a “revised English translation” of the same. In their cover
letter, the Claimants noted that the new translation “conforms more closely to Russian

treaty practice than the translation previously submitted.”

On 5 April 2016, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it may assist it in this phase on
jurisdiction to consult with the other investment tribunals dealing with Crimean cases on
the status and nature of the proceedings and on the issues identified in the
jurisdictional phase, and invited the Parties to provide their views on such consultation.
The Tribunal also invited the Parties to state whether they had any objection to the
PCA occasionally publishing information about the progress of this arbitration in a

press release.

On 18 April 2016, the Claimants expressed their agreement to the PCA’s publication of
press releases reporting on the procedural progress of this arbitration. The Claimants

also agreed to procedural consultations among the different tribunals, but, with regard

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 13 of 80

to matters of substance, raised concerns as to the result of such consultations in the
absence of the Respondent's explicit consent. In light of the Claimants’ response and
the absence of express consent by the Respondent, on 22 April 2016 the Tribunal
informed the Parties that it would not engage in either substantive or procedural
consultations with other tribunals.

The Respondent failed to submit a Statement of Defense by 15 April 2016, the
deadline fixed by the Tribunal in the Procedural Timetable.

On 22 April 2016, the Tribunal ordered that the proceedings continue notwithstanding
the Respondent’s failure to communicate its Statement of Defense pursuant to
Article 28(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and informed the Parties that Scenario 2 of the

Procedural Timetable would apply.

As foreseen in Scenario 2 of the Procedural Timetable, by letter dated 22 April 2016,
the Tribunal posed questions to the Parties with respect to issues of jurisdiction. In the
same letter, the Tribunal also (i) invited the Parties to state whether they had any
objection to a counsel from the PCA assisting the Tribunal Secretary in her tasks as
outlined in the Tribunal’s letter of 3 November 2015, and (ii) asked the Parties to
provide their comments on a draft press release prepared by the PCA concerning
certain procedural steps in the present proceedings. On 1 May 2016, the Claimants
confirmed that they had no objection to the PCA providing assistance to the Tribunal
Secretary and provided their comments on the press release. The Respondent
submitted no comments.

On 2 May 2016, the PCA issued a press release in the present proceedings, which was

published on its website.

On 23 May 2016, having sought the Parties’ comments on the possible appointment of,
and instructions to be given to, a translator, the Tribunal requested Mr. Igor Vesler to
produce a new English translation of the BIT from its Russian and Ukrainian original

versions.

By letter from the PCA dated 3 June 2016, the Tribunal conveyed copies of the
translation of the BIT produced by Mr. Vesler to the Parties and invited their comments
by 17 June 2016.

On 3 June 2016, the Claimants submitted their answers to the Tribunal’s questions on
jurisdiction (the “Claimants’ Answers”), which included: (i) exhibits C-127 to C-155;

(ii) legal authorities CLA-132 to CLA-195; and (iii) expanded versions of previously
submitted legal authorities. The Respondent filed no responses to the Tribunal’s

questions.

On 8 June 2016, the PCA informed the Parties that it had received copies of the
following documents from the Embassy of Ukraine in The Hague: (i) a Note Verbale
from the Embassy of Ukraine to the PCA, dated 7 June 2016; (ii) a letter from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to the Tribunal, dated 6 June 2016; and (iii) the
Submission of Ukraine as Non-Disputing Party to the BIT, dated 6 June 2016 (the
“Submission of Ukraine”). The PCA informed the Parties that it had forwarded copies
of the first two items to the Tribunal and, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested the
Parties’ comments with respect to whether the Submission of Ukraine should be

admitted into the record.

Also on 8 June 2016, the Tribunal, the Claimants, and the claimant in PCA Case
No. 2015-34 held a teleconference to discuss outstanding issues pertaining to the
organization of the hearing on jurisdiction scheduled to take place on 11 July 2016 in
Geneva, concurrently in this matter and in PCA Case No. 2015-34 (“Hearing”).
Although the Respondent was informed of the teleconference and was invited to

participate, it did not do so.

On 13 June 2016, the Tribunal circulated to the Parties an audio-recording of the
teleconference of 8 June 2016 and issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO 3”), deciding

the outstanding issues pertaining to the organization of the Hearing.

On 17 June 2016, the Claimants submitted their comments on Mr. Vesler’s translation

of the BIT. The Respondent did not submit any comments.

On 21 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“P04”), in which it
admitted the Submission of Ukraine into the record and granted the Parties until

comments on that date. The Respondent remained silent.

On 22 June 2016, the Claimants sought the Tribunal’s permission to introduce into the
record the legal authorities referred to in the Submission of Ukraine that were not yet

therefore facilitate the Tribunal’s work.

On 29 June 2016, counsel for Ukraine sought permission for Ukraine to attend and
make oral submissions at the Hearing. Having given the Parties an opportunity to

and PCA Case No. 2015-21, PJSC CB PrivatBank and Finance Company Finilon LLC
v. The Russian Federation. The Claimants proposed to submit these awards into the

record of this arbitration.

The Tribunal sought the comments of the Respondent and, in the absence of any
response, informed the Parties on 17 March 2017 that it “would find it useful to have
access to the aforementioned awards” and that, if they so wish, the Claimants “may

therefore submit these awards into the record.”

On the same day (17 March 2017), the Claimants submitted the interim awards into the

record of this arbitration.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that in the present Award it uses the terms
“Crimea”, “Crimean Peninsula’, and “Peninsula” interchangeably to refer to the
geographical area composed of the administrative units “Autonomous Republic of
Crimea” and “City of Special Status Sevastopol,” identified in the Ukrainian
Constitution. The Tribunal uses the latter two terms or “Republic of Crimea” and
“Federal City of Sevastopol” (which are the terms used under Russian law to refer to
the region and city within the Russian Federation) for descriptive purposes only,

without expressing any view about the legal status of these two entities.

THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENTS IN CRIMEA

Between 2000 and 2010, the Claimants collectively acquired title to or built 31 petrol
stations on the Crimean Peninsula.’ From 2010 to 2011, two of the Claimants,
Trade-Trust LLC and Elefteria LLC, obtained rights to lease and operate the stations
and adjoining convenience stores from the owners of the stations: Stabil LLC, Rubenor
LLC, Rustel LLC, Novel-Estate LLC, Pll Kirovograd-Nafta LLC, Crimea-Petrol LLC, and
Pirsan LLC.® The remaining companies, VKF Satek LLC and Stemv Group LLC, owned
two storage facilities in the cities of Simferopol and Sevastopol, respectively; these
were used to store reserve fuel and supply petroleum products (which were largely
sourced from outside Crimea’) to the petrol stations.’° The Claimants owned various
other assets, including an office building held in Stabil LLC’s name, located in the
Crimean city of Feodosia.'' Mr. Kolomoisky, whose connections both to the present
Claimants and to the claimant in PCA Case No. 2015-34, PUSC Ukrnafta, are alleged

to have been the motivating factor for the Respondent's expropriation, is a beneficial
owner of the Claimants.

THE INCORPORATION OF CRIMEA BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION

On 22 February 2014, then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich departed Ukraine
following a series of protests in the country against his administration. '® Thereafter
there have been media accounts which reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin

“ordered work on ‘returning Crimea” immediately following President Yanukovich’s

departure.'*

The subsequent chain of events, which culminated in what has been referred to by the
Claimants as the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula to the Russian Federation, has
been extensively documented and features prominently in the Claimants’ pleadings.
The following account, excerpted from media reports contained in the record, provides
an overview of the most relevant events for present purposes which arose in the
context of Crimea’s incorporation into the Russian Federation (the “Incorporation’).
The Tribunal underlines that it is using the term “Incorporation” and later “Incorporation
Treaty”, rather than “annexation” or “Annexation Treaty,” in order to be clear that it
expresses no view on the legality of the incorporation of Crimea into the Russian
Federation, an issue the Tribunal need not resolve in order to decide the questions
before it.

On 23 February 2014, the leader of the Crimean “Russian Unity Party’, Mr. Sergei
Aksyonov, described the formation of “rapid-response groups” and patrols in
Simferopol to defend “the interests of the Crimeans and Crimean Russians who live in
the autonomous republic.”® Mr. Alexey Chaly, a Russian national, “emerged as the de

facto mayor” of Sevastopol on 25 February 2014."°

administrative complex in Simferopol, establishing control over the parliament and

above the building.” These forces also surrounded Ukrainian military bases and seized
control of the Simferopol and Belbek airports. In a special session, the parliament of

the Autonomous Republic of Crimea named Mr. Aksyonov as prime minister."®

On 28 February 2014, Russian military forces consolidated control over the Peninsula.
A Russian Black Sea Fleet missile boat blocked the exit to Balaklava Harbor to
Ukrainian State Border Service ships; a Russian armored personnel carrier was
observed on the streets of Sevastopol;'® and Russian military transport planes landed

outside Simferopol.7°

According to the Claimants, despite initial denials,2’ President Putin recognized in a
television appearance dated 17 April 2014 that Russian armed forces had been
involved in the seizure of control in Crimea, stating:

Russia did not annex Crimea by force. Russia created conditions—with the help
of special armed groups and the Armed Forces, | will say it straight—but only for
the free expression of the will of the people living in Crimea and Sevastopol. It
was the people themselves who made this decision. Russia answered their call
and welcomed the decision of Crimea and Sevastopol. This was natural, and it

could not have been any other way.22

Commissioner for Human Rights.°

On 18 March 2014, the “Republic of Crimea” and the “City of Special Status
Sevastopol,” the latter of which became known as the “Federal City of Sevastopol”
under Russian law, signed the “Treaty between the Russian Federation and the
Republic of Crimea on the Acceptance of the Republic of Crimea into the Russian
Federation and the Formation of New Constituent Parts within the Russian Federation”
(the “Incorporation Treaty”).?” The Russian Constitutional Court ruled that the
Incorporation Treaty was “consistent with the Russian Federation Constitution” on 19
March 2014,” and the Incorporation Treaty was approved by the lower and upper
houses of Russia’s parliament on 20 and 21 March 2014, respectively. 2° The
parliament also approved legislation in furtherance of the Incorporation: the Federal
Constitutional Law of the Russian Federation No. 6-FKZ “On Accepting the Republic of

THE FACTS RELATING TO THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENTS,

According to the witness statement of Mr. Uriel Laber, an executive in charge of the
commercial and financial operations of the Petrol Companies’ business, members of
Crimean “paramilitary forces” (the “Paramilitary Forces”) seized the Claimants’
Feodosia office on 22 April 2014. Mr. Laber recalls:

After arriving at my office in Miami, | called [a deputy] in Dnepropetrovsk,
Ukraine. He described to me the following events that had transpired earlier in
the day in Crimea:

e Mr. Karyagin, a director of Stabil LLC (the company that owned the building in
Feodosia from which Ukrnafta operated its Crimean business), was supposed
to travel from Crimea to Dnepropetrovsk (in continental Ukraine), but the

Paramilitary Forces prevented Mr. Karyagin from leaving Crimea.

e By 10:00 a.m. (Ukraine time), we could no longer reach the office in Feodosia
by telephone. At 10:30 a.m., an employee in the Feodosia office managed to
reach Mr. Topchiy and told him that the office had been seized by
approximately 20 gunmen. Before she could provide any additional details,

the phone line went dead.

e At about 2:30 p.m. (Ukraine time), Mr. Topchiy received another call from the
Feodosia office. The caller said that he had only 15 seconds to talk, and that
the Feodosia office had been seized. The connection was then cut. Fearing
for our employees’ safety, Mr. Topchiy repeatedly tried to call them throughout

the day, but he could not get through.°>

According to Mr. Laber, the armed men who took control of the Feodosia office
confiscated mobile phones and “abducted” two employees of PJSC Ukrnafta.°° The
office employees later reported that the office had been “looted” of computers, permits

and licenses, commercial documentation, and the equivalent of USD 800,000 in cash.°”

According to the Claimants, the Paramilitary Forces were “directed by the
Russian-installed Crimean authorities” and received “direct support’ from the
Respondent's military,** including in respect of the seizure of the Claimants’ Feodosia
office.*° They assert that the Paramilitary Forces (i) were installed by the Russian
Federation; (ii) were afforded the imprimatur of authority through a series of decrees
issued by the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol; and (iii) acted “on

On 30 April 2014, the State Council of the Republic of Crimea, which had been
established after the Incorporation and which the Claimants contend is a Russian State
organ,“ issued “a decree nationalizing certain properties” throughout the Peninsula.*+
That decree was amended on 3 September 2014 to include: (i) Stabil LLC’s office in
Feodosia; (ii) the Claimants’ petrol stations located in the Republic of Crimea,
excluding the stations within the Federal City of Sevastopol, a separately administered
entity under Russian law; (iii) the Claimants’ storage facility in Simferopol; and (iv) other
properties and real estate connected with, or believed to be connected with,
Mr. Kolomoisky.*° In announcing these amendments, Mr. Aksyonov, chairman of the
new Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, declared that “Kolomoisky is one of
the oligarchs who initiated and has been financing military operations in the southeast
of Ukraine where our compatriots are being killed; therefore it is our moral right and our

moral duty to carry out this nationalization.”

On 18 June 2014, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, the principal
federal investigative organ in Russia, opened a criminal investigation into
Mr. Kolomoisky. *” The Basmanny District Court in Moscow authorized

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND UKRAINE AS A NON-DISPUTING PARTY

SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF

As noted above, the Claimants consider that the Respondent has breached the
following provisions of the Treaty: (i) Article 5, relating to expropriation; (ii) Article 3,
prohibiting “measures discriminatory in nature that could interfere with the management
and disposal” of protected investments, and incorporating a most favored nation
(‘MFN”) clause; and (iii) Article 2, which provides that each Contracting Party
“guarantees, in accordance with its legislation, the full and unconditional legal

protection of investments by investors of the other Contracting Party.”

1. Article 5 of the BIT

The Claimants argue that, as of April 2014, Crimea’s Paramilitary Forces “seized and
looted” the Feodosia office building and began to operate the Claimants’ petrol
stations,®” measures which they consider to be attributable to the Respondent as
outlined in paragraph 66 above. The Claimants additionally note that, on 3 September
2014, the State Council of the Republic of Crimea formally nationalized the Claimants’
petrol stations located in the Republic of Crimea and, on 11 November 2014, in the
Federal City of Sevastopol.®* In the Claimants’ view, these measures qualify as a

2. Article 3 of the BIT

In addition to their pleadings with regard to Article 5, the Claimants submit that the
Respondent has also violated Article 3 of the Treaty. Article 3(1) requires Contracting
Parties to refrain from “measures discriminatory in nature that could interfere with the
management and disposal” of protected investors’ investments. The article also
includes an MFN clause that requires host States to provide protected investors
treatment that is “no less favorable than the treatment given to its own investors or

investors of any third state.”

First, the Claimants assert a claim under a theory of discriminatory treatment flowing
from the first clause of Article 3(1).°° Relying on AES Summit Generation Ltd. v.
Hungary, the Claimants suggest that discrimination is shown where a State “benefit[s]
or harm[s] someone more in comparison with the generality.”*' In the Claimants’ view,
the Respondent “left no doubt” that its actions discriminated against the Claimants and
were motivated by “political animus towards Mr. Kolomoisky.”°* They submit that such

conduct is devoid of an “objective or reasoned basis.”©°

Second, the Claimants invoke the MFN clause in Article 3.° In this connection, the
Claimants refer to Article 3(1) of the bilateral investment treaty between Canada and
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (the “Soviet Union”), which provides for fair
and equitable treatment and full protection and security.°° The Claimants consider the
Treaty to incorporate, and the Respondent to have violated, guarantees of fair and

equitable treatment and full protection and security.©

3. Article 2 of the BIT

The Claimants also claim a breach of Article 2 of the Treaty, which requires the
Respondent to guarantee “the full and unconditional legal protection of investments by
investors of the other Contracting Party.” According to the Claimants, the Russian
Federation failed to grant such protection when it “targeted” the Claimants based on
their connection with Mr. Kolomoisky, “ultimately destroying” their investments through

physical seizure and nationalization.©”

4. The Claimants’ Request for Relief
The Claimants request the Tribunal to issue an award:

(a) Ordering the Russian Federation to pay compensation for the injury to the
Petrol Companies; the Petrol Companies calculate that value as
USD 47,406,455;

(b) Ordering the Russian Federation to pay interest on the above amount at a
reasonable commercial rate compounded from 22 April 2014 until full payment

has been made;

(c) Ordering the Russian Federation to pay the Petrol Companies’ costs in these
arbitration proceedings in an amount to be specified later, together with interest
thereon, including all attorneys’ fees and expert witness fees, and as between the
parties, alone to bear the responsibility for compensating the Arbitral Tribunal, the

Appointing Authority, and the Permanent Court of Arbitration; and

(d) Ordering any other relief that the Tribunal may deem appropriate.

SUMMARY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION’S POSITION

The Respondent has not participated in these proceedings so far. Nevertheless, the
Tribunal understands the Respondent's Letters, quoted in full in paragraphs 5 and 6
above, to constitute an objection to jurisdiction and, a fortiori, an objection to the
Claimants’ requested relief. Specifically, the Russian Federation objected that the

Treaty “cannot serve as a basis for composing an arbitral tribunal to settle these

claims.” By reference to the definition of investment in Article 1(1) of the Treaty, it also
submitted that the assets in dispute are “situated in the territory of the Crimea and
Sevastopol, i.e., in the territory that was a part of Ukraine but at the present time [...]
forms an integral part of the territory of the Russian Federation and cannot be
regulated by the Treaty.”

SUMMARY OF UKRAINE’S POSITION

As stated in the procedural history above, in PO4 the Tribunal admitted the Submission
of Ukraine as a non-disputing party to the BIT. It did so on the basis of the general
procedural powers vested in it by Article 182(1) of the Swiss Federal Private
International Law Act (the “PILA”)® and by analogy with ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2)
and Articles 4 and 5 of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules, all of which recognize such
inherent powers of arbitral tribunals in investor-State disputes. In the exercise of its
procedural powers, the Tribunal found that Ukraine’s application to file a non-disputing
party submission met the criteria of Article 5(1) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules
for issues of interpretation of the BIT and the criteria of Articles 5(2) and 4(3) of such
Rules as well as ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) in respect of other matters, all these

provisions being applied by analogy.

In its Submission, Ukraine makes the following four main arguments in support of its
position that the Treaty should apply to and protect Ukrainian investments in Crimea.
First, according to Ukraine, the term “territory” as used in Article 1(4) of the Treaty
applies to territories occupied by, and under the effective control and jurisdiction of, the
relevant Contracting Party.”° Second, the Treaty’s application to Ukrainian investments
in Crimea is supported by international practice concerning situations of illegal
occupation.” Third, in light of the objective of the Treaty, there can be no doubt that it
applies to investments in Crimea initiated before the Russian occupation.” Finally, the
requirement of consistency in international law (allegans contraria non audiendus est)
precludes the Russian Federation from denying the Treaty’s application to Ukrainian

investments and investors in Crimea.”

ANALYSIS

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

Prior to considering the merits of the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal will address the
law governing this arbitration (1); the subject matter of this Award (2); the coordination
of parallel proceedings (3); the default of the Respondent (4); and the law applicable to
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, in which context it will also address the relevance of

previous decisions or awards (5).

1. Law Governing this Arbitration

This investment arbitration is seated in Geneva, Switzerland, and is thus governed by
Chapter 12 of the PILA.” It is also governed by any procedural rules found in the BIT
and by the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules.

2. Subject Matter of this Award

The present proceedings were bifurcated between jurisdiction and merits in
accordance with the Procedural Timetable (Scenario 2) in PO2. Thus, this Award deals

with the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the dispute submitted to it.

3. Coordination of Parallel Proceedings

In accordance with Article 5 of PO1, the present proceedings were conducted in
parallel with PCA Case No. 2015-35, Stabil LLC et al. (Ukraine) v. The Russian
Federation. |In light of the commonalities of fact and law and of the identical
composition of the tribunals in the two cases, the Tribunal sought to structure the
arbitral proceedings in such a manner as to minimize duplication and avoid
unnecessary costs whenever possible. In particular, a joint Hearing was held and the
Tribunal allowed a single PHB to be filed for both matters. However, the Tribunal deals

with the cases in separate awards.

4. Default of the Respondent

Although it has been advised of all procedural steps in this arbitration and invited to

participate in each of them, the Respondent has not taken part in the proceedings

PO1, Articles 9.1, 11.1.

23

89.

90.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 30 of 80

aside from submitting the Respondent's Letters. After the Respondent failed to submit
a Statement of Defense, the Tribunal ordered the proceedings to continue in
accordance with Article 28(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.’>

Under the UNCITRAL Rules and the /ex arbitri, an arbitration must proceed even if the
Respondent defaults. This said, unlike in court litigation in many jurisdictions, there is
no “default judgment” in arbitration. In other words, in spite of the default, a tribunal
cannot dispense with satisfying itself that the claims before it are well founded in fact

and in law. This rule applies to jurisdiction as well as to the merits.

In this context, the Claimants have argued that by electing not to participate in these
proceedings, the Respondent has waived any objections other than those raised in its
Letters. With reference to scholarly writings,’ the Claimants submit that Article 21 of
the UNCITRAL Rules” “by its wording suggests that the tribunal's far-reaching power
to rule on jurisdictional objections is limited to ‘objections’ to jurisdiction—that is, only if
raised by a party and not as a result of the tribunal's own initiative.” The Claimants
appreciate the Tribunal’s duty “to find the appropriate balance between assuring that
the non-participating party is treated fairly, [...] and not over-compensating for that
party's absence in a way that is unfair to the party that is participating.””® Nonetheless,
the Tribunal should bear in mind, say the Claimants, that the protection it gives to the
non-participating respondent “erodes the protection” of the claimant under the
applicable rules, with the result that “the greater the protection to the respondent the

more progressive is the shift in the balance in its favour.””°

Pursuant to Article 28(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, “[iJf, within the period of time fixed by the
arbitral tribunal, the respondent has failed to communicate his statement of defence without
showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal shall order that the proceedings
continue.”

Performance of Contracts, in INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION: IMPORTANT
CONTEMPORARY QUESTIONS, p. 235 (Albert Jan van den Berg, ed., 2003) (CLA-182).

In accordance with Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules, “[t]he arbitral tribunal shall have the power
to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the
existence or validity of the arbitration clause or of the separate arbitration agreement.”

The Tribunal has taken note of the Claimants’ submission and considers that the
Parties have been treated in accordance with their fundamental procedural rights. This
being so, it underlines that it has a duty to ascertain its jurisdiction ex officio whenever
jurisdiction is sought to be established on the basis of an international treaty. This rule
appears even more justified when the respondent does not participate.

5. Law Governing Jurisdiction

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is governed by the BIT, interpreted in application of Articles
31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”),®° to which both
Russia and Ukraine are parties since 1986,°' and which also reflect customary
international law. In addition, the Tribunal may also look to other rules of international
law which may apply as between the Contracting Parties. Finally, national law may
further be relevant to the jurisdictional requirements depending on the issues involved,
particularly if the BIT contains a reference to national law® or uses a term that can only

be understood by reference to national law.®*

When applying the governing law, be it international or national, the Tribunal is not
bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. Under the maxim iura
novit curia—or, better, iura novit arbiter—the Tribunal is required to apply the law of its
own motion, provided it seeks the Parties’ views if it intends to base its decision on a
legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably

anticipate.®*

1155 UNTS 331 (1969) (CLA-24).

The VCLT entered into force on 27 January 1980. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic
acceded to the VCLT on 14 May 1986, while the Soviet Union acceded to it on 29 April 1986
(Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the General Secretary, United Nations Treaty Collection
Website, Chapter XXIII (23 May 1969) (CLA-113)). Ukraine is the legal successor of the
Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and Russia assumed the treaty obligations of the Soviet
Union upon its dissolution.

See, inter alia, Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational
State of Bolivia, \CSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, § 47 (27 September 2012).

This determination of applicable law is in line with Article 178 PILA. As to its form, there is no
question that the arbitration agreement is in writing under Article 178(1). As to the law governing
substantive validity, the determination just made accords with the first two options of Article
178(2) PILA, being specified that the Contracting States consent to jurisdiction and applicable law
when concluding the treaty and the investor when starting an arbitration under it.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 32 of 80

The Tribunal also notes that the Claimants as well as Ukraine have referred to a large
number of arbitral awards and decisions dealing with international investment law and
other areas of international law. The Tribunal considers that, while it is not bound by
previous decisions, in its judgment it must give due consideration to earlier decisions of
international tribunals. Specifically, it believes that, absent contrary grounds, it should
in principle adhere to rules established on comparable facts in a series of consistent

cases.®°

In this context, the Tribunal further observes that, as can be seen from the procedural
history above, it had the opportunity to review the decisions on jurisdiction issued in
PCA Case No. 2015-07, Aeroport Belbek LLC and Mr. Igor Valerievich Kolomoisky v.
The Russian Federation, PCA Case No. 2015-21, PJSC CB PrivatBank and Finance
Company Finilon LLC v. The Russian Federation, and PCA Case No. 2015-36, Everest
Estate LLC et al. v. The Russian Federation. These decisions, rendered under the BIT
at issue here, dealt at least in part with legal issues analogous or identical to the ones
before this Tribunal. While the Tribunal has formed its opinion independently and
exclusively on the basis of the record before it, it notes the convergence of the

outcomes reached by the different tribunals.

RELEVANT TREATY PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Turning next to the specific treaties applicable in the present case, in particular the BIT
and the VCLT, the Tribunal notes that the following BIT provisions may be relevant to

the present dispute:
e Article 1 of the BIT reads, in relevant part, as follows:

1. The term “investments” means any kind of tangible and intangible
assets [which are] invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the
territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation,
including:
a) movable and immovable property, as well as any other related
property rights;
b) monetary funds, as well as securities, commitments, stock and
other forms of participation;

Annulment, § 295 (7 January 2015).

Arbitrator Stern does not analyze the arbitrator's role in the same manner, as she considers it her
duty to decide each case on its own merits, independently of any apparent jurisprudential trend.

26

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 33 of 80

c) intellectual property rights, including copyrights and related
rights, trademarks, rights to inventions, industrial designs, models,
as well as technical processes and know-how;

d) rights to engage in commercial activity, including rights to the
exploration, development and exploitation of natural resources.

Any alteration of the type of investments in which the assets are invested
shall not affect their nature as investments, provided that such alteration
is not contrary to legislation of a Contracting Party in the territory of which
the investments were made.

2. The term “investor of a Contracting Party” means:

a) any natural person having the citizenship of the state of that
Contracting Party and who is competent in accordance with its
legislation to make investments in the territory of the other
Contracting Party;

b) any legal entity constituted in accordance with the legislation in
force in the territory of that Contracting Party, provided that the said
legal entity is competent in accordance with legislation of that
Contracting Party, to make investments in the territory of the other
Contracting Party.

Led

4. The term “territory” means the territory of the Russian Federation or
the territory of Ukraine as well as their respective exclusive economic
zone and the continental shelf, defined in accordance with international
law.

5. The term “legislation of the Contracting Party” means legislation of the
Russian Federation or Ukraine, respectively.

Article 9 of the BIT states, in relevant part, as follows:

1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the
other Contracting Party arising in connection with investments, including
disputes concerning the amount, terms, and payment procedures of the
compensation provided for by Article 5 hereof, or the payment transfer
procedures provided for by Article 7 hereof, shall be subject to a written
notice, accompanied by detailed comments, which the investor shall
send to the Contracting Party involved in the dispute. The parties to the
dispute shall endeavor to settle the dispute through negotiations if
possible.

2. If the dispute cannot be resolved in this manner within six months after
the date of the written notice mentioned in paragraph 1 of this article, it
shall be referred to:

L.]

c) an “ad hoc” arbitration tribunal, in accordance with the Arbitration
Regulations of the United Nations Commission for International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL).

27

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 34 of 80

e Further, Article 12 of the BIT has the following content:

This Agreement shall apply to all investments made by investors of one
Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, on or
after January 1, 1992.

97. Furthermore, it is recalled that Article 31 of the VCLT provides the following rules on

treaty interpretation:

(1) A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their
context and in the light of its object and purpose.

(2) The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall
comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

a. Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made
between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the
treaty;

b. Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by
the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

(3) There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

a. Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

b. Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its
interpretation;

c. Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the parties.
(4) Aspecial meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the
parties so intended.

e Article 32 of the VCLT adds the following:

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation,
including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its
conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the
application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the
interpretation according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

e Furthermore, Article 29 of the VCLT, entitled “Territorial Scope of Treaties”,

provides as follows:

Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise
established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire
territory.

28

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 35 of 80

e Article 26 of the VCLT, entitled “Pacta Sunt Servanda”, states that:

Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be
performed by them in good faith.

98. On the basis of the BIT provisions set out above, the following requirements must be
met for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction: the dispute must fall within the territorial (C)
and the temporal (D) scope of application of the Treaty; the Claimants must qualify as
“investors” under the Treaty (E); and they must have made an “investment” in the

territory of the Respondent State in accordance with the host State’s legislation (F).

99. One issue pervades practically all the themes just listed. It arises because State control
over Crimea changed between the time when the investments were made and the time
when they were allegedly taken (or otherwise affected by State measures). The Treaty,
like all investment treaties, is conceived for investments by nationals of one State that
own or control investments in another State. The present situation is different. At the
time of the investment, the assets at stake were located in the territory and were under
the control of the investor's home State. Through the Incorporation, control over
Crimea, the location of the investment, changed, with the result that what had been an

investment in Ukraine became an investment in Crimea.

100. This specific feature of the dispute, while linked to the timing of the investment,
essentially raises the issue of the territorial scope of application of the BIT and the
definition of “territory” under the BIT. However, it is recurrent in various aspects of the
analysis, such as in the context of the definition of “investment” in Article 1(1) of the
BIT, which refers to “assets [...] invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the
territory of the other Contracting Party.”®° Similarly, Article 12 of the BIT, which defines
the Treaty’s temporal scope of application, also speaks of “investments [...] made by
investors [...] in the territory of the other Contracting Party.”°”

101. In essence, the question is whether investments made by Ukrainian nationals in
Ukraine came under the protection of the Russia-Ukraine BIT because the territory of
Ukraine where the investments were made came under the control of Russia. In other
words, does the Treaty bind Russia in respect of investments made in Crimea prior to
the Incorporation? If the answer is affirmative, the Tribunal will then review the other

jurisdictional requirements separately taking into account its previous conclusion and,

in particular, the relevant point in time to assess the jurisdictional requirements. A

negative answer, by contrast, will put an end to the enquiry.

In view of the recurrent relevance of this question in the assessment of the various
jurisdictional requirements, the Tribunal will address it at the outset of its analysis.
Before turning to it, the Tribunal, however, notes that it is satisfied that there is a
dispute between the Claimants and Russia, that the Claimants have given an
appropriate notice of such dispute,®* and that the requirements of Article 9(2) BIT are

met.®°

TERRITORIAL SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF THE TREATY
1. The Parties’ Positions

In the Claimants’ view, a treaty extends to “all territories which are ‘controlled and
administered’ by the parties” to that treaty.°° Noting that the status of Russia’s
annexation of Crimea is heavily disputed under international law, °' the Claimants
submit that the Tribunal “does not need to resolve the controversy between Russia and
the international community” with regard to the legality of the annexation in order to
adjudicate the present dispute.°* Specifically, they submit as follows:

The Petrol Companies are not asking the Tribunal to find that the Russian
Federation’s invasion and Annexation of Crimea were legal or to recognize the
Crimean referendum as legitimate. Nor are the Petrol Companies asking the
Tribunal to find the opposite and hold that the Russian Federation's invasion and

Annexation of Crimea were illegal.

27 Heidelberg J. Int'l L., pp. 483, 488-489 (1967) (CLA-93). Ukraine has also relied on the
writings of Professor Doehring, then-Director of the Max Planck Institute, who observed, shortly
before the VCLT was concluded, that under Article 29, application of a treaty to a State’s
“territory” could include “occupied zones” held by that State. Professor Doehring went on to note
that where a State purports to annex such territory, application of the treaty does “not imply the
recognition of [the] annexation.” According to Ukraine, contemporary authorities confirm this point
(Submission of Ukraine, § 9).

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 37 of 80

Rather, the Petrol Companies are asking the Tribunal simply to find that, as a
result of the Russian Federation’s establishment of de facto control over Crimea
and its assertion of sovereign authority there, Ukrainian investors with
investments on the territory of the Crimean Peninsula are entitled to invoke the
protections of the BIT and to arbitrate their claims for compensation for injuries
they have sustained due to the Russian Federation’s unlawful interference with

their investments.°°

104. Accordingly, the Claimants suggest that the Tribunal merely needs to find that

105.

93,

94

95

Ukrainian investors are “entitled” to invoke the BIT as a result of Russian factual control
and assertion of sovereignty over Crimea. In this connection, the Claimants submit
that: Russia has established de facto control in and asserted sovereignty over Crimea
(a); under Article 29 of the VCLT, Russia’s Treaty obligations apply to all areas in which
it exercises control and has asserted sovereignty (b); and no “different intention” rebuts
Article 29 of the VCLT (c).

(a) Russia’s presence in Crimea

The Claimants submit that the de facto control of the Respondent over Crimea

“continues uninterrupted” since 27 February 2014.% The Claimants add:

Crimea became part of the “territory” of the Russian Federation within the
meaning of Article 1.4 [of] the BIT, and the Russian Federation began to incur
obligations to Ukrainian investments in Crimea, on 27 February 2014, when the
Russian Federation forcibly took possession of Crimea and assumed the function
of a State to the exclusion of the Ukrainian authorities, as part of a planned and

premeditated effort to permanently make Crimea Russian territory.

In the weeks that followed, the Russian Federation purported to legitimize its
control and authority over Crimea though the integration of Crimea into its federal
system of government. Specifically, on 18 March 2014, the Russian Federation
signed the Annexation Treaty. [...] Thus, Russian law has, since 18 March 2014,
served as the vehicle through which the Russian Federation purported to assert

de jure sovereignty over Crimea.

. Thus, Russia “took steps [...] to assert de jure sovereignty” over Crimea pursuant to

Russian law; this was accomplished by dividing the Peninsula into two new juridical
units, or “federal subjects,” i.e., the Federal City of Sevastopol and the Republic of
Crimea.® In this regard, the Claimants note that Article 9 of the Incorporation Treaty®”
provides that the “laws and other statutes and regulations of the Russian Federation
shall apply on the territories” of the two new federal subjects, effective from the date of
the Republic of Crimea’s acceptance into the Russian Federation and the formation of
its new constituent parts.°* The fact that Russian legislation itself explicitly provides that
the territorial scope of Russian law extends to Crimea, they submit, is indicative of
Russia’s intent to become bound by its international obligations in respect of Crimea as
well. The Claimants also note the conclusion of their Russian law expert, Professor
Maggs, who explains that the Russian Constitution incorporates the Respondent's

treaties into the domestic legal system.”

(b) Russia’s Treaty obligations in light of Article 29 VCLT

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s Treaty obligations extend to all territory
over which it asserts sovereignty and jurisdiction. In this respect, they rely principally on
Article 29 of the VCLT, which provides that, “[uJnless a different intention appears from
the treaty or is otherwise established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of

its entire territory.”""°

For the Claimants, the reference in Article 29 to the “entire territory’ includes “all
territory over which a State asserts sovereignty or exercises jurisdiction.” '°' The
Claimants further observe that the VCLT, unlike the Vienna Convention on the
Succession of States in respect of Treaties (the “VCST”)'?, is not limited in its
application to situations in “conformity with international law.”' The Claimants do not
consider the VCST to be a relevant or helpful basis of reference in this dispute because
its application is limited by Article 6 to “succession of States occurring in conformity

with international law.”'* As opposed to the VCST, Article 29 VCLT may be applied
“without having to accept” (or otherwise adjudicate) the lawfulness of the annexation.1°°

In this context, the Claimants have referred to the travaux of the VCLT and its
commentary in support of the argument that a State’s treaty obligations apply to its
entire territory, including any new territory over which a State asserts sovereignty and
exercises jurisdiction, whether it does so legally or illegally. They also submit that
their position in the context of the VCLT is supported by State practice,'°’ even with
regard to extending treaty obligations of an annexing State to territory acquired
forcibly.'°° Such State practice is alleged to include the annexations of (i) Hawaii by the
USA in 1898; (ii) Austria by Germany in 1938; and (iii) the Baltic States by the Soviet
Union in 1940."°° With regard to contemporary State practice, the Claimants further cite
the practice of the USA, which, they suggest, deems treaties to extend “to all territories
which are ‘controlled and administered’ by the parties.”""°

The Claimants also assert that international law “continues to apply treaties of an
occupying power” to unlawfully occupied territory, even after the introduction of the
United Nations Charter and its prohibition on the use of force.'"' They cite, for instance,
the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (the “ICJ”), declaring that the
prohibition on invoking or applying treaties concluded by South Africa on behalf of
Namibia, a territory deemed illegally occupied by the international community, could not

apply to “certain general conventions such as those of a humanitarian character.”"'2

Ukraine has also underlined that the ICJ made clear in the Wall Advisory Opinion that
“essentially territorial” treaties may apply “both to territories over which a State party
has sovereignty and to those areas over which that State exercises territorial
jurisdiction.” It is therefore widely understood that a State exercises “territorial
jurisdiction as the occupying power” over the territory which it effectively controls.''?

It is the Claimants’ additional submission that the jurisprudence of the European Court
of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”) provides similar support for their proposition. The
ECtHR held that “certain legal arrangements and transactions” remained in effect
despite the Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus.''4 The Claimants draw particular
attention to the ECtHR’s concern that “any other finding”, namely one in which States
would be exempted from treaty obligations with respect to unlawfully occupied territory,
“would result in a regrettable vacuum in the system of human rights protection.”""5 In
the Claimants’ submission, the policy underlying the ECtHR’s jurisprudence militates in
favor of the application of bilateral investment treaties to occupied territories, since
these treaties “protect[] the rights of individuals and other third parties—investors—

against State conduct that violates international law.”""®

The Claimants further argue that they “immediately became foreign investors in the
Russian Federation upon the unlawful imposition of Russian authority and jurisdiction
over Crimea and Claimants’ investments, and the Russian Federation’s conduct quickly

demonstrated their need for treaty protection.”1”

The Claimants conclude that the Tribunal should apply Article 29 of the VCLT in order
to “hold the Russian Federation to its obligations to Ukrainian investors in Crimea
under the BIT.”""8

(c) No “different intention” rebuts Article 29 VCLT

While they acknowledge that Article 29 of the VCLT does not apply to cases where “a
different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established,” the Claimants

argue that no such intention is established in this case. ''?

i. No different intention exists under the BIT

The Claimants submit that an intention contrary to Article 29 does not appear in the
Treaty’s use of the term “territory”. Relying on Article 31 of the VCLT,'° the Claimants
consider that a reading of the BIT, “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning” of its text, the Treaty’s context, and its object and purpose, “reveals no

intention” to deviate from Article 29.

The Claimants also submit that the Treaty provides for its “expansive application”.'2'
Article 1(4), for example, defines “territory” as “the territory of the Russian Federation or
the territory of Ukraine as well as their respective exclusive economic zone and the
continental shelf, defined in accordance with international law.” According to the
Claimants, the correct interpretation of Article 1(4) of the Treaty is that “in accordance
with international law” modifies only the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone
of each Contracting Party; it does not modify or concern the Treaty’s definition of
“territory” such as to potentially exclude the Claimants’ investment owing to the change
of control over Crimea.'22

The Claimants also suggest that a distinction between a broad definition of “territory”,
on the one hand, and more specific constraints placed on the continental shelf and

exclusive economic zone, on the other, is present in the Russian Constitution itself,

where Article 67 addresses the two categories in separate subparagraphs. '° Since
Russian law is the “mechanism by which the Russian Federation has purported to
assert de jure sovereignty” over Crimea, the Claimants assert that Russian law is a

relevant factor in construing the words of Article 1(4) of the BIT."

Even if the phrase “in accordance with international law’ did refer to terrestrial territory,
the Claimants contend that the effect would be to expressly incorporate into the
definition of Article 1(4) the rule of customary international law found in Article 29 of the
VCLT.125

The Claimants insist that the Respondent’s approach in other bilateral investment
treaties is instructive.'7° According to the Claimants, the Respondent has previously
agreed to the inclusion of provisions limiting the territorial scope of its bilateral
investment treaties. '?” In the absence of similar provisions in the current BIT, the
“ordinary meaning” of the term “territory” should prevail, with the effect that the BIT
should be read to cover “the entire territory’ over which the Respondent asserts
sovereignty.'28

In the Claimants’ view, international jurisprudence supports the proposition that, absent
such contrary intent, “generic” terms (such as “territory”) are best approached with an
interpretive flexibility permitting adjustment in the face of changes in circumstances. '°
The Claimants rely on ICJ jurisprudence in the Aegean Sea Continental Shelf case,'°

such as “territorial status”, “the protection of the environment’, and “commerce” by
similarly taking into account the terms’ contemporary meaning.'** The Claimants argue
that the present Treaty already endorses such an evolutionary approach in Article 1(4),
which construes the continental shelf “as defined in conformity with international law,”
thus embracing, implicitly or by extension, the above approach.'*4

. Finally, the Claimants consider an expansive interpretation of “territory” to be consistent
with the BIT’s object and purpose, noting especially the Treaty’s aspiration, in its
preamble, to the “expansion of economic cooperation between the Contracting Parties”
and its purpose to “create and maintain favorable conditions” for investment between
Russia and Ukraine." In the Claimants’ view, excluding investments in Crimea from

the Treaty’s scope “would not serve this purpose.”"°°

ii. No different intention is “otherwise established”

. Having argued that the Treaty contains no intention to deviate from the rule set forth in
Article 29 of the VCLT, the Claimants next submit that no extrinsic element indicates

the existence of such an intention.

. The Claimants note, first, that Article 15 of the Russian Constitution provides that
treaties form an integral part of Russian law.'%’ Article 17 of the Russian Constitution
also refers to “generally recognized principles and norms of international law.”'** In the
Claimants’ view, Russia therefore “recognizes the validity’ of its international
obligations, including with respect to the territory of the Republic of Crimea and the

Federal City of Sevastopol.'°?

In addition, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s statements demonstrate the
understanding that Crimea comprises part of its territory.4° This understanding, they
argue, is reflected in numerous statements of Russian officials ‘41 and in the
Respondent's Letters. “2 In the Claimants’ submission, the Respondent must “act
consistently” with those assertions, in compliance with its obligation of good faith under
international law.'4° Similarly, theories of estoppel could also be relied upon to “confirm”

the Respondent's previous assertions. "44

Finally, the Claimants note that the Respondent has not attempted to argue that
illegality in its conduct may justify excluding the application of the Treaty to Crimea.'4°
In any event, the Claimants stress that it is well established that a State may not rely on

its own illegal acts to defeat jurisdiction.'4°

2. Analysis

The Claimants have emphasized that the exercise of jurisdiction under the BIT does
not require the Tribunal “to resolve the controversy between Russia and the
international community over the legality of the Russian Federation’s Annexation of
Crimea.” '*’ The Claimants do not ask the Tribunal to find that “the Russian
Federation’s invasion and Annexation of Crimea were legal or to recognize the

Crimean referendum as legitimate”; nor do they ask it “to find the opposite.”"“°

The Tribunal has noted the Claimants’ observations. It deems its mission limited to

assessing whether it has jurisdiction under the BIT. Therefore, in the analysis that

follows, it expresses no view on the legality of Crimea’s incorporation into Russia or on
the legitimacy of the sovereignty claims over this territory.14°

129. Before embarking on the interpretation and application of the BIT, it may be worthwhile
to stress the obvious: the Treaty is in force. Neither Contracting Party has sought to
terminate, suspend, or amend the Treaty; nor have they taken any steps to terminate

its application with respect to investments in Crimea.'©°

130. The Tribunal will begin its analysis by recalling some facts (Section VI.C.2(a)). It will
then interpret the BIT in light of the VCLT, namely, in accordance with the ordinary
meaning of terms placed in their context and taking account of the BIT’s object and

purpose, viewed in good faith (Section VI.C.2(b)).

(a) Russia’s effective control of and assertion of sovereignty over Crimea

131.

The facts pertaining to the events that took place in Crimea in 2014 have been
described in detail above (§§ 53 ff.). Among them, the following events are particularly

relevant to the Tribunal’s analysis:

By the end of February 2014, the Russian military forces had consolidated control

over Crimea.

ii. On 1 March 2014, Russia formally authorized the “use [of] the armed forces of the

Russian Federation” in Crimea.

iii. On 18 March 2014, Russia and the Republic of Crimea concluded the
Incorporation Treaty, which formally admitted Crimea into the Russian Federation
and subjected it to Russia’s laws (“[t]he Republic of Crimea shall be considered
accepted into the Russian Federation from the date of signing of this treaty’"’).

The Russian Constitutional Court and the upper and lower houses of Russia's

449° The Tribunal observes that the Bel/bek tribunal took a similar view and noted that “this Interim
Award does not reach any view on the legality or illegality under international law of the
incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula by the Russian Federation or on the sovereignty claims of
Ukraine and the Russian Federation in respect of the Crimean Peninsula. None of the findings
contained in this Interim Award are intended to take any position on such matters” (Interim Award,
§ 158 (24 February 2017) (CLA-269)).

150 Russia’s assertion in its letter of 12 August 2015 that the “property in question [...] cannot be
regulated by the [Treaty]” has no impact on this conclusion, particularly considering that Russia
has taken no action to denounce or terminate the Treaty’s general application with respect to
Crimea.

parliament approved the Incorporation Treaty. Shortly thereafter, the Crimean
Integration Law was adopted, providing for the creation of new courts and various
new administrative bodies for Crimea.'®? Such courts were required to adjudicate

cases under Russian procedural law.'®>

iv. On 19 March 2014, the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to
the United Nations submitted President Putin’s 18 March 2014 speech—in which
he maintained that “Crimea has always been an inseparable part of Russia’—as

“an official document of the General Assembly [...] and of the Security Council.”"*4

v. On 21 March 2014, President Putin held a signing ceremony for the Incorporation

Treaty,'°> which entered into force with retroactive effect as of 18 March 2014.1°°

vi. The Russian authorities also adopted a constitution for Crimea, which entered into
force on 12 April 2014 and which inter alia calls for the application of “international
treaties of the Russian Federation” to Crimea. ‘°”

Federation.

See, e.g., a letter by the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United
Nations circulating Russia's reservation to the 2014 Annual Report of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, noting that the report asserted that Crimea and Sevastopol were part of Ukraine
in the applicable period and stating: “This assertion is false [...] [and] the Russian Federation
cannot agree to any parts of the Annual Report [...] which contradict objective reality” (Letter from
the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations Addressed to the
Secretary-General, U.N. Doc A/70/555 (5 November 2015) (C-150)).

these proceedings, stating explicitly that Crimea “forms an integral part of the

territory of the Russian Federation.”'°

In light of these facts, there can be no doubt that the Russian Federation has
established effective control over Crimea, by taking physical control coupled with legal
steps. It is equally clear that the Respondent considers Crimea as part of its sovereign
territory; it treats it as such in its national law and claims sovereignty vis-a-vis the

international community.

In its non-disputing party submission, Ukraine acknowledges that the Russian
Federation has established control over Crimea, while challenging the legality of

Russia’s conduct:

Ukraine considers that the Russian Federation, although it has not lawfully
assumed any rights pertaining to sovereignty in Crimea, has by its conduct
assumed international obligations in its administration of Crimea, particularly with
respect to treaties benefiting individual rights or other innocent third parties. '®

Properly interpreted, the Treaty requires the Russian Federation to afford
investment protection to Ukrainian investors in Crimea, a territory over which
Russia exercises jurisdiction and effective control. '°*

In fact, Ukraine has enacted long term legislation and thus accepts as a matter of fact
that the control is not merely temporary: “as reflected in Ukrainian legislation, Crimea is
presently occupied by, and under the effective control and jurisdiction of, the Russian
Federation.”'® Thus, even if it disputes Russia’s claims of sovereignty over Crimea,

Ukraine recognizes the factual situation and Russia’s de facto control of Crimea.

(b) The application of the BIT to the Claimants’ investments in Crimea in
light of the VCLT

In accordance with Article 31 VCLT, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith,
according to the ordinary meaning of its terms, read in their context and in light of the
BIT’s object and purpose and with due regard to any other relevant rules of

international law applicable in the relations between the Contracting Parties.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 32 VCLT, if through the application of Article 31 VCLT
the meaning of a provision or a term of a treaty were to remain unclear or lead to a
manifestly unreasonable result, the travaux préparatoires and the negotiating history
may also be used as supplementary means of interpretation.

As noted above, both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the VCLT. Moreover, the treaty
interpretation standards set forth in Articles 31 and 32 VCLT are also generally
accepted as reflecting customary international law.'* The Tribunal will thus apply these
standards and interpret the Treaty in accordance with the ordinary meaning of terms (i)
placed in their context (ii) taking account of the Treaty’s object and purpose (iii),

interpreted in good faith (iv).

i. Ordinary meaning

Article 31(1) VCLT provides that a treaty should be interpreted “in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty.” Indeed, the starting point of
treaty interpretation is the text of the Treaty'® and it is “reasonable to assume [...] that

the ordinary meaning is most likely to reflect what the parties intended.”'

According to the Claimants, “the ordinary meaning of the term ‘territory’ in the

Russia-Ukraine BIT should be the entire territory over which the Russian Federation

VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES: A COMMENTARY (Oliver Dorr and Kirsten
Schmalenbach eds., 2012), p. 523, noting that the ICJ has consistently “applied the rules of
interpretation laid down in the Convention as codified custom to virtually every treaty that came

the position under customary international law” (footnotes omitted).

asserts sovereignty or exercises jurisdiction, including Crimea.”'®” In assessing the
validity of the Claimants’ position, the Tribunal has in particular considered the
following arguments and circumstances, not without noting beforehand that both
languages of the BIT are equally authoritative under Article 31(1) VCLT."

140. First, several English, Ukrainian, and Russian legal dictionaries commonly define
“territory” with reference to all areas under a State’s jurisdiction and control, without
reference to sovereignty.'®° In a similar vein, Judge Crawford has also observed that
the terms “territory[, ...] sovereignty and jurisdiction” are “not employed very
consistently,” and that situations arise where “territorial administration [is] separated
from state sovereignty.”1”°

141.

Second, the meaning referring to jurisdiction and control is not contradicted by
Article 1(4) of the BIT, which reads: “The term ‘territory’ means the territory of the
Russian Federation or the territory of Ukraine as well as their respective exclusive
economic zone and the continental shelf, defined in accordance with international law.”
Indeed, from a natural and grammatical reading of Article 1(4), it seems clear that the
term “in accordance with international law” refers to the exclusive economic zone and
the continental shelf, and not to the term “territory”. As the Claimants correctly point

out, other Russian bilateral investment treaties confirm that the phrase “in accordance

167 Statement of Claim, § 3.38.

168 The Treaty provides that it was “[e]xecuted in Moscow in November 27, 1998 in two counterparts,
each one in the Russian and the Ukrainian languages, both texts having equal force.” In
accordance with Article 33 VCLT, “[w]hen a treaty has been authenticated in two or more
languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the
parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.” In this context, the
Tribunal also notes that it retained the services of a professional translator to determine whether
there were any significant differences between the two authoritative language versions of the
Treaty (see § 30 above and the 1% Harmonization Chart dated 25 May 2016 provided by the
translator, Mr. Vesler). On this basis, the Tribunal identified no differences in the Ukrainian and
Russian versions of the Treaty that would have any impact on the Tribunal’s findings.

effective exercise of jurisdiction even when it is clear that the state exercising jurisdiction has not
been the beneficiary of any lawful and definitive act of disposition” (Statement of Claim, § 3.25,
referring to lan Brownlie, PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW (7th ed. 2008), p. 112

with international law” is concerned with maritime concepts, because it only appears in
treaties with States that have maritime borders."

Third, there is simply no indication in Article 1(4) or in any other provision of the Treaty
that the ordinary meaning of the term “territory” should be interpreted restrictively in
order to include only areas over which a State has lawful title “in accordance with
international law,”'”? which would require the Tribunal to decide the issue of the legality
of the incorporation of Crimea into the Russian Federation. Unlike the maritime
concepts (i.e., exclusive economic zones and continental shelves), which are often
defined with a greater degree of specificity under multilateral conventions such as the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,'” there is nothing in the BIT that
would imply an intention to strictly limit the Contracting Parties’ territorial boundaries. '”+
As noted by UNCTAD:

The geographical scope of application of a BIT depends on the definition of the
term “territory.” The purpose of defining this term is not to delimit the territory of
the Contracting Parties; that is an aspect normally dealt with in national
constitutions. Rather, the rationale derives from the objective of investment
protection, in particular to provide that investments located in maritime areas
beyond the boundaries of the territorial waters are deemed to be within the
parties’ territory for the purposes of the agreement.'7°

Claimants’ Answers, § 2.1.9, in response to the Tribunal’s question to the Parties as to whether
“the term ‘in accordance with international law’ in Article 1.4 of the BIT refer[s] to both the
Contracting Parties’ (i) territory and (ii) the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf or
only to (ii)?” (see the Tribunal's questions to the Parties of 22 April 2016, § 2.1).

The Tribunal also notes that the Be/bek tribunal came to a similar conclusion: “As for the phrase
‘in accordance with international law’ in Article 1(4), the Tribunal considers that it only concerns
the definition of the two States’ exclusive economic zones and continental shelf, not the definition
of ‘territory’ as a whole. This reading is consistent with the ordinary meaning of this provision and
is supported by the investment treaty practice of the Russian Federation” (Interim Award, § 199
(24 February 2017) (CLA-269) (footnotes omitted)). The Everest tribunal, on the other hand, did
not consider the construction of the phrase “in accordance with international law” in Article 1(4)
relevant for purposes of ascertaining its jurisdiction “given declarations of both State parties to the
BIT after the annexation of Crimea,” and the fact that there was “no indication in the Russian
Federation's conduct that it has the intention to exclude Crimea from the application of the BIT”
(Decision on Jurisdiction, § 147 (20 March 2017) (CLA-269)).

Fourth, the Tribunal notes that, whenever they deemed it necessary, the Contracting
Parties explicitly limited the territorial scope of application of other bilateral investment
treaties. '7° In fact, a number of bilateral investment treaties concluded by Ukraine
specifically define “territory” with reference to “sovereignty”.'”’ No such limitations are

contained in the Ukraine-Russia Treaty.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that it had invited the Parties’ views on the relevance, if any,
of Russian law in construing the meaning of “territory” in Article 1(4) of the BIT. 1° The
Claimants replied that “Russian law is relevant [...] to the extent that [it] is the
mechanism by which the Russian Federation has purported to assert de jure
sovereignty over Crimea.”'”° As the Tribunal has already noted, it cannot be seriously
disputed that, having incorporated Crimea into its territory by various legal and
constitutional measures, Russia considers that its “territory” encompasses Crimea,

which the Tribunal finds relevant for the purposes of its present analysis. '®°
Importantly, Ukraine has also acknowledged that:

[wlithin the meaning of the Treaty, “territory of the Russian Federation” presently
includes Crimea because it is occupied and administered by the Russian

Federation, despite Russia’s lack of a valid claim to sovereignty. This

For example, Russia's bilateral investment treaty with the United Kingdom excludes the United
Kingdom's self-governing, overseas dependent territories (Agreement between the Government
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments,
Article 1(e)(i) (6 April 1989) (CLA-16)). Similarly, the Protocol accompanying Russia's bilateral
investment treaty with China expressly excludes that treaty’s application to the Macao Special
Administrative Region (Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the
Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments, Protocol (9 November 2006) (CLA-10)). See also Statement of Claim, § 3.38.

Ukraine's Submission, § 14, referring to other bilateral investment treaties concluded by Ukraine
and Russia which explicitly define “territory” of a party as “the territory under its sovereignty” (see,
inter alia, Agreement between the Government of Ukraine and the Government of the Republic of
Lithuania on the Encouragement and Mutual Protection of Investments, Article 1(4) (8 February
1994) (CLA-220)).

See the Tribunal’s questions to the Parties of 22 April 2016, § 2.4: “What is the relevance, if any,
of Russian law in construing the meaning of territory in Article 1.4 of the BIT? To what extent, if
any, is Russian law relevant in determining whether the Respondent has asserted de facto and/or
de jure sovereignty over Crimea under international law?”

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 52 of 80

interpretation of the Treaty follows from the ordinary meaning of the word
“territory,” interpreted in the context of the Treaty’s other provisions, in good faith,

and in light of the Treaty’s object and purpose.‘®"

On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that the ordinary meaning of the term “territory”
includes areas over which the Contracting Parties exercise jurisdiction and de facto
control, even if they hold no lawful title under international law. For completeness, the
Tribunal notes that its conclusion finds further support in the open-ended manner in
which the term “territory” has been interpreted in Article 29 VCLT, which establishes
the widely-accepted rule that a treaty applies to the State’s “entire territory”, unless the
Contracting Parties have expressed a “different intention” with regard to the Treaty’s

territorial scope. "8?

Indeed, a number of authorities have expressed support for a broad definition of the
term “entire territory” in Article 29 VCLT, not limited to lawful territory under
international law. It has been observed that the application of a treaty to a State’s
“territory” could include “occupied zones” held by that State'®® and that “recognition

under international law of the State and its territory is not required.”"®*

Most recently, the Belbek tribunal also held that the term “territory” in Article 29 VCLT
should be interpreted broadly, '® whilst the Everest tribunal confirmed that the “term
‘territory’ as defined in the BIT and read in light of Article 29 of the VCLT covers the
entire territory of each State party,” adding that it is “unable to identify a different
intention in the BIT.”1

Submission of Ukraine, § 6.

Verbatim Article 29 VCLT provides that, “[u]nless a different intention appears from the treaty or is
otherwise established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory.”

See, inter alia, Karl Doehring, The Scope of the Territorial Application of Treaties: Comments on
Art. 25 of the ILC’s 1966 Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties, 27 Heidelberg J. Int'l L., pp. 483,

ii. Context

In accordance with Article 31(2) VCLT, the context of a treaty includes its text and
preamble. The text of the treaty must be considered “as a whole” by inter alia

comparing “the use of the same term elsewhere in the treaty.”1°”

Many provisions of the BIT include references to the term “territory”, which is itself
defined in Article 1(4) of the BIT. To the extent that the term “territory” as used
elsewhere in the BIT may provide further context, the Tribunal notes that nothing in the
context supports the view that this term should only cover territory over which a
Contracting Party maintains internationally recognized title. Instead, the use of the term
“territory” in the other articles is linked to the State’s ability to legislate in a particular
area'®® and generally reflects a practical focus on effective control over territory.'®° As
discussed above, Russia is currently the only State with the effective ability to legislate
in Crimea and it has, in fact, made extensive use of this prerogative.

Conversely, when the Contracting Parties intended to prescribe a definition of the term
as it is understood under general international law, they did so explicitly, such as when
requiring that the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf be “defined in

accordance with international law’ (Article 1(4) of the BIT).

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the context supports the ordinary meaning of the
term “territory” identified above. This understanding is also supported by the preamble

of the Treaty, to which the Tribunal now turns.

iii. | Object and purpose

In accordance with Article 31(1) VCLT, a treaty must also be interpreted in light of its
object and purpose. It is habitually acknowledged that one of the main objectives of

investment treaties is to “enhanc[e] the legal framework under which foreign investment

Schmalenbach eds., 2012) (expanded CLA-95). See also Submission of Ukraine, § 16, fn. 32.

See, e.g., Article 1(1): “The term ‘investments’ means any kind of tangible and intangible assets
[...] invested by an investor [...] in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with
its legislation [...]"; Article 2: “Each Contracting Party will [...] admit such investments in
accordance with its legislation’; see also the dispute resolution clause in Article 9, which lists
domestic courts among the possible dispute settlement fora available to a qualifying investor:
“[...] 2. If the dispute cannot be resolved [...] it shall be referred to: a) a competent court or
arbitration court of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investments were made.”

operates.”'*° More specifically, the object and purpose of an investment treaty is often
determined by looking at its preamble.'*! Here, the preamble of the BIT refers to the
Contracting Parties’ commitment “to develop the basic provisions of the Agreement on
Cooperation in the Sphere of Investment Activity of December 24, 1993.” This
agreement, which was concluded between Russia, Ukraine, and other CIS countries,
pursued cooperation “in the development and implementation of investment policy” and
protection of foreign investment.'*? These objectives can thus be considered to reflect
those of the BIT.

Furthermore, the preamble of the Treaty expressly states that the Contracting Parties
“intend[...] to create and maintain favourable conditions for mutual investments” and
“desir[e] to create favourable conditions for the expansion of economic cooperation
between the Contracting Parties.”"°° The Tribunal therefore finds that, like in many
investment treaties, there is an intent to both enhance economic cooperation and

safeguard investments by maintaining favourable conditions.

This observation resonates with the findings of the tribunal in Sanum, where the
question arose whether the extension of the bilateral investment treaty between China
and Laos to Macao at the moment of recovery of sovereignty by China was compatible

with the Treaty’s object and purpose. The Sanum tribunal concluded that that treaty’s

purpose is twofold: to protect the investor and develop economic cooperation.
The Tribunal does not find—and no element has been provided by the
Respondent to that effect—that the extension of the PRC/Laos BIT could be
contrary to such a dual purpose. In fact, the larger scope the Treaty has, the
better fulfilled the purposes of the Treaty are in this case: more investors—who
would not otherwise be protected—are internationally protected, and the
economic cooperation benefits a larger territory that would otherwise not receive

such benefit.

[...] In other words, the Tribunal is satisfied that the extension of the PRC/Laos
Treaty to the Macao SAR is not incompatible with its object and purpose, which
again is to “encourage, protect and create favorable conditions for investment by
investors of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State
[...] and for the purpose of the development of economic cooperation between
both States [...].”"%

. The Sanum tribunal thus concluded that extending a State’s obligations under a

bilateral investment treaty to its new territory is “fundamentally compatible with [that
treaty’s] object and purpose, the more so that there is no other possibly competing
[bilateral investment treaty].”195

In claiming that the object and purpose of the Treaty is to expand rather than limit its
scope of application, the Claimants have argued that leaving investments “without any
protection” under international law would “reduce, rather than create and maintain” the
conditions which the Treaty aspires to nurture.'°° They added that there is “certainly
nothing about the object and purpose of the BIT that would require it to be interpreted

to favor aggressor States by shielding them from their obligations.”'9”

In the Tribunal’s view, the object and purpose of the Treaty does not support a
restrictive interpretation which would exclude investments that ended up being located
on a Contracting State’s territory as the result of that State’s territorial expansion. It is
undisputed that the Treaty applied to foreign investments in Crimea before the
Incorporation. As a result of the Incorporation, foreign investments by Russian
investors became domestic investments and domestic investments by Ukrainian
investors became foreign investments. That the latter became entitled to Treaty
protection as a consequence appears in conformity with the Treaty’s object to protect
investments. It would indeed go against the object and purpose of the Treaty to leave
without protection foreign investments on a territory over which a State exercises
exclusive control and claims sovereignty, particularly in circumstances where that State

is not only the main beneficiary-State of these investments but also the only State in a
position to protect foreign investments.'%*

Finally, the Tribunal’s finding derived from the object and purpose of the Treaty is
buttressed by reference to Article 12. Under that provision, which is entitled
“Application of the Agreement’, the Treaty protects investments and investors
irrespective of when and how they became subject to Treaty protection, as discussed
in more detail below (c.f. Sections VI.D and VI.E).

iv. | Supplementary means of interpretation

Pursuant to Article 32 VCLT, resort may be had to supplementary means of
interpretation, including the travaux préparatoires, in order to (i) confirm the meaning
resulting from the application of Article 31 VCLT, or (ii) determine the meaning when
the interpretation according to Article 31 VCLT “leaves the meaning ambiguous or
obscure” or “leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”

In the present case, the supplementary means of interpretation, including the travaux
préparatoires of the Treaty,'°° may be used to confirm the meaning of “territory” as
established above, which is neither ambiguous nor obscure, nor brings to a result that

is absurd or unreasonable, let alone manifestly so.

For that purpose, the Tribunal first notes that, while it has only had the benefit of the
input of one Contracting Party, it finds nothing in the travaux préparatoires submitted by
the Claimants that would require or justify restricting the definition of the term “territory”
in the BIT to territory over which a Contracting Party lawfully asserts sovereignty in
accordance with international law. In this context, the Tribunal has also noted the
argument that Ukraine deferred in Article 1(4) to the Russian Federation’s preference
for a broad, non-restrictive definition of “territory”.2°

Second, the Tribunal observes that any other interpretation of the term “territory” under
Article 31 VCLT would indeed lead to a manifestly unreasonable result, which the
Tribunal must avoid under Article 32 VCLT. The Tribunal thus concurs with the view

expressed by the Everest tribunal, which held that “it would lead to an unreasonable

préparatoires of Articles 1(1), 1(4), and 12, which the Claimants did on 7 March 2016.

result as a matter of interpretation of the BIT, if investments made in Crimea and
interrupted by the nationalization by Russia and/or its subjects were considered made
outside the Russian Federation. In fact, the nationalization presupposes that the

investments were on Russian territory.”2°'

v. Good faith

Article 31(1) VCLT opens with the requirement for a treaty to be interpreted in good
faith.

The principle of good faith is an “essential principle of law in the international legal
order,””°? as well as a universally recognized cornerstone of treaty interpretation, which
is recalled in the preamble of the VCLT.%°° Its importance is also highlighted in
Article 26 VCLT (“Pacta sunt servanda’”), which provides that “[e]very treaty in force is
binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.” As noted
above, neither Party has sought to take any steps towards the suspension or
termination of the Treaty, which therefore remains binding upon the Parties and must

be performed in good faith.

The principle of good faith is the source of several other international legal principles,
such as “the rule pacta sunt servanda and other legal rules distinctively and directly
related to honesty, fairness and reasonableness.”*° Good faith also encompasses the
principle of consistency°> and the Latin maxim of allegans contraria non audiendus est
(colloquially translated as “one cannot blow hot and cold”), which has often been
applied by international courts and tribunals.2°°

admissible [...]" (Case Concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear, Judgment, Separate Opinion of

167. A number of investment tribunals have similarly acknowledged the importance of good
faith in a variety of contexts.?°’ For example, tribunals have found that the principle of
consistency stems from “the more generally conceived requirement of good faith”?°
and have disallowed inconsistent behavior by States vis-a-vis foreign investors, 7°?
accentuating the principle that “[a] State that has taken a particular position may be

under an obligation to act consistently with it on another occasion.”*1°

community and yet simultaneously denying that it has obligations to Ukrainian investors

See, inter alia, Inceysa v. El Salvador, holding that good faith “is a supreme principle, which
governs legal relations in all of their aspects and content” (/nceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic
of El Salvador, |\CSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, §§ 230, 235-239 (2 August 2006)). See also
Phoenix v. The Czech Republic, stating that “[t]he principle of good faith has long been
recognized in public international law, as it is also in all national legal systems. This principle
requires parties ‘to deal honestly and fairly with each other, to represent their motives and
purposes truthfully, and to refrain from taking unfair advantage” (Phoenix Action Ltd v. The

accepted in investment arbitrations that the principle of good faith is a principle of international
law applicable to the interpretation and application of obligations under international investment
agreements” (Europe Cement Investment & Trade S.A. v. Republic of Turkey, \CSID Case No.

2008) (CLA-152), holding that Yemen's consistent representation that the claimant's investment
was made in accordance with its laws prevented it from later asserting that the tribunal lacked
jurisdiction based on the unlawful nature of the investment. The tribunal also noted that “[it] would
offend the most elementary notions of good faith [...] to imagine that [the Head of State] offered
his assurances and acceptance with his fingers crossed, as it were, making a reservation to the
effect ‘that we welcome you, but will not extend to you the benefits of our BIT with your country”
(§ 119). In the same vein, the tribunal in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan held that “it is also well

169. Ukraine has expressed a similar view:

The Russian Federation has repeatedly claimed that Crimea forms an integral
part of the territory of the Russian Federation. Yet it simultaneously maintains
that its actions in Crimea “cannot be regulated by the [Treaty].” A restrictive
interpretation of the term “territory” in the Treaty that would allow Russia to profit
from this inconsistency is fundamentally inconsistent with the principle of good
faith interpretation. To condone this position would reward Russia for violating
international law. Paradoxically, the Russian Federation would be permitted a
freer hand vis-a-vis Ukrainian investors in territory it illegally occupies than within
its legitimate sovereign territory. No good faith interpretation could allow this

result.21?

170. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants’ position insofar as the principle of good faith

171.

21

calls for the opposability of the Treaty to Russia with respect to foreign investment
presently located in Crimea. Indeed, Russia cannot at the same time claim that Crimea
forms part of its territory and deny the application of a Treaty that it has concluded to
protect investments made on its territory, without incurring an inconsistency contrary to

good faith and the principle of consistency.

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has in particular considered Russia’s publicly
stated views with respect to Crimea, as discussed above (§ 131). In this context, the
Tribunal recalls the United Nations’ International Law Commission’s 2006 Guiding
Principles Applicable to Unilateral Declarations of States Capable of Creating Legal
Obligations (the “ILC’s 2006 Principles”),?"° in accordance with which:

Declarations publicly made and manifesting the will to be bound may have the
effect of creating legal obligations. When the conditions for this are met, the
binding character of such declarations is based on good faith; States concerned
may then take them into consideration and rely on them; such States are entitled

to require that such obligations be respected.*"*

The ILC’s 2006 Principles further specify that such a declaration “binds the State
internationally only if it is made by an authority vested with the power to do so”*'§ and
provided that it is “stated in clear and specific terms.”2"° In the present case, Russia, via
its Head of State and other officials, has clearly manifested its will to consider Crimea
as part of its territory, whilst taking no action to terminate or suspend the Treaty. As

noted by the ICJ in the Nuclear Tests case:

One of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal
obligations, whatever their source, is the principle of good faith. Trust and
confidence are inherent in international co-operation, in particular in an age when
this co-operation in many fields is becoming increasingly essential. Just as the
very rule of pacta sunt servanda in the law of treaties is based on good faith, so
also is the binding character of an international obligation assumed by unilateral
declaration.?"”

The tribunal in Joy Mining also made clear that unilateral declarations by States are not
without consequence: “formal declarations by States and its officials constitute
unilateral acts giving rise to obligations on which third parties may rely to exercise their
rights.”218

Consequently, a good faith interpretation of the Treaty mandates that Russia’s
declaration that Crimea is part of its territory cannot remain without legal consequence
to Russia’s Treaty obligations vis-a-vis Ukrainian investors in Crimea. A similar
conclusion was also reached by the Belbek tribunal:

[...] a conclusion that the Treaty no longer applies to conduct occurring in the
Crimean Peninsula would be to denude the Treaty of effect and relieve the
Contracting Parties of their obligation to perform the Treaty in good faith, contrary

to the cardinal principle of pacta sunt servanda. It would be to create a legal void,

a bubble, in the application of the Treaty in respect of the Crimean Peninsula that
was never contemplated and should not be countenanced.*"9

(c) Conclusion

175. In sum, and particularly with due regard to the Respondent's statement in these

proceedings and elsewhere that Crimea now “forms an integral part of the territory of
the Russian Federation,”**° the Tribunal construes the term “territory” for purposes of
the Treaty to include territory over which a State exercises de facto control and
jurisdiction. Any other interpretation would, to borrow the words of the Russian
Federation, “contradict objective reality’.22’ The Tribunal thus finds that the Treaty
became opposable to Russia with respect to Ukrainian investments in Crimea upon
Russia’s incorporation of Crimea in its territory no later than 21 March 2014 when
Russia ratified the Incorporation Treaty and passed the Crimean Integration Law which
formally incorporated Crimea as a subject of the Russian Federation in accordance

with its Constitution.?22

176. Thus, the Tribunal concludes that the territorial scope of the Treaty encompasses

Crimea and Russia’s jurisdictional objection must be denied.

JURISDICTION RATIONE TEMPORIS (ARTICLE 12 BIT)

177. In the Tribunal’s understanding, Article 12 of the BIT sets forth the scope of application

21

220

22

22

of the Treaty in time and thus deals with the ratione temporis jurisdiction of the
Tribunal: the Treaty applies to investments made in the territory of the other
Contracting State after 1 January 1992. Article 1(1) by contrast defines investments
and thereby deals primarily with the Tribunal’s ratione materiae jurisdiction. This said,
doing so, Article 1(1) refers to investment made in the territory of the other Contracting
State like Article 12, linking the territorial with the temporal requirement. The Claimants
have not strictly distinguished these two aspects, which is reflected in the following
summary of their positions. The Tribunal has considered the interplay between Article

1(1) and Article 12 in the analysis below, but finds that its focus should remain on the
temporal notion in Article 12 of the BIT.

1. The Parties’ Positions

. The Claimants acknowledge that the Respondent's Letters “appear to assert a form of
objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the
Claimants made their investments in Crimea before it became Russian territory,” but

submit that this objection is not well founded.

. The Claimants agree that Crimea was part of Ukraine at the time when they made their
investments. However, they submit that Russia assumed all State obligations “in the
territory” of Crimea when it “assumed the function of a State to the exclusion of the
Ukrainian authorities” on 27 February 2014.74 The Claimants maintain that their
investments “became entitled to the protections of the BIT” at the moment when its
operations were “forcibly transferred into the territory of the Russian Federation.”225

. In the Claimants’ submission, Article 12 of the Treaty reinforces this position. That
article provides that the Treaty “shall apply to all investments made by investors of one
Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, on or after January 1,
1992.” Since the instrument itself was executed on 27 November 1998 and did not
enter into force until 27 January 2000, Article 12 contemplates the coverage of
investments pre-dating the Treaty’s entry into force.??° The only temporal restriction
found in Article 12 is that of 1 January 1992, which is the cut-off date for qualifying

investments.”””

. The Claimants further submit that the application of the rules of the VCLT also leads to
the conclusion that Article 12 “imposes no further requirements beyond the requirement
found in its text,” namely that an investment be “in the territory of the other Contracting

Party” on or after 1 January 1992.78 They conclude that there is “no basis” in the

Treaty text to “exclude from protection pre-existing investments on newly acquired
territory.”22°

. Finally, and in any event, the Claimants assert that the text of the BIT is consistent with
a “default rule” in international law that allows for “retroactive application” of bilateral
investment treaties to pre-existing investments. They explain their argument in the

following terms:

There is no reason to distinguish Claimants’ investments here. Just as future
investments of Ukrainian investors in Crimea would be protected investments
under the BIT now that the Russian Federation has asserted sovereignty and
assumed jurisdiction over Crimea, Ukrainian investments made in Crimea prior to

the Russian Annexation [...] are equally entitled to the protections of the BIT.2*"

. For the Claimants, this position is confirmed by the broad protection afforded to
property rights in other legal instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, multilateral treaties, regional human rights conventions to which the
Respondent is party, and customary international law.7°? Consequently, the Claimants

oppose the objection set forth in the Respondent's Letters in the following terms:

The fact that Crimea was not “in the territory of the other Contracting Party” when
Claimants initially invested in Crimea is irrelevant. Although the BIT did not apply
to Claimants’ investments when they initially were made in Crimea, because
Crimea was then part of Ukraine, those investments became protected under the
BIT when the Russian Federation caused them to be located in the territory of the
Russian Federation by invading, exercising jurisdiction, and asserting sovereignty

over Crimea.?*°

184. In its Submission, Ukraine has expressed a similar view:

The clear intent of Article 12 was to maximize the temporal application of the
Treaty, specifically to cover investments that were not protected by the Treaty at
the time they were initiated. Like most bilateral investment treaties of its era, the
Treaty was written to protect pre-existing investments (covering the period from
1992, shortly after the dissolution of the USSR, to 1998, when the Treaty was
concluded).

A Russian investor who initiated an investment in Kyiv in 1993 had no
expectation that the investment would be protected by the Treaty, but
nonetheless received that protection as soon as the Treaty began to apply in
1998. Similarly, a Ukrainian investor who initiated an investment in Crimea in
2013 had no expectation that the investment would be protected by the Treaty,
but nonetheless received that protection as soon as the Treaty began to apply in
2014. Any interpretation that discriminates against a class of Ukrainian investors,
and excludes them from protection despite the exposure of their investments to
Russian authority, would conflict with the investment protection and rule of law

aims of the Treaty.?5*

2. Analysis

185. The Treaty was signed on 27 November 1998. In Article 12, it provides that “[t]his
Agreement shall apply to all investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in
the territory of the other Contracting Party, on or after January 1, 1992.” As is well
known, 1 January 1992 is the date of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Hence, the
purpose of Article 12 is to protect investments made after the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, irrespective of whether the BIT was in effect or not at the time the investment

was made.

186. The default rule, to which the Claimants draw attention, provides that a protected
investment can have been made before or after the investment treaty’s entry into force,

unless the treaty contains a provision providing otherwise.** Article 12 is such a

234 Submission of Ukraine, §§ 32-33 (footnotes omitted).

provision. While it confirms the default rule according to which the Treaty covers
pre-existing investments, it limits the period prior to the entry into force of the Treaty.

Thus, the key aspect of Article 12 is the date of 1 January 1992. By choosing this date,
the Contracting Parties expressly agreed that investments made when no protection
existed because the BIT was not in force and possibly not even contemplated, could
later benefit from Treaty protection if they were affected by a measure taken after the
Treaty had entered into force. In other words, Article 12 of the BIT expressly foresees

the application of the BIT to investments made prior to its entry into force.

Considering that all of the Claimants’ investments were made after 1 January 1992, the

Tribunal is satisfied that the temporal condition set forth in Article 12 of the BIT is met.

In this context, the Tribunal further notes that, to the extent that Russia’s letter dated
12 August 2015%°° can be read as an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione
temporis and/or ratione materiae based on the fact that the Claimants initially invested
in Crimea before its incorporation into Russia, the Tribunal finds that a reading of
Article 12 in combination with Articles 1(1) and 1(4) of the Treaty imposes no
requirement that the investment be made in the territory of the other Contracting Party

ab initio.

This conclusion concords with the interpretation of Article 12 of the Treaty under
Article 31 VCLT. As to the ordinary meaning of the words, the Tribunal finds that
Article 12 must be interpreted by reference to Article 1(1) of the Treaty, which defines
“investment”, and to Article 1(4), which defines “territory’.?°” As to the latter, suffice it to
recall the conclusion reached by the Tribunal ?%* that Russia’s “territory” for the
purposes of the BIT includes Crimea and that Russia assumed obligations over

Ukrainian investment in Crimea upon incorporating Crimea in this territory.

In its letter of 12 August 2015 (C-112), the Respondent noted as follows:

In accordance with paragraph 1 Article 1 of the [Treaty] the term “investment” means
every kind of movable and immovable and intellectual property invested by an investor
of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance
with the legislation of the latter Contracting Party. The property in question which is
the matter of the claims is situated in the territory of the Crimea and Sevastopol, i.e. in
the territory that was a part of Ukraine but at the present time pursuant to the will of
people forms an integral part of the territory of the Russian Federation and cannot be
regulated by the [Treaty].

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 66 of 80

As to the definition of the term “investment” in Article 1(1), the Tribunal is of the view
that it sets forth a geographical as opposed to a temporal limitation on the “making” of
an investment. This becomes clear if one considers other requirements contained in
Article 1(1) of the definition of “investment”, such as the requirement to comply with the
legislation of the host State. For this requirement to be meaningful, the host State in
question must be capable of exercising jurisdiction and control over the area where the
given assets are located. In the present case, Russia exercises sole jurisdiction and
control over Crimea and consequently, as demonstrated further below,”*° the legality of
the investment must be assessed under the Russian legislation, which became

applicable to the investments upon Russia’s incorporation of Crimea into its territory.

The Tribunal thus concludes that there is nothing in the language of Articles 12 or 1
excluding the Claimants from the protection of the Treaty on temporal grounds.”4?
Moreover, such exclusion would also contradict the Treaty’s object and purpose:
Articles 2 and 5 of the BIT, as well as the preamble referring to the creation of
“favorable conditions for mutual investments” and the “expansion of economic
cooperation” lead to the conclusion that any restrictive interpretation denying protection
would defeat the objectives of both Article 12 and the BIT in general. 241

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that there is no basis to read into the Treaty a denial of
protection for pre-existing investments in the event of a change of territorial boundaries.

JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE (ARTICLE 1(2) BIT)
Article 1(2)(b) defines an “investor” in relevant part as follows:

b) any legal entity constituted in accordance with the legislation in force in the
territory of that Contracting Party, provided that the said legal entity is competent
in accordance with legislation of that Contracting Party, to make investments in

the territory of the other Contracting Party.

See §§ 214 ff. below.
Claimants’ Answers, § 1.2.5.

As noted by the Everest tribunal, the textual analysis of the BIT does not support a finding that
“(i) the character of the ‘investor’, (ii) the transaction comprised of the assets, and (iii) the
‘territory’ need to converge at the same time, namely when the investment is made.” Rather, “the
non-simultaneity of the requirements of Article 1(1) is more responsive to the purposes and
objects of the BIT provided these requirements converge before the alleged breach of the BIT
occurs” (Decision on Jurisdiction, §§ 151, 153 (20 March 2017) (CLA-269)).

60

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 67 of 80

. In order to meet the requirements set forth in Article 1(2)(b), the Claimants need to
demonstrate that they are legal entities constituted in accordance with Ukrainian
legislation and that they are “competent” to make investments in accordance with
Ukrainian legislation. Thus, the relevant law for the purposes of determining the
Claimants’ status as “investors” is undoubtedly Ukrainian law.742

. The Claimants assert that they are legal entities incorporated in Ukraine, whose
investments in Crimea were lawful under the laws of Ukraine at the time when they
were made. Accordingly, in the Claimants’ view, they are investors for the purposes of
Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT.2

. The record shows that the Claimants are corporations organized under the laws of
Ukraine. The Claimants have submitted constituent documents for each of the claimant
companies establishing their existence and presence in accordance with the Ukrainian
company register, the Ukrainian Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Individual
Entrepreneurs and Civic Organizations (the “Ukrainian Corporate Register”), which is
available on the website of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine.?“4 The Tribunal finds this
documentary evidence sufficient to ascertain that the Claimants are indeed legal
entities “constituted in accordance with the legislation in force in the territory of
[Ukraine]” for the purposes of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT.245

. The Claimants’ expert, Mr. Bondar, also confirmed that the Claimants are registered in

the Ukrainian Corporate Register and that they have been duly constituted in

This is also the Claimants’ position: “The BIT requires that investors be competent under the law
of the State of incorporation (BIT, Art. 1(2)), in this case Ukrainian law” (PHB, p. 11, fn. 55).

Statement of Claim, § 3.5; Ukrainian Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Individual
Entrepreneurs and Civic Organizations, Ministry of Justice of Ukraine Website (C-117).

While the Tribunal has deemed the documentation provided by the Claimants to be sufficient for
the present purposes, it notes that, as confirmed by the Claimants at the Hearing in response to a
question from the Tribunal, as of 22 April 2014 the Claimants had no access to their offices and
any of the petrol stations. Considering that most company records were kept in those offices, the
Claimants are presently only in possession of very limited documentation (Transcript, 17/3-17).
This is also confirmed by Mr. Laber, who explains that the documentation of the Claimants’
day-to-day business activities—including permits and licenses—was stored in their Feodosia
office, and thus has been inaccessible since the seizure of these offices in April 2014 (Witness
Statement of Mr. Uriel Laber, § 33 (CWS-1). In any event, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt
the fact that the Claimants were legal entities incorporated in accordance with Ukrainian law at all
relevant times.

accordance with Ukrainian legislation from the moment of their registration to the
present.246

Furthermore, Article 1(2)(b) requires the investor to be “competent” in accordance with
the legislation of its home State to make investments in the territory of the host State.
Two questions thus arise: first, what is to be understood by “competence” in this

context and, second, at what time should such “competence” be assessed.

As to the first question, with the assistance of a legal translator whom it appointed to
provide an independent translation of the original Russian and Ukrainian versions of
the BIT,” the Tribunal has established that “competent” in this context means “having
legal capacity” under the home State’s law. In the ordinary understanding of this term,
legal capacity refers to a natural or judicial person’s power to enter into contracts or
other legal relationships and to sue and be sued. The term does not imply the
necessity of any specific authorization.”*® On this basis, the Tribunal is satisfied that the
Claimants had the necessary “competence” and/or the legal capacity to invest under
Ukrainian law.

The Tribunal now turns to the second question dealing with the time when competence
must be assessed. For the Claimants, they were “competent” under Ukrainian law to
make investments in Crimea when they made their investments. Another approach in
light of the specificity of the situation would be to enquire whether the Claimants were
competent in accordance with Ukrainian law to make investments in Crimea at the time
of the Incorporation, i.e., when the investment came under the protection of the BIT.

Be this as it may, the question can remain open. Indeed, the Tribunal is satisfied that
the Claimants were competent, in accordance with Ukrainian law, to invest in Crimea

both at the time of making the original investment as well as at the time of the

Bondar Opinion, §§ 15-19.

See, e.g., the 1** Harmonization Chart dated 25 May 2016 provided by the translator, Mr. Vesler.
See also fn. 168 above.

The Tribunal notes that the initial BIT translation provided by the Claimants (CLA-1) used the
term “legally authorized” as opposed to “competent”. Having examined other Russian bilateral
investment treaties, the Claimants concluded that the term “competent” more adequately
reflected the meaning of this provision. The independent translator appointed by the Tribunal also
found the term “competent” more appropriate on the grounds that it does not imply a specific
authorization. According to the translator: “Legally authorized’ strongly implies specific
‘permitting’ action on the part of the State's authorities, which is not the case in the majority of all
cases. More appropriate legal terms for this would include ‘competent’ or ‘having/enjoying the
legal capacity to [do something],’ the latter being a little too verbose to my liking” (Translator’s
Chart dated 25 May 2016).

62

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-4 Filed 04/09/22 Page 69 of 80

Incorporation. There is no indication in the record that Ukrainian law would have barred
legally competent corporations from investing at either time. In particular, the Tribunal
accepts Mr. Bondar’s evidence that the legislation enacted by Ukraine following the
Incorporation, i.e., the Law of Ukraine No. 1207-VIl “On Guaranteeing Rights and
Freedoms of Citizens and the Legal Regime in the Temporarily Occupied Territory of
Ukraine” (the “Occupation Law”)? and the Law of Ukraine No. 1636-VII “On
Establishing Free Economic Zone Crimea and Special Aspects of Conducting
Economic Activity in the Temporarily Occupied Territory of Ukraine” (the “FEZ Crimea
Law’”),2©° allowed Ukrainian investors to maintain their existing investments in Crimea

and guaranteed their protection.75'

. In this context, at the Hearing the Tribunal invited the Claimants to comment on the
legal capacity of a Ukrainian entity to invest in Crimea in light of the sanctions currently
in place against Russia. The Claimants clarified that “in Crimea, there are restrictions
on the transfer of funds, but [...] no restriction on the ownership of property [and] no
impediment under Ukrainian law to continuing to own property you owned already.”
In any event, the current sanctions were imposed after the Incorporation and, hence,
could have no bearing on the Claimants’ competence at the earlier moments in time

just determined to be relevant.

. The Tribunal’s conclusion on the Claimants’ competence is shared by the Belbek
tribunal which held that “competence” in Article 1(2) of the Treaty is to be understood
as “a requirement of capacity to enter into certain legal relations” and that, particularly
in light of the expert evidence on Ukrainian law, there can be no doubt that the Belbek
claimants had such capacity “at all times from the making of their investment to the

commencement of this arbitration.” °*

Belbek, \nterim Award, § 215 (24 February 2017) (CLA-269). For completeness, the Tribunal
adds that it shares the Belbek tribunal’s conclusion regarding the impact of Resolution No. 699 of
the National Bank of Ukraine of 3 November 2014, namely that, to the extent that this Resolution
may at all be relevant, it only prohibits monetary transfers to Crimea after the Resolution came
into force (Belbek, Interim Award, §§ 217-219 (24 February 2017) (CLA-269)). As already noted

above, the Tribunal has accepted the Claimants’ explanation that their investments are not
impacted by any restriction on the transfer of funds in Crimea (c.f. § 203).

In a similar vein, the Everest tribunal also held that Ukrainian law did not “restrict the
competence of Ukrainian entities or individuals to make or maintain investments in
Crimea” and emphasized that “Article 11(1) of the Occupation Law guarantees the

protection of investments made by individuals or legal entities in Crimea.”*4

In light of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the

Claimants qualify as “investors” in accordance with Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT.

JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE (ARTICLE 1(1) BIT)
1. Definition of Investment

Article 1(1) of the Treaty (cited in full at § 96 above) defines “investments” as “any kind
of tangible and intangible assets [which are] invested by an investor of one Contracting
Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation,”
including, inter alia, “movable and immovable property, as well as any other related
property rights.”

The Claimants submit that their investment on the Crimean Peninsula, which consists
of “movable and immovable property, cash, and rights to engage in the commercial
activity of selling petrol,” qualifies as an investment under Article 1(1) of the BIT.25> At
the Hearing, the Claimants further specified that the immovable property consisted of
“actual title to real estate and leaseholds in real estate and property rights in both,”
while the movable property consisted of “tanks, pumps, cash registers, computer
equipment{,] land [and] buildings.” °° Their investment also included “the supply
mechanism necessary to store and deliver the petrol and related convenience stores,
real estate holdings, commercial operations [and] machinery.”*5’ The Claimants added
that their investment consisted of “thriving profitable chains of petrol stations,” which
were fully operational, had plans for expansion, and were “moneymaking

enterprises”.25°

It is also the Claimants’ submission that it is sufficient for them to establish that their
investment corresponds to one of the categories of assets listed in Article 1(1), which

they undoubtedly do.

The Tribunal must first construe the meaning of the word “investment” in Article 1(1). At
the Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Claimants whether, in their view, there was an
inherent notion of “investment” embedded into Article 1(1) of the BIT.%5° Indeed, a
number of recent investor-State awards have considered that the term “investment”
has an inherent meaning, which an alleged investment must meet in addition to falling
within one of the categories of assets generally used in bilateral investment treaties.
Importantly, these awards have applied this so-called inherent or objective definition

irrespective of the application of the ICSID Convention.

In response to the Tribunal’s question, the Claimants noted that the wide majority of
cases containing this type of analysis were decided under the ICSID Convention and
that Romak, a non-ICSID case, was wrong on the inherent meaning of “investment”.7°'
In their view, the “intellectual foundations of that argument lie mostly in the construction

of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and how to construe ‘investment’.”26

In the Tribunal’s view, elucidating the meaning of the term “invested” in Article 1(1) is
part of the interpretation of that provision and thus there can be no question of adding
an inexistent element into the Treaty. Thus, in light of the wording of this BIT, which

expressly requires that assets be “invested”, the Tribunal can dispense with

Transcript, 66-67.

For example, in GEA v. Ukraine, the tribunal found as follows: “[I]t is not so much the term
‘investment’ in the ICSID Convention than the term ‘investment’ per se that is often considered as
having an objective meaning in itself, whether it is mentioned in the ICSID Convention or in a BIT”
(GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine, |CSID Case No. ARB/08/16, Award, § 141 (31 March
2011)). Similarly, the tribunal in Romak v. Uzbekistan also held in favour of an objective meaning
of the term investment: “The term ‘investment’ has a meaning in itself that cannot be ignored
when considering the list contained in Article 1(2) of the BIT. [...] The Arbitral Tribunal therefore
considers that the term ‘investments’ under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of
whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution
that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk [...]. By their nature, asset
types enumerated in the BIT’s non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an asset
does not correspond to the inherent definition of ‘investment’, the fact that it falls within one of the
categories listed in Article 1 does not transform it into an ‘investment” (Romak S.A. v. The
Republic of Uzbekistan, PCA Case No. AA280, Award, § 207 (9 November 2009)). Lastly,
mention of an objective definition of investment existing equally under the ICSID Convention and
bilateral investment treaties is also found in Abaclat and Others (formerly, Giovanna Beccara and
Others) v. The Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and
Admissibility, § 371 (4 August 2011).

determining whether the Treaty incorporates an objective definition of investment
beyond the asset list contained in Article 1(1).

In the present case, there can be no serious doubt that the resources committed by the
Claimants fully correspond to the meaning of “investment” set forth in Article 1(1) of the
BIT.263

2. Legality of Investment

Article 1(1) of the BIT requires that any investment be made “in the territory of the other
Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation.” “** Previous investor-State
decisions have held that this condition—referred to as the “legality requirement’—limits
the scope of protected investments to those that are established lawfully under the host

State’s laws and regulations at the time the investments were made.765

As to the general meaning and scope of the legality requirement, the Claimants have
argued that only a breach of a fundamental legal norm would result in the violation of
this requirement. The Claimants refer to previous investor-State awards”® in support of
their argument that “[dJeficiencies in meeting registration rules and similar bureaucratic
infractions typically do not disqualify investments from treaty protection.” 6’ The
Claimants also argue that Russia may not raise its illegal actions as a defense to
jurisdiction. As the annexation of Crimea violated international law, the imposition of
Russian law upon the Claimants and their investments is therefore also a violation of

international law. Consequently, Russia cannot impose its unlawful actions (i.e., the

The Tribunal was also convinced by the Claimants’ explanations provided at the Hearing as to
how their investment fully meets all four requirements arguably imposed by the so-called Salini
test, i.e., allocation of resources, duration, risk, and contribution to the host State's development
(Transcript, 67-70).

imposition of its domestic laws in Crimea) to excuse itself of its obligations under the
BIT.268

In the present case, it first needs to be determined whether the “host State” for the
purposes of the legality requirement in Article 1(1) is Russia or Ukraine. Put differently,
should the Claimants’ compliance with the “host State’s” legislation be assessed at the
time when the investment was initially made in Crimea before Incorporation or rather
upon Crimea’s Incorporation to Russia when the investments became subject to

Russian control??6°

The Claimants have argued that the BIT requires that “investments be in accordance
with the law of the place of investments (BIT, Art. 1(1)),” and that the relevant law for
the present purposes is Russian law.?”° They further argue, with reference to Metal-
Tech,?"' that “the relevant point in time under the BIT for analyzing whether an
investment was made in conformity with local law is the moment of the investment’s
inception.”*” In their view, the fact that an investment may subsequently violate local
laws cannot strip a tribunal of jurisdiction provided that the investment was legal when
created.2”° They submit that their investments conformed with Russian law from the
moment it became applicable to them, and remained in compliance with it until the

moment they were unlawfully taken away from them.?”

For the Tribunal, the legality of the investment must be established at the time when

the investment came under the protection of the Treaty, which occurred on 21 March

PHB, § 2.16; Claimants’ Answers, §§ 4.3.1-4.3.6. The Claimants also refer to Article 27 of the
VCLT providing that “[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justifications for
its failure to perform a treaty.”

The Tribunal notes that the third hypothetical, namely, whether the investments complied with
Russian law at the time they were made (in Crimea/Ukraine) is irrelevant. This question is
analogous to the one addressed in the context of “competence” or legal capacity; see §§ 201-202
above.

2014.7’5 Hence, the legal regime applicable to the investment before the Incorporation
is of no relevance for the present purposes.

The Claimants further submit that, following the annexation, their investments were
subject to two domestic legal regimes. From the perspective of Ukraine, Ukrainian law
continued to apply, while Russia asserted that its law applied to Crimea.?’° The
Claimants go on to explain, with reference to the legal opinions of Professor Maggs
and Mr. Bondar, that their investments complied with both regimes.

In connection with the Ukrainian legal regime, the Claimants explain that Ukraine took
a pragmatic approach and sought to protect existing legal rights by allowing Ukrainian
investors to maintain their investments and property rights in Crimea following the
annexation.?”’ In particular, and as already noted above, Mr. Bondar has convincingly
explained that the legislation enacted by the Ukrainian parliament following the
Incorporation, i.e., the Occupation Law and the FEZ Crimea Law, allowed Ukrainian
investors to maintain their existing investments in Crimea and guaranteed their
protection.2”6

The Tribunal further notes that while the FEZ Crimea Law prohibited “transactions with
entities owned or controlled by the Russian Federation in relation to property located in
the Occupied Territory,”2”° it seems obvious that the Claimants were no longer in
possession of their investments—which were allegedly nationalized pursuant to
decrees passed by the Crimean authorities in September and November 201476°—
before any occasion for any transactions with Russian entities could have arisen.

(a) The Crimean Integration Law

As to the Russian legislation applicable to the Claimants’ investments
post-Incorporation, the Tribunal notes that the primary legal instrument through which
the Russian Federation integrated Crimea into the Russian legal structure was the

Crimean Integration Law, a federal constitutional law. This law established a transition

period until 1 January 2015 during which “issues shall be resolved regarding the
integration of the new constituent entities of the Russian Federation into the economic,
financial, credit and legal systems of the Russian Federation and into the system of
state agencies of the Russian Federation.”*' The Crimean Integration Law provided for
the continued operation of business entities under their existing corporate forms during

the transition period.?&

The Crimean Integration Law also provided in its Article 12 that legal documents
establishing ownership rights, rights of use, and business licenses issued by Ukrainian
authorities to persons and legal entities in Crimea prior to the Incorporation would be
recognized and that no further confirmation by the Russian authorities of such rights
would be necessary.”® Importantly, Article 12 applied beyond the expiration of the
transition period and explicitly stated that there would be “no limitation on the period of
validity of such documents.” To conclude, it does not seem to the Tribunal that the
Crimean Integration Law required the Claimants to take any action to secure or confirm
their property rights or licenses, as long as they complied with Ukrainian law upon

Incorporation,”®° which they did.7°°

Crimean Integration Law, Article 6 (C-62).

Crimean Integration Law, Article 10 (C-62). Russian legislation thus did not apply to legal entities
that had invested in Crimea prior to the Incorporation. Similarly, taxes were levied in accordance
with Ukrainian tax laws during the transition period (Letter from the Republic of Crimea Tax
Service to Ukrnafta dated 27 May 2014 (C-152)).

Article 12 of the Crimean Integration Law (C-62) provided as follows:

Documents issued by state and other official agencies of Ukraine [and] state and other
Official agencies of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, [...] shall remain valid in the
Republic of Crimea [...], including documents confirming civil status, education, title,
right of use, right to receive pensions, benefits, compensation and other forms of
social payments, right to obtain medical care, and permit documents (licenses, except
licenses to perform banking transactions and licenses (permits) for the operation of
non-credit financial organizations). There is no limitation on the period of validity of
such documents and no confirmation by state agencies of the Russian Federation [or]
state agencies of the Republic of Crimea [...] is required, unless otherwise required by
the documents in question or the nature of the relationship.”

The Tribunal notes in passing that the specific provisions regarding licenses to perform banking
transactions (Articles 17 and 18 of the Crimean Integration Law) are irrelevant for the present
purposes as they did not apply to the Claimants or their investments in Crimea.

Furthermore, the Crimean Integration Law contemplated and, in some instances,7°”
also provided the legal basis for the enactment of further laws, both federal and

regional.

(b) Federal Law No. 258-FZ and Federal Law No. 124-FZ

Federal Law No. 258-FZ?** provided that contracts, including leases*®° such as those of
the Claimants, that were entered into in the territory of Crimea prior to the Incorporation
would remain in force. In response to a question from the Tribunal at the Hearing?°° as
to whether the Claimants’ licenses were affected by any exceptions to Article 21(2) of
Federal Law No. 258-FZ,*°' the Claimants explained that none of the transactions
pursuant to which they acquired property rights constituted a “unilateral transaction”
under Russian law and, hence, Article 21(2) did not apply to their investments in

Crimea. The Tribunal is satisfied with the Claimants’ explanation.

For completeness, the Tribunal notes that another Russian law part of the post-
Incorporation legal framework was Federal Law No. 124-FZ “On Making Amendments
to the Federal Law ‘On Putting the First Part of the Civil Code of the Russian
Federation into Effect’ and Article 1202 of the Third Part of the Civil Code of the
Russian Federation” (“Federal Law No. 124-FZ”),2°* which essentially established a

simplified procedure for the transition of Ukrainian companies with their corporate seat

See, e.g., Article 12.1 of the Crimean Integration Law (amendment of 21 July 2014) (C-62), which
delegated to the newly-formed Republic of Crimea and Federal City of Sevastopol the power to
enact “legislation affecting property rights” in Crimea (discussed in Second Maggs Report,
§§ 43-44).

Federal Law No. 258-FZ, “On the Making of Amendments to Article 222 of the first part of the
Civil Code of the Russian Federation and to the Federal Law on Putting the First Part of the Civil
Code of the Russian Federation into Effect,” 13 July 2015, Article 21(1) (C-148).

As explained by Professor Maggs, leases are considered contracts under Russian law (First
Maggs Report, § 65; Second Maggs Report, § 25).

Transcript, 82/10-13.
Article 21(2) provides as follows:

With respect to relations that have arisen from unilateral transactions on the territory of
the Republic of Crimea [...] before the date of acceptance of the Republic of Crimea
into the Russian Federation and the formation in the composition of the Russian
Federation of the new subjects—the Republic of Crimea and the City of Federal
Significance Sevastopol, the civil legislation of the Russian Federation shall be applied
to rights and duties arising from the date of acceptance of the Republic of Crimea into
the Russian Federation and the formation in the composition of the Russian
Federation of the new subjects—the Republic of Crimea and the City of Federal
Significance Sevastopol.

in Crimea prior to the expiration of the transition period on 1 January 2015 (as per
Article 6 of the Crimean Integration Law).*%° Five of the Claimants, whose executive
bodies were seated in Crimea or Sevastopol before Incorporation, could have arguably

profited from this simplified procedure.

However, while arguably some of the Claimants were eligible for this simplified
procedure, they were no longer in possession of their property upon the expiration of
the transition period and thus were not affected by the procedure.

In any event, Federal Law No. 124-FZ does not appear to contain sanctions in case of
a company’s failure to re-register as a Russian company upon expiration of the
transition period and did not affect the company’s existing property rights in Crimea.
Rather, the only result appears to be that such company could no longer do business in
Crimea, which, considering the circumstances of the present case, is of no practical or

legal consequence.

(c) Laws of the Republic of Crimea

In light of the authority granted to them by the Crimean Integration Law (Article 6), the
Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol also enacted legislation
concerning the registration of property rights. In response to the Tribunal’s question
during the Hearing?** concerning the effect of paragraph 3(11) of the Republic of
Crimea Law No. 38-ZRK?°> on the Claimants’ investments, the Claimants answered
with reference to Professor Maggs that Article 3(11) does not apply to the Claimants for
two reasons. First, because it has no effect on private property and, second, because

none of the Claimants is a Ukrainian State or municipally owned enterprise.?°°

Second Maggs Report, § 67.

Law of the Republic of Crimea No. 38-ZRK, “On the Peculiarities of Regulation of Property and
Land Relations on the Territory of the Republic of Crimea,” 31 July 2014, Article 2(2) (C-119). An
identical law was passed by the Federal City of Sevastopol (C-84).

Paragraph 3(11) of the Crimea Law No. 38-ZRK provides as follows:

The right of economic management of property, the right of operational management
of property located in the Republic of Crimea arising before the entry into force of the
Federal Constitutional Law shall be deemed consistent with the right of economic
management and the right of operational management of such land as provided for
under the legislation of the Russian Federation. The rule established in this paragraph
shall not apply with respect to foreign legal entities.

(d) The Foreign Investment Law of the Russian Federation

Finally, apart from the compliance of the Claimants’ investments’ with the specific
post-Incorporation laws, the Tribunal has also asked whether they complied with the
definition of “foreign investment” under the Russian pre-existing Federal Law No.
160-FZ “On Foreign Investments in the Russian Federation” (the “Foreign Investment

Law’)

For this assessment, the Tribunal has carefully scrutinized the authorities in the record,
including inter alia Professor Maggs’ detailed analysis of the Foreign Investment
Law.?°° Specifically, it notes that the Claimants’ investments qualified as such under the
Foreign Investment Law because they complied with all the requirements imposed by
Article 2 of this Law. In brief, the Claimants’ assets were (i) “in the form of objects
under the civil law,” which (ii) included “money” and “other property”, and (iii) were “held
by the foreign investor.” In addition, their trading was not “prohibited or limited in the
Russian Federation” and they were not affected by any of the Law’s restrictions
“required for the purposes of protecting the constitutional system, morals, health, rights

and lawful interests of others, national defense and state security.”2°°

3. Conclusion on Legality

The Tribunal thus concludes that the Claimants’ investment meets the requirement set
forth in Article 1(1) of the BIT for the investment to be made in accordance with the
host State’s legislation. For completeness, the Tribunal also notes that the Everest

tribunal reached the same conclusion.°°

OVERALL CONCLUSION

On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal concludes that is has jurisdiction
over the present dispute. In particular, it is satisfied that the dispute falls within the

territorial and temporal scope of application of the Treaty and that the Claimants qualify

Federal Law No. 160-FZ, “On Foreign Investments in the Russian Federation,” 9 July 1999, as
amended on 19 July 2011, Article 2 (C-158).

Foreign Investment Law, Articles 2 and 4(2).

Everest, Decision on Jurisdiction, § 167 (20 March 2017) (CLA-269), adding that “the Russian
authorities did not justify the measures that are the subject of this arbitration by reference to any

non-conformity of Claimants’ properties with Russian or Ukrainian laws.” The Tribunal concurs
with this observation.

as “investors” under the Treaty, having made an “investment” in the territory of Russia
in accordance with its legislation.

Vil. COSTS

234. In PO5, which dealt with various post-hearing matters, the Tribunal decided that
“[t]here shall be no cost submissions at the present stage, it being understood that the
Parties shall provide cost submissions if the Tribunal subsequently so requests.” The
decision on the costs and fees of the jurisdictional phase is thus reserved for a later
stage of the proceedings.

Vill. OPERATIVE PART
235. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:
(i) | The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration;

(ii) The Tribunal will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the
proceedings toward the liability phase;

(iii) | The Tribunal reserves the decision on the costs of the jurisdictional phase for
a later stage of the proceedings.
