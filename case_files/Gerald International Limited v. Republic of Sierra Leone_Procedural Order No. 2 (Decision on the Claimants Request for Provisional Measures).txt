Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

THE RELEVANT PROCEDURAL STEPS

On 18 October 2019, Gerald filed a Request for Arbitration against Sierra Leone (the
“Request for Arbitration”), together with Factual Exhibits C-1 through C-33 and Legal
Authorities CLA-1 through CLA-3.

On 1 November 2019, the Secretary General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the

Parties of the registration.

On 24 January 2020, the Claimant informed ICSID that it wished to appoint Prof. Dr.
Guido Santiago Tawil, a national of Argentina, and the Respondent informed that it wished
to appoint Ms. Funke Adekoya, SAN, a national of Nigeria and the United Kingdom, as

arbitrators in this case.

As a result of an exchange of emails dated 21 and 27 of January 2020 on the method of
constituting the Tribunal, on 27 January 2020, the Respondent informed that the Parties
had not been able to reach an agreement on the procedure for the appointment of the

President of the Tribunal.

By letter of 28 January 2020, the Centre informed that it “can take no action with respect
to the appointment of an arbitrator before the method of constituting the whole Tribunal
has been established, either pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) or pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of

the Convention.”

On 5 February 2020, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal be constituted pursuant to
Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and that the President of the Tribunal be
appointed pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4.

On 6 February 2020, the Centre informed the Parties that the Tribunal is to be constituted
pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and it would proceed to seek Prof.

Tawil’s and Ms. Adekoya’s acceptance of their respective appointments. The Centre also

Gerald International Limited v. Republic of Sierra Leone
(ICSID Case No. ARB/19/31)

 

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

proposed to conduct a ballot to assist the Parties in selecting a mutually agreeable presiding

arbitrator.

On 11 and 12 February 2020, Prof. Tawil and Ms. Adekoya, respectively, accepted their

appointments as arbitrators in this case.

On 25 February 2020, following the Parties agreement on the ballot procedure, ICSID

provided a list of candidates to serve as presiding arbitrator to the Parties.

On 5 March 2020, ICSID informed the Parties that the ballot did not result in the selection
of a mutually acceptable candidate and that the appointment of the President would proceed

pursuant to Articles 38 and 40(1) of the ICSID Convention.

On 20 March 2020, the Centre informed the Parties that it intended to propose the

appointment of Prof. Dr. August Reinisch, a national of Austria, as the presiding arbitrator.

On | April 2020, the Centre informed that it would seek Prof. Reinisch’s acceptance of his
appointment as President of the Tribunal and transmit the Respondent’s observations to
Prof. Reinisch. On 3 April 2020, Prof. Reinisch accepted his appointment as President of

the Tribunal in this case.

On 6 April 2020, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), the Secretary-General notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Dr. Jonathan Chevry, ICSID Legal

Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal is composed of Prof. Dr. August Reinisch, a national of Austria, President,
appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in accordance with
Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; Prof. Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil, a national of
Argentina, appointed by the Claimant; and Ms. Olufunke Adekoya, SAN, a national of the
United Kingdom and Nigeria, appointed by the Respondent.

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

By letter of 15 May 2020, the Claimant advised the Tribunal that it “imminently will be
submitting an application for very urgent provisional measures in accordance with Article
47 of the ICSID Convention and Article 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.” The Claimant
also informed that it will request that a portion of the first session be set aside to deal with

its future application.

By email of the same date, the Respondent informed that it was opposed to any discussion
of the Claimant’s allegations during the first session and that it “strongly denies” the
allegations contained in the Claimant’s letter. The Respondent also noted that if the
Claimant seeks provisional measures on the basis of these allegations, it expects that “the
Tribunal will proceed to set a procedure to determine whether to accept such a request,

consistent with Sierra Leone’s due process rights.”

On 19 May 2002, the Centre circulated the Agenda for the first session, the List of

participants and the Parties’ joint comments on the Draft Procedural Order No. 1.

By email of the same date, the Respondent informed that it would not agree to any
adjustments to the Agenda previously agreed by the Parties and that only the Tribunal could

decide on changes to the Agenda at this late stage.

Later that same day, the Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures dated 19 May
2020 (the “Request for Provisional Measures’), together with a cover letter, Factual
Exhibits C-34 to C-76 and Legal Authorities CLA-4 to CLA-47. As further described
below, the Claimant’s Request generally aimed to obtain the immediate release from
detention of five employees of SL Mining, the alleged Claimant’s investment vehicle in
Sierra Leone, to allow the employees to return to SL Mining’s operation site in Sierra
Leone, to suspend the criminal investigation launched against the employees, and to obtain
the release of SL Mining documents that were seized by Sierra Leone authorities. The
Claimant further requested in its letter that “[g]iven the gravity of the situation and the
serious dangers posed to the lives and health of its illegally arrested employees as well as
those remaining on site” a portion of the first session, scheduled for the next day, “be set

aside to hear argument from the Parties on the immediate issuance of the interim

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

provisional measures, and that the Tribunal recommend the interim provisional measures

detailed in the Request within 24 hours of the conclusion of the hearing.”

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the
Parties on 20 May 2020 by telephone conference (the “First Session”). During the First

Session, the Tribunal allowed time for the Parties to comment on the Claimant’s Request.

By letter of 21 May 2020, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to address four specific
questions regarding the Claimant’s allegations within 48 hours from the issuance of its

letter and file a response to the Claimant’s Request no later than 28 May 2020.

On 23 May 2020, the Respondent filed a letter in response to the Tribunal’s questions of
21 May 2020 (the Respondent’s “Response to the Tribunal’s Questions”).

Later that same day, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide its comments, if any, to

the Respondent’s Response by 25 May 2020.

On 25 May 2020, the Claimant submitted its comments to the Respondent’s Response to
the Tribunal’s Questions of 21 May 2020, together with Factual Exhibits C-77 through C-
78 (the Claimant’s “Comments”. In its letter, the Claimant reiterated its request that the
Tribunal “immediately recommend the interim provisional measures sought by Gerald at
paragraph 144 of its Request for Provisional Measures and order that those measures
remain in place until the Tribunal’s adjudication of the Request.” It also informed that
“Tt]he only modification to the interim relief sought by Gerald at paragraph 144 is that in
sub-paragraph 144.1, the words ‘immediately release from detention and to return’ should

be changed to ‘allow the return’.”

By letter dated 26 May 2020, the Tribunal reminded “both Parties of their obligations not
to aggravate the dispute and not to threaten the integrity of the proceedings, including the

duty to ensure that witnesses and documents remain available” and informed that it would

appreciate if both Parties abstained from taking any steps that might aggravate the dispute

before the Tribunal has decided on the Request.

On 28 May 2020, the Respondent filed a Response and Objection to the Claimant’s Request
for Provisional Measures (the Respondent’s “Respondent’s Response and Objection to
Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures”), together with Factual Exhibits R-1

through R-11 and Legal Authorities RL-1 through RL-19.

On 29 May 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. | recording the agreement of

the Parties and the decision of the Tribunal on procedural matters.

On 31 May 2020, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide its comments, if any, on the
Respondent’s Response and Objection by 8 June 2020, and the Respondent to address the
Claimant’s possible comments by no later than 15 June 2020. The Tribunal also inquired
whether the Parties would be available for a possible one-day hearing during the week of

29 June 2020, or at a later date.

On 9 June 2020, the Claimant submitted its Reply on Provisional Measures dated 8 June
2020 in response to the Respondent’s Response and Objection (the Claimant’s “Reply”),
together with a witness statement, Factual Exhibits C-79 through C-80 and Legal
Authorities CLA-48 through CLA-78.

By email of 11 June 2020, the Claimant “confirmed” that it requested an oral hearing on
the Claimant’s Request and informed of its availability for a hearing during the week of 29
June 2020. The Claimant alleged that the Respondent continued to aggravate the dispute
and that the situation “cannot wait for another three weeks for a hearing and longer for a
decision without immediate, temporary intervention by the Tribunal.” It also informed that
(i) certain documents the Claimant wished to use as exhibits were confidential and that
before the Claimant put them on the record, the Claimant would seek to enter into a
confidentiality agreement with the Respondent; and (ii) the Parties were discussing the

terms of a confidentiality agreement.

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

By email of that same day, the Respondent noted that (i) it would respond to the Claimant’ s
allegations that the Respondent had aggravated the dispute in its Rejoinder on the
Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures; (ii) the “Claimant appears to be seeking to
expedite the schedule set by the Tribunal, which is not only procedurally inappropriate but
a continuation of its efforts to curtail Sierra Leone’s due process rights in this arbitration”,
and urged the Tribunal to reject the Claimant’s attempt; and (iii) while it was true that the
Claimant approached the Respondent to seek to enter into a confidentiality agreement, “to
date, other than a vague email, no such agreement has been proposed for [the

Respondent’s] consideration.”

On 15 June 2020, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Claimant’s Request (the
Respondent’s “Rejoinder”), together with a witness statement, Factual Exhibit R-12, and

Legal Authority RL-20.

By letter of 17 June 2020 the Claimant requested that the Tribunal (i) instruct the
Respondent to negotiate a confidentiality agreement with the Claimant “expeditiously and
in good faith” to have it finalized by 19 June 2020; (ii) order, if the Parties were able to
reach a confidentiality agreement by 19 June 2020, that the Respondent should be granted
leave to file a submission on the content of the confidential documents and the Claimant
be in turn granted leave to file a brief response; (iii) order, if the Parties were unable to
reach a confidentiality agreement by 19 June 2020, that the confidential documents should
be considered as confidential and treated as such, as of 20 June 2020, by order of the
Tribunal, and grant leave to the Parties to file submissions; and (iv) instruct the Claimant
to lodge the confidential documents with the Secretary of the Tribunal, which confidential
documents should be transmitted to the Respondent or the Tribunal only once (i) or (iii)
had crystallised. The Claimant’s letter was accompanied by Annexes A (including Parties’
email correspondence between 9 and 13 June 2020) and B (including the draft confidential

agreement sent by the Claimant’s counsel to the Respondent’s counsel).

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

On 18 June 2020, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment upon the Claimant’s
letter of 17 June 2020 and urged the Parties to successfully conclude their negotiations on

a confidentiality agreement.

On 19 June 2020, the Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal requesting the Tribunal to

reject the Claimant’s requests contained in its letter of 17 June 2020.

On 23 June 2020, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties, reiterating its invitation to the
Parties to successfully conclude their negotiations on a confidentiality agreement, and (i)
inviting the Claimant to produce the documents necessary to establish the Tribunal’s prima
facie jurisdiction for purposes of ruling on the Request for Provisional Measures, (ii)
ordering that these documents be considered confidential by both Parties, and (iii) inviting

the Respondent to comment on the content of the confidential documents.

On 25 June 2020, the Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal together with Factual Exhibits
C-81 through C-92, which the Claimant indicated to be confidential corporate documents
necessary to establish Gerald’s ownership of SL Mining and the Tribunal’s prima facie

jurisdiction.

By email of the same date, the Respondent communicated a note reflecting its
understanding of the Tribunal’s decision of 23 June 2020 on the confidential documents
and requested that the Tribunal clarify its instructions if the Respondent’s understanding
was not correct. The Respondent understanding was that the Respondent should be allowed
to print the confidential documents submitted by the Claimant, as may be necessary to

prepare its response.

Later the same date, the Claimant clarified that a confidentiality agreement was no longer
required as the Claimant’s need for a confidentiality agreement was superseded by the

Tribunal’s decision of 23 June 2020.

On 26 June 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that it did not require the Parties to continue to
seek a confidentiality agreement, although they would be free to do so and “that its decision

that the documents to be filed by [the] Claimant ‘shall be considered confidential by both

Parties’ implies that they shall not be made available to any third party and shall not be
used for any other purpose than the present proceedings. Such confidentiality does not
restrict the normal and reasonable use of such documents in the current proceedings by the
Parties and their counsel for the purpose of presenting their case. This includes, in
particular, accessing and reading the documents online as well as printing them in order to
study them. Of course, the Parties’ obligation to consider the documents confidential
implies that they have to ensure that the documents remain outside the reach of any third

party.”

On 30 June 2020, the Respondent sent a letter in response to the Claimant’s letter of 25

June 2020 to the Tribunal, together with Factual Exhibits R-13 through R-15

By email of 6 July 2020, the Claimant noted that it remained troubled by the critical
situation on the ground and by the Respondent’s continuing aggravation of the dispute. It
also informed the Tribunal that another SL Mining employee from the security department
was arrested on 28 June 2020, interviewed without the presence of counsel and remained

in jail.

On 8 July 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it did not consider, at this stage, that
it would be necessary to hold a hearing on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional
Measures. In addition, the Tribunal invited the Parties to address three specific questions
regarding the Claimant’s allegations concerning criminal investigations and bail conditions

of the SL Mining employees.

On 13 July 2020, the Parties submitted their respective responses to the Tribunal’s
questions of 8 July 2020. The Claimant’s response was accompanied by Factual Exhibits
C-94 through C-95 and Legal Authority C-95 and the Respondent’s response was

accompanied by a witness statement and Factual Exhibits R-16 through R-17.

On 16 July 2020, the Respondent submitted a letter supplementing its responses to the

Tribunal’s questions of 8 July 2020, together with a witness statement.

On 20 July 2020, via email to the Tribunal, the Claimant sought permission to respond to
the Respondent’s letter of 16 July 2020 by 23 July 2020, should it consider it necessary to

do so.

On 21 July 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that while it considered that the
Respondent’s letter of 16 July 2020 did not require further comment, the Claimant could

submit a brief response if it wished to do so.

By email of 23 July 2020, the Claimant indicated that it disagreed with the Respondent’s

submission of 16 July 2020 and referred to its position set out in its letter of 13 July 2020.

BACKGROUND ON THE CLAIMANT’S REQUEST

To the extent required for the Tribunal to address the Claimant’s Applications for
provisional measures, and for this limited purpose only, Section A below briefly
summarizes the factual background to the Parties’ underlying dispute in this Arbitration as
pleaded in the Request for Arbitration and in the Parties’ subsequent submissions on the
Claimant’s Request. This summary does not constitute any finding by the Tribunal on any
facts disputed by the Parties. Section B provides a short overview of the factual
background specific to the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures. This overview
is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all facts considered relevant by the
Tribunal. Further factual material will be addressed in the context of the Tribunal’s analysis

below.

A. THE PARTIES’ UNDERLYING DISPUTE

The dispute, as described in the Claimant’s Request for Arbitration, relates to SL Mining
Limited (“SL Mining”), a Sierra Leone company allegedly owned by Gerald, and its iron
ore project at the Marampa mine, in Port Loko District, Sierra Leone (the “Marampa

Project”).

In short, Gerald contends that the Sierra Leone Government took a series of unlawful
measures in order to coerce SL Mining into renegotiating the mining license agreement

(ICSID Case No. ARB/19/31)

 

57.

58.

59.

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

concluded between SL Mining and the Government of Sierra Leone for the operation of
the Marampa Project. These measures included, among others, threats of suspension of SL
Mining’s mining duties and tax waivers agreed upon under the license agreement, and a
temporary suspension of SL Mining’s concession. According to the Request, the dispute
escalated when Gerald and SL Mining served a Notice of Dispute under the UK - Sierra
Leone BIT.’ Sierra Leone allegedly retaliated by launching police investigations against
SL Mining’s management, and by imposing an indefinite shipping prohibition on SL

Mining that prevented SL Mining to export and sell Marampa ore.*

Due to this shipping prohibition, SL Mining faced a threat of having to place the Marampa
mine into “care and maintenance” (meaning that the mining operations must be put on
pause, hereby causing potentially serious economic consequences). SL Mining then
initiated an ICC emergency arbitrator proceeding under the mining license agreement.° The
ICC-appointed emergency arbitrator issued a series of interim orders requesting Sierra
Leone to, inter alia, lift the shipping prohibition and abide by the terms and conditions of
the mining license agreement.° According to Gerald, Sierra Leone refused to comply with

the orders and instead cancelled SL Mining’s license for the Marampa Project.”

An ICC Tribunal has since then been constituted and has confirmed the orders of the

Emergency Arbitrator.®

The Claimant’s Request for Arbitration relies upon several provisions of the UK - Sierra
Leone BIT. According to the Claimant, Sierra Leone’s alleged actions towards SL Mining

and Gerald constitute breaches of the protections accorded to Gerald’s investment under

Claimant’s Request for Arbitration, {{] 24-26.

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

The presentations of the Parties’ positions in the sections below are not meant to serve as
exhaustive reviews of the Parties’ submissions on the Claimant’s Request on Provisional
Measures, but as summaries of the arguments that are relevant to the Tribunal’s analysis
and findings. Regardless and as further indicated below,** the Tribunal has carefully

considered all the submissions made by the Parties.

A. THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

(dd) The Tribunal’s Power to Grant the Provisional Measures Requested
by the Claimant and the Standard for Intervention by the Tribunal
According to the Claimant, Articles 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 grant ICSID
tribunals “broad discretion to ‘recommend’ ... provisional measures” which they consider
appropriate to preserve the rights of a given party in an ICSID arbitration based on the
circumstances of the case.*? The Claimant further explains that “traditionally, tribunals
have held that it is appropriate to issue an order of provisional measures where — as here —
a party’s right to the preservation of the status quo, the non-aggravation of dispute, and the

integrity of the proceedings is threatened.”“°

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

The Claimant contends that it is also settled that ICSID tribunals may order provisional
measures prior to rulings on jurisdiction, and that ICSID tribunals need only to satisfy that

they have prima facie jurisdiction to issue provisional measures.*!

Further, the Claimant argues that provisional measures are usually issued in ICSID cases
when there is a need to prevent the aggravation of disputes. In the Claimant’s words, “the
past practice of tribunals establishes that parties have a duty not to take any action that
might aggravate the dispute, disrupt a party’s right to the status quo, or affect the integrity
of the arbitration.”*? According to the Claimant, this practice is based on the principle of
good faith in the conduct of proceedings* and the principle of integrity of the

proceedings. +

The Claimant elaborates on ICSID tribunals’ power to grant provisional measures, arguing

that:

e “the right to the integrity of ICSID proceedings includes a party’s right to evidence
its case through witness testimony”, and “the right to protect witnesses (including
potential witnesses) from interference and harassment.”*>

e “the right to the integrity of ICSID proceedings incorporates the right to preserve
and protect documentary evidence, including from unlawful seizure and
destruction,”*° and

e “tribunals have confirmed that the removal of management personnel from their
offices and the seizure of an investor’s premises, or the like, is a breach of a bilateral
investment treaty’s full protection and security (“FPS”) standard.”“”

On the standard for intervention by the Tribunal, the Claimant explains that, contrary to
what Sierra Leone asserts, the Tribunal has the authority to recommend provisional

measures in relation to domestic criminal proceedings.**

In particular, the Claimant argues that not only ICSID tribunals have found that they have
the power to order interim and provisional measures that seek to limit or even discontinue

domestic criminal proceedings,*® the provisional measures may be issued even when

domestic criminal proceedings are being conducted in an “ordinary”, “reasonable”, and
“good faith” manner.*’ Accordingly, the Claimant contends that Sierra Leone is wrong
when it argues that there is a “very high threshold” which has to be demonstrated and
“exceptional circumstances” have to exist for an ICSID tribunal to order a provisional

measure relating to criminal investigations.*! Finally, the Claimant argues that it is further

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

established in ICSID case-law that provisional measures are particularly warranted “if
criminal investigations or proceedings are being conducted in bad faith and unlawfully, to

the investor’s detriment.”°?

Based on these general considerations, the Claimant argues that because the Respondent
has and continues to breach the Claimant’s procedural rights (as further explained below
in Section IV.A.(3)), provisional measures are warranted in this case regardless of the fact
that these breaches are allegedly connected to on-going criminal proceedings in Sierra

Leone.

(2) The Issue of Burden of Proof

In its Response on Provisional Measures, the Respondent argues that ICSID tribunals have
accepted to issue “provisional orders affecting criminal proceedings only in extraordinary
cases where the requesting party meets a very high evidentiary threshold”** and that the

Claimant in the present case fails to meet such evidentiary threshold.*

In its Reply, the Claimant refutes this argument. According to the Claimant, “[t]here is no

‘heightened’ standard of proof in ICSID provisional measures practice”,>> the standard of

proof for establishing facts in provisional measures practice is “balance of probabilities”

or “sufficient likelihood.”°°

Further, the Claimant explains the standard of proof to support a request for provisional

measures should not be influenced by the nature of the allegations made in support of such

request.*” In the Claimant’s own words, “the seriousness of the allegation does not
automatically mean, as Sierra Leone suggests, that the moving party must submit some
‘extraordinary’ evidence that satisfies a ‘heightened’ standard. ... [t]he standard of proof
remains at the standard level of likelihood and balance of probabilities, without requiring
proof that is impossible to obtain, and may include ‘indirect’ evidence or reasonable

inferences.”**

Finally, the Claimant argues that the evidentiary burden shifts once a prima facie case for
provisional measures has been made by the requesting party,*? and that the Claimant has
discharged its prima facie burden by showing that the criminal proceedings against
Gerald’s employees and the document seizures “are improper and illegal and present a real,
immediate danger to the integrity of this proceeding and Gerald’s right to advance its case

+60

in an unobstructed manner. As a result, according to the Claimant, the burden of

disproving these contentions shift to Sierra Leone.*!

(3) The Claimant’s Request Satisfies the Legal Standard for the
Recommendation of Provisional Measures

According to the Claimant, its request satisfies each of the criteria required to recommend

provisional measures, namely:

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

The Claimant refers to ICSID case law based on which, according to the Claimant, the

Tribunal does not need to “examine in depth the claims and arguments submitted on the

merits of the

case,” but rather limit itself to “‘an initial analysis, i.e. ‘at first sight’.”

The Claimant then argues that, as demonstrated in its Request for Arbitration, and further

in its Request for Provisional Measures and in its letter dated 25 June 2020 relating to the

Claimant’s investment ownership structure, there shall be no doubt that:

iii.

Specifically

“Gerald is an ‘investor’, with a qualifying ‘investment’” pursuant to
Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25 of the Convention, and that the
Tribunal therefore has prima facie jurisdiction ratione personae,”

there is a “legal” dispute arising out of an “investment”, and that the
Tribunal therefore has prima facie jurisdiction ratione materiae,®

the dispute lies within the temporal scope of the BIT and the Tribunal
therefore has prima facie jurisdiction ratione temporis,° and

finally, the Parties have consented to ICSID arbitration and the Tribunal
therefore has prima facie jurisdiction ratione voluntatis.”

on the issue of the Claimant’s ownership of its alleged investment in Sierra

Leone, the Claimant argues that the exhibits submitted with its letter of 25 June 2020

demonstrate

of the shares

that, contrary to the Respondent’s contentions, “Gerald indirectly owns 100%

in SL Mining, a company registered and incorporated in Sierra Leone.”7!

© The requested measures are necessary.’

According to the Claimant, “[a] tribunal’s ‘necessity’ inquiry focuses on the nature and
extent of the harm which is likely to occur to the applicant in the event that the provisional
measures sought are not granted.””? The Claimant argues that in the present case, there is
“a material risk of serious or significant harm to Gerald’s procedural rights stemming
directly from Sierra Leone’s actions on 13-14 May 2020, including in particular with
respect to Gerald’s right to protect the status quo, prevent the aggravation of the dispute,
and safeguard the integrity of the proceedings by protecting access to witness and
documentary evidence,” and that “[o]n that basis alone, the requested measures are

necessary.”7>

© The requested measures are urgent.’

On the issue of urgency, the Claimant observes that “ICSID tribunals have considered the
urgency criterion to be satisfied if ‘a question cannot await the outcome of the award on
the merits.”””” According to the Claimant, “Gerald’s Request rests on its right to the non-
aggravation of the dispute, and the preservation of the integrity of the proceedings and the

status quo. By its very nature, the facts informing Gerald’s Request satisfy the urgency

requirement.””*

e The requested measures are proportional, because requiring Sierra Leone to respect
its legal obligations and to refrain from aggravating the dispute is not
inconvenient.”

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

Finally, the Claimant explains that in applying the criterion of proportionality and of the
balance of (in)convenience, the Tribunal has “to take into account the degree and the nature
of the harm that would be suffered by each Party to ensure that the provisional measure

ordered would be proportional in all the circumstances of the case.”*?

The Claimant submits that, in the present case, the measures requested do not cause any
inconvenience to Sierra Leone, as there were and are no reasons to criminally investigate
the SL Mining employees.*! According to the Claimant, “the same cannot be said for the
effect on Gerald of Sierra Leone’s continued detention.”** Should the Tribunal decline to
issue the measures requested by the Claimant, the Claimant faces significant risk that the
Detained Employees (as well as other SL Mining employees and local suppliers) will be
discouraged from participating in the arbitration, thereby seriously and significantly
harming the Claimant’s right to fully present its case.** Hence, the Claimant concludes
that “[t]he test for proportionality is met and the balance of (in)convenience falls squarely

in Gerald’s favour.”**

In further support to its demonstration that the Claimant’s request satis
the recommendation of provisional measures, the Claimant argues that the riots in Lunsar
which preceded the arrests of the SL Mining employees and the seizure of the SL Mining
documents had “nothing to do” with SL Mining,® and that the criminal proceedings started
against SL Mining employees were not only unjustified but also “illegal”, “improper”, and
“groundless” as a matter of international and domestic law.*° According to the Claimant,
this is demonstrated by the alleged lack of explanation by the Respondent for the arrests of

SL Mining’s employees and by the impossibility for the Respondent to show a “reasonable

suspicion,” the standard required by the provision in Sierra Leone’s Constitution on the
Protection from arbitrary arrest and detention,*’ justifying the arrests of the SL Mining

employees, and the criminal investigations more generally.**

The Claimant concludes that “[i]t is obviously striking that all of SL Mining’s senior
management would suddenly be investigated for the same nebulous crime. And then when
five of them are released on bail, for completely unexplained reasons they are still
prohibited from returning to the Marampa mine site.”*? Hence, according to the Claimant,
the Respondent’s conduct was “extraordinary, in bad faith, and in violation of fundamental

90

protections contained in its constitution,”’”’ and the provisional measures requested are

therefore warranted.

(4) The Claimant’s Responses to the Tribunal’s Questions of 8 July 2020

As indicated above, on 8 July 2020 the Tribunal invited the Parties to address three

questions regarding the Claimant’s allegations on the SL mining employees, namely:

e Do the SL Mining employees subjected to criminal investigations have a legal
possibility to challenge their imprisonment/bail conditions and, if so, have they
made use of it, and, if not, why not?

e What is the reason for not permitting those SL Mining employees who have been
released on bail to return to the Marampa site?

e What is the present status of the seventh SL Mining employee arrested on 28 June
2020?

In response to the Tribunal’s first question,®! the Claimant indicates that there are no viable
options for the SL Mining’s employees to challenge their imprisonment/bail conditions by

way of local proceedings, given that:

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

e Sierra Leone has not applied a procedure provided for in the Sierra Leone criminal
procedural law, and there is therefore no legal basis for the review of challenge of
this procedure;

e There is a risk of retaliation against the employees should they initiate any action
before domestic courts in Sierra Leone; and

e Even if there was a possibility of legal challenge, the proceedings would take at
least several months and would be of no immediate assistance to the employees.

As to the reason for not permitting the employees to return to the Marampa site, the
Claimant affirms that the SL Mining employees have only been told by Sierra Leone’s
authorities that SL Mining does not have a valid mining licence. According to the Claimant,
this reason is unsatisfactory given that the validity of the mining license does not have any

bearing on the right for SL Mining to legally remain on site.°”

Finally, the Claimant indicates that i. the seventh SL Mining employee subject
to criminal investigation was arrested on 28 June 2020 and released on bail on 6 July
2020.°° The Claimant argues that, like for the other previously arrested employees, the

arrest lacks any factual justification and legal ground.**

(5) The Claimant’s Request for Relief

The Claimant’s request for relief, as updated in its Reply, contains two categories of

requests.
First, the Claimant requests “interim provisional measures” including:

e “Ordering Sierra Leone to take all actions necessary to immediately, and within 8
hours of the Tribunal’s interim order, change the bail conditions for [the five Gerald
employees], so that they are allowed to return to the Marampa mine site, and further
ordering Sierra Leone to update the Tribunal and Gerald on all steps it has taken in
those respects within 4 hours of the Tribunal’s interim order;

e Ordering Sierra Leone to take all actions necessary to immediately, and within 8
hours of the Tribunal’s interim order, release a from detention and

ordering Sierra Leone to update the Tribunal and Gerald on all steps it has taken in
those respects within 4 hours of the Tribunal’s interim order;

Ordering Sierra Leone to take all actions necessary to immediately suspend the
criminal investigations and/or proceedings initiated against [the five Gerald
employees in Sierra Leone, and further ordering Sierra Leone
to update the Tribunal and Gerald on all steps it has taken in that respect within 12
hours of the Tribunal’s interim order; [and]

Ordering Sierra Leone to return to SL Mining all documents seized on 13 May
2020 from the Marampa mine site, within 24 hours of the Tribunal’s interim order,
and further ordering Sierra Leone to update the Tribunal and Gerald on all steps it
has taken in that respect within 12 hours of the Tribunal’s interim order.”>

Second, the Claimant further requests the Tribunal to urgently order measures for the entire

duration of the proceedings, including:

“Ordering Sierra Leone to immediately comply with any aspect of the Tribunal’s
interim order with which it has not complied as of the date of the Tribunal’s final
order;

Ordering Sierra Leone to refrain from engaging in any conduct that may directly
or indirectly affect (or otherwise jeopardise) the legal or physical integrity of any
directors, shareholders, representatives, or employees of Gerald or SL Mining,
including but not limited to [the five Gerald employees and i:

Ordering Sierra Leone to refrain from any further seizure or interference with
Gerald’s or SL Mining’s assets (including its equipment, stockpiles of iron ore or
documents, whether at the Marampa mine site or elsewhere), or its legal rights in
Sierra Leone, including with respect to the Marampa mine and the land on which it
is situated, and to allow SL Mining’s employees (including all security staff) to
operate from and base themselves at the Marampa mine site;

For the avoidance of doubt, ordering Sierra Leone to refrain from taking any step,
action (judicial or otherwise) or other measures that would interfere with Gerald’s
investments, alter the status quo ante, aggravate the dispute or threaten the integrity
of the proceeding, or render ineffective any relief that this Tribunal ultimately may
award;

© Ordering any other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate.”°°

B. THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

(wD The Tribunal’s Power to Order Interim and Provisional Measures
and the Legal Test for the Issuance of Provisional Measures
The Respondent accepts that, pursuant to Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules, ICSID tribunals
have the authority to recommend provisional measures, but observes nonetheless that “that

authority is not unlimited,”””

and that ICSID practice shows that tribunals consider that
they lack the power to grant measures interfering with a State’s sovereign right to conduct

criminal proceedings.”*

Based on these observations, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal in the present case
“does not have the power to prohibit Sierra Leone from exercising one of its most
fundamental and quintessentially sovereign rights: to enforce its criminal laws by
investigating the commission of serious offenses within its territory,” and that should the
Tribunal have and decide to exercise this power, it would “in effect, put Sierra Leone’s
good faith criminal investigations under foreign scrutiny merely because the subjects of
investigation are employees of a company whose alleged shareholder happens to have filed

a claim against the State.”°°

Further, the Respondent argues that even if the Tribunal had the power to order the
requested measures, it could only do so if the Claimant demonstrated, through concrete
evidence, the existence of bad faith or a violation of rights. In particular, the Respondent

submits that ICSID tribunals are generally reluctant to interfere with State prerogatives

such as criminal law enforcement and do so only in exceptional circumstances, in which
the requesting party bears the burden of proving.'°° According to the Respondent, “that
burden can only be met through the presentation of ‘concrete evidence’ showing that the
conduct of the State went beyond a legitimate exercise of this sovereign right,”!°! and the

“exceptional circumstances that justify these kinds of provisional measures are bad faith or

a violation of rights.” !?

With respect to the legal test for the issuance of provisional measures in an ICSID
proceeding, the Respondent agrees with the Claimant that there are five criteria to be
considered by an ICSID tribunal in deciding whether a provisional measure should be
granted, namely (i) the necessity for the tribunal to establish prima facie jurisdiction to hear

the dispute, (ii) the existence of a right, (iii) the existence of an irreparable impairment of

this right, (iv) the urgency of the remedial measure, and (v) proportionality. !°

(2) The Respondent’s Arguments on the Claimant’s Failure to Meet its
Burden of Proof

As indicated above, the Respondent argues that ICSID tribunals accept to issue provisional
measures interfering with criminal investigations only when the requesting party

discharges its burden of proof and satisfies a demanding evidentiary threshold.'°

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

On the issue of burden of proof, the Respondent refutes the Claimant’s argument on the
doctrine of burden shifting.'°> According to the Respondent, the law is clear with respect
to the issue of the burden of proof in the case of provisional measures: it is the requesting
party who “has the burden of showing why the measures should be recommended,” !°° and
none of the authorities cited by the Claimant shows that in the context of provisional
measures relating to criminal proceedings, burden shifting is either appropriate or

permissible. !°7

(3) The Respondent’s Arguments on the Five Criteria for the Imposition
of Provisional Measure
According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to meet the five criteria for the
imposition of provisional measures, that is (i) prima facie jurisdiction, (ii) the existence of

rights to be protected, (iii) necessity, (iv) urgency, and (v) proportionality.

In its Response and Objection, the Respondent examines separately these five criteria and
demonstrates how, in its view, the Claimant fails to satisfy each criterion. 108 Th its
Rejoinder, the Respondent addresses first the issue of the jurisdiction prima facie and
explains, for the remaining criteria that, “because the substantive elements of the legal test
for provisional measures (existence of a right in need of protection, necessity, urgency and
proportionality) are all closely related,” the Respondent elected to address them jointly in
its second submission.!°” The summary below follows the structure of the Respondent’s

latest submission.

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

In particular, the Respondent argues that the Claimant fails to make a prima facie showing
of jurisdiction, given that Claimant presents no evidence of its ownership interest in SL

Mining.!!°

According to the Respondent, the documents submitted by the Claimant “lack the
evidentiary value required to demonstrate that SL Mining is indirectly and wholly owned

by Claimant,”!!!

especially because they do not establish, accurately, correctly and
completely Claimant’s indirect ownership through all the corporate links within Gerald’s

alleged corporate structure. !!”

e The Claimant’s failure to prove that its rights are in urgent need of protection (the
existence of a right, urgency, necessity and proportionality).

The Respondent further explains that the Claimant has failed to meet its burden of

demonstrating that it has a right that is threatened with irreparable impairment by Sierra

Leone’s legitimate criminal investigations, and that it is in urgent need of protection.

In particular, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s request is based on unsupported
premise and baseless allegations. The Respondent refers notably to the failure of the
Claimant to prove that (i) the arrests of the employees are based on anything other than
“reasonable suspicion”,''? (ii) the arrested employees were not informed of the “facts and
grounds for the arrests,''* (iii) the employees’ arrests and detentions are otherwise
illegal,!!> (iv) the conditions of the employees’ bail are arbitrary,''® (v) the arrests of the

employees have caused “irreparable harm’”,!'” (vi) the arrest of ; has

aggravated the dispute,''® (vii) the criminal investigation has discouraged SL Mining

9

employees and others from assisting the Claimant in this arbitration,'!? and (viii) the

document seizure was conducted without a proper legal basis. !7°

The Respondent concludes that based on these failures, the Claimant’s request for

provisional measures should be rejected.

(4) The Respondent’s Responses to the Tribunal’s Questions of 8 July
2020
The Respondent addressed the three questions pertaining to the status of SL Mining

Employees in its Letter to the Tribunal dated 13 July 2020.

First, relying on Mr. Fisher’s witness statements the Respondent argues that several legal
actions are available to the SL Mining employees, including the request for a writ of habeas
corpus, the filing of a complaint before “the Criminal Investigation Department [...], the
Inspector General of the Police, the Independent Police Complaints Board, the Local Unit
Commander (LUC), Human Rights Commission, or the Attorney-General’s office,” or an
action before domestic courts.!?! According to the Respondent, none of the SL Mining
employees has challenged his detention through any of the above-mentioned mechanisms,

nor have they challenged the conditions of their bail.!7?

Second, while the Respondent notes that it cannot speak on behalf of the Sierra Leone
police authorities regarding the reasons for not permitting the SL Mining employees’ return
to the Marampa site, given that the criminal investigation is still on-going, the Respondent

notes that “in the case of a person suspected of having committed the offense of incitement,

it is not uncommon to restrict, as a condition on bail, that person’s ability to return to the

location where the incitement activities allegedly took place.”!”

Finally, the Respondent explains that it was not possible for Sierra Leone’s international
counsel and the Office of the Attorney-General “to determine whether a seventh employee
of SL Mining was arrested, and if so, the employee’s identity and status,”'*+ but that it will
“nonetheless continue to investigate the matter after this submission [...] and provide the

Tribunal with any information about the individual’s status as soon as possible.” !?°

In its letter dated 16 July 2020,'?° the Respondent supplemented its responses of 13 July,
confirming that the seventh SL Mining employee who was arrested was | and
that he had been released on bail on 7 July 2020 and exceptionally been permitted to visit
a sick child in Lunsar on 9 July 2020.

(5) The Respondent’s Request for Relief

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent identifies the changes that the Claimant made in its
requests to the Tribunal between the Claimant’s Request on Provisional Measures and the
Claimant’s Reply on Provisional Measures and argues that some of these changes
demonstrate either a lack of proportionality in the Claimant’s requests, '2’ or a “pattern of
disregard for this arbitral process.” !?

The Respondent further requests that the Tribunal (i) deny all the Claimant’s requests in
their entirety, and (ii) order the Claimant to immediately reimburse the Respondent for its

costs and fees in relation with the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures. !7°

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

THE TRIBUNAL’S CONSIDERATIONS

A. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

In order to arrive at its decision, the Tribunal reviewed and considered all the arguments of
the Parties and the documents submitted by them in this phase of the proceedings. The fact
that the Tribunal does not specifically mention a given argument or reasoning does not
mean that it has not considered it. In their submissions, the Parties produced and cited
numerous awards and decisions dealing with matters that they consider relevant to the
presently sought provisional measures. The Tribunal has considered these documents
carefully and may take into account the reasoning and findings of these and other tribunals.
However, in coming to a decision on the matter of provisional measures requested by the
Claimant, the Tribunal must perform, and in fact has performed, an independent analysis

of the ICSID Convention, the Arbitration Rules, and the particular facts of this case.

B. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK

For the decision on provisional measures, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39

of the ICSID Arbitration Rules are applicable.

Article 47 of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:

“Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that
the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which
should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.”

Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules reads in relevant part as follows:

“(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request
that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended
by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the
measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances
that require such measures.

(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made
pursuant to paragraph (1).

144.

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own
initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It
may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.

(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or
revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of
presenting its observations.”

The BIT is silent on the matter and thus in no way restricts or conditions the Tribunal’s

power to recommend provisional measures.

It is generally accepted and also common ground between the Parties that before issuing
provisional measures, an ICSID tribunal should first be satisfied that it has prima facie

jurisdiction to decide the merits of the case.

It is also common ground between the Parties that provisional measures must (i) serve to
protect certain rights of the applicant and (ii) meet the requirements of necessity and (iii)

urgency, as well as (iv) proportionality.

Before addressing these specific conditions for the issuance of provisional measures, the
Tribunal feels compelled to address a possibly more fundamental point of disagreement
between the Parties. That is the question whether an arbitral tribunal has the authority to

grant interim relief affecting the power of a State to conduct criminal proceedings.

Cc. THE POWER TO GRANT THE REQUESTED RELIEF CONCERNING THE CONDUCT
OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

The Claimant maintains that ICSID tribunals have the power to order provisional measures

also in cases where they would be aimed at the way how host States conduct criminal

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

proceedings, '*° whereas the Respondent seems to insist that such power does not extend to

measures that interfere with criminal proceedings. '*!

While the Parties refer to a number of ICSID cases where tribunals have taken diverging
approaches to the matter, it appears to the Tribunal that even the Respondent does not
question the fundamental premise that investment tribunals may exceptionally order
preliminary measures if they have sufficient ground to be concerned that criminal

proceedings are not conducted in good faith. '**

The Tribunal shares the view expressed by other ICSID tribunals that provisional measures
that concern the sovereign right to conduct criminal proceedings must be issued with

caution.

It specifically concurs with the views of the tribunals in Caratube v. Kazakhstan and PNG

v. Papua New Guinea having stated that:

“Tt]he State’s investigative powers, including in criminal matters, are ‘a
most obvious and undisputed part of [its] sovereign right ... to implement
and enforce its national law on its territory’ and ‘a particularly high
threshold must be over-come before an ICSID Tribunal can indeed
recommend provisional measures regarding criminal investigations
conducted by a state.” !73

See Claimant's Reply on Provisional Measures, 8 June 2020, {[ 11.1 (“ICSID tribunals do have the power to
order interim and provisional measures that seek to limit or even discontinue domestic criminal
proceedings.”).

See Respondent’s Response and Objections to Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures, 15 June 2020,

48 (“[...] the Tribunal does not have the power to prohibit Sierra Leone from exercising one of its most.
fundamental and quintessentially sovereign rights: to enforce its criminal laws by investigating the
commission of serious offenses within its territory [...].”).

SGS v. Pakistan tribunal’s determination that an ICSID tribunal may not interfere with a State’s sovereign
right to conduct good faith criminal investigations is correct.”); ibid, | 19 (“Thus, Sierra Leone’s position,
reflected in ICSID practice, remains valid and unrebutted: a tribunal’s power to issue interim and provisional
measures does not extend to measures that would interfere with a State’s sovereign right and duty to conduct
good faith criminal investigations.”).

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

It is further in agreement with the tribunal in Churchill Mining v. Indonesia stressing that:

“[...] the right, even the duty, to conduct criminal investigations and
prosecutions is a prerogative of any sovereign State. By way of
consequence, ICSID tribunals have rightly held that when it comes to
criminal proceedings “a particularly high threshold must be overcome”
before an ICSID tribunal can recommend provisional measures.” '*+

However, the Tribunal also agrees with the tribunals in Burlington v. Ecuador'*> and Ipek
v. Turkey that an ICSID tribunal’s power to adopt provisional measures may in appropriate
cases even entail “some interference with a State’s sovereign powers and enforcement
duties.”!*° Thus, the latter tribunal did not hesitate to eventually order the suspension of
criminal proceedings in the respondent state.'?’ In a similar vein, the tribunal in Nova
Group v. Romania concluded that “domestic criminal proceedings are not per se immune

from potential recommendation of provisional measures under Article 47.”!%8

Thus, the Tribunal is not prevented from ordering provisional measures in the context of

criminal proceedings, as a matter of principle. However, it considers that resort to such

measures is only justified in exceptional situations, such as where they are not instituted or

conducted in good faith. '°

D. BURDEN AND STANDARD OF PROOF

The Parties apparently also disagree on both the burden and the standard of proof required

for the issuance of provisional measures.

The Claimant suggests that it merely needs to make a prima facie case for provisional
measures upon which Respondent would bear the burden of disproving them.'#°
Additionally, the Claimant asserts that even if it had to prove the case for provisional
measures, the applicable standard would not be a heightened or extraordinary standard of

proof, but rather a mere sufficient likelihood. i

The Respondent objects and maintains that the burden of proof must rest with the party
seeking to establish that provisional measures are warranted'*? and that provisional
measures aimed at restricting criminal investigations do not merely require a lenient

standard, but rather a particularly high threshold. '**

The Tribunal sees no reason why it should depart from the established rule that the
requesting party has the burden of showing that provisional measures should be
recommended.'** In this context, the Tribunal notes that the examples provided by the
Claimant for a shifting of the burden of proof practically all stem from cases not addressing

provisional measures. The well-known principle actori incumbit probatio, according to

which the burden of proof is upon the claimant or the party making an assertion, also

applies to provisional measures. !4°

The Tribunal does not see that an extraordinary situation that may exceptionally justify a
shifting of the burden of proof in regard to the prerequisites for provisional measures, such
as a loss or inaccessibility of documents, is present. Therefore, it is upon the Claimant to

demonstrate that the requirements for ordering provisional measures are fulfilled.

In regard to the standard of proof, the Tribunal is not convinced that any abstract standard
of proof, ranging from “lenient” to “heightened” would be particularly helpful. It concurs
with other tribunals that provisional measures constitute extraordinary remedies aimed at
preserving the rights of parties litigating their cases in arbitral proceedings and at ensuring
that they will both receive a fair process. Interim procedures are not meant to interfere with
the final adjudication of the dispute but, to the contrary, to ensure that such adjudication

can take place.

The Tribunal agrees that provisional measures are “exceptional” remedies in particular
where they concern the exercise of sovereign powers, such as the enforcement of criminal
law.'#° Whether such exceptionality should be regarded as an evidentiary rule may be

questioned though. It rather appears that investment tribunals should resort to indicating

See, e.g., Maffezini v. Spain, Decision on Provisional Measures, Procedural Order No. 2, 28 October 1999,

provisional measures potentially affecting criminal investigations only reluctantly and

where there is an urgent need.

Such urgency and necessity as well as the other prerequisites can be proved by a

preponderance of evidence, however.

In this regard, the Tribunal concurs with the standard expressed in Caratube I according

to which “|

 

the applicant’s burden of proof is that it must establish the requirements
with sufficient likelihood, without however having to actually prove the facts underlying

them.”!47

Although the Tribunal has decided that the present situation does not warrant any shifting
of the burden of proof and that the existence of the requirements for the grant of provisional
measures must be proved with sufficient likelihood, it needs to point out that in regard to
jurisdiction only prima facie proof is required since the question of jurisdiction will be

decided by the Tribunal in detail at a later stage of this arbitration.

E. PRIMA FACIE JURISDICTION

The Respondent takes issue that the Claimant’s alleged ownership link with SL Mining in
the form of 100% shareholding lacks any supportive evidence. Indeed, this is forcefully

argued by Respondent, stating that “[d]espite the centrality of the issue, the Claimant has

+148,

provided nothing beyond naked assertions to substantiate its alleged ownership’ and it

was initially surprising to the Tribunal that the Claimant did not respond to these

jurisdictional arguments in its Reply,'#? a fact which was also stressed by the Respondent

in its Rejoinder.!°°

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

Only in the Claimant’s letter dated 17 June 2020,'5! it was revealed that the Claimant’s
silence on the matter was motivated by its seeking a confidentiality agreement with the
Respondent on documents exchanged in the course of this arbitration which would include
the documentation evidencing the Claimant’s ownership relationship to SL Mining. In this
letter, the Claimant alleged a lack of cooperation on the part of the Respondent in reaching

such a confidentiality agreement.

In its letter dated 19 June 2020, '*? the Respondent rejected this latter allegation and pointed
out that the usual proof for corporate ownership would ordinarily be available even
publicly, rendering a confidentiality agreement unnecessary. In any case, in the
Respondent’s view such a confidentiality agreement could have been negotiated since the
Claimant’s Notice of Intent, dated 14 July 2019, instead of in the middle of the provisional

measures debate.

Following the Tribunal’s 23 June 2020 letter to the Parties, inviting the Claimant to produce
the documents necessary to establish the Tribunal’s prima facie jurisdiction for purposes
of ruling on the Request for Provisional Measures and ordering that these documents be
considered as confidential by both Parties, the Claimant produced a number of corporate
documents, aimed to demonstrate that “Gerald indirectly owns 100% of the shares in SL
Mining, a company registered and incorporated in Sierra Leone.” !?

On 30 June 2020, the Respondent commented on these documents, questioning their
evidentiary value to demonstrate “that SL Mining is indirectly and wholly owned by

Claimant and SL Mining were “[...] not crosschecked against the official Registry of

Corporate Affairs to ensure their accuracy, correctness, and completeness.” !°°

The Parties are in agreement that in order to recommend provisional measures an ICSID

tribunal must be satisfied that it has prima facie jurisdiction.'*°

The Tribunal considers that a determination whether or not prima facie jurisdiction exists
should not anticipate a thorough analysis of potentially ensuing jurisdictional challenges

by either Party. Rather, the Tribunal should satisfy itself that upon an initial analysis, i.e.

  

“at first sight’/prima facie, it has jurisdiction. For this, it is necessary and sufficient that

the facts alleged by the Claimant establish this jurisdiction without it being necessary or

possible at this stage to verify them and analyse them in depth.!°’

The Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in PNG v. Papua New Guinea that “[t]he
determination of the prima facie jurisdiction for provisional measures is a somewhat higher

threshold than that to be applied at the registration stage, although it of course also falls

short of a final decision on jurisdiction.” !>*

The exchange of submissions by the Parties demonstrates that among the jurisdictional

requirements it is primarily the alleged ownership link between the Claimant and SL

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

Mining that is questioned by the Respondent.'* Since at this stage of the proceedings, the
Respondent has not questioned other jurisdictional requirements, the Tribunal will focus

on the question of the ownership link.

In the present case, the Claimant, a UK company, asserts that it indirectly wholly owns SL
Mining, the company which allegedly suffered harm by the Respondent in violation of the
BIT. The documents conveyed to the Tribunal by the Claimant indicate that through a chain
of corporate entities SL Mining is indirectly owned by the Claimant.'® While the Parties

are in disagreement as to the evidentiary value of these documents, '°!

they, at first sight,
appear to confirm the ownership relations between the Claimant and SL Mining. Both the

UK and Sierra Leone have been parties to the ICSID Convention since the mid-1960s.

On this basis, the jurisdictional requirements ratione personae, that the Claimant be a
national of a party to the ICSID Convention and the Respondent also be a party to the
ICSID Convention are prima facie equally fulfilled as is the ratione materiae requirement
that the dispute concerns an investment. Similarly, the required consent to ICSID
arbitration appears to be given on the basis of Article 8 of the UK - Sierra Leone BIT which

entered into force in 2001.

This prima facie conclusion is without prejudice to a full review of the jurisdictional

arguments of the Parties at the appropriate stage of this arbitration.

F. NECESSITY, URGENCY AND PROPORTIONALITY

Although not expressly laid down in Article 47 ICSID Convention or Rule 39 on
provisional measures, ICSID tribunals generally accept that the circumstances that require

such measures are necessity and urgency and that they have to pass a proportionality test.

It is also evident from the Parties’ submissions that they accept these requirements as a

162

matter of principle, '°~ although they disagree on whether they are fulfilled in the present

case.

As stated by the tribunal in Occidental v. Ecuador, “in order for an international tribunal
to grant provisional measures, there must exist both a right to be preserved and
circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid irreparable harm.”!® And according to
the tribunal in Plama v. Bulgaria, “[t}he need for provisional measures must be urgent and
necessary to preserve the status quo or avoid the occurrence of irreparable harm or

damage.” !®4

That provisional measures must be necessary follows from the wording of Article 47 which
requires that a tribunal considers that “the circumstances so require.”!® A provisional
measure is “necessary” where the actions of a party “are capable of causing or of
threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked.” !©° While many tribunals determine

necessity by ascertaining whether otherwise “irreparable harm” would be caused,'®” some

The Parties agree on the requirements of necessity and urgency as a matter of principle.
However, they interpret the specific levels of necessity and urgency differently and they

these issues below.

requirement that is sometimes considered to be inherent in “necessity’ and sometimes

considered to be closely linked to “urgency.”!7”

In the context of provisional measures aimed at domestic criminal proceedings, the tribunal
in Quiborax v. Bolivia aptly stated that proportionality requires that an arbitral tribunal

“must thus balance the harm caused to Claimants by the criminal proceedings and the harm

however, the only time constraint is that the measure be granted before an award — even if the grant is to be
some time hence. The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the level of urgency required depends on the type
of measure which is requested.”).

that would be caused to Respondent if the proceedings were stayed or terminated.”!”8 Such
a balancing exercise takes into account, among others, the relative importance of the
respective rights and interests affected, the existence of exceptional circumstances, the

good faith of the parties, the specificity of the requests, etc.

These questions are also related to the specific rights sought to be protected by the request

for provisional measures. Thus, the Tribunal will address them below as well.

G. RIGHTS TO BE PROTECTED

According to Article 47 ICSID Convention, the main explicit purpose of provisional
measures is the preservation of “the respective rights of either party.”!”” Thus, such
measures must be necessary in order to preserve rights the protection of which is being

sought in proceedings brought on the merits.

As already noted, however, the Parties do not disagree that provisional measures may also
serve to protect certain procedural rights of the Parties, such as the right to ensure that a
fair procedure before this Tribunal is not made impossible. This entails, in particular, the
applicant’s “right to freely present its case before this Tribunal [...] the right to gather and

present documents, and to identify and present witnesses.” !8°

The Respondent disputes, however, that the police investigations and any eventual criminal
proceedings threaten any procedural rights of the Claimant or would aggravate the

dispute.!*!

The Claimant’s requests for interim relief focus on measures securing its procedural rights
in the present ICSID proceedings, not rights the protection of which are being sought in

these proceedings on the merits.

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

The Tribunal thus has to assess whether the specific orders requested by the Claimant serve

the protection of its procedural rights.

In its 19 May 2020 Request, The Claimant asked the Tribunal, as interim provisional
measures, to order “Sierra Leone to take all actions necessary to immediately release from
detention and to return to the Marampa mine site” its five employees then held in custody
by the Respondent’s police, as well as the suspension of criminal investigations and/or
proceedings against them, and to “return to SL Mining all documents, data and equipment

seized on 13 May 2020 from the Marampa mine site.”!*”

The Claimant further requested the Tribunal to recommend, among others, the following
provisional measures “for the duration of the proceeding”: to order “Sierra Leone to refrain
from engaging in any conduct that may directly or indirectly affect (or otherwise
jeopardise) the legal or physical integrity of any directors, shareholders, representatives, or
employees of Gerald or SL Mining,” and “to refrain from any further seizure or interference
with Gerald’s or SL Mining’s assets (including its equipment, stockpiles of iron ore or
documents, whether at the Marampa mine site or elsewhere), or its legal rights in Sierra
Leone, including with respect to the Marampa mine and the land on which it is situated,
and to allow SL Mining’s employees (including all security staff) to operate from and base
themselves at the Marampa mine site;” as well as “to refrain from taking any step, action
(judicial or otherwise) or other measures that would interfere with Gerald’s investments,
alter the status quo ante, aggravate the dispute or threaten the integrity of the proceeding,

or render ineffective any relief that this Tribunal ultimately may award.” !*3

In its 8 June 2020 Reply, after the release on bail of the five SL Mining employees arrested
in May 2020, the Claimant further requested that the Respondent be ordered to change their

bail conditions'** and to release a sixth SL Mining employee from detention and police

In its Reply the Claimant no longer requested the return of “data and equipment”, but

confined itself to requesting the return of “documents” seized on 13 May 2020.'*°

Following the release from detention and police custody of the sixth SL Mining employee
on 15 June 2020, as well as of a seventh one (subsequently detained) in early July 2020,
the Claimant focused its request on ordering a change to their bail conditions which

prevented them all from returning to the Marampa mine site.

These requests broadly fall into three categories: first, those that relate to the criminal
investigations/proceedings directed against SL Mining employees, second, those that relate
to documents seized in the course of such investigations, though initially also including
mining equipment and proceeds, and, third, those that concern general duties of the parties

not to aggravate a dispute.

() Criminal Investigations against and Treatment of SL Mining
Personnel

The Claimant’s request to order “Sierra Leone to take all actions necessary to immediately
release from detention and to return to the Marampa mine site” its employees primarily
seeks to ensure their physical integrity. It is not directly related to preserve the Claimant’s
rights except to the extent that it is argued that the criminal investigations hamper its right
to present its case before this Tribunal and that the presence of the personnel at the mine

site is required in order to protect the latter.

Criminal investigations as such do not render the Claimant’s right to freely present its case

impossible.

However, it is also clear that criminal investigations initiated as a retaliation for bringing
an investment case, or with a view to intimidating and harassing potential witnesses of a

Party may give rise to a situation where provisional measures are exceptionally warranted.

Indeed, investment tribunals have found that host State criminal proceedings initiated
because of the institution of investment proceedings,'*’ or in bad faith or maliciously,'*
or for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage in the arbitration, e.g. by obtaining
evidence!®? or by intimidating and harassing potential witnesses,'°? may constitute such

exceptional situations.

This is also acknowledged by the Respondent, arguing that “[t]he requesting party bears
the burden of proving the existence of exceptional circumstances that would justify the
relief it seeks” and “that the exceptional circumstances that justify these kinds of
provisional measures are bad faith or a violation of rights.”!?! The Respondent also does
not dispute that criminal proceedings in Sierra Leone might discourage potential witnesses
from giving evidence. It expressly “acknowledges that Claimant has a right to freely

present its case before this Tribunal [which] includes the right [...] to identify and present

witnesses. Rather, the Respondent maintains that “the allegation that other potential

witnesses could be discouraged by the ongoing criminal investigation is highly

speculative.”!9

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant repeatedly insinuates that the criminal investigations
have been instituted on spurious grounds and were meant to target and intimidate SL

Mining employees.!™*

The Tribunal is seriously concerned about the temporal coincidence of the criminal
investigations with the beginning of the present ICSID proceedings. It is further troubled
by the unclear connection between the youth riots in Lunsar, a village near the SL Mining
complex at the Marampa mine site, in late April 2020 and the role of the SL Mining
employees arrested on 13 May 2020 as well as on subsequent dates “on suspicion of

inciting riots that have resulted in the deaths of a number of people.”!°

The Tribunal also notes, however, that it appears that no formal challenge in regard to the
arrests’ and the investigations’ legality has been made by any of the SL Mining employees.
The Tribunal is aware of the Claimant’s argument that the police investigations including
the arrests had been unlawful for failure to show a “reasonable suspicion”!*® and that
because the SL Mining employees were concerned about retaliatory action they considered
challenging their imprisonment/bail conditions “not a viable option.”!°” Nevertheless, it is
not for this arbitral tribunal to provide relief for allegedly unlawful investigations, arrests
and bail conditions. This is a matter that must be pursued in the national legal system of

the Respondent state. The Tribunal notes in this context that the credible witness testimony

by the Respondent’s witness, Mr. Fisher, to the effect that the law of Sierra Leone provides

legal remedies, '* has not been challenged by the Claimant.

The Arbitral Tribunal also notes that there is no evidence at this time that the investigations
were initiated in bad faith or by way of retaliation. Although the timing as well as the cause
of the investigations may raise questions, it is clear that a State must be able to resort to its

criminal justice system in order to investigate occurrences of violent crimes.

Balancing the interests of the Respondent in exercising its sovereign right to conduct
criminal investigations aimed at examining the causes of and identifying those responsible
for the unrest in late April/early May 2020 and those of the Claimant in seeking to shield
its employees from the potential abuse of such investigations shows that ordering “Sierra
Leone to take all actions necessary to immediately suspend the criminal investigations
and/or proceedings” would intrude too far into the rights of a State to enforce its criminal

law.

It is clear that States have to conduct criminal investigations in accordance with their own
law and respecting fundamental rights of the accused. It is also clear that in regard to
potential witnesses in ICSID proceedings, “[t]he immunity granted by Art. 21 and 22
[ICSID Convention] is applicable without a specific order of an ICSID Tribunal.”!”? An
additional and even broader immunization of persons “from the normal operation of the

200

criminal law would in the current circumstances be too broad and_ thus

disproportionately interfere with the Respondent’s sovereign rights.

The Claimant also requests the Tribunal to order the Respondent “to take all actions
necessary to immediately [...] change the bail conditions for [its employees], so that they

are allowed to return to the Marampa mine site [...].”2"!

This is a more focused request that arguably links the criminal proceedings to the
investment, its protection and ultimately the current ICSID proceedings. Thus, the Tribunal
asked the Parties why those SL Mining employees who had been released on bail were not

permitted to return to the Marampa site.

The Claimant repeatedly stressed that the presence of the SL Mining employees would
contribute to the security of the mine, since a number of them were security staff, as well

as to reducing their own health risk in the exceptional Covid-19 pandemic situation.”°?

While not directly responding to this question because of the pending investigations, the
Respondent suggests that persons suspected of having committed offenses of incitement,
are often restricted in their ability to return to places where the incitement activities

allegedly took place.?°*

While this is an understandable policy, it also appears that it could be equally well pursued
by fashioning the bail conditions in a way that allowed the SL Mining employees to return
to the Marampa mine in order to ensure the safety of the investment, while at the same time
restricting their abode to the mine which is located a few miles away from the village where

the investigated crimes took place.

Therefore, the Tribunal urges Sierra Leone to convey its considerations to the competent
authorities which have to decide on the bail conditions so that they can seriously consider

adapting the current bail conditions with a view to allowing the Claimant’s employees to

return to the Marampa mine site. It would appear to the Tribunal that such a course of
action would not interfere with Sierra Leone’s sovereign rights to pursue its criminal
investigations, while taking into account the legitimate concerns of the Claimant for the

safety and security of its employees and its investment.

(2) Documents seized

The Claimant further requests the Tribunal to order “Sierra Leone to return to SL Mining
all documents seized on 13 May 2020.2 The potential impairment of the Claimant’s
procedural rights appears evident in the case of documents that might have been removed
or destroyed as a result of the seizure. In fact, the Claimant specifically invokes “the right
to preserve and protect documentary evidence, including from unlawful seizure and

+206

destruction’ and the Respondent expressly “acknowledges that the Claimant has a right

to freely present its case before this Tribunal. This includes the right to gather and present
documents [...].”27

As the tribunal in Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania put it, “necessity and urgency are present
where a Respondent fails to take steps to preserve or to provide documentation relevant to
a Claimant’s case, or in circumstances where there is a risk of loss or destruction of such
documentation.”°°

There is no evidence at this time that the documents allegedly seized by police forces are
in danger of being lost or destroyed or would otherwise not be available to the Claimant.
The Respondent does not deny that some documents have been seized, but confirms that

they will remain intact and available in the present proceedings.” In the face of such an

explicit commitment, the Tribunal sees no need for ordering the return of the documents.

Rather, the Claimant can rely on this specific undertaking by the Respondent.

In addition, it remains unclear to what extent the allegedly seized documents are relevant
to the proceedings. Some of the documents mentioned by the Claimant do not evidently
demonstrate such relevance. In order to remove such doubts the Tribunal will order the
Respondent to detail the documents seized, to make a full copy of them, to preserve the

originals and to make the copies available to the Claimant and the Tribunal.

In case the seized documents were no longer available in the course of these ICSID

proceedings, the Tribunal would be entitled to eventually draw adverse inferences.

(3) Aggravation of the Dispute

The Parties do not dispute that the non-aggravation of a dispute is a general duty of parties
to any ICSID proceedings?'® and that such end may be supported by ordering interim

measures.

A dispute may escalate in various forms. As mentioned above, this could also arise from

intimidating and harassing potential witnesses.

However, it is also clear that the institution of criminal investigations that relate to an

investment, even during the pendency of an investment dispute do not automatically

aggravate such dispute.”!!

Procedural Order No. 2 — Decision on the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures

The Tribunal is further concerned about the breadth of the Claimant’s request which
generally seeks interim relief ordering the Respondent “to refrain from taking any step,
action (judicial or otherwise) or other measures that would interfere with Gerald’s
investments, alter the status quo ante, aggravate the dispute or threaten the integrity of the
proceeding, or render ineffective any relief that this Tribunal ultimately may award,”?!?
and “to refrain from engaging in any conduct that may directly or indirectly affect (or

otherwise jeopardise) the legal or physical integrity of any directors, shareholders,
representatives, or employees of Gerald or SL Mining”,?!? beyond the more specific

requests concerning specific SL Mining employees addressed above.?!*

The Tribunal considers that such requests are too broad to permit the Tribunal to assess the

tisk of serious harm that could materialize absent the Tribunal’s order or to establish

whether there is necessity and urgency for such an order in light of that risk.?'>

Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers it pertinent to remind the Parties of their continuing

obligation to act in good faith during these proceedings and to refrain from taking any

action that could affect the integrity of the arbitration or aggravate the dispute.?!®

H. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS
The Tribunal wishes to stress that its decision on Claimant’s requests is based on an
assessment of the facts at present. If circumstances arise which the Claimant considers

impede the arbitration in any way or prevent the Claimant from presenting its case, the

Claimant may submit a new application for provisional measures.7!”

At the same time, the Claimant is reminded of the Tribunal’s view that legal remedies in
regard to criminal investigations and bail conditions are primarily to be sought in the

domestic legal order.

This does, of course, not absolve the Parties from their duty to act in good faith and to
refrain from taking any measures that could affect the integrity of this arbitration or

aggravate the dispute.

Therefore, the Tribunal reaffirms its readiness to reassess the situation if warranted.

DECISION
Based on the above analysis, the Tribunal decides as follows:

1) The Claimant’s request to order “Sierra Leone to take all actions necessary to

immediately suspend the criminal investigations and/or proceedings” is rejected.

2) The Claimant’s request to order Sierra Leone “to take all actions necessary to
immediately [...] change the bail conditions for [its employees], so that they are

allowed to return to the Marampa mine site” is equally rejected.

3) However, given the legitimate concerns of the Claimant for the safety and security
of its employees and its investment, the Tribunal urges Sierra Leone to convey to

the authorities competent to decide on the bail conditions the Tribunal’s views in

order to consider adapting the current bail conditions so as to allow the Claimant’s

employees to return to the Marampa mine site.

The Claimant’s request to order “Sierra Leone to return to SL Mining all documents

seized on 13 May 2020” is rejected.

However, the Tribunal specifically notes the Respondent’s confirmation that the

seized documents will remain intact and available in the present proceedings.

Furthermore, the Tribunal requests the Respondent to detail the documents seized,
to make a full copy of them, to preserve the originals and to make the copies

available to the Claimant and the Tribunal by 15 August 2020.

The Claimant’s requests to order Respondent “to refrain from engaging in any
conduct that may directly or indirectly affect (or otherwise jeopardise) the legal or
physical integrity of any directors, shareholders, representatives, or employees of
Gerald or SL Mining” as well as “to refrain from taking any step, action (judicial
or otherwise) or other measures that would interfere with Gerald’s investments,
alter the status quo ante, aggravate the dispute or threaten the integrity of the
proceeding, or render ineffective any relief that this Tribunal ultimately may

award” are rejected.

The Parties are reminded of their continuing duty to act in good faith during these
proceedings and to refrain from taking any action that could affect the integrity of

the arbitration or aggravate the dispute.

The Tribunal reserves its decision on the costs of the procedure relating to the

Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures to a later stage of this arbitration.
