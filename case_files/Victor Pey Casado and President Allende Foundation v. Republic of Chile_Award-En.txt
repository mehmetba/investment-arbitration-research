I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

A. Historical Context and Relevant Facts

1.

The Tribunal finds it useful to begin this Award with a brief summary of the factual and
procedural background. In doing so, the Tribunal notes that the underlying dispute between
the Parties goes back four decades, and has been pending before ICSID since 1997. It is

therefore conscious of its duty to bring a final end to this long-running proceeding.

Mr Victor Pey Casado was born in Spain in 1915, moved to Chile at the age of 24 in 1939,
and lived there for 34 years until 1973. Though he has retained Spanish nationality, he
acquired Chilean nationality by naturalization in 1958. Ms Coral Pey Grebe, his daughter,
was born in Chile on 27 December 1953, and holds Spanish nationality.

Mr Salvador Allende, elected President of Chile on 4 September 1970, was a friend of
Mr Pey Casado.

During the early 1970s, Mr Pey Casado became associated with a Chilean newspaper,
El Clarin. The newspaper had been founded by Messrs Dario Sainte-Marie and Merino
Liana, and was under the control of the company, Consorcio Periodistico y Publicitario,
S.A. (“CPP”), through a wholly owned subsidiary, Empresa Periodistica Clarin, Ltda.
(“EPC”).

El Clarin had a left-leaning political orientation and lent strong media support to the broadly
socialist coalition led by President Allende. After Mr Sainte-Marie left Chile for Spain,
Mr Pey Casado acquired 40,000 shares in CPP? by purchase concluded on 2 October 1972.7

On 11 September 1973, President Allende was overthrown in a coup d’état led by General
Augusto Pinochet, and on the same day military troops occupied the premises of El Clarin,

seizing papers located in Mr Pey Casado’s office there.*

On 8 October 1973, Decree-Law No. 77 declared unlawful and dissolved all ‘Marxist
entities’ and their affiliates, with their property passing to the Respondent.> The property
thereafter remained under complete control by the military, and was subsequently

confiscated formally by means of Decree No. 165 in 1975.°

On 27 October 1973, Mr Pey Casado was granted permission to leave Chile for Venezuela
and went from there to Spain, where he remained until 1989, the year of the return of

democratic government to Chile.

On 16 January 1990, the Foundation Presidente Allende (“the Foundation”) was established
under Spanish law. Mr Pey Casado donated 90% of his stock holdings in CPP and EPC to

the Foundation later that same year.’

On 6 September 1995, Mr Pey Casado wrote to the President of Chile, asking for restitution
of the assets of El Clarin.® By letter dated 20 November 1995, the Chilean Minister of
National Assets replied that the Government of Chile was developing a reparations
programme that would compensate persons whose assets had been confiscated by the
military government.’ On 10 January 1996, Mr Pey Casado wrote again to the President of

Chile, asking for immediate restitution.!°

In October 1995, Mr Pey Casado filed in the First Civil Court in Santiago (“the Santiago
court”) a request for restitution for the confiscation of a Goss printing press that had been on
the premises of El Clarin when the property was seized during the coup d’état.'' This claim

is hereinafter referred to as “the Goss press case.”

On 23 July 1998, Chile duly initiated, under Law No. 19.568,!? a comprehensive reparations
programme which was designed to compensate, through an administrative process, those
persons who had suffered confiscations of property at the hands of the military government.
Mr Pey Casado was notified of this programme by the Respondent and invited to participate
in it.

In a letter dated 24 June 1999, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende
notified the Chilean Ministry of National Assets that they expressly waived the right to seek

compensation under Law 19.568 for the expropriation of CPP and EPC.'*

On 28 April 2000, the Chilean Ministry of National Assets issued Decision No. 43, by which
it authorized compensation to four individuals (or, as applicable, their heirs) for the
expropriation of CPP and EPC, on the basis that they had established, to the satisfaction of
the Ministry, that they had owned assets belonging to these companies, and were thus entitled
to reparations for the confiscation of E/ Clarin. The persons in question were Messrs Dario

Sainte-Marie, Ram6én Carrasco, Emilio Gonzalez and Jorge Venegas.!>

Previous Phases of the Dispute and Procedural History

Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende submitted a Request for Arbitration
to ICSID on 7 November 1997, in reliance on the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain
and the Republic of Chile on the Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments

(“BIT”) which had entered into force on 29 March 1994, Article 10 of which provides:

1. Any dispute concerning investments, as defined in this Agreement, which arises between a
Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, to the extent possible, be
settled by means of friendly consultations between the two parties to the dispute.

2. If the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the time it was initiated by one of the
Parties, it shall be submitted, at the discretion of the investor, to:

- The national jurisdiction of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute; or
- International arbitration in the conditions described in paragraph 3.

Once the investor has submitted the dispute to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party involved
or to international arbitration, the choice of one or the other procedure shall be final.

3. If the dispute is submitted to international arbitration, it may be brought before one of the
following arbitration bodies, at the discretion of the investor:

- The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established
by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States, which was opened for signature in Washington, D.C., on
18 March 1965, when each State Party to this Agreement has acceded to it. As long as
this condition remains unmet, each Contracting Party gives its consent to submit the
dispute to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Additional Facility of ICSID;

- An ad hoc court of arbitration established under the arbitration rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

4. The arbitration body shall take its decision on the basis of the provisions of this Agreement,
of the law of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, including the rules relative to
conflicts of laws, and of the terms of any specific agreements concluded in relation to
investment, as well as of the principles of international law on the subject.

5. The arbitral awards shall be final and binding for the parties to the dispute.

6. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from dealing, through diplomatic channels, with matters
concerning arbitration or judicial proceedings already under way until the relevant procedures
have been completed, unless the parties to the dispute have not complied with the award of the
court of arbitration or the decision of the ordinary court pursuant to the terms of compliance
established in the award or decision.'®

The Request was registered on 20 April 1998,'’ and a Tribunal was constituted on

14 September 1998, which will be referred to in this Award as “the First Tribunal”.

On | February 1999, the Respondent lodged an objection to the jurisdiction of the First

Tribunal.'® An oral hearing on the jurisdictional objection was held in May 2000,'° and in

due course, by a Decision of 8 May 2002, the First Tribunal joined the jurisdictional

objections to the merits.”°

On 6 May 2000, Dr Garcés wrote to the Minister of National Assets of Chile on behalf of
Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende asking the Ministry temporarily to
suspend the execution of Decision No. 43.7! This letter was forwarded to the Contraloria
General, which concluded on 22 November 2000 that the Ministry of National Assets had
followed proper procedure, and that there was no legal basis for suspending execution of the

Decision.”

On 23 April 2001, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende submitted to the
First Tribunal a request for the indication of provisional measures, seeking suspension of the
execution of Decision No. 43 because of its incompatibility with the claim pending before
ICSID.”? Ina decision of 25 September 2001, the First Tribunal rejected this request, finding

no incompatibility between Decision No. 43 and the expropriation-related claims at ICSID.”4

On 4 November 2002, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende submitted an
ancillary request to the Santiago court, seeking to suspend proceedings pending a decision
on their request to transfer to ICSID the claim asserted before the Santiago court in relation

to the Goss press.*> The Santiago court rejected this request on 14 November 2002.7°

A hearing on jurisdiction and merits in the original arbitral proceedings was held in
Washington in early May 2003. Following a number of changes to the composition of the
First Tribunal and the rejection of a request from the Respondent for new written

submissions,’ a further hearing was held on 15-16 January 2007 in Paris.

On 8 May 2008, the First Tribunal issued its Award (“the First Award’), in which it decided,
inter alia: 1) that the expropriation of El Clarin was not covered ratione temporis by the
substantive protections under the BIT;?* 2) that the Respondent had committed two BIT
violations distinct from the expropriation of El Clarin;?° 3) that the absence for seven years
of a decision on the merits in the Goss press case amounted to a denial of justice, in violation
of Article 4 of the BIT;*° and 4) the award of compensation under Decision No. 43 to other
persons but not to Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation constituted discrimination contrary to
the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4 of the BIT»! The Tribunal
ordered the Respondent to pay Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende
$10,132,690.18 (plus compound interest) in damages for the violations found, and in
addition $2,000,000 in legal fees and costs and $1,045,579.35 in procedural costs, but
rejected all other claims submitted by Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente

Allende.

On 2 June 2008, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende submitted a request
for revision of the First Award under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, contending that
certain new facts had emerged that would decisively affect the Tribunal’s ruling and justify
an increase in the amount of damages to $797,000,000. Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation
Presidente Allende also requested the provisional suspension of the execution of the First

Award.*?

On 24 July 2008, the Santiago court rendered its decision in relation to the Goss press case,
in which it concluded that Mr Pey Casado did not have standing to sue, and that in any event
his claim had become time barred.** On 16 June 2009, a motion ex parte was filed by the

Council for Defence of the State (“CDE”) for the abandonment of the case,** which was

rejected by the Santiago court on 6 August 2009.*° On 12 August 2009, the CDE appealed
against this decision,*’ and on 18 December 2009, the Court of Appeal of Santiago declared

the proceedings to have been abandoned.**

On 5 September 2008, while the request for revision was still pending, the Respondent filed
a request for annulment of the First Award, on the grounds that procedural irregularities had
tainted the arbitral proceeding, and that there were unexplained conclusions and
characterizations in the First Award.*? The Request was registered by the Secretary-General
on 6 July 2009. An ad hoc Committee was constituted on 22 December 2009. On 4 May
2010, the ad hoc Committee issued a Decision rejecting Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation
Presidente Allende’s request to declare inadmissible the application for annulment. On
15 October 2010, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende put forward a
request of their own for partial annulment, *° which the ad hoc Committee rejected as plainly

time-barred.

On 18 November 2009, the First Tribunal, ruling in the revision proceeding, denied the

request for revision.*!

Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende contend that they first became aware
of the decision of the Santiago court in relation to the Goss press case on 27 January 2011.77
Three days later Mr Pey Casado requested the Santiago court to annul the decision to declare

the proceedings before that court abandoned,** which was rejected on 28 April 2011,*4 a

decision that was upheld by the Court of Appeal of Santiago on 31 January 2012;*° leave to
appeal to the Supreme Court of Chile was denied on 11 July 2012.46

On 18 December 2012, the ad hoc Committee rendered its Decision on Annulment, the

dispositive part of which reads, in translation, as follows:

For the reasons set forth above, the Committee renders the following decisions:
1. Pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) and (e), decides to annul paragraph 4 of the dispositif of the
Award of 8 May 2008 and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to
damages (Section VIII);
2. Rejects the other grounds of the Republic’s Application for annulment;
3. Rejects the Claimants’ request for the partial annulment of paragraph 8 of the dispositif of
the Award;
4. Finds that paragraphs | to 3 and 5 to 8 of the dispositif as well as the body of the Award but
for Section VIII are res judicata;
5. Decides that there is no need to order the temporary stay of enforcement of the un-annulled
portion of the Award.
6. Decides that each party shall bear one half of the ICSID costs incurred in connection with
this annulment proceeding; and
7. Decides that each party shall bear its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect

to this annulment proceeding.

Claimants”) lodged on 18 June 2013, pursuant to Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention, a
new Request for Arbitration (“the New Request’). The New Request was registered by the
Centre on 8 July 2013. In accordance with the terms of Article 52(6), a new Tribunal was
constituted on 24 December 2013 (“the Tribunal”) composed of Sir Franklin Berman
(President), appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID in
accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, Mr Philippe Sands, appointed by the

Claimants, and Mr Alexis Mourre, appointed by the Respondent. Following a challenge by

the Respondent, Professor Sands informed the Centre by letter of 10 January 2014 that, while
rejecting the grounds for the challenge, he took the view that the proper course was to allow
the proceedings to continue without distraction, and accordingly relinquished his
appointment as_ arbitrator. On 13 January 2014, following the resignation of
Professor Sands, the ICSID Secretary-General notified the vacancy to the Parties and the
proceeding was suspended pursuant to Arbitration Rule 10(2). On the same date, the
Tribunal consented to the resignation of Professor Sands pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule
8(2), and on 31 January 2014 Mr V V Veeder was appointed to fill the vacant place on the
Tribunal in accordance with Arbitration Rule 11(1) and the Tribunal was reconstituted on
that date. Mr Paul-Jean Le Cannu was appointed Secretary of the Tribunal on the same
date, and was later replaced in that office on 13 May 2014 by Mr Benjamin Garel. Following
a proposal by the President, and with the agreement of the Parties, Dr Gleider Hernandez

was appointed as Assistant to the President on 12 December 2014.

On 11 March 2014, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties by telephone. In

addition to the Tribunal and its Secretary, the following participated:

Counter-Memorial on 27 October 2014, the Claimants’ Reply on 9 January 2015, and the
Respondent’s Rejoinder on 9 March 2015.

On 10 November 2014, the Claimants submitted to the Tribunal a request for the production
of documents under Procedural Order No. 1, to which the Respondent replied on 1 December
2014. A further response by the Claimants was received on 3 December 2014, to which the
Respondent responded (with the leave of the Tribunal) on 8 December 2014. On
16 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, containing its reasoned

decision on the document production requests.

On 9 February 2015, the Claimants sought the Tribunal’s authorization to produce (a) two
decisions rendered on 10 January and 3 February 2015 by the Santiago court, (b) the
documents obtained through the search ordered by the Santiago court in these decisions, and
(c) comments on such documents. On 13 February 2015 the Respondent expressed its
consent to the Claimants’ requests, and indicated that it would respond to the Claimants’
comments in its Rejoinder. On 16 February 2015, the Tribunal granted leave to the
Claimants to produce the documents in question, together with comments upon them, by
20 February 2015. On 20 February 2015, the Claimants submitted the documents in

question and comments upon them.

On 2 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 laying down the arrangements

for the oral hearing and communicating the hearing schedule.

From 13 to 16 April 2015, the Tribunal held an oral hearing in London. In addition to the

At the conclusion of the hearing, the President laid down the procedure to be followed by
the Parties for the submission of statements of costs for the purposes of Arbitration
Rule 28(2). On 18 and 29 May 2015 respectively, the Claimants and the Respondent filed

statements of costs and the Claimants a supplemental statement of costs.

On 9 June 2015, the Tribunal took note of certain agreed corrections to the hearing

transcripts, and decided on the remaining corrections on which the Parties could not agree.

On 18 September 2015, the Claimants sought the Tribunal’s authorization to introduce into
the record a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Chile on 14 September 2015, and
on 28 September 2015 the Respondent submitted its comments on this request. On

9 October 2015, the Tribunal authorized the introduction of the judgment into the record.

On 17 March 2016, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed under Arbitration
Rule 38(1).

Arbitration Rule 46, it had extended for a further 60 days the period to draw up and sign the
Award.

II, SUMMARY OF PARTIES’ POSITIONS

A. Approach of the Tribunal

41.

The account that follows of the Parties’ arguments provides the essential background for the
Tribunal’s findings in the subsequent Sections of this Award. It is intended however as a
summary only of the arguments both of fact and of law that the Tribunal has found to be of
greatest relevance to the issues before it. At various times, accusations were put forward
from both sides of bad faith or improper conduct on the other side. The Tribunal has not
found these relevant to the issues before it and does not propose to consider them further.
The Tribunal wishes to emphasize however that it has given full attention to all of the

submissions put to it by the Parties both orally and in writing.

B. Overview of the Claimants’ Submissions

42.

The Claimants’ submissions can be divided into two broad categories. The first represents
their opposition to the Respondent’s jurisdictional arguments in respect of Ms Pey Grebe.
The second category goes to determining the nature and quantum of the compensation due
for the denial of justice and for the failure to accord fair and equitable treatment. The
Claimants expressly disclaim any request for compensation under Article 5 of the Chile-
Spain BIT (expropriation), as foreclosed by the res judicata nature of the First Award in the

light of the Decision on Annulment.**

46.

(1) — Jurisdiction and Admissibility

a. Ms Pey Grebe is the assignee of all the rights of Mr Pey Casado in the present
resubmission proceeding

The Claimants submit that the First Tribunal recognized Mr Pey Casado in his quality of

‘investor’ under the Chile-Spain BIT.*? They further submit that the First Tribunal

recognized the nature of the ‘investment’ as broad, encompassing the shares in CPP and EPC

held by Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation.*”

The Claimants argue that the jurisdictional conclusions in the First Award should apply to
Ms Pey Grebe in her capacity as assignee of Mr Pey Casado’s shares in El Clarin and all

rights in this arbitration.>!

They point to the assignment of rights effected on 15 March 2013
between Mr Pey Casado and Ms Pey Grebe for the totality of his rights relating to his holding
of the shares (10%) in CPP, as well as his position and his rights in the pursuance of the
present arbitration, as well as any claims that flow from his ownership of shares in CPP and
EPC.*? This assignment accordingly includes the right to reparation arising from the First

Award.*?

The Claimants contend that the Respondent never objected to the assignment in 2013 and
2014, despite having been notified of it on 13 June 2013 and having since had several
opportunities to do so.* They also contend that, because her situation is governed by the
Chile-Spain Convention on dual nationality and the Chile-Spain BIT does not explicitly
exclude dual nationals from the scope of its protection, the conditions in the First Award

concerning application of the BIT are not opposable to Ms Pey Grebe.>°

The Claimants contend that, because the assignment of rights was effected after the date on

which the First Tribunal established its jurisdiction over the dispute, the Tribunal need not

re-examine its jurisdiction simply because rights have been assigned from one person to
another.*° According to Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, jurisdiction is
established at the moment that the parties have consented to submit the application to
arbitration, by reference to the date on which proceedings are instituted;>’ because Ms Pey
Grebe is only acting as an assignee of assets, and did not put in a claim of her own, no legal
question exists.** The Claimants contend that, where an assignee becomes a claimant during
the course of arbitral proceedings, it is an established principle of international law that the
assignee can be considered as the successor to a party to a dispute,’ and that the same

principle would apply in a resubmission proceeding following an annulment.”

The Claimants further submit that the assignment of rights from Mr Pey Casado to Ms Pey
Grebe is a juridically valid act opposable to the Respondent which should be upheld by the
Tribunal. They recall that the earlier assignment of rights from Mr Pey Casado to the
Foundation Presidente Allende was confirmed by the ad hoc Committee, and should thus be
considered res judicata.°! They contend that the Respondent’s objections to Ms Pey

Grebe’s standing would deprive Mr Pey Casado of his rights under the First Award.°*

The Claimants maintain that the assignment of rights was valid under Spanish law and does
not require authorization under Chilean law to be opposable to the Respondent,® and that
Chilean domestic law allows the assignment of rights relating to moral damages. The
Respondent’s objection to Ms Pey Grebe’s standing is a repetition of an unsuccessful
objection to the First Tribunal’s jurisdiction, in respect of an assignment which used similar

wording and was upheld in the First Award.

b. The Claimants’ requests do not impinge on the unannulled portions of the First Award
and are admissible

The Claimants maintain that their requests do not require the Tribunal to pronounce on points
unaffected by the partial annulment of the First Award, and in particular on the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal. The sole purpose of the resubmission proceeding is to establish the
damages due as a result of the denial of justice and the discrimination suffered by the
Claimants.*’ The Claimants equate the harm suffered as a result of these two BIT violations
with the harm suffered for the expropriation of El Clarin.©* The appropriate remedy would
be for the Tribunal to restore the situation the Claimants would have been in, had they been
in a position to avail themselves of the judgment of the Santiago court in the Goss press case

prior to the publication of the First Award, or in a situation where they would not have

  

suffered from discriminatory treatment vis-a-vis other Chilean investors.

The Claimants submit that the behaviour of representatives of the Respondent during earlier
phases of the case, and in particular during the post-First Award phase and relating to the
Goss press, constitute a new violation of Article 4, and possibly Article 5, of the BIT.”
Because the owners of other media companies were compensated for the expropriation of
their assets, the fact that the Claimants were not compensated for the expropriation of E/

Clarin constitutes a violation of the obligation to guarantee ‘national treatment’.”!

c. In the alternative, the Claimants submit that they are entitled to compensation for the
unjust enrichment that has benefited the Respondent

The Claimants submit that res judicata does not apply in this proceeding to their claim for

unjust enrichment, because that was not the subject matter of a finding by the First

Tribunal.”” They recall that they had already made submissions on unjust enrichment in

their first memorial before the First Tribunal in March 1999.73

The Claimants base their claim of unjust enrichment on the 1970s dissolution of El Clarin
and the Respondent’s forcible seizure of the assets of CPP and EPC.” Unjust enrichment
is prohibited both under Chilean domestic law” and under customary international law.”°
They maintain that, though unjust enrichment can also constitute a violation of the obligation
to provide fair and equitable treatment, unjust enrichment is routinely awarded by

international tribunals when the conditions for its existence are met.””

Since in the present
case the Respondent illicitly appropriated for itself the investment of a Spanish national and
the benefits of that investment, without compensation, the unjust enrichment created by that

seizure opens a right to reparation.”®

 

(2) The Clai issions on the cal ion of d for the denial of
justice

a. Compelling reasons exist for revisiting and overturning certain unannulled portions of
the First Award

The Claimants recall that the denial of justice found in the First Award concerned the absence

for seven years of a decision on the merits on the Goss press case, which was confirmed by

the First Tribunal and the ad hoc Committee, and is res judicata.” The Claimants contend

that the failure to decide deprived the Claimants, and also the First Tribunal, of a judgment

on the merits that would have established both the nullity ex tunc under public law of Decree

No. 165; and that Respondent committed this violation in full knowledge of its

consequences.*® The Claimants argue that the Santiago court had its judgment on the merits
ready as early as the start of 2001, but that its paralysis for several years deprived the
Claimants of a crucial fact,®! and that the Respondent’s recollection of events had struck out

or omitted key facts in order to expunge this fact.®?

During the oral proceedings, the Claimants further submitted that the fact that constitutes the
denial of justice, that is, depriving the First Tribunal and the Claimants of the evidence that
the Santiago court had avoided applying Decree No. 165, can be distinguished from the
consequences of that denial of justice, which was that the First Tribunal could not take into

account the nullity of the Decree.**

The Claimants acknowledge that unannulled parts of the First Award are res judicata and
cannot be revisited, in particular those on the competence of the Tribunal to be seized of the
dispute between the parties, and on the violations of the Respondent of its obligations under
the BIT.* The Claimants maintain, however, that so long as there are no new requests, the
introduction of new information or facts arising after publication of the First Award

(‘intervening effects’) would be permissible.*°

b. The Claimants’ submissions as to the validity of Decree No. 165
(i) Decree No. 165 is null under Chilean public law

The Claimants submit that the decision of the Santiago court took note of the reality of the
nullity ex tunc under public law of Decree No. 165, and that this finding constitutes sufficient
evidence of the fact that the decree is null and void.*° The Claimants rely on Chilean
domestic case law to establish that under Chilean law, nullity operates ipso jure and no

judicial recognition is needed to constitute it.*7 The Claimants further submit that the nullity

of Decree No. 165 operates ex tunc as a matter of Chilean public law, citing Chilean court
judgments that have repeatedly taken note of the nullity of decree-laws issued pursuant to
Decree No. 77.** According to the Claimants, Mr Pey Casado had already raised in 1995
the question of the nullity of Decree No. 165 before the Santiago court, which took note of

the reality of the nullity of the decree under public law.*?

The Claimants contend that the Santiago court was duty bound to pronounce on the reality
of the nullity of Decree No. 165, because of the judicial obligation to respond to extensive
submissions by the Claimants and organs of the Respondent (the ‘Fisc’) before it.” Reacting
to the Respondent’s expert report by Dr. Libedinsky, the Claimants deny that the matter was
raised only as a subject to be resolved with respect to the debate over the prescriptibility

period (‘statute of limitations’) of the nullity under public law action.?!

The Claimants contend that, when the Santiago court decided explicitly that only CPP and
EPC had the requisite standing in that case,” it necessarily must have concluded that Decree
No. 165 was null under public law, as there could be no other reason for the Santiago court
to conclude that EPC remained in existence;”* for them, such a finding entailed the continuity

of the legal personality of CPP and EPC.**

(ii) The Claimants’ submissions as to the effects on the First Award of the
taking note of the nullity under public law of Decree No. 165

The Claimants contend that both the absence of a decision for seven years by the Chilean
courts with respect to the Goss press case, and the absence of a decision with respect to the
validity of Decree No. 165, constitute the denial of justice found by the First Tribunal in the

First Award.”

The Claimants maintain that, but for the denial of justice they have suffered, the nullity of
Decree No. 165 would have been established before the First Tribunal, which would not
have been able to conclude, as it did in the First Award, that the expropriation of CPP and
EPC had been consummated with the entry into force of Decree No. 165, and that the said
Decree was still in force.*° The Claimants submit that, owing to the denial of justice, they
were precluded from fully substantiating their claims for the injuries that continued to subsist
for the de facto withholding of their investment after the entry into force of the BIT.” They
take the view that the First Tribunal would not have dealt with compensation as it had done,
as it would have regarded the expropriation claim as falling within the ‘continuing act’

exception at the time of the entry into force of the BIT.”

The Claimants dispute the Respondent’s argument that paragraph 608 of the First Award
extends also to the validity of Decree No. 165.°? The Claimants submit that the validity of
Decree No. 165 is to be distinguished from its legality, which concerns the respect of
considerations such as public utility, due process, the absence of discrimination and the
existence of compensation. The Claimants instead submit that paragraph 78 of the First
Award demonstrates merely the awareness of the First Tribunal that to its knowledge, the

validity of Decree No. 165 had never been put into question before the Chilean courts.!°°

Finally, because the nullity of Decree No. 165 would have entailed its inexistence ex tunc
and the invalidity also of the expropriation de jure, the Claimants argue that the expropriation
de facto that had existed from 1973 would have continued until after the entry into force of
the Chile-Spain BIT, and that the appropriate remedy to erase the effects of the denial of
justice would not be to speculate as to what the First Tribunal would have concluded, but for

1.!°! The Claimants further maintain

the Tribunal to decide in the place of the First Tribunal
that in the absence of the denial of justice, the First Tribunal would have made

determinations with respect to the expropriation de facto of CPP and EPC; the Claimants

maintain that this approach would not call into question the principle of res judicata, as it
would serve to acknowledge the consequences of the withholding of evidence with respect
to the denial of justice.'°? The Claimants suggest that case law from the European Court of
Human Rights supports the idea that a denial of justice can be constituted through the

operation of a continuously unlawful act.!%

(iii) The Claimants’ objections with respect to the reliability of the testimony
of the expert for the Respondent in relation to Decree No. 165

The Claimants submit that expert for the Respondent, Dr Marcos Libedinsky, has already
participated in two judicial pronouncements in the Pey Casado v. El Fisc case, even
participating in the denial of justice against the Claimants, and thus demonstrating a lack of
independence. The Claimants further submit that Dr Libedinsky, by applying the 1977 auto-
amnesty Decree so as to protect Chilean civil servants who had perpetrated international
crimes, demonstrated the intention to uphold the impunity of the Respondent for its seizure

of the Claimants’ investment.!°

The Claimants suggest that Dr Libedinsky’s expert report does not take into account the
specificities of Decree-Laws No. 77 and 1726, the latter of which was confirmed as null by
the Chilean Supreme Court. According to the Claimants, the nullity attaching to these two
decrees, and any decrees made pursuant to them, differs from the administrative acts cited
within his expert report as these are tainted with nullity ipso jure, the effects of which operate
ex tunc and require no judicial intervention in order for the nullity to operate with full effect.
The Claimants note that on 20 October 1999, Dr Libedinsky, then a judge on the Supreme
Court, participated in a decision that made a general statement to the effect that if nullity
operates ipso jure, it may be ‘observed and declared indistinctly by a tribunal or
administrative authority’ .'°°

The Claimants observe that Dr Libedinsky’s expert report cited three cases from appellate

tribunals in Chile that did not concern the nullity of confiscatory decrees taken in pursuance

of Government Decree No. 77 and Supreme Decree No. 1726; according to the Claimants,
abundant case law exists that takes note of the nullity ex tunc of these decrees, and which
also notes the imprescriptibility of actions in nullity under public law. The Claimants
highlight a distinction between, on the one hand, the nullity of administrative or legislative
acts, and on the other hand, civil or patrimonial actions which flow from the taking note of
the nullity. They contend that, with respect to the former category, the passage of time can

never cure nullity under public law.!°°

c. The discontinuance proceedings are immaterial as regards the denial of justice

The Claimants contend that the claimed discontinuance by Mr Pey Casado, or the purported
eradication of the judgment of 24 July 2008 and of its case file from the records of the
Santiago court by the Respondent, do not affect the denial of justice resulting from the
absence of decision in the Goss press case, as consummated by the First Award of 8 May
2008.!°7 Though the Respondent has maintained that such discontinuance was purely for
administrative ends, the Respondent in fact sought to paralyse the execution of the Santiago

court’s judgment.!%

The Claimants submit that the conditions for discontinuance prescribed under Article 152 of
the Chilean Code of Civil Procedure, namely, that all parties must have ceased to participate
for at least six months in a proceeding, and where the tribunal must also notify all concerned
parties personally or by official act, have not been met in the present case.'°? The
abandonment of proceedings, in such cases, is a sanction that arises from the passivity, lack
of interest or inactivity of a party, and does not arise in cases where it falls to a tribunal to
take the next steps towards resolving the dispute. The Claimants accordingly submit that
no abandonment could arise before the Santiago court, as the case before it was ready for

decision, and Mr Pey Casado was merely awaiting notification.!!°

d. The Respondent’s acts subsequent to the First Award constitute a new denial of justice
under the BIT

The Claimants contend that, in breach of the principles of a fair hearing and due process, the
Respondent sought to erase from the record the judgment of 24 July 2008 so preventing the
First Tribunal and the Claimants from being informed of the existence of that judgment, thus
committing a new violation of Article 4 of the Chile-Spain BIT.''' Specifically, the
Claimants point to a motion submitted by the Council for the Defence of the State to the
Santiago court on 16 June 2009, which called for the proceeding to be declared abandoned
so as to invalidate the judgment rendered.!!? The motion was denied on 6 August 2009, on
the grounds that Mr Pey Casado had not been notified of the judgment, at which point the
CDE appealed ex parte to the Court of Appeal of Santiago, which on 18 December 2009
acceded to the CDE’s request, again ex parte.''> The Claimants contend that, despite the
annulment proceedings having been in train since 5 September 2008, at no point did the
Respondent notify the Claimants that the Santiago court had given judgment on the merits
in the Goss press case.''* The Claimants were only notified of the existence of the judgment

on 31 January 2011.!!°

These acts, taken together, constituted a further denial of justice and a new breach of

Article 4(1) of the BIT, as they demonstrate a lack of good faith, and a breach of the

obligation to maintain the existing position as far as possible for the duration of a dispute.!!°

The Claimants further contend that the decisions of the Chilean domestic courts, which have
attempted to eradicate the Santiago court ruling, cannot produce legal effects on the

international plane; and if they constitute a breach of international law, the principle of

restitutio in integrum would apply to nullify their effects.!'7

e. Reparation for the damage resulting from the denial of justice

The Claimants submit that, though Article 4 of the BIT does not specify that reparation
becomes due in case of breach, they may rely on the ‘most-favoured-nation’ (MEN) clause
embodied in Article 7, and give as an example the Chile-Australia BIT (Articles 6-7) to

justify a claim for reparation.''*

The Claimants, recalling their argument that the consequence of concealing the ruling of the
Santiago court was that the First Tribunal could not take note of the reality of the nullity of
Decree No. 165, point to the fact that the objection based on extinctive prescription raised
on 17 April 1996 by the CDE was not mentioned in paragraph 78 of the First Award.!!° For
the Claimants, this objection, upheld by the Santiago court, was only valid in relation to

actions under the Chilean civil code, but was inapplicable before the First Tribunal.!7°

Under international law, the dies a quo for the prescription of a claim may be extended in
cases where the claimant has sound reasons for failing to raise such claims, and has not been
negligent.'?!_ The Claimants recall that Mr Pey Casado fled Chile to seek asylum in
‘Venezuela, was banned from Chile between 1973 and 1989, and was only able to recover
the share certificates proving his ownership of CPP and EPC through a judicial decision of

29 May 1995, which was the dies a quo.'”

The Claimants maintain that, because Mr Pey Casado filed an action for restitution of the
Goss press on 4 October 1995, some four months after the dies a quo, the decision of the
Santiago court—which concluded that extinctive prescription had run pursuant to Articles
2226, 2227 and 2236 of the Chilean Civil Code—is not opposable before the present

Tribunal.!?> The Claimants contend that reparation for the denial of justice which prevented

them from putting forward claims after the entry into force of the BIT, should be calculated

on the basis of the fair market value of CPP and EPC prior to their de facto confiscation.'?*

With respect to the moral injury suffered, the Claimants contend that during the seizure of
CPP and EPC’s assets in 1973, Mr Pey Casado’s inclusion on a list of persons who needed
to surrender immediately to the Ministry of National Defence, put him at serious risk of
internment, torture, assassination or disappearance, which led him to seek asylum in
Venezuela.'2> The Claimants further contend that since 1973, Mr Pey Casado has been
subjected to continuous humiliation, injustice and uncertainty owing to the Respondent’s

refusal to provide reparation.!”°

f The Respondent attempted to subvert the arbitral proceedings through fraud

The Claimants assert that the Respondent’s representatives have sought to frustrate the First
Award in bad faith and to cause injury to the Claimants’ investment, in further violation of
Article 4 of the Chile-Spain BIT.'?? The annulment of Section VIII and clause 4 of the
dispositif of the First Award opens the possibility for the Tribunal to take full cognizance of

the Respondent’s conduct, both prior and subsequent to the First Award.'*

The Claimants contend that, beyond the moral injury caused at the moment of the seizure of
CPP and EPC in 1973 and thereafter, Mr Pey Casado has been subject to defamation through
measures taken by Chilean authorities;!?? the reference to the Claimants as ‘liars and

3;1°° insults to the

impostors’ in El Pats on 23 June 1999, upon publication of Decision No. 4:

Spanish national, thus imposing on him Chilean nationality de facto.'*? The Claimants
submit that because of the element of intentional misconduct that is inherent in fraud, arbitral

tribunals may find indirect or circumstantial evidence of fraud to be sufficient.'**

The Claimants submit that the Respondent introduced into the case file of the First Tribunal
a gravely misleading translation of Mr Pey Casado’s Demande of 1995 which would have
altered the causa petendi by omitting the claim that Decree No. 165 was null ex func, and by
mistranslating a term in such a way that it was read to refer to the building where the Goss
press was located, rather than to the press itself.'** The Claimants maintain that these
mistranslations were repeated exactly in the judgment of the Santiago court of 24 July
2008,'*5 and that, in relation to Decision No. 43 of 28 April 2000, the Respondent falsely

argued that ownership of the Goss press was attributed to EPC, rather than to CPP.'*°

The Claimants further contend that the submissions of the Respondent before the First
Tribunal were fraudulent in relation to the nullity ex tunc of Decree No. 165, as the
Respondent was aware of Mr Pey Casado’s request for restitution of the Goss press, and yet
paralysed the progress of the proceeding before the Santiago court until the First Award had
been rendered and attributed the ownership of CPP and EPC to third parties through Decision
No. 43. This paralysis was particularly evident given the Respondent’s argument that the
First Tribunal lacked jurisdiction ratione temporis after Decree No. 165 was issued in 1975,
and amounted to a wilful misconstrual of the framework in which the First Tribunal was to

consider the Claimants’ claims.'*7

g. The Respondent’s deceptive conduct persisted throughout the Revision Proceeding, the
Annulment Proceeding and the present Resubmission Proceeding

The Claimants contend that the Respondent and its representatives deliberately withheld

knowledge of the Santiago court judgment throughout the Revision Proceeding in which the

continued absence of decision from the Santiago court figured prominently. The Claimants
point to the Respondent’s Response of 1 October 2008,'** in which the Respondent rejected
submissions as to the effects of the nullity under public law of Decree No. 165. The
Claimants maintain that the fraudulent concealment of the domestic court judgment by the
Respondent constituted a denial of justice, as it prevented them from submitting a request

for annulment under Article 52, paragraph 2, of the ICSID Convention.'*?

The Claimants maintain that the Respondent continues to act fraudulently in the present
Resubmission Proceeding. The Claimants submit that from 22 May 2014, representatives of
the Respondent successfully managed to unarchive the original case file in the Santiago
court, and resorted to measures to conceal the file from the Claimants throughout 2014
through false pretences.'? The Claimants allege that the Santiago court repeatedly ignored
or refused Mr Pey Casado’s requests for access in order to prevent the Claimants from
demonstrating coordination between the Santiago court and agents for the Respondent in the
present Resubmission Proceeding.'4! The Claimants further complain that the Respondent

has actively denied them access to the Goss file at the Santiago court.'”

The Claimants contend that, taken as a whole, the Respondent’s fraudulent conduct and bad
faith amounts to a further violation of Article 4 of the Chile-Spain BIT, as, for this reason,

the First Tribunal could not properly establish the quantum of damages because of the

presumption that the Respondent still had title over the investment.'**

(3) The Claimants’ submissions on the injury resulting from the violation of the
obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment resulting from Decision
No. 43

a. The Claimants have suffered from discrimination arising from the breach of the
obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment

(i) The finding by the First Tribunal of the discrimination violation by the
Respondent is res judicata

The Claimants contend that the First Tribunal’s finding, that Decision No. 43 constituted a

violation by the Respondent of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment under

Article 4 of the BIT,'** is res judicata, and constitutes recognition by the First Tribunal of

both the existence of an investment by them which is protected under the fair and equitable

treatment rule, and the breach of that rule.'*>

The Claimants recall that the ad hoc Committee has already rejected the Respondent’s
request for annulment of that finding, concluding that i) it did not constitute a manifest excess
of powers by the First Tribunal;!*° ii) that the First Tribunal had found that the violation of
fair and equitable treatment consisted not only in the payment of compensation to third
parties, but in the paralysis of the Claimants’ requests for reparation;'*’ and iii) that although
the First Tribunal declined to order provisional measures with respect to the execution of

Decision No. 43, that decision nevertheless represented a violation of Article 4 of the BIT. 148

(ii) The Respondent cannot deny the obligation to pay compensation

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that it is under no obligation to pay
compensation to them because the Claimants voluntarily waived their rights under Law No.
19.568 through the exercise of the ‘fork-in-the-road’ clause in the BIT. The Claimants
contend that the Respondent’s paralysis of their claims in domestic proceedings was such

that they had no choice but to turn to international arbitration, and that Law No. 19.568 was

not the exclusive source of their right to compensation.'*? They point to the optional
character of Law No. 19.568, which provides in its Article 1, paragraph 6, for alternative
proceedings, for example for restitution or compensation under Article 7 of the Chilean
Constitution.'*° The Claimants also contend that, through Decision No. 43, the Respondent
exhausted its obligation under Law No. 19.568, thus precluding the Claimants from being
able to seek compensation, as the Respondent could not be forced to compensate twice for

an asset.!>!

The Claimants invoke various provisions of Chilean domestic law, including Articles 10 and
18 of the Constitution which entrench the right to property and the obligation to pay
compensation for the deprivation of property;'°? Articles 2314 and 2329 of the Civil Code
likewise provide for an obligation to pay reparation for injury caused by administrative
acts;'*? and Article 1556 of the Civil Code, stipulates that compensation for injuries
comprises both /ucrum cessans and damnum emergens.'** The Claimants assert that these

provisions of domestic law also grant them a right to restitutio in integrum, irrespective of

any specific protections in place at the time of the seizure.!°°

(4) The quantum of damages
a. Compensation due for the breaches of Article 4 of the BIT

(i) | Fair market value is the appropriate standard of compensation for the injury
inflicted upon the Claimants by the Respondent

The Claimants submit that the aim of compensation is to undo material harm inflicted by a
breach of an international obligation, and that in the present case, damages and interests

should be calculated on the fair market value of the investment, taking into account damnum

emergens, lucrum cessans and moral damages.'*°

The Claimants submit accordingly that
as the injury to them consisted in their loss of the right to compensation for the seizure of
CPP and EPC, compensation should be equivalent to the fair market value of these two
companies just prior to their seizure, and that the resulting sum must be adjusted up to the

date of the present Award.!°7

The Claimants argue that the reference in the dispositif to their entitlement to ‘compensation’
is a general reference to a right of reparation, and precludes neither reparation for moral

injury nor a claim of unjust enrichment.!**

The Claimants point to domestic Chilean case law where compensation has been paid in
situations where the relevant expropriatory decrees have been declared to be null under

° The Claimants

public law, and submit that similar treatment ought to apply to them.'>
submit that the consequence of the seven-year delay in the Goss press case and resulting
denial of justice was to deprive them of their ability to assert their rights against Chile.!°°
They argue that, but for the concealment of the Santiago court judgment of 2008, the First
Tribunal could not have concluded as it did in the First Award that Article 5 of the BIT was
inapplicable ratione temporis to the expropriation,'®! but would have accepted their

‘continuing act’ theory.'®

The Claimants contend that, in cases of expropriation, the critical date from which damages
are calculated is the date of deprivation of the rights of ownership, in this case 11 September
1973.'? Where successive violations of a BIT have occurred, the Claimants contend that
the Tribunal may choose to fix a date other than the starting date of the expropriation in order

to make fully operative the right to restitutio in integrum.'*+ They submit that, in the present

case, the multiple violations committed by the Respondent favour the selection of the date
of the First Award, 8 May 2008, as the critical date for establishing the fair market value of

the companies.'®

The principal injury suffered by the Claimants remains, according to them, the value of the
expropriated assets of CPP and EPC, both of which were ‘going concerns’ which were in

full development, and thus more valuable than the value of their discrete tangible assets.!°°

The Claimants contend that the appropriate standard to be used in calculating damages in
the present proceedings is one based in international law, and not the law of the host State;
therefore Law No. 19.568 and the value paid to investors under it would not be relevant for
the calculation of damages here.'®” They reject the Respondent’s contentions on the burden
of proof for establishing damages, pointing out that paragraph 689 of the First Award, which
deals with the burden of proof in establishing damages, was annulled by the ad hoc

Committee.

They further contend that under ICSID case law, compensation can also be calculated on fair

market value for BIT violations not constituting expropriation.!

Finally, they reject the
Respondent’s contention that no harm resulted from the discrimination, on the ground that

to do so questions the very existence of the violation, which is res judicata.!

The Claimants contend that Decision No. 43 was in fact adopted as a deliberate manoeuvre
by the Respondent during proceedings before the First Tribunal, with the sole purpose of
constructing evidence that the Claimants were not the legitimate owners of CPP and EPC.!7>
Recalling that Chilean domestic law recognizes that legal persons can also seek moral
damages for injuries caused by administrative acts, the Claimants submit that the correct
calculation of compensation for the violation of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment
is the payment of the compensation that would be due to investors for the seizure of CPP

and EPC, as well as the moral damages resulting to Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation.!”°

The Claimants maintain that they are not bound by the calculation of the quantum of damages

under domestic law, which under Decision No. 43 only awarded damnum emergens and

omitted Jucrum cessans entirely.'"7. They contend that Law No. 19.568 was in any event

only one particular means to implement the obligation to respect property, or to receive
restitution and reparation for the deprivation of property, as embodied in the Chilean
Constitution.'* The Claimants further contend that they cannot be bound by the
calculations issued pursuant to Decision No. 43, as they had no opportunity to make

observations during the proceedings leading to that decision.'””

(iii) In the alternative, damages should be calculated on the basis of the
Respondent’s unjust enrichment

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s unjust enrichment should be used as the basis

to calculate the compensation due to them, on the general principle in international law that

no State has the right to enrich itself to the detriment of another State or legal person.!*?

Accordingly, the Claimants’ alternative contention is that they should be awarded the value

of the unjust enrichment enjoyed by the Respondent through 40 years’ use of the seized

assets. !*!

The Claimants rebut the Respondent’s argument that a claim for unjust enrichment
represents a new claim, as it represents only a basis for the calculation of damages once
liability has been established;!** moreover, new evidence may be introduced if it is for the

sole purpose of calculating damages to be awarded.'**

According to the Claimants, the mention of compensation in the un-annulled portions of the
First Award need not exclude other such forms of reparation, as the term refers to harm that
is financially quantifiable.'** They point out that the only passages in the First Award that
excluded certain types of reparation are those passages where moral damages were excluded,
which were however in the annulled sections of the First Award and cannot be considered
before the present Tribunal.!* The Claimants moreover contend that the term
‘compensation’ refers to all forms of financial reparation for the injury suffered, be it moral

or material, and that the International Law Commission reached the same conclusion.'®°

The Claimants also contend that, even if the Respondent’s conduct was not fraudulent, and

even if Decree No. 165 is not null under public law ex tunc, the Respondent must still

disgorge all the fruits of the confiscation of assets held in bad faith, on the basis that there
exists a delictual act to the detriment of the Claimants and benefiting the Respondent.!*”
The Claimants submit that aggravated damages arising out of the bad faith of the Respondent

are also permitted under Chilean civil law.!**

b. The Accuracy expert report

The Claimants contend that the figures presented by Accuracy are pertinent and accurate,
and take into account the differences between E/ Clarin and the chosen comparators, in
particular through the use of the 20% discount.'*? The Claimants further contend that the
facts subsequent to the critical date of 10 September 1973 are not relevant in the present
case, as the objective of a comparative approach is to determine what the reasonable and
well-informed businessman would have been prepared to pay on the critical date, using

knowledge available at the time.!°°

The Claimants recall that Accuracy considered that the analogical method was the most
reliable method to establish the fair market value of CPP and EPC, and accordingly to
substantiate an expropriation-based calculation of damages. They submit that the
‘Discounted Cash Flow method’ (‘DCF’) cannot be used in cases where there was
insufficient financial information, and that, owing to the Respondent’s systematic refusal to
produce the financial documents sought by the Claimants, it would not have been possible
to use this method.'?! Accuracy states that the method of assessment using fair market value
is not expropriation-based, but applicable to a wider range of assessments.'°? The Claimants
further contend that in any event, the ad hoc Committee annulled Section VIII of the First

Award, in which the First Tribunal rejected the use of expropriation-based damages, and

103.

therefore there would be no violation of res judicata in calculating compensation based on

fair market value.!°>

The Claimants submit that in calculating the compensation due for the expropriation of CPP,
the price paid by Mr Pey Casado cannot be relevant, as fair market value is an abstract
concept that does not take into account the particularities of a given situation.'** They point
to the fact that the price paid by Mr Pey Casado to Mr Sainte-Marie reflected the ‘fair value’,
but not the ‘fair market value’, of CPP and EPC, as it reflected the specific positions of the
two parties to the transaction, who were friends and long-standing colleagues, rather than

the fair market value of the assets sold.!°5

The Claimants defend the use by Accuracy of the US dollar in its calculations, on the basis
that a prudent investor at that time would have used that currency, and that any differences
in inflation between the US and Chile would have been counter-balanced by changes in the
exchange rates between the two currencies. The exchange rate used by Accuracy was the
average annual exchange rate published by the Bank of Chile, which corresponds to the rate
that would have been applied to businessmen seeking to purchase United States dollars

during that period.'°°

With respect to the capitalization rates used, the Claimants defend
Accuracy’s choice of the mid-rate of American ten-year Treasury Bonds, augmented by a
national risk premium of 2% corresponding to the rate assigned to Chile from 1974 to 2000

and subjected to annual review from 2000-2014.'°”

The Claimants contend that the expert report submitted by Navigant in support of the
Respondent’s claim is based on an incorrect interpretation of the dispute as directed by the
Respondent, and that Navigant’s entire report is outside its field of expertise, being based on

a legal analysis of the consequences of a treaty violation and not on financial matters.!°*

The Claimants suggest that Accuracy’s damages assessment should be used by the Tribunal
as Navigant, the Respondent’s expert, has not proposed an alternative damages
assessment,'*? and because the Respondent has failed to produce the documents requested
by the Claimants in their March and November 2014 requests for document production.?°
The expert reports of Accuracy are reliable and trustworthy, even if a measure of uncertainty
is present in the calculations, as there exists an inherent uncertainty in damages calculations,
and the Tribunal possesses the discretion to make an approximate calculation as to the

amount recoverable.2”!

Moreover, given the particularly violent character of the expropriation in the present case,
and the inability of the Claimants to obtain key information from the Respondent, Accuracy
was only able to obtain incomplete information relating to its calculations. The Tribunal
should give the Claimants the benefit of the doubt and consider the value range submitted

by Accuracy.”

The Claimants explain that the EBITDA adjustment undertaken by Accuracy, which aims to

also applied a 20% discount (décote) by reason of the absence of similar data for the press
sector in Latin America, and using a range of multiples in line with the practice of other

forecasters; after the discount, the 12x multiple would be converted to 9.6 x EBITDA.

They reject the Respondent’s contention that the New York Times and the Washington Post
should not have been excluded, as these two comparators are the least close to the situation
of El Clarin.°® The Claimants contend that the EBITDA adjustment has been confirmed in
the First Award and has the character of res judicata, and that the Respondent’s objections

to this adjustment are unfounded.?”

The Claimants explain that Accuracy analysed the financial data of the seized companies
prior to their seizure from 1970 to 1972, so as to determine the profitability of the operational
activity of the group.2*

EBITDA value) of the Group El Clarin was, in 1972, either US$738,000 or

Accuracy has concluded that the aggregate value (normalized

US$1,222,000.2 The Claimants contend that two figures were necessary given the claimed
concealment by the Respondent of figures relating to 1973, and that the higher figure should
be preferred.”!° Taking into consideration the El Clarin Group’s debt of US$535,000, the
Claimants calculate that, according to the normalized EBITDA value of (US$1,222,000 -
US$535,000), the value of the shares in CPP and EPC on the eve of their seizure de facto
was US$11,200,000.7!!

The Claimants contend that the material injury to the Claimants must be capitalized up to
the date of the First Award, 8 May 2008, after which compound interest should apply until
the date of payment.?!? Capitalization should be at the rate of American 10-year Treasury
bonds augmented by the risk premium pertaining to Chile, namely, fixed at 2% from 1973-
1999 and revised each year from 2000-2008.7!3_ From 8 May 2008 until 27 June 2014,
compound interest of 5% has been applied.”'+ The injury suffered by the Claimants, valued

on 27 June 2014, is thus US$329,700,000.

The Claimants’ request for relief, drawn from the second Accuracy Report, is therefore
US$338.3 million, which is equal to the compensation that would be due from the

Respondent to the Claimants for the shares of CPP and EPC Ltda.?!>

(i) | The compensation calculation for unjust enrichment

With respect to the unjust enrichment calculation, the Claimants’ alternative claim is for:
1) the value of the rents saved by the Respondent between 11 September 1973 and 22 April

2013, assessed at US$3,800,000;7'° 2) the value of real estate and moveable property seized

7

by the Respondent in 1973, adjusted for rises in property values?!’ assessed at

US$17,800,000;7!8 3) the Respondent’s enjoyment and use of premises in Santiago, Viiia
del Mar and Concepcién claiming the benefits of the savings accrued by the Respondent
since 11 September 1973,7!9 assessed at US$1,500,000;7" and 4) the Respondent’s
enjoyment and use of the moveable property owned by CPP and EPC, in particular, the Goss
and Plamag presses.”! The Claimants contend that to achieve restitutio in integrum these
should be capitalized annually, so that on 27 June 2014, the reparation due for unjust

enrichment was US$91,600,000.2?2 Given the fact of confiscation, no evidence is required

as to the actual use of the assets made by the Respondent.??*

The Claimants conclude that, on the basis of unjust enrichment, they are entitled to the sum
of US$94.1 million,24 having regard to the profits or savings made by the Respondent from

the seizure of the assets of CPP and EPC.”*5

c. The calculation of moral damages

The Claimants claim for the moral injury suffered by Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation
Presidente Allende, for the injury endured by Mr Pey Casado through the seizure of CPP and
EPC’s assets and subsequently, as well as for the Respondent’s misconduct during the
arbitral proceedings.””°

The Claimants submit that it falls outside the expertise of Accuracy to calculate moral
damages, and that it is for them to provide detail as to the basis for compensation for such
damages.”?7 Moral damages are not excluded by the dispositif of the First Award since

‘compensation’ refers simply to indemnification, whether for material or moral damages.”

The Foundation Presidente Allende and Ms Pey Grebe have standing to claim moral
damages, because they are not claiming for any direct injury to them, but for the violation of
Article 4 of the BIT, which includes moral injury, given the character assassination of
Mr Pey Casado since 11 September 1973.” The Claimants further submit that a causal link
exists between the moral damages suffered and the violation of Article 4 recognized by the

First Tribunal, as well as by the Chilean Supreme Court in its judgment of 21 June 2000.7”

Given the gravity and recurring nature of the moral injuries suffered by Mr Pey Casado,”*!

the Claimants have assigned the value of US$10,000,000 to Ms Pey Grebe, and US$500,000

to the Foundation Presidente Allende for this harm.?>?

d. Tax gross-up

The Claimants contend that any compensation must take into account the difference between

the tax rate that would be paid at the time of any eventual award, and the tax rate applicable

on the capital gains that would have been paid had compensation been awarded in 1973.2*

They thus request a tax gross-up on the damages awarded, so as to restore fully to them their
patrimony had there been no violation of fair and equitable treatment.*** They calculate that
the tax gross-up should be between US$10 and 13 million (Accurracy’s Approach A), or
between US$18 and 22 million (Accurracy’s Approach B) for the principal claim, and more

than US$6 million for the ancillary claim.?*°

During the oral proceedings, the Claimants sought to introduce into the record new tax
calculations, with respect to the rates of taxation applicable in Chile in 2015, on the basis
that these were a simple update of document CM-48.7° The Respondent objected to the
introduction of this new documentation, on the basis that these constituted an entirely new
document that they have not had the opportunity to assess, rebut, or show to experts.2*’ By
email dated 16 May 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would “rule on the
Claimants’ request as and when it reaches the point of deciding on the relevance of tax rate

schedules to its Award.”

e. Interest

The Claimants submit that the awarding of interest is an accepted practice in international

238

dispute settlement,’ and that abundant international case law supports the award of

compound interest from the date of the award.” They recall that the rate used by Accuracy

240

reflects the rate used by the First Tribunal and the ad hoc Committee of 5%,““" and deny any

responsibility for the lapse of time since the Award, given the concealment by the

Respondent of the Santiago court judgment.*!

The Claimants further request that, in the case of default, interest of 10% should be levied
after 90 days from the date of the eventual Award.” They point to previous refusals by the
Respondent voluntarily to execute the Award as justifying any forward-looking measures to

establish post-Award interest.7*

f£ Incidental damages, costs and fees

The Claimants maintain that compensation may be claimed for the incidental costs of acts
taken to remedy or mitigate the original injury, including the cost of pursuing judicial
proceedings.** They contend that the First Award in fact made provision for such costs in

paragraphs 719 and 730,

and that costs and fees, including legal fees, can be regarded as
damages caused by the unlawful act, and thus as consequential damages under international
law.4° The Claimants estimate the incidental costs of all acts taken to remedy or mitigate
the original injury, including the total costs of arbitral and judicial proceedings, at

€11,156,739 and $US517,533 plus interest.7*7

Based on the same principle, the Claimants seek compensation for the additional costs
imposed on them by the Respondent’s refusal to execute the First Award without delay,
namely €102,734.75 for the legal fees of Me Manuel Murillo, and €8,890.72 for those of
Mr Bordallo.248 The Claimants recalled that, pursuant to the decision of 16 December 2014
of the Spanish tribunal, a portion of those sums, €69,545.67, may allow for enforced
recovery against assets held jure gestionis by the Respondent in Spain. By letter of 22 April
2015, the Claimants took note of the fact that the Respondent had paid this sum, and in a
written communication addressed to the Parties of 16 May 2015, the Tribunal took note of

the Claimants’ abandonment of their claim for that specific sum.

respect to costs and fees relating specifically to the Resubmission Proceeding, the Claimants

submitted figures of US$4,534,826.60 and €33,332.19 in legal costs and translation costs.?>°

C. Overview of the Respondent’s Submissions

123. The Respondent’s submissions can be divided into three broad sections: challenges to the
standing of Ms Pey Grebe, and to the admissibility of the Claimants’ requests for relief;
challenges to the Claimants’ theory of damages, and in particular, the damages calculations
presented by their expert; and challenges to the Claimants’ requests for a tax gross-up,

interest, and costs and fees.

124. The Respondent’s principal submission in response to the Claimants’ submission is that
‘each and every one of the Claimants’ requests for relief? exceeds the Tribunal’s authority

to award relief in the present proceedings,”*!

as they contravene the two fundamental
principles that characterize ICSID resubmission proceedings: first, the parties must be in
complete identity with those that participated in both the original arbitration that yielded the
award and the annulment proceeding that vacated the award in full or in part; and secondly,
the parties and the resubmission tribunal remain bound by the un-annulled portions of the
award, with the competence of the resubmission tribunal confined to deciding issues raised

in the annulled portion(s) of the First Award.

(1) ‘Jurisdiction and Admissibility
a. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Ms Pey Grebe and her claims
125. The Respondent considers that the Claimants’ decision to substitute Ms Coral Pey Grebe for

Mr Pey as Claimant generates three specific jurisdictional problems. The Respondent

suggests instead that Mr Pey Casado be reinstated as Claimant in the proceeding, in lieu of

49 CR, para. 412.

128.

129.

Ms Pey Grebe, and that, in the light of Mr Pey Casado’s advanced age, Ms Pey Grebe be

regarded as her father’s representative.°*

In the Respondent’s contention Ms Pey Grebe is not a proper party to the Resubmission
Proceeding, since Article 52 of the ICSID Convention provides that only the same ‘parties’
who participated in both the arbitration and the annulment proceedings are entitled to seek
resubmission of a dispute following the full or partial annulment of an award.2** The
Respondent argues that because the First Award did not make any jurisdictional findings on
claims of Ms Pey Grebe, she lacks standing to assert rights on the basis of the First Award’s
findings, as ICSID rules do not allow for representative claims.?>

The Respondent further submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae over
Ms Pey Grebe as she does not have a qualifying ‘investment’. Investors must not only hold
some type of protected asset, but the asset must, under Article 1(2) of the BIT,?° have been
obtained as a result of a personal contribution; the cession from Mr Pey Casado to his
daughter does not qualify, as it was made without consideration (a titre gratuit). Moreover,
the object of the cession is precisely what the First Award found to have been expropriated

definitively during the 1970s.?°7

The Respondent further submits that jurisdiction has not been, and in all likelihood cannot
be, established with respect to Ms Pey Grebe, as Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention
prohibits claims by dual nationals if one of the nationalities is that of the respondent State;

the Claimants have not denied that Ms Pey Grebe is a dual Spanish-Chilean national, was

born in Chile, and continues to bear Chilean nationality.?>*

Finally, the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal is not empowered to award relief to

Ms Pey Grebe for an injury sustained by another party, in particular those which by their

253 RCM, para. 195.

254 RCM, para. 179; RR, para. 18.

255 RCM, paras. 181-183.

256 Which expressly limits protection to claims, securities and rights ‘arising from all types of contributions
made for the purpose of creating economic value’.

258 RCM, paras. 191-92; RR, para. 19.

nature are in personam, or for an injury occurring prior to her claimed investment.”

Because Ms Pey Grebe was not a party to the Chilean court proceeding that was the subject
of the finding of a denial of justice in the First Award, the Respondent concludes that Ms Pey
Grebe cannot recover any damages for that finding. In the alternative, the Respondent
argues that even if the violations of the BIT found in the First Award relate only to the
investment and not to the investor as such, Ms Pey Grebe cannot recover for harm caused

before her claimed acquisition of the investment in March 2013.76

As to the more specific arguments made by the Claimants in support of Ms Pey Grebe’s
status as Claimant in the Resubmission Proceedings: (a) although it is right that jurisdiction
is to be established at the moment that proceedings are instituted, the Respondent submits
that if a new claimant joins the case, the Tribunal must evaluate its jurisdiction anew as to
each such claimant; (b) the assignment of Mr Pey Casado’s shares in El Clarin and rights
in this arbitration does not suffice to establish Ms Pey Grebe’s standing, because the
requirement of the identity of the parties is not satisfied merely by virtue of a transfer of
rights; (c) although the Claimants contend that the assignment constitutes a valid legal
agreement that must be respected by the Tribunal, to uphold the Claimant’s argument would
be to permit a private agreement to supersede the limitations on jurisdiction imposed by the
ICSID Convention; (d) the Respondent denies that it is merely repeating its earlier objection
to the First Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Foundation, since the situation of Ms Pey Grebe
has to be distinguished on the grounds set out above; (e) the Respondent denies that it is
precluded from raising jurisdictional objections in the Counter-Memorial, as ICSID
Arbitration Rule 41(1) allows a party to identify jurisdictional deficiencies until ‘the
expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial’; no ICSID tribunal
has ever refused to examine jurisdictional deficiencies identified in a respondent’s counter-
memorial, but the Tribunal must in any event evaluate sua sponte any jurisdictional defects
posed by Ms Pey Grebe’s role as Claimant; (f) finally, the Respondent denies that its

objections are designed to deprive Mr Pey Casado of the benefits of the First Award, since

259 RR, para. 29.
260 RCM, paras. 193-194.

43

131.

132.

the problems arise out of the Claimants’ own unwillingness to reinstate Mr Pey Casado as

Claimant.”°!

b. The damage calculations offered by the Claimants and their expert are inadmissible,
as they do not relate specifically to the two BIT violations identified in the First Award

The Respondent recalls that Procedural Order No. | identifies the scope of the Tribunal’s
authority as the matters identified in paragraph 359.1 of the Decision on Annulment, and
submits that all the Claimants’ requests for relief, in particular those relating to claimed post-
First Award violations of Article 4 of the BIT, exceed the Tribunal’s authority, as they either

represent a variety of new claims or revisit prior failed claims.?°

The Respondent rejects
in particular the following: the freestanding expropriation claim; the claim that various post-
First Award events relating to the Goss press constitute a violation of Article 4 of the BIT;
the claim that the behaviour of its representatives amounts to a new violation of Article 4 of
the BIT; the claim that national treatment was denied to the Claimants when the owners of
most other media companies were compensated for the expropriation of their assets; and the

claim based on unjust enrichment.?%

The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ requests for relief are improper because they
are inconsistent with the nature and scope of the Resubmission Proceeding, and directly
contradict prior decisions which are res judicata.“ The Respondent points, in particular,
to the three requests corresponding to the expropriation value of E/ Clarin, the requests for
costs and legal fees that were declined by the First Tribunal and ad hoc Committee, and the
request for moral damages;”°> all of these are insufficiently connected to the two violations
of the BIT that fall within the scope of the Resubmission Proceeding, and in any event Chile

6

has already paid some of these costs and fees.°° The Respondent further contends that,

because paragraph 3 of the First Award’s dispositif was not annulled and remains binding, it

precludes the Tribunal from ordering restitution or satisfaction; accordingly, it may not

consider any claims for unjust enrichment or moral damages, as these are not requests for

compensation, compensation being understood as financially assessable damages.”

c. The claims based on expropriation value contradict unannulled portions of the First
Award and are outside the scope of the Resubmission Proceeding

With respect to the requests corresponding to the expropriation value of El Clarin, the
Respondent submits that un-annulled portions of the First Award preclude any assessment
of damages that equates injury from the BIT violations with the injury from the expropriation
of El Clarin. The Respondent submits that the un-annulled portions of the First Award
declare that none of the BIT’s substantive protections applied to the expropriation of El
Clarin, and that the two BIT violations are distinct from any expropriation-based

violation.2%

Liability for a breach being a prerequisite for an award of damages as
compensation, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants’ request would entail it being

obliged to pay damages for a BIT violation not found by the First Tribunal.”

The Respondent denies that any unjust enrichment gained by it can be awarded by the
Tribunal, primarily because, whether or not unjust enrichment was argued before the First
Tribunal but not considered in the First Award, the First Tribunal ‘unambiguously
concluded’ that none of the BIT’s substantive protections could apply either to the taking of
control over the assets of El Clarin, or to the depriving of the Claimants of the benefits of
them.?” The Respondent therefore submits that to grant any compensation for unjust
enrichment would be ‘completely arbitrary, inconsistent with binding conclusions from the
Award, contrary to the Annulment Decision’s clear and explicit guidance on the issues and
findings that had been annulled ... and at odds with the ... tenet of international law that a
State can be condemned to pay damages for particular conduct only if there has been a

finding of liability for such conduct’.?7!

136.

The Respondent submits in the alternative that even if the First Award had failed to address
a claim for unjust enrichment, the appropriate proceeding would have been the filing of a
request for supplementation pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, but subject
to a fixed time limit of 45 days after the date on which an award is rendered; having failed
to observe that, the Claimants must now be deemed to have waived their rights to make such

a claim”

d. The Claimants’ request for costs incurred in prior phases of the dispute is
impermissible

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ request for costs incurred in prior phases of the
dispute is outside the scope of the Resubmission Proceeding. The Respondent also contends
that the Tribunal cannot entertain costs claims relating to violations of Article 3 of the BIT
and of Articles 53(1) and 54(1) of the ICSID Convention, as it has not been found in breach
of these provisions by any ICSID panel.?”* As to claims for prior costs linked to the violation
of Article 4 of the BIT, the Respondent maintains that these must be rejected in the present
Resubmission Proceeding, as the First Tribunal, the Revision Tribunal, the ad hoc
Committee, and the Spanish court in the enforcement proceeding in Spain had already ruled
on the Claimants’ costs requests in the context of each proceeding.?* Finally, the
Respondent notes that it has already paid the cost amounts owed to the Claimants pursuant
to the cost awards in the First Award and Supplementation Decision of 19 June 2013.25 The
sum of US$2,634.83 noted by the Claimants as missing is due to a commission that the

Claimants’ bank had deducted from the amount transferred by Chile.?’°

e. The Claimants’ claim for moral damages is improper

The Respondent submits that it would be impermissible to award moral damages, whether
for the seizure of El Clarin or in compensation for any claimed misconduct on its part during
the arbitration proceedings, on the basis that neither of them relates to the two BIT violations
found in the First Award; it recalls in particular that the First Tribunal expressly rejected the
Claimants’ submissions concerning any misconduct during the arbitration proceedings. The
Respondent contends that the Claimants are only entitled to compensation for the BIT
violations, and then only to compensation which corresponds to ‘financially assessable
damage’; by contrast, moral damages cannot be quantified, so that the Claimants’ request
for US$10.5 million in moral damages is arbitrary. Even if the Tribunal were authorized to
award moral damages, it could still not do so for the benefit of Ms Pey Grebe or to the
Foundation for injuries suffered by Mr Pey Casado, as the ICSID system only allows for
claims for losses suffered personally, and the interests of Ms Pey Grebe and the Foundation
were not acquired until 2013 and 1990 respectively, thus much later than when the purported

injuries were sustained.?””

f The Claimants have failed to satisfy their burden of proving their damages, and thus
are entitled to no compensation

The Respondent submits that, inasmuch as the Claimants have failed to identify any relief
that can be granted by the Tribunal, no compensation can be awarded. The Claimants have
instead claimed for the expropriation value of El Clarin, which is excluded by the un-
annulled conclusions of the First Award, and have neglected to advance any damages
calculations or theories with respect to the BIT violations upheld by the First Award.?’> The
Respondent takes the view that even if a BIT violation is found to exist, a tribunal may
decline to award any damages to a claimant if the claimant fails to meet its burden of proving

them.?”

The Respondent further submits that the Claimants’ brought the harm on themselves by their

own actions, by knowingly and voluntarily declining to participate in the relevant Chilean

reparations process established by Law No. 19.568, instead opting to pursue their
expropriation claims in an international forum, which, through the ‘fork-in-the-road’ clause
in the Chile-Spain BIT, made it impossible for the Respondent to compensate them under

Chilean law for the expropriation of El Clarin.?*°

(2) Merits: calculating the quantum of damages
a. All the Claimants’ arguments on damages are ill-founded

The Respondent disputes all of the Claimants’ arguments on damages, on the basis that they
are irrelevant to the Resubmission Proceeding and exceed its scope. They create the risk of
a contradiction between the First Award and the present Tribunal’s Award, or would
represent a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Respondent recalls
its earlier submission that there is no causal link between the denial of justice and
discrimination violations and the ability of the Claimants to obtain compensation for the
expropriation of E/ Clarin, but that it was the Claimants’ own decision to eschew Chilean

legal mechanisms in favour of an international claim.7*!

b. The Claimants’ theory of damages for the denial of justice violation is untenable

The Respondent contends that, despite bearing the burden of proving causation, quantum
and the recoverability of the loss claimed by the denial of justice violation, the Claimants
have not presented any damages calculation that relates specifically to it, but instead, have

presented a theory of damages that has already been rejected by the First Tribunal.?**

The Respondent recalls that the First Tribunal confined the denial of justice purely to the
absence of a decision on the merits in the Goss press case between September 1994 and
4 November 2002, and not the underlying issue relating to the confiscation itself;?** to accept
the Claimants’ ‘continuing expropriation’ theory of compensation would, however, be to

rule upon the substance of the confiscation claim, and to overturn or contradict the un-

annulled conclusions in the First Award.”** The Respondent also contends that the denial of
justice is limited only to the absence of decision by the Chilean tribunals for more than seven
years, and not to any other conduct by them;7*> the only effect of the seven-year delay is that
that court would have ruled earlier, but still against Mr Pey Casado, and in any event the
Santiago court could not possibly have granted Mr Pey Casado the full expropriation value

of El Clarin, as he was only asking for the value of the Goss printing press.”*°

Moreover, to substantiate their claim the Claimants would have had to prove that the denial
of justice had prevented the First Tribunal from awarding compensation to the Claimants in
the amount of the expropriation value of E/ Clarin, yet this is in fact the very portion of the
First Award that was annulled.”*” However, the First Tribunal based its conclusion purely
on its determination that the expropriation of E/ Clarin was an instantaneous act, and the
status of Decree No. 165 under Chilean law had no bearing on the issue of when the

expropriation was consummated.?**

Accordingly, the First Tribunal’s reference to Decree
No. 165 concerned its timing, and had no bearing on the legal status or validity of that

document.?

The Respondent argues, relying on the two Expert Reports of Dr Libedinsky, that it is a
requirement of Chilean domestic law that ‘nullity under public law must be expressly and
formally stated by a competent judicial or administrative authority’.?°? However, Mr Pey
Casado had never asked for the annulment of Decree No. 165 before the Santiago court, and
there is no express declaration in its judgment that Decree No. 165 is rendered null and
void.”?! The Respondent further denies that the Santiago court ruling’s conclusion that only
EPC, and not Mr Pey Casado, had standing to assert its property rights in that case, could be

construed to constitute recognition that Decree No. 165 is null under public law. Instead,

the Respondent contends that Mr Pey Casado’s claim was rejected purely on the basis that
he lacked standing on the face of his own complaint, which was one for restitution of
property belonging to a third party, and because the relevant five-year statute of limitations
had run even before the claim was filed in 1995; there would accordingly have been no
difference in the outcome of the case had the Santiago court issued its merits ruling earlier.?°?
The Respondent concludes that Decree No. 165 remains in force under the Chilean legal

system;??3

in the alternative, even if null, the validity of Decree No. 165 had no impact on
the effects of that expropriation under international law, which cannot be undone

retroactively.?**

(i) The Claimants’ submissions amount to the overturning of binding
conclusions from the First Award

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no authority to grant either the Claimants’
request to apply the BIT’s substantive provisions to the expropriation of E/ Clarin, or their
request for compensation in the amount of the expropriation value of El Clarin.°> To do so
would require overturning several binding conclusions from the un-annulled portions of the
First Award: (a) the inapplicability ratione temporis of the BIT’s substantive provisions;
(b) that the seizure and transfer of assets from CPP and EPC to the Chilean State were
constitutive of a consummated fact that was distinct from violations occurring after the entry
into force of the BIT; (c) that the Claimants’ ancillary request of 4 November 2002 was not
a request for restitution for the seizure of the Goss press, but a request for reparation for the
injury suffered by Mr Pey Casado for the denial of justice. The Respondent reiterates that
under Arbitration Rule 55(3), the present Tribunal cannot revisit any of the un-annulled

passages of the First Award, which are res judicata.?”°

The Respondent further submits that, under Article 2.2. of the BIT, an investment may have
been made prior to its entry into force, but must still be existing at the time of the entry into

force; if the investment has already disappeared, it cannot be covered by the BIT.”

The Respondent argues that new evidence, e.g. in the form of the Santiago court ruling,
allows for the reopening of an Award only in the context of a revision proceeding pursuant
to Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, but not that of a resubmission proceeding under

Article 52.7

According to the Respondent, the acts and omissions now complained of by the Claimants
fall outside the temporal and substantive scope of the denial of justice found by the First
Tribunal, which extends from 1995 and ended in 2002.7” In response to the allegations
centring on the translation of the 2008 judgment of the Santiago court, the Respondent points
to the original version of the document where there was a stamp over the three missing
words, and suggests that this was the reason for the omission, not fraud.*°” The Respondent
further argues that the denial of justice found by the First Tribunal included only the conduct
of Chilean domestic courts, and excluded any alleged misconduct by Chile’s executive

authorities in the prior phases of the present dispute.*°!

The Respondent submits that the claim for restitution for the Goss press was dealt with in
the Claimants’ Ancillary Request of 2002, and that the finding that none of the substantive
provisions of the Chile-Spain BIT applied to any of the expropriation-related claims, also

encompasses claims relating to the Goss press, and is res judicata.

The Respondent further submits that the Claimants have neglected to provide any evidence
or argument to identify the compensation that was due for the denial of justice resulting from
the seven-year delay in the Santiago court proceeding, and that in any event the delay did

not cause any compensable injury to the Claimants, as they would not have received

compensation for the restitution value of the Goss press or for the expropriation value of El
Clarin had there been no delay. The Respondent rejects the allegation that it had denied
access to the Goss press case file at the Santiago court, in view of the evidence it has
submitted that the Claimants only requested access to a small handful of pages from the case

file, which they received.°™

 

c. The Claimants’ theory of d ‘for the discriminati iolation is unfounded

The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ theory of damages for the discrimination
violation encounters the identical objections to the theory put forward for the denial of
justice; in both cases, the compensation demanded is for the expropriation value of El

305

Clarin. The Respondent accordingly submits that because the Claimants have not

identified any injury caused by the discrimination, no compensation can be awarded.

The Respondent maintains that Mr Pey Casado was duly notified of the comprehensive
reparations programme for military-era expropriations promulgated through Law
No. 19.568, and invited to participate in it, but, under the ‘fork-in-the-road’ provision in
the BIT that required a choice between international and domestic remedies, Mr Pey Casado
and the Foundation chose to notify the Chilean Ministry of National Assets that they would

not pursue any claims through the 1998 programme.*””

With respect to Decision No. 43, which authorized the payment of compensation to the
successors and representatives of four individuals who had established that they had owned
assets belonging to CPP,*°’ the Respondent submits that the Claimants have

mischaracterized the procedural history leading to the finding of discrimination; according

to the Respondent, no quantifiable injury stems from the events that constituted the

discrimination violation.*°°

The 1998 Reparations Law was the only source of any right to compensation for the
Claimants, but the right was extinguished by the express waiver of participation in the
reparations programme;*!° once a decision had been made on a particular asset, it was no
longer possible for other claims to be filed over that asset under the Law.*!! The letter sent
by Mr Pey Casado to the President of Chile in September 1995 did not create a ‘free-
standing’ right to compensation for the expropriation of E/ Clarin; on that reasoning, a
respondent State would be in violation of its BIT obligations every time it were to reject or
deny any compensation request made by any claimant, regardless of the merits of any such

request.3!

The Respondent also rejects the argument that, but for the paralysis and rejection of their
claims within the Chilean domestic system, the Claimants would have received

compensation for the expropriation of El Clarin.#'*

According to the Respondent, the
Claimants’ actions were confined to efforts to stop the execution of Decision No. 43, and
did not at any point include any affirmative request for compensation for the full
expropriation value of El Clarin.*'+ The Respondent suggests that to put the Claimants in
the position of there having been no violation of the BIT would only result in the suspension
of Decision No. 43, and that no compensation for the expropriation value of El Clarin would

have been awarded.*>

d. The Claimants cannot identify any injury caused by the discrimination violation

The Respondent argues further that, because Decision No. 43 does not address Mr Pey

Casado’s rights, nor did it conflict with the then ongoing Goss press case or affect the ICSID

dispute between the parties, it cannot be said to have caused any injury to the Claimants;*!°

any injury that might be said to exist was caused by the Claimants’ own conscious decision
not to participate in the 1998 reparations programme.*!’ Even if the administrative process
that led to Decision No. 43 had been suspended, no benefit would have accrued to the
Claimants.*!® Decision No. 43 was not issued with the aim of frustrating the Claimants’
rights, notably the right to arbitration, and the First Tribunal has already rejected the

Claimants’ arguments on this point.*!?

Finally, the Respondent submits that, though the ad hoc Committee did not annul the First
Tribunal’s conclusion that the Claimants are entitled to compensation, that does not endow
the present Tribunal with a general discretion to award compensation, unless the Claimants
can meet the usual requirements to prove causation and quantum.*””. The Respondent recalls
the finding of the First Tribunal that Decision No. 43 could only be considered a violation
of Article 4 of the BIT, and not a violation of Articles 3 and 5.°2!_ As the Claimants had
expressly waived their right to assert claims under the 1998 reparations programme, no harm
is attributable to the discrimination engendered by Decision No. 43; therefore, no

compensation is to be awarded.*?*

(3) The calculation of damages
a. Accuracy’s damages calculations cannot be regarded as reliable

The Respondent asserts that, as shown by the Navigant Expert Reports, Accuracy’s damages
calculations cannot be relied upon, as they are methodologically and logically unsound,
speculative and contrary to explicit determinations in the First Award and Annulment

decision,*”> particularly in that they have not calculated separately damages for the

discrimination violation or the denial of justice violation.*** The damages assessment
presented by Navigant, the Respondent’s expert, is thus entirely appropriate as an alternative
assessment. In any event it is the Claimants who bear the burden of proof in demonstrating,
for damages purposes, the situation that would have obtained but for the relevant violations

of the BIT established by the un-annulled portions of the First Award.

The Respondent argues that adverse inferences cannot be drawn against it for the non-
production of documents requested by the Claimants in March and November 2014; the
IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration only permit adverse
inferences to be drawn ‘[i]f a Party fails without satisfactory explanation to produce any
Document requested in a Request to Produce to which it has not objected in due time or fails
to produce any Document ordered to be produced by the Arbitral Tribunal ...’ but here the
Tribunal had rejected the Claimants’ requests in their entirety.*>>

The Respondent regards Accuracy’s damages calculation as speculative because the
Claimants have quantified the same injury with figures that have diverged substantially:
US$515 million in their Request for Arbitration;**° US$397 million in their Counter-
Memorial on Merits and Jurisdiction;??” US$797 million during the Revision Proceeding;*”*

and in the present proceeding, US$338 million.”

The Respondent suggests that these
figures vary by more than 692 percent, and Accuracy provides five different damages

estimates which range from US$91,669,220 to US$329,678,000.7°

The Respondent contests the legitimacy of Accuracy adjusting their “Main Claims”
calculations even though they know the actual figures for El Clarin’s earnings in 1970-1972;
this ‘adjustment’ amounts to 90% of the amount claimed.**! Moreover, Accuracy

improperly relies on a comparison of El Clarin with large United States media

conglomerates, including an adjustment of 20% achieved by eliminating from the calculation
two United States conglomerates that, according to the Respondent, were the most

comparable to El Clarin*?

The Respondent further submits that Accuracy has ignored the particular circumstances of
the economy of Chile in the 1970s by assuming that the Claimants would have been paid in
US dollars and ignoring the rapid decrease in value of the assets of E/ Clarin that would have
resulted in an economic environment in which inflation was as high as 341% from 1974 to

1975.33

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that fair market value can serve as the
standard of compensation for breaches of fair and equitable treatment and suggests that the
application of the fair market value standard is not always an appropriate or logical measure
of compensation for non-expropriation violations. The Respondent submits that the case
law of investment tribunals shows that compensation based on fair market value has always
involved a deprivation of the entire investment, or its value.**> The Respondent asserts that
the Claimants have failed to established any causal link between the compensation they seek

and the two violations declared in the First Award.

b. The Claimants are not entitled to compensation on the basis of unjust enrichment

The Respondent submits that unjust enrichment is not a legitimate methodology for the
quantification of damages in this proceeding, as it exceeds the scope of the Tribunal’s
authority,**° but also as a general matter of damages under international law.**’ The
Respondent submits, in the alternative, that even if a causal link did exist between the BIT
violations found in the First Award and the damages assessments submitted by the

Claimants, the Respondent has disgorged whatever enrichment it might have derived from

the expropriation of E/ Clarin in virtue of the payment made to Messrs Sainte-Marie,
Carrasco, Gonzalez and Venegas under Decision No. 43.*** In any case, the Respondent
challenges the Claimants’ estimates as involving several levels of conjecture, including the
calculation of rental amounts from 1973 to 2013 using inappropriate valuation methodology,

and in some cases the fact that the rental properties no longer existed.”

c. A tax gross-up would not be appropriate

The Respondent contends that a tax gross-up in any amount would be improper and
unprecedented;*° any potential domestic tax obligations of the Claimants cannot be
considered ‘losses’ for purposes of damage recovery under international investment
arbitration, as they are not directly attributable to the opposing party in the investment

dispute.*!

In the alternative, the Respondent argues that neither the Claimants nor their
experts have invoked any legal provision currently in force in Chile or any other jurisdiction
to sustain the proposition that the Claimants would be taxed on an eventual award in this
case,*? and have failed to account for the potential implications of multi-jurisdictional tax
treatment.*#?_ However, the Respondent submits that in any event the few tribunals that have

addressed claims for a tax gross-up have uniformly rejected them.*#

d. Interest cannot be added to any award of damages

The Respondent rejects outright any entitlement to interest on an award of damages in this
case. The Claimants’ claim to pre-award interest from September 1973 bears no relationship
to the dates of the Article 4 BIT violations found in the First Award.*4> The calculations are

based on US dollars, despite the fact that the E7 Clarin Group’s revenues and expenses were

earned and incurred in Chilean escudos. The interest rate proposed is moreover an

artificially inflated one.*4°

With respect to the post-Award phase, the Respondent contends that most of the time elapsed
since the issuance of the First Award has been spent by the parties addressing issues raised
or proceedings commenced by the Claimants, or awaiting the decisions of the First Tribunal
and the ad hoc Committee, and that to allow interest to accrue during that period would
reward the Claimants for their unsuccessful invocation of remedies while punishing the
Respondent for its successful request for annulment.*“” The Respondent also challenges the
Claimant’s request for a compounded interest rate of 10% on any future Award issued by
the Tribunal, which has no basis in the actual purpose, intent or conventions regarding the
application of interest rates. To propose, as the Claimants do, that post-Award interest
compound on a monthly basis deviates from compounding convention, which requires that

the compounding periodicity be dictated by the interest rate“#*

e. The Respondent seeks an award of costs and fees, including legal fees.

The Respondent requests the Tribunal to order the Claimants to reimburse all costs and fees,
including legal fees, incurred by it in this Resubmission Proceeding.*“? It contends that the
Claimants have distorted the contents of the Santiago court ruling to an extent that seems
designed to mislead the Tribunal, and thus constitutes an abuse of process warranting

penalization in the form of an award of costs.*°°

The Respondent further argues that the Claimants have resorted to improper and unduly
convoluted claims and arguments; have publicly accused the Respondent’s counsel of bad
faith, by uploading pleadings and correspondence in which they challenged the impartiality
of Dr Libedinsky and the conduct of Ms Macchiavello and Mr Di Rosa;*"! in addition, they

have belaboured procedural points and improperly appealed certain issues; and generally

TH.ANALYSIS

A. Introduction: the Role of a New Tribunal

171.

172.

In coming to its decision on this case, the Tribunal is all too conscious (as it has been
throughout the earlier phases of this resubmission proceeding) of how long it is since the
events took place that gave rise to the dispute between the Parties, and indeed of the quite
unusual length of the totality of the arbitral proceedings since their inception all of nineteen
years ago. The Tribunal is aware, too, of the passion with which the case has been fought
on both sides, and of the way in which the facts underlying the case entwine high politics
with the personal fate of individuals, and commercial and economic relations with personal
connections and family relationships.** The Tribunal has therefore done its utmost to listen
with careful and sympathetic attention to all of the arguments that have been brought before
it by the Parties in writing and orally, without seeking to apply in advance any a priori
criterion of selection as to which of them would ultimately prove relevant and material to its

Award.

The time has however now come for these arbitral proceedings to be brought to their final
end; reipublicae interest ut finis sit litium. The Tribunal will now proceed to do so, with
an expression of gratitude to all Parties and their counsel for the thoroughness of their
arguments, but a reminder that its function, as an arbitration tribunal under the ICSID

Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, is to decide according to the applicable law, in

32 RCM, para. 342; RR, paras. 185-188.

its relation to the established facts. In the absence of any agreement to that effect between

the Parties, the Tribunal has no power to decide their dispute ex aequo et bono.

The Tribunal thinks it as well to recall at the outset the limited nature of its task. These are
resubmission proceedings, following the partial annulment of the First Tribunal’s Award.
They are thus governed by Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that: “If
the award is annulled, the dispute shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to a new
Tribunal constituted in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter.” The present Tribunal is
of course that ‘new Tribunal’ and will address below what is to be understood as ‘the dispute’
in the context of the partial annulment of the First Award. For good measure, and because
of its direct relevance to that question, it is noted that Rule 55(3) of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules provides specifically: “If the original award had only been annulled in part, the new
Tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled.” The Tribunal will

also address below what is meant by ‘reconsider’ in the circumstances of the present case.

It remains to recall, as the framework for what is to follow, the exact terms in which the ad
hoc Committee brought about the partial annulment of the First Award, in its Decision of

18 December 2011:

Par ces motifs, le Comité rend les décisions suivantes :

176. It will be evident, therefore, that the ad hoc Committee has been at great pains to delineate
clearly the contours of the partial annulment brought about by its Decision of 18 December
2011. The reason, one may assume, was the entirely laudable desire to exclude any room
for doubt as to the meaning and scope of its Decision, and the consequences that follow from
it. The intention was also, no doubt, to ease the burden on the Parties by making it plain
what remained open for re-litigation between them, and what (on the other hand) could not
be re-opened because it had been finally determined with the quality of res judicata (or, in
the French phrase used by the Committee, ‘autorité de chose jugée’). To summarize, point
by point, it has been finally determined: that the dispute falls within ICSID jurisdiction; that
Chile (the Respondent) was in breach of its obligation to accord to the Claimants fair and

equitable treatment (including to abstain from any denial of justice); that the Claimants have

 

356 ion’. The Tribunal is

issed further below,

 
  

 
 

 

The French term ‘compensation’ is translated in what follows, literally, as ‘compens:
conscious that, in doing so, it is at risk of begging an important question, which will be dis
but no better translation seems to be available.

 

61

177.

178.

” and finally that any further or other claims were rejected.*** All

a right to compensation;>
of that, in other words, has the quality of res judicata (‘chose jugée’ ), including, notably, the
definitive rejection of all the Claimants’ claims in the dispute other than those covered by

paragraphs 2 and 3 of the dispositive part of the First Award.

Conversely, what does remain open for re-litigation at the instance of the Claimants is the
nature of the compensation due to them under paragraph 3 in consequence of the breach
established in paragraph 2, following the annulment of the assessment made by the First
Tribunal in paragraph 4. It must also be assumed (notwithstanding the incidental inclusion
of a reference to paragraph 4 in paragraph 7, which is in turn expressly stated by the ad hoc
Committee to be res judicata) that, if any monetary compensation was awarded by the
present Tribunal, the due date for payment is also a matter that remains at large, to be

established by the Tribunal in this Award.

The conclusion to be drawn from the above — and it is an inescapable one — is that the present
Tribunal is absolved from any need to investigate afresh whether there was any breach of
Chile’s obligations towards the Claimants in respect of the present dispute, what that breach
consisted in, or whether the breach gives rise to a right to compensation. All of those matters
have been predetermined by the First Award and are binding on all Parties under
Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention. Not only is there no need for the Tribunal to go
into these matters, but it would be a manifest excess of its own jurisdiction if the Tribunal
purported to do so. That is the express consequence of Arbitration Rule 55(3), cited above.
Before this Tribunal, all that remains in ‘dispute’ between the Parties in these resubmission
proceedings (in terms of Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention) is the nature of the
compensation due for the breach or breaches already established by the First Tribunal, and,
if the present Tribunal should find that that compensation should take a monetary form, the

amount thereof.

357 See note 356 above.

*8 The further paragraphs dealing with the allocation of costs and the rate of interest payable in default have
not been included in this summary, as they are not material to the present resubmission proceedings.

62

179.

The Tribunal will therefore confine itself strictly to noting and analysing the First Tribunal’s
finding of breach, and the principles of compensation that follow from that finding, and,
having done so, to applying those findings so as to arrive, in the light of the arguments put
before it by the Parties, at the proper compensation that is due, as well as any consequential

matters which hinge on that.

B. The Claimants in the Present Resubmission Proceedings

180.

181.

182.

Before proceeding to do so however, it will be convenient for the Tribunal to establish who
should be understood as the Parties before it. In a normal situation, this question seldom
arises; that it does so now is because of the doubts raised by the Respondent in respect of the
appearance of Ms Coral Pey Grebe among those for whom counsel for the Claimants state

that they are acting in these proceedings.

To recapitulate: the original Request for Arbitration was brought against the Republic of
Chile in the name of Mr Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation ‘President Allende’; it was
registered by the Centre under that name as ARB/98/2, and that is the way it was known
throughout the original proceedings. The First Award specifies that Mr Pey Casado and the
Foundation are the Claimants in the proceedings, from which it necessarily follows that they
are the beneficiaries of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the dispositif of the First Award cited above.
To be more precise, the finding in paragraph 1 must be understood as a determination of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over claims brought by Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation; and the
findings in paragraphs 2 and 3 as to the existence of a breach, and the consequential
entitlement to compensation, establish rights which vest in Mr Pey Casado and the

Foundation.

The annulment proceedings were conducted in the same way, and in accordance with
standard ICSID practice under the identical ICSID case reference; the Republic of Chile
appears as Applicant, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation as Respondents, and each are
specified as such in the wording of the Decision on Annulment, including therefore the

dispositive paragraphs cited in paragraph 174 above.

63

183.

184.

185.

Tt follows automatically from this that, following the delivery to them of the ad hoc
Committee’s Decision on 18 December 2012, Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation became,
along with the Republic of Chile, the beneficiaries of the entitlement under Rule 55(1) to
request the resubmission of the annulled part of the dispute to a new tribunal, and this is
indeed exactly what was done in the ‘Nouvelle Requéte d’arbitrage’ lodged with the
Secretary-General on 18 June 2013 and registered by the Secretary-General under the same
title as before, namely Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation Presidente Allende v. The

Republic of Chile, and the same case reference as before, ARB/98/2.

It remains only to note, in the interests of clarity, that — although the annulment had been
sought by the Republic of Chile (Respondent in the Arbitration), and although there was a
cross-application by Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation (Claimants in the Arbitration) — the
net effect of the ad hoc Committee’s upholding (in part) the Respondent’s application, even
while rejecting that by the Claimants, was nevertheless in practical terms to open up to the
Claimants the opportunity to seek resubmission of the unresolved parts of the dispute, which
indeed is the way matters turned out as indicated in paragraph 183 above. Nor is there
anything untoward in this procedural state of affairs, given the reciprocal terms of Article

52(6) of the ICSID Convention (paragraph 173 above).

The Respondent now complains that the claims and requests for relief now pleaded by the
Claimants in the name of Ms Pey Grebe are barred by the Convention and the Rules. This
objection attaches itself to the Claimants’ Memorial on Resubmission to which (although
the case title remains as described above) counsel subscribes as ‘Représentant de M. Victor
Pey-Casado, Mme. Coral Pey Grebe et de la Fondation espagnole Président Allende’, and
more particularly it attaches itself to point (4) in the requests for relief contained in paragraph
514 of the Memorial which seeks a payment to Ms Pey Grebe in respect of moral damage.
The Respondent says that this request is procedurally improper, and also lacks any factual
basis as Ms Pey Grebe was neither party to the Chilean court proceedings at the heart of the
denial of justice claim, nor could there have been moral prejudice to her from events taking
place many years before she could assert any rights in relation to El Clarin. The Respondent
adds that it is in any case not permissible for a newly named claimant to benefit from the

First Tribunal’s finding of jurisdiction without establishing jurisdiction ratione personae in

64

186.

187.

her own regard, and that doubts subsist as to whether Ms Pey Grebe would, on closer

examination, so qualify (paragraphs 173-130 above).

The Claimants’ answer is that jurisdiction is determined once and for all as of the date of the
initiation of proceedings, and cannot be affected by events after that date; that Ms Pey Grebe
is the beneficiary of the valid cession to her, recognized by the First Tribunal, of Mr Pey
Casado’s rights, which include the rights arising out of the First Award; and that the reason
underlying the cession was simply Mr Pey Casado’s very advanced age (paragraphs 43-48

above).

The Tribunal is sympathetic towards the points put forward on this matter by both sides, but
feels, on mature consideration, that the matter has been taken beyond its real intrinsic
importance in the argument that has developed between them. On the one hand, it is
undoubtedly true that a new claimant party cannot simply freeload on the back of the
jurisdictional claims of others, but must establish jurisdiction in his or her own right under
the usual criteria. On the other hand, there is no dispute between the two sides that there
has been a cession of rights, in good faith, between Mr Pey Casado and his daughter, which
has been made for good reason, or that both the cession itself and the reason for it were
disclosed to the Tribunal, as they had been to the First Tribunal at an earlier stage.
Nevertheless, if the cession of rights should be understood as transferring to Ms Pey Grebe
her father’s substantive rights, then the effect would be that Mr Pey Casado had lost standing
and could not now appear as claimant; but even then the transfer would not have been such
as to satisfy the normal requirement of an identity of parties. That said, the legal materials
on the subject of cessions of rights, which have been debated between the Parties, are
directed to ensuring that arrangements for the way in which investments are held cannot be
used as a device for evading the jurisdictional requirements of either the ICSID Convention
or (as the case may be) a particular investment treaty. That is not the case here. The
jurisdictional link as between Mr Pey Casado and the Foundation, and the Republic of Chile,
has been definitively established by the First Award, and is res judicata; those persons or
entities continue to be the Parties under whose name the present proceedings are conducted,
and the Tribunal notes that the claim for moral damages, to which the Respondent has

referred, is in fact phrased as a claim “au titre de la réparation intégrale du préjudice moral

65

188.

subi par M. Victor Pey Casado et la Fondation espagnole du fait des violations de Il’ API par
la République du Chili” [emphasis added].*? There is no dispute that, whatever procedural
inexactitudes there may be in the formulation of some of the pleadings, the substance of the
arrangements in their actual operation is that Ms Pey Grebe, the daughter, acts in practice as
the legal representative of her aged father. It may be that the formulations used were
intended to signal to the Tribunal that counsel for the Claimants were in practice taking
detailed instructions from Ms Pey Grebe on her father’s behalf, rather than from Mr Pey
Casado in person; and, if so, the Tribunal can see nothing in the least improper about that.
By the same token, the Tribunal was gratified to note, in the Respondent’s written
pleadings,*” an indication that the Respondent too, for its part, would have no objection to
a practical arrangement of that kind in the particular circumstances of the case. The Tribunal

will accordingly proceed as set out in the next following paragraph.

The Tribunal is clear that the present proceedings are a continuation of the original
arbitration, such that the title and case reference remain unchanged, as do the Parties to the
proceedings. The only Claimants are therefore Mr Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation,
and the Respondent is the Republic of Chile. Such compensation as may be awarded
pursuant to the partial annulment will accordingly be awarded to these named Claimants,
and will be in respect of the injury suffered by these Claimants as the result of the breaches
identified, as res judicata, in the First Award. Ms Pey Grebe will be regarded as the
representative of Mr Pey Casado for all purposes relating to the award of such compensation.
Should the Tribunal decide that the compensation is to take a monetary form, the payment
over of the moneys due to each of the two entitled Claimants will be a matter for internal
arrangement between them in which their designated counsel will play their duly appointed
role as counsel to Ms Pey Grebe as well. On that basis, the Tribunal can now proceed to
analyse the admissibility of the claims for relief put forward by Mr Pey Casado and the

Foundation.

C. The Claimants’ Requests for Relief

189.

190.

191.

The Claimants’ requests for relief can be found at paragraph 514 of their Memorial. They
consist of seven claims for damages, or subsidiarily for unjust enrichment, which have
remained to all intents and purposes intact throughout the subsequent proceedings, although
they were subject to some further elaboration in the Reply Memorial. The first three claims
relate to compensation for the damage suffered as a result of the Respondent’s breaches of
Article 4 of the BIT, together with lost profits, or failing that for reimbursement of the unjust
enrichment enjoyed by the Respondent; the sums claimed are of the order of
US$330 millions or US$92 millions, both at 2014 values. The fourth head is a claim to
moral damages, in the order of something in excess of US$10 millions. The remaining three

heads are consequential claims to tax equalization, to interest, and for costs.

The claims to damages are, in other words, substantial. To understand the basis on which
the main claims are put forward, it will be most convenient to look first at the methods
adopted for their quantification in the expert report on which the Claimants rely and then to

the legal reasoning on which the Claimants seek to justify them.

The expert report by Mr Eduard Saura of Accuracy (who also testified orally at the hearing,
confirming his report**') states that it takes as its starting point the First Tribunal’s finding
of a breach by the Respondent of its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment and to
refrain from discrimination. It includes under the former a denial of justice by the
Respondent which deprived the Claimants of their possibility of obtaining indemnification
for the true value of their assets seized since the coup d’état in 1973. It computes this true
value by assessing the fair market value of the seized assets at the time of their seizure and
then uprating that to current values, in a manner said to be consistent with normal practice
in arbitration. The subsidiary method put forward in the alternative, under the rubric of
unjust enrichment, consists in cumulating the assessed amounts of the capital value of the

immovable properties expropriated by the Respondent, the rental income from those

%6! The report by Accuracy, and a supplementary report responding to the rebuttal report submitted by the
Respondent, were co-signed by Mr Christophe Schmit but, as Mr Saura appeared on his own to testify at the
hearing, the reports are referred to in his name alone; this is purely for convenience.

 

67

192.

properties since their seizure, and the asset value of the movable property that had been

seized together with the real property (notably the Goss printing press).

Mr Saura was not tasked with making an assessment of the claim to moral damages, which
in turn is not quantified by the Claimants themselves either, save simply to state minimum
figures in their Memorial and Reply Memorial (where the figures are amounts not less than
US$10 millions and US$500,000 claimed in respect of Mr Pey Casado and of the
Foundation). Mr Saura did not advance, either in his expert report or in his oral testimony
at the hearing, any other methodology for assessing the Claimants’ damages or compensation

for unjust enrichment.

D. The Admissibility of the Claimants’ Claims

193.

194.

195.

The Respondent, for its part, rejects the basis for each of the above, though on different
grounds in each case: as to the fair market value of the seized properties, the Respondent
says that this is no more and no less than reverting to the claims for expropriation which
were expressly rejected by the First Tribunal as outside its jurisdiction ratione temporis;, as
to the unjust enrichment alternative, the Respondent says once again that it harks back to the
original expropriation, although on a theory of ‘continuing expropriation’ which is equally
incompatible with the un-annulled portions of the First Award; and as to moral damage, the
Respondent says that (quite apart from the fact that the argumentation adduced links this yet
again to the original expropriation), the common understanding is that moral damage falls

outside the scope of ‘compensation’ of the kind provided for in the First Award.

The Tribunal is thus confronted with what amount to objections to the admissibility of all of
the main claims as formulated by the Claimants in their submissions, which it is therefore
appropriate to determine first, before proceeding to any consideration that may be necessary

of how the Claimants have themselves quantified these claims.

The Tribunal begins by recalling that the breaches found by the First Tribunal in its Award
(see paragraph 175 above) consist in a violation of ‘son obligation de faire bénéficier les
demanderesses d’un traitement juste et équitable, en ce compris celle de s’abstenir de tout

déni de justice’. In reaching this conclusion, the First Tribunal had already decided, in an

68

196.

earlier section of its First Award, that the substantive protections of the BIT did not extend
retroactively so as to cover the Claimants’ dispossession by the Respondent in the period
between 1973 and 1975: ‘[aJussi le Tribunal considére que I’ expropriation dont se plaignent
les demanderesses doit étre qualifiée d’ acte instantané, antérieur a la date d’ entrée en vigueur
de l’API. Cette analyse est conforme a la position de principe de la Cour européenne des
droits de homme qui considére I’ expropriation comme un acte instantané et qui ne crée pas
une situation continue de « privation d'un droit ».’* These findings were left untouched in
the decision on annulment. The ICSID Arbitration Rules explicitly prohibit the present
Tribunal from reconsidering them. None of this is contested between the Parties. It would
seem however, at first sight, to put an insuperable obstacle in the way of the Claimants now
advancing a claim to damage which in its essence goes back to that original dispossession,

by using the value of the then-expropriated property as its central element.

The Claimants’ answer to this objection is somewhat complex. In certain places, the
Claimants contend that elements of the non-annulled parts of the First Award need to be
revisited and modified by the present Tribunal. That would however (as already indicated)
be well beyond the Tribunal’s functions and powers under ICSID Arbitration Rule 55 and
will not be further considered in this Award. The main substance of the Claimants’ answer
is, however, different. It consists essentially in the contention that the central consequence
of the denial of justice found by the First Tribunal to exist, as a result of the delays in the
proceedings before the Santiago court over the Goss press, was that they (the Claimants)
were disabled from invoking a conclusive argument that Decree No. 165 was absolutely null
(ex tunc) and as such incapable of producing any legal effects. Had they been in a position
to do so, the argument continues, they (the Claimants) would either have been able to recover
their confiscated property in Chile, or at the least would have been able to establish before
the First Tribunal that the expropriation of this property was not an instantaneous act taking
final effect in 1975, but was not in fact completed until many years later, and the result of
that would have been that the expropriation did indeed fall under the jurisdiction of the First
Tribunal under the BIT, contrary to the findings in the First Award. From this it follows, so

the Claimants’ argument concludes, that the loss suffered by them arising out of the denial

3 See also paragraphs 610, 620, and 622 of the First Award.

69

of justice is the loss of that right to compensation in the original arbitration, so that such loss

is the one they can now claim in the present proceedings.

E. The Status of Decree No. 165

197.

198.

This might therefore be the convenient place for a brief excursus on the status of Decree
No. 165 under Chilean public law, a subject that absorbed an appreciable portion of the
argument between the Parties, both in the written phase and at the oral hearing. The burden
of the Claimants’ argument has already been given in paragraph 196 above. The Respondent
countered it with the evidence of an expert witness on Chilean law, in the person of
Dr Marcos Libedinsky Tschorne, formerly President of the Chilean Supreme Court and
Member of the Constitutional Court of Chile. His evidence was, in essence, that the better
view is that the absolute nullity of a legislative decree requires a judicial pronouncement to
that effect, that in any event there was no request for a declaration of nullity by the claimant
in the Goss press case, and finally that no such declaration of nullity can be inferred from
the terms of the Santiago court’s judgment of 2008 in that case. The Claimants produced
no expert witness of their own, contenting themselves with offering, through counsel (none
of them Chilean lawyers), their own interpretation of Chilean law, and casting aspersions on
Dr Libedinsky’s accuracy and bona fides. The Tribunal, for its part, can appreciate the good
sense in Dr Libedinsky’s explanation of the reasons why, both in logic and in the interests
of good administration, as serious a matter as the nullity ab initio of a legislative act should
presuppose an express judicial pronouncement to that effect, nor can it find any reason to
doubt either Dr Libedinsky’s good faith or his independence and objectivity. It takes note,
finally, of the complex formula in which the Claimants have clothed their proposition, i.e.
that a Chilean court ‘would be under the obligation to take note of the reality of the nullity
of Decree No. 165 ex tunc’, and finds in the very contorted shape of this proposition the

strong implication that it has more in it of the speculative than of the operational.

The above having been said, the Tribunal sees no need to go further into the matter as it has
concluded that, even if the Claimants were able to establish the proposition for which they
have been arguing, it would have no material bearing on these resubmission proceedings.

What the Claimants wish to argue is that, inasmuch as Decree No. 165 was never (so they

70

allege) a valid legal act, there never was a legally effective expropriation of the investment
at all, so that the legal ownership of E/ Clarin and the associated assets rested where it had
been in 1973 and 1975 (subject only to the subsequent cession to the Foundation). The main
difficulty resides, however, not in this proposition itself, as in the conclusions the Claimants
would seek to draw from it, so far as the remedies available in the present proceedings are
concerned. As the Tribunal sees it, there are only two: one is that the First Tribunal was
wrong in its finding that the expropriation was excluded ratione temporis from the scope of
the BIT; the other is that what amounted in effect (if not in form) to the expropriation took
place with Decision No. 43. Each of these has figured, in various forms, in the submissions
of the Claimants in the course of these resubmission proceedings. Both of them, however,
encounter insuperable difficulties. As to the first, the Tribunal is in no doubt that the First
Tribunal, although it used slightly different forms of words in different parts of its Award,
was of the view that the expropriation was completed (fait consommé) with the physical
seizure in 1975 and thus fell outside the scope of the BIT. More to the point, however, the
present Tribunal is simply not empowered to hear an appeal against that finding, or to
substitute a view of its own for that of the First Tribunal, or to award any relief of any kind
whatsoever on that account. As to the second (i.e. that the effective expropriation did not
take place until Decision No. 43), it is also in its turn incompatible with the First Tribunal’s
findings as to the chronology of the expropriation, but it is equally incompatible with
Decision No. 43 itself, the whole tenor of which is that it was an award of compensation in
respect of a confiscation that had already occurred The Tribunal’s final observation
before leaving the subject, is that, if the alleged nullity under Chilean law of Decision No. 43
did indeed have decisive significance, the consequence would surely be that the investment
continued to be, in law, the property of Mr Pey Casado and/or the Foundation — the remedy
for which could lie in the domestic sphere but clearly not before this Tribunal in these

resubmission proceedings.

At p. 3 of the Decision, it is noted expressly that ‘les biens identifiés ci-dessus furent confis:
application du D.L. No. 77 de 1973 ... lequel a dissous les sociétés considérées préte-noms de partis politiques
déterminés qui y étaient spécifiés, et a disposé de leurs biens.’

 

71

F. Compensation under the First Award and International Law

199.

200.

The Tribunal must revert at this point to the question raised earlier in this Award as to the
meaning of the word ‘compensation’ in the First Award. As the Tribunal pointed out above
in paragraphs 174 and following, the original and authentic text of the First Award is French,
and it establishes, in paragraph 3 of the dispositif, with the effect of res judicata, that the
Claimants ‘ont droit 4 compensation’. The Tribunal has given consideration to the question
whether this formulation should be understood to mean, in and of itself, that the Claimants
have an accrued right to monetary compensation, and that the only question remaining for
decision in these resubmission proceedings is the assessment of the appropriate amount of
such compensation. The Tribunal has however come to the conclusion that that would not

be the correct way to understand the meaning and effect of the First Award.

There are various reasons for this conclusion, which reinforce one another. One is that both
terms, the English as well as the French, have a broader dictionary connotation not restricted
to making good in a purely financial sense. Another is that, taken in its context, paragraph 3
of the dispositif plainly states only the general principle of reparation; but neither this
paragraph, nor paragraph 2 which precedes it, seeks to determine the nature of the injury or
damage caused by the Respondent’s breach, which would be the essential precursor for then
determining the kind as well as the extent of the reparation required to remedy the breach.
The Parties have expressed strongly divergent views on this question, which can best be
summarized through their responses to the question posed by the Tribunal during the oral
hearing, namely whether paragraph 3 should be regarded as having an independent meaning,
separate from paragraph 4, and whether the Tribunal should understand the term
‘compensation’ as referring only to monetary compensation, or more generally to the forms
of reparation recognized in international law in the case of international wrongs. The
response for the Claimants was that paragraph 4 represented the mere quantification of the
right to be compensated; but that, starting from the authentic French language text of the
First Award, the right to be compensated “exclusively refers to a financial notion, harm that
is quantifiable financially, and nothing else; for instance, reparation or satisfaction in public

>> 364

international law The Respondent, for its part, agreed with much of the Claimants’

36 Hearings, Day 4, pp. 26-27.

72

201.

202.

203.

answer, namely that paragraphs 3 and 4 do have independent meanings, that under paragraph
3 “Claimants are entitled to the form of reparation comprised by damages that are financially
assessable” but that this form of reparation, or other forms of reparation under international
law, “would be available so long as Claimants (1) establish causation — that is, establish the
necessary link between the BIT violation and the form of monetary damages they seek — and

(2) meet their burden of proving their specific monetary damages.”

The Tribunal takes note of these views, but does not subscribe fully to the reading that the
First Tribunal was using (to reprise the original French) the term compensation in
paragraph 3 as a specific, limiting term of art, intended to be differentiated from the more
general indemnisation or réparation. The Tribunal sees in the First Award no sign that the
First Tribunal was setting out to make a conceptually systematic usage of these various terms
that would justify treating paragraph 3 as a deliberate determination that monetary damages
must necessarily follow (provided of course that their amount was properly established).
Taking the paragraph in its context, the Tribunal reads paragraph 3 as stating the entitlement
to reparation that necessarily follows from the determination of the breach of an international
obligation, but without predetermining what form or nature that reparation must take, except
perhaps the non-explicit assumption that in the normal case it may take the form of monetary
damages. But it does not read the paragraph as absolving a party claiming monetary

damages from its normal obligation to prove such damage, including its causation.*°

It remains, then, for this Tribunal to determine what nature and form of ‘compensation’ is
thus due, in the wake of the annulment of the First Tribunal’s assessment, as laid down in
paragraph 4 on the basis of the reasoning in the corresponding part (Section VIII) of the First
Award.

To do this, the Tribunal must apply, in the absence of any specific rules in the BIT, the

applicable rules of general international law.

204. Both sides have invoked in this respect the provisions of Part Two of the Articles on

Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts drawn up by the International
Law Commission (ILC) and commended to States by the UN General Assembly in
Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001. As stated in Article 31, the principal obligation of
the responsible State is “to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally
wrongful act.” The Article goes on to specify that ‘injury’ in this context includes “any
damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.”
In the Commentary to this Article, the ILC indicates that it based itself on the classic
formulations given by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the Factory at
Chorzéw case, according to which the responsible State must endeavour to “wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability,
have existed if that act had not been committed.” Both sides in the present proceedings
have, once again, relied on this dictum and discussed its application to the circumstances of
the case. The Tribunal, for its part, notes that what both the PCIJ, and the ILC in turn, had
in their direct contemplation was the legal consequences of an internationally wrongful ‘act’
— as opposed to the more complex situation here, which (as indicated above) is one in which
the breach is constituted not by a single act but by a course of conduct.*” It notes, secondly,
that the operation of the primary rule enunciated by the ILC depends upon injury, and that
injury in turn depends on causation; both of these terms, ‘injury’ and ‘causation’, appear in
each of the two paragraphs of Article 31. It becomes necessary, therefore, for the Tribunal
to isolate what conduct was held by the First Tribunal to constitute in the present case the
‘wrongful act’, and then to determine, in the light of the submissions of the opposing Parties,

how the rule reflected in Article 31 is to be applied to that set of circumstances.

G. The Burden of Proving Damage

205.

It is a basic tenet of investment arbitration that a claimant must prove its pleaded loss, must
show, in other words, what alleged injury or damage was caused by the breach of its legal

rights. This is partly a consequence of the general principle in international judicial

  

67 The ILC does foresee, in draft Article 15, a breach brought about by a composite act, though in the context
of when the breach is deemed to occur; there is no reason to think, however, that Article 31 does not also apply
mutatis mutandis to composite acts.

74

206.

proceedings that each party bears the burden of establishing the allegations on which it relies.
The International Court of Justice refers to this as a well-established rule which has been

consistently upheld by the Court.*°

The same rule has regularly been followed by
investment tribunals. But equally it follows directly from the principles of State
responsibility in international law reflected in Article 31 of the ILC Articles, under which
the duty to make reparation is ‘for the injury caused by’ the internationally wrongful act;
and ‘injury’ for these purposes is damage ‘caused by’ the internationally wrongful act.
The International Law Commission explains that this definition is deliberately limitative,
excluding merely abstract concerns or general interests, and further that material damage has

to be understood as damage which is assessable in financial terms.*”°

Tt is thus axiomatic that this Tribunal (like the First Tribunal before it) is only competent to
award reparation in the form of financial compensation to the extent that it has been duly
established before it that the compensation represents a fair assessment of the alleged
damage suffered by the Claimants that has actually been caused by the Respondent’s breach

of its international obligation towards them under the BIT.*7!

H. The Interpretation of the First Award

207.

Although, as already indicated, the Tribunal is required under the ICSID Arbitration Rules,
in these resubmission proceedings, to refrain from reconsidering any portion of the First

Award that had not been annulled, this does not, in the Tribunal’s opinion, prevent the

present Tribunal from proceeding to an interpretation of the First Award for the purposes of
carrying out its mandate under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.
Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise; the essence of the Tribunal’s mandate consists in giving
effect, in the light of the arguments marshalled by the Parties, to certain paragraphs in the
dispositif of the First Award, and this the Tribunal can hardly do without first understanding
what those paragraphs mean. In other words, the Tribunal construes the injunction under
ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) not to ‘reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled’
as laying down that the resubmission tribunal may not re-open such un-annulled portions or
the reasoning on which they are based, but not as excluding the effort to arrive at a correct
understanding of the meaning of the un-annulled portions for the purpose of putting them
properly into effect. This interpretation of ICSID Rule 55(3) seems logically necessary, and
is supported by the French text of the Rule, which employs the term ‘nouvel examen’ to
describe what a new tribunal may not do. The Tribunal will accordingly proceed to consider
what meaning should properly be attributed to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the dispositif of the
First Award, notably the First Tribunal’s finding in paragraph 2 that the Respondent “a violé
son obligation de faire bénéficier les demanderesses d’un traitement juste et équitable, en ce
compris celle de s’abstenir de tout déni de justice” to remedy which “les demanderesses ont
droit 4 compensation” under paragraph 3. This is the question which lies at the heart of

these resubmission proceedings.

The question is nevertheless not without some considerable difficulty. It has occupied a
large part of the argumentation of both Parties; and the Tribunal has some sympathy with
the problems the Parties have faced over what exactly the First Tribunal should be
understood as having meant with its findings recited above. Having given the most careful
consideration to the submissions made to it by all of the Parties, the Tribunal arrives finally

at the following answer.

The first point, in the Tribunal’s view, is that the breach of the BIT established in paragraph 2
is a single composite breach. Although, as will appear, the breach was the product of more
than one item of conduct (action or omission) attributable to the Respondent, they amount
in the aggregate to the failure to accord to the investor the ‘fair and equitable treatment’

required under the BIT. There is nothing uncommon in this; on the contrary, it corresponds

76

210.

to the typical case in investment protection, since the entire concept of ‘treatment’ is one that
can and often does envisage something in the nature of a course of action. That this was the
understanding of the First Tribunal is clear from the language used (“de faire bénéficier les
demanderesses d’un traitement juste et équitable’”) and in particular from the words that
follow: “en ce compris celle de s’abstenir de tout déni de justice.” It is clearer still from
the First Tribunal’s reasoning in paragraph 623 of its Award: “[e]n réalité, la seule
qualification susceptible d’étre retenue serait celle d’un acte composite comprenant une série
d’atteintes au traitement juste et équitable de l’investissement des parties demanderesses,
résidant essentiellement dans la Décision n°43 et le déni de justice allégué qui lui est lié
concernant la rotative Goss.” This establishes plainly, for example, that there was no
separate breach consisting of a denial of justice, but that all of the failings identified by the
First Tribunal, including the denial of justice, amount together, globally, to a failure to accord
fair and equitable treatment, and thus constitute a breach of the BIT. It follows that it is this
single composite breach which gives rise to the ‘right to compensation’ laid down in

paragraph 3.

It is not in dispute between the Parties that the two passages in which the First Tribunal
determines conduct by the Respondent falling short of the requirements of Article 4 of the
BIT are to be found at paragraphs 653 — 674 of its First Award. As the ad hoc Committee

puts the matter in its Decision on Annulment, citing the First Award:

57. Le raisonnement et la conclusion du Tribunal en ce qui concerne la violation par le Chili de
l'article 4 de l’API sont bien illustrés par les paragraphes suivants de la Sentence. Le Comité
les reprend in extenso :

653. La question se pose en particulier de savoir si le comportement des autorités chiliennes,
législatives, administratives et judiciaires, peut ou non étre considéré comme constituant un
« déni de justice » et une violation du devoir d’accorder 4 l'investissement étranger une
protection suffisante, soit plus précisément, un « traitement juste et équitable » au sens de
l'article 4 (1) de l’ API ainsi congu : « Chaque Partie garantira dans son territoire, en accord
avec sa législation nationale, un traitement juste et équitable aux investissements réalisés
par des investisseurs de |’ autre Partie, sous des conditions non moins favorables que pour
ses investisseurs nationaux ».

et équitable » n’appellent pas de longue analyse. Elles se laissent résumer a deux questions
relativement simples :

* La premiére est celle de savoir si l’absence de toute décision par les juridictions
chiliennes pendant une période de sept années (1995-2002), d’une part, et l’absence de
réponse de la Présidence aux requétes de M. Pey Casado, d’ autre part, sont constitutives
d’un déni de justice.

* La seconde est celle de savoir si les investissements reconnus par le Tribunal arbitral
comme ayant été faits par M. Pey Casado ont bénéficiés du « traitement juste et
équitable » prescrit par I’ API.

659. Sur la premiére question, la réponse ne peut étre que positive, au regard des faits établis
et déja retenus par le Tribunal arbitral, l’absence de toute décision par les tribunaux civils
chiliens sur les prétentions de M. Pey Casado s’analysant en un déni de justice. [...]

665. Sur la seconde question, celle de savoir si les investissements des demanderesses ont
bénéficié d’un traitement juste et équitable, une réponse négative s’impose de I’avis du
Tribunal arbitral, compte tenu des conclusions auxquelles il est parvenu précédemment aux
termes de son appréciation des preuves et de son analyse juridique. En bref, il s’agit de la
conclusion selon laquelle M. Pey Casado a bien démontré avoir procédé 4 des
investissements et étre propriétaire de biens meubles ou immeubles qui ont été confisqués
par l’autorité militaire chilienne.

L.]

674. Dans le cas d’espéce, en résumé, en accordant des compensations — pour des raisons
qui lui sont propres et sont restées inexpliquées - 4 des personnages qui, de l’avis du
Tribunal arbitral, n’étaient pas propriétaires des biens confisqués, en méme temps qu’ elle
paralysait ou rejetait les revendications de M. Pey Casado concernant les biens confisqués,
la République du Chili a manifestement commis un déni de justice et refusé de traiter les
demanderesses de fagon juste et équitable.

These paragraphs in the First Award were not annulled by the ad hoc Committee and
constitute res judicata. What the Committee did annul was the defective method by which
the First Tribunal arrived at the compensation due for the breach so found. For all that the
present Tribunal finds difficulty in extracting precisely what consequences the First Tribunal
regarded as flowing from the findings in paragraphs 659, 665, and 674 just cited, it is not
empowered or permitted to reopen the matter or to substitute its own conclusions for those
of the First Tribunal. Its mandate is limited (see above) to identifying the injury proven to
have been caused to the Claimants by the above breach, and then determining the appropriate

reparation for it in accordance with international law.

The Tribunal finds it instructive to begin this process by revisiting the method adopted by

the First Tribunal and the reasons why this was annulled by the ad hoc Committee. So far

78

as the present Tribunal can judge (drawing also on the Decision of the ad hoc Committee),

the process followed by the First Tribunal consisted of the following steps:

e the existence of injury resulting from the original expropriation of the investment
required no demonstration, since the Respondent had fixed its quantum in order to

award it to persons other than the Claimants;

e the Claimants had not produced any proof, or at least any convincing proof, of any
kind for the existence of damage caused by the facts falling within the competence of

the First Tribunal ratione temporis;

e in the absence of proof, and the unavailability in the circumstances of alternative
expert evidence, the First Tribunal was empowered to make its own evaluation by
reference to “objective elements” given that a quantum had been fixed by the

Respondent (see above);

e this evaluation could not be of the damage suffered by reason of the original
expropriation, but had instead to be of the damage resulting from the breach of the

guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT;

e the object was to put the Claimants into the position they would have been in if the
authorities of the Respondent had compensated the Claimants instead of third persons
who (in the judgement of the First Tribunal) were not the owners of the assets in

question; and

e it followed therefore that the amount awarded to these third persons was the correct

measure of the damages.

213. The Tribunal passes then to the reasons why this analysis was found faulty, and in

consequence annulled, by the ad hoc Committee.

214. The ad hoc Committee begins by saying that, having reviewed the entire record, it can only
conclude that the Parties never pleaded the damages claims arising from the breaches of

Article 4 of the BIT (the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment). It goes on to conclude

79

215.

that the Parties had no fair opportunity to discuss the remedy for breach of Article 4. This
constituted grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. The ad
hoc Committee further expresses its agreement with the Respondent’s submission that the
First Tribunal ended up, in its own conclusions, going beyond the standard it had itself
established, i.e. placing the Claimants in the position they would have been but for the
breaches of the BIT, because in fact it left them far better off. It further concludes that when
the First Tribunal adopted the expropriation-based calculation of damages used by the
Chilean authorities, this contradicted the Tribunal’s own determination that this basis of
calculation was irrelevant, and that the allegations, discussion and evidence related to such
damages could not be considered; this contradiction set up a manifest inconsistency within
the terms of the First Tribunal’s Award and constituted grounds for annulment under

Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.

Tt will thus be evident that the First Tribunal’s method of arriving at the compensation due
for the breach of the BIT was found faulty, and annulled, on two separate grounds, one of
procedure and one of substance. The procedural ground was the failure to allow the Parties
(and in particular, one must assume, the Respondent) to be heard; the substantial ground
was that the method which the First Tribunal decided of its own motion to adopt, in order to
remedy the breach, stood in direct contradiction to its findings on the nature of the breach
itself. Given that the first of these defects has been expunged in the present resubmission
proceedings, by the full and comprehensive opportunities offered to both Claimants and
Respondent to advance their arguments on damages as recorded above, the Tribunal will
focus its attention on the second, with the essential aim of ensuring that its findings in respect
of compensation follow from, and do not contradict, the findings of the First Tribunal on the
nature of the breach, as recorded in the First Award. The Tribunal might, in addition,
register at this point that there is a further criticism that might potentially have been levelled
against the annulled portions of the First Award, namely the way in which they tend to elide
the distinction between injury (and the associated question of causation) and the assessment
of the compensation due for that injury. As indicated above (see paragraph 204 above), this
distinction is fundamental to the operation of Article 31 of the ILC Articles. The point was
no doubt irrelevant in the context of the annulment proceedings once the ad hoc Committee
had in any event determined that the relevant parts of the First Award were to be annulled

80

216.

217.

on other grounds. But it is a point that must stay in the forefront of the present Tribunal’s
consideration as it approaches the question of compensation afresh, on the basis of the First

Tribunal’s un-annulled findings in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the dispositif of its Award.

The Tribunal should also interpolate at this point that part of the argument addressed to it by
the Claimants in these resubmission proceedings was to the effect that the actions of the
Respondent, since the handing down of the First Award, constituted a new denial of justice
for which compensation is due, and can be awarded in these resubmission proceedings. This
is an argument that the Tribunal must reject outright. The reason is not only that allegations
of that kind would have to be subjected to a proper process of evidence and proof before
they could properly come to decision in an arbitral process (which indeed they would); it is
quite simply that the entire argument falls plainly outside the jurisdiction of the present
Tribunal, which (as already indicated) is limited, under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention
and Rule 55 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, exclusively to ‘the dispute’ or such parts of it
as remain in being after the annulment. That can only be taken to refer to ‘the dispute’ that
had been submitted to arbitration in the first place, the critical date for which was the
Claimants’ original request for arbitration. Issues arising between the Parties after that date
—and still more so issues arising out of post-Award conduct — cannot by any stretch of the
imagination fall within the scope of resubmission proceedings under the provisions cited

above, and the Tribunal sees no need to say more about the matter in this Award.

To recapitulate therefore: the assessment of the reparation due under international law for
the breach of an international obligation consists of three steps — the establishment of the
breach, followed by the ascertainment of the injury caused by the breach, followed by the
determination of the appropriate compensation for that injury. The three-stage process can
be seen with particular clarity where, as in the present case, the claims are for monetary
damages.*” Since the first stage, the establishment of breach, has already been determined
with binding effect by the First Award, the Tribunal can begin with the second, the
ascertainment of the injury caused by the breach. In doing so, however, it notes that the

First Tribunal has established the breach negatively as well as positively. That is to say, it

paragraph 690 of its Award; see fn. 364 above.

is res judicata both (positively) that the breach consists in the composite failure to accord
fair and equitable treatment (including the avoidance of denial of justice), and also
(negatively) that the expropriation of the original investment is outside the temporal scope
of the BIT, so that all evidence and argument related to that expropriation is to be excluded

as not relevant to the dispute other than as background facts.

The Tribunal starts with the fact that the injury in question has to be that caused by the
specific breach. Causation is of the essence. What must be proven is both the existence of
an injury to the claimant and that that particular injury is the sufficiently proximate
consequence of the specific breach.*”* On the basis of the somewhat incomplete indications
which the First Tribunal offers in its Award, the Parties have argued the matter in front of

the present Tribunal as follows.

374 the first of which

For the Claimants, the argument comes in two alternative versions,
separates into two parts. The first part has it that the consequence of the excessive delay in
the Goss press proceedings before the Santiago court was that it prevented the Claimants
from demonstrating to the First Tribunal that the Decree expropriating the El Clarin
investment was absolutely null from the outset (ex func). Had the Claimants been in a
position to do so, the argument continues, they would have been able to convince the First
Tribunal that the expropriation was not in fact un fait consommé in the 1970s, and the First
Tribunal would in consequence have decided that there was a continuing expropriation
extending beyond the entry into force of the BIT for which the Claimants were indeed

entitled to compensation under the BIT.

In its second part, the Claimants’ argument is that, had the authorities of the Respondent not
insisted on pressing ahead with Decision No. 43 in the domestic restitution proceedings, by
which compensation for the expropriation was awarded to other persons while the original
arbitration was in train, it would still have been open to the Claimants to avail themselves of

other potential remedies under Chilean law; in other words, the injury the Claimants suffered

ed., 1987), pp. 241-253.

221.

222.

from the discrimination as established by the First Tribunal was the loss of the right to
recover, however belatedly, compensation for the expropriation, since the Chilean legal
system would not have been able to accommodate the concept of a second compensation for

a wrong that had already been compensated once.*”>

The alternative argument on behalf of the Claimants is that, whatever the difficulties lying
in the way of establishing a directly compensable injury, the loss suffered by the Claimants
and the benefit that accrued to the Respondent can be seen as the two sides of a zero-sum
game. The consequence would be that the injury to the Claimants and its monetary
evaluation are simply established by calculating the enrichment flowing to the Respondent

(sc. arising out of the continuing and uncompensated expropriation).*”°

The Respondent has interposed a series of objections to these various alternative arguments
by the Claimants. At the heart of the Respondent’s objections lies the repeated assertion
that all of the Claimants’ submissions, in one way or another, represent attempts to reinstate
their original claim for the expropriation of El Clarin, despite the fact that it was definitively
rejected by the First Tribunal as lying outside its jurisdiction under the BIT. In addition,

and more specifically, the Respondent contends:

e that the length of the Goss press case in the Santiago court could not have been the
cause of any relevant injury to the Claimants, both because the value of the press
became part of the Claimants’ expropriation case in the original arbitration, and
because the only bearing which the proceedings in that case was asserted to have on
the Arbitration was via the Claimants’ theory as to the nullity ex tunc of Decree

No. 165, which leads back in turn to the rejected expropriation claim;

e that the Claimants likewise suffered no direct, or financially assessable, injury as a
result of Decision No. 43, and that such disadvantage as the Claimants suffered was

the direct consequence of their own voluntary decision not to participate in the

224.

domestic compensation scheme.*””

In order to decide between these competing submissions, the Tribunal needs itself to revisit
the First Award, in its annulled as well as its un-annulled portions. The key passages for
this purpose are paragraphs 600/610/615; 601-603; 608; 620-623/652; 629/633; 635-636;
645; 658/659/665; 666/669; and 670/674. All of these paragraphs fall within the un-
annulled portions of the First Award and are thus res judicata. The Tribunal takes account
as well of paragraphs 675, 677, and 680, which, although they form part of Section VIII of
the First Award, and therefore stand annulled, nevertheless illuminate the reasoning of the

First Tribunal in the un-annulled portions of its Award.

In paragraphs 600 and 610, together with paragraph 615, the First Tribunal finds that the
expropriation of E/ Clarin under Decree No. 165 was not a continuing breach and therefore
lay outside the protection of the BIT ratione temporis, by contrast with Decision No. 43 and
the claimed denial of justice, and that “le fait illicite composite invoqué par les parties
demanderesses n’existe pas en l’espéce”; in paragraphs 601-603, it rejects the argument to
the contrary raised by the Claimants on the basis of their claim that Decree No. 165 was
invalid ab initio and that a decision of the Chilean Supreme Court could be applied by
analogy; in paragraph 608, it holds that the expropriation “était consommeée” on the date of

Decree No. 165 “quelle que soit l’appréciation que l’on peut porter sur sa licéité”; in
paragraph 620, it holds that the expropriation was not merely “un fait consommé” but also
“distinct des violations postérieures a l’entrée en vigueur de |’ API [=BIT] dont font état les
demanderesses”; in paragraph 621, it decides that the initial refusals of Mr Pey Casado’s
requests for compensation were not in themselves contrary to the BIT, since the sole right of
compensation subsequent to the BIT was that brought into being by the Chilean legislation
in 1998. In paragraphs 622-623, the Tribunal holds that Decision No. 43, which had to be
understood as a discriminatory application of a post-BIT law and the rights created under

that law, was “une question distincte et non pas ...un fait identique 4 l’expropriation

577 See paragraph 139 above, and Exh. R-1, Letter from Me Garcés to the Chilean Minister of National Assets,
24 June 1999, pp. 3-4, concluding: “Que eu égard A ce qui vient d’étre dit je vous signifie que la présente partie
ne vas pas invoquer la Loi 19.568.”.

 

84

225.

susceptible de former l’un des ingrédients du fait composite allégué” and that the only
admissible analysis was that of “un acte composite comprenant une série d’atteintes au
traitement juste et équitable de l’investissement des parties demanderesses, résidant
essentiellement dans la Décision no 43 et le déni de justice allégué qui lui est lié concernant
la rotative Goss” — this last being complemented by the holding in paragraph 652 that the
discrimination alleged under Decision No. 43, as well as the alleged denial of justice, were
to be assessed against Article 4 of the BIT, since the application of Articles 3 and 5 was

incompatible with the Tribunal’s rejection of the ‘continuing act’ thesis.

When it moves on, against that background, to assessing the claims that do fall within the
scope of the BIT, the First Tribunal decides, in paragraph 629, that the first potential breach
concerned the compensation under Decision No. 43 of persons who were not the owners,
and in paragraph 633, that the second potential breach concerned the absence of a decision
by the Chilean courts on the restitution of the Goss press; in paragraphs 635-636, it notes as
matters of fact that the Claimants undertook several attempts, all without success, to establish
before the Chilean authorities incompatibilities between Decision No. 43 and the domestic
court proceedings over the Goss press; and in paragraph 645, it summarizes the position as
being that the Claimants’ allegations of ‘denial of justice’ took various forms and had various
very different factual bases. The decision therefore reduces itself, so the First Tribunal holds
in paragraph 658, to two relatively simple questions, namely whether the absence of a
decision from the Chilean courts for a period of seven years, coupled with the lack of
response by the Presidency to Mr Pey Casado’s requests, constituted a denial of justice, and
secondly whether the investments that had been recognized by the First Tribunal as having
been made by Mr Pey Casado had enjoyed the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ prescribed by
the BIT. To the first of these two questions, the First Tribunal responds, in paragraph 659,
that, on the established facts and the legal precedents, the delay of seven years had to be
adjudged a denial of justice; and to the second, in paragraph 665, that, given that it had been
established that Mr Pey Casado was the owner of the confiscated properties, these
investments had not enjoyed fair and equitable treatment; this was on the basis (paragraph
666) that the Chilean authorities were aware of Mr Pey Casado’s claims and of a judicial
decision recognizing his ownership and that it had never been shown with any degree of
credibility (paragraph 669) that his role was limited to that of intermediary or nominee for

85

226.

227.

228.

the true owners; moreover, it was firmly established in international jurisprudence that
discriminatory treatment of foreign investors is a breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable

treatment under bilateral investment treaties.

And then finally, against that background, the First Tribunal decides, in paragraph 674,

Dans le cas d’espéce, en résumé, en accordant des compensations — pour des raisons qui lui sont
propres et sont restées inexpliquées — 4 des personnages qui, de l’avis du Tribunal arbitral,
n étaient pas propriétaires des biens confisqués, en méme temps qu’ elle paralysait ou rejetait les
revendications de M. Pey Casado concernant les biens confisqués, la République du Chili a
manifestement commis un déni de justice et refusé de traiter les demanderesses de fagon juste
et équitable.

All these paragraphs come from the un-annulled part of the First Award. The present
Tribunal completes this summary of the key passages in the First Award by noting in
addition (though on the basis indicated in paragraph 223 above) the First Tribunal’s
indication (paragraph 675) of its finding that Mr Pey Casado was the owner of the
confiscated property, and its indication (paragraph 677) of the recognition by the Chilean
State of the illegality of the original confiscation and the accompanying duty to provide
compensation, disputing only to whom it should be paid. The Tribunal notes also, though
on a somewhat different, and non-factual level, the First Tribunal’s holding, in
paragraph 680, that the existence of damage “résultant de la confiscation” [emphasis added]
follows automatically by itself, as well as from the decision (sc. Decision No. 43) to award

compensation in favour of other persons.

The present Tribunal draws the following conclusions from the above, which represent its
interpretation of the res judicata portions of the First Award for the purposes of carrying out
its own mandate of deciding on the “compensation” due under paragraph 3 of the dispositif

of the First Award for the breach determined in paragraph 2 thereof:

a) that the original expropriation of E/ Clarin and the related assets belonging to Mr Pey
Casado was consummated in 1975 and consequently lies outside the scope of the BIT;
that all arguments based on or arising out of the expropriation may not be taken into
consideration, except in so far as they constitute factual background to matters that are
properly within the scope of the dispute under the BIT; and that the Claimants’ theory

of a ‘continuing act’ linking post-BIT conduct to pre-BIT conduct must be rejected;

86

229.

230.

b) that the issues properly within the scope of the dispute under the BIT, namely the
Claimants’ allegations of breach of Article 4 of the BIT (fair and equitable treatment)
resulting from the delays in the Goss press litigation and from Decision No. 43, are

distinct, both factually and legally, from the original expropriation; and

c) that there was a breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4,
which consisted of the totality of the conduct of the Chilean authorities resulting in the
seven-year delay in the Goss press litigation and Decision No. 43, and manifested itself
in the award of compensation to persons who were not the owners of the assets

confiscated while Mr Pey Casado’s claims were rejected.

The Tribunal believes this analysis to be entirely consistent with the findings of the ad hoc
Committee in its Annulment Decision, notably its paragraph 261, in which the ad hoc
Committee draws from the First Award the holdings by the First Tribunal that the Claimants’
arguments as to damages were strictly limited to ones founded on the expropriation; that
these were not relevant to the claims for denial of justice and discrimination; and that the
Claimants had not produced any convincing proof of damage in respect of these claims. The
same is true of paragraphs 282-285 of the Annulment Decision, in which the ad hoc
Committee stigmatizes the First Tribunal’s use of the amount awarded to the third parties by

Decision No. 43 as a contradiction of the reasoning summarized above.

The consequence of this interpretation of the First Award is, in the opinion of the Tribunal,

as follows:

a) that, beyond its description, in somewhat Delphic terms, of what constituted the breach
of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment, the First Tribunal made no finding as to

what injury was caused to the Claimants by that breach or its constitutive elements;
b) that it remains therefore outstanding to determine the nature and extent of that injury;

c) that, having failed to meet the corresponding burden of proof in the original arbitration,

the burden rested with the Claimants to do so now in these resubmission proceedings;

87

231.

d) that any assessment of injury and damage based on the original expropriation is

inconsistent with the First Award and must therefore be rejected.

The question remaining for the Tribunal, and it is the central question in these resubmission
proceedings, is whether, and to what extent, the Claimants have met that burden of proving
what injury was caused to either or both of them by the Respondent’s breach of the standard
of fair and equitable treatment in the BIT, and then of establishing the corresponding

assessable damage in financial terms.

I. Have the Claimants met the Burden of Proving Injury?

232. Once the question is reduced to the terms in the preceding paragraph, it becomes plain that

233.

the Claimants have not met this burden; indeed, it could be said that in some senses they
have not even set out to do so, in as much as they have focussed their submissions on the
evaluation of damage, without undertaking the prior step of showing the precise nature of
the injury, causation and damage itself. The Respondent submits that, in truth, if one
focusses on the actual breach (and its component parts) established by the First Award, the
Claimants have suffered no demonstrable material damage at all. None from the Goss press
case, because what was sought in that case was restitution of the press or compensation for
its confiscation, which was in due course rolled into the extended version of the Claimants’
claims in the original arbitration, and was rejected by the First Tribunal as outside the scope
of the BIT; and none from Decision No. 43, because the Claimants could not possibly have
benefited from a compensation process in which they had deliberately and explicitly elected
not to participate (on account of the fork-in-the-road clause in the BIT). Or the Respondent
puts the matter a different way, by submitting that, if the Claimants could be assumed to
have suffered some damage, the proximate cause of the damage was the Claimants’ own
actions, thus breaking the chain of causation required for the award of financial

compensation under the ILC’s draft Articles 31 and 36.

The Tribunal finds much merit in the Respondent’s submissions. It is not, however, required
to pronounce formally on them; given the Claimants’ failure to address their own burden of

proof, there is no prima facie case for the Respondent, as the opposing party, to rebut.

88

234.

The Tribunal has therefore no option but to find that the Claimants have failed to prove any
material injury caused to either of them as the sufficiently direct result of the Respondent’s
breach of Article 4 of the BIT. The Tribunal cannot therefore, on principle, make any award

of damages.

J. Have the Claimants Met the Burden of Proving Quantifiable Loss?

235.

236.

Given its finding in paragraph 234 above, the Tribunal can dispose of this question shortly
by saying that, in the absence of any sufficient proof of injury or damage caused to the
Claimants by the breach of the BIT established in the First Award, the question of the
assessment or quantification of that damage does not arise. The Tribunal has accordingly
no need to analyse in further detail the expert reports of Mr Saura for the Claimants and
Mr Kaczmarek for the Respondent, although it would like to register its appreciation for the
reports and oral testimony of both expert witnesses, which was of material assistance in

clarifying the issues before the Tribunal in these proceedings.*”*

The Tribunal adds — though this is necessarily obiter — that, had the matter arisen for
decision, it would have been disposed to accept the Respondent’s objection to the
admissibility of all those parts of the Claimants’ damages submissions which were based
directly or implicitly on the expropriation value of the original investment, as diametrically
inconsistent with the res judicata portions of the First Award and the Annulment Decision

of the ad hoc Committee.

K. The Unjust Enrichment Claim

237.

238.

As already indicated, the Claimants put forward at various stages of their written argument
a claim to monetary compensation based on unjust enrichment. Unjust enrichment also

features in the expert Report of Mr Saura as an alternative basis for his calculation of damage.

There are two possible ways of analysing the unjust enrichment claim. One is to regard it

as a freestanding claim in its own right. This is how the Tribunal interprets paragraph 380

38 For similar reasons, the Tribunal has no reason to pursue further the issue as to taxation reserved as noted
in paragraph 117 above.

89

239.

240.

of the Claimants’ Reply, which is based on the simple allegation that, through its possession
and use of the confiscated assets, the Respondent has been enriched ‘sans juste cause’ to the
detriment of the Claimant investors, which gives rise in and of itself to an obligation to
disgorge the assets and the fruits of their use. The Respondent counters that this is
tantamount to de-linking the claim from the BIT entirely, since it would result in awarding
compensation without any prior finding of breach from which the injury to be compensated
flowed. The Respondent adds that this interpretation of the Claimants’ argument is shown
by the way in which paragraph 380 is expressly linked to the ‘hypothése’ (although it is one
the Claimants reject) of the absence of any of the circumstances which generate liability for

breach of the BIT.

In the view of the Tribunal, the Respondent is correct on this point. As demonstrated above,
the operative finding of liability is already fixed for all purposes by the (un-annulled)
paragraph 2 of the dispositif of the First Award, and the right to compensation (‘droit a
compensation’) specified in paragraph 3 can only properly be understood as referring to
compensation for the injury suffered from the breach identified in paragraph 2. This reading
of these two paragraphs — both of them res judicata — is what logic demands; and it is also
consistent with the entire tenor both of the First Tribunal’s own assessment of compensation
that follows, and of the ad hoc Committee’s criticism of that assessment in its Decision.

This version of the unjust enrichment claim must therefore be rejected.

The alternative way of looking at the unjust enrichment claim would be to regard it as no
more than a method, a technique, for arriving at an acceptable quantification of a right to
compensation established by other means. This corresponds, as the Tribunal understands
it, to the methods through which Mr Saura conceived the calculations contained in his
Report. Expert valuations of damage are, however, essentially secondary, or derivative; it
is not simply a question of whether the calculation correctly values what it sets out to
measure, but also (at the primary level) whether it is setting out to measure the right thing.
The Respondent is critical of Mr Saura’s calculations at both the primary and the secondary
level. Specifically, the Respondent contends that, whatever the merits or demerits of
Mr Saura’s particular calculations, they all fall at the hurdle that they are nothing more than

alternative approaches to measuring the capital value of the confiscated assets and the profits

90

from their use, which would only be admissible in the presence of a valid expropriation
claim.*”” Once again, the Tribunal accepts this criticism. A claim for the expropriation of
El Clarin and associated assets is precluded, with the effect of res judicata, by the First
Award and the Decision on Annulment; the only compensation open to be awarded in these
resubmission proceedings is for the particular breaches established by paragraph 2 of the
dispositif of the First Award which, as the Tribunal has concluded above**’ may not be used

as a cloak for reintroducing under another guise the precluded expropriation claim.

L. The Moral Damage Claim

241.

242.

243.

In addition to the claim for compensation for material damage, the Claimants put forward in
these proceedings, as in the original proceedings before the First Tribunal, a claim to moral
damages on behalf of Mr Pey Casado and separately of the Foundation. The claim was
absent from the request for resubmission, but in the subsequent procedure appeared as

follows.

In the Claimants’ Memorial, the claim was linked to Mr Pey Casado’s treatment at the time
of the coup d’état, his exile abroad, and a subsequent campaign of denigration; it was linked

381 The claim

also to the Respondent’s conduct in the original arbitration and subsequently.
is repeated in the Reply, with additional authority on the question of proof, and a final
suggestion that, if the Tribunal was not ready to grant compensation for moral damage, it
should at least bring the corresponding facts into play in order to enhance the amount of the
assessed material and financial damage.**?_ These submissions were developed to a limited

extent during the oral hearing.

In the view of the Tribunal, two facts stand out from this summary account. The first is that
no attempt was made to advance, or to justify, a specific claim that moral damage had been
suffered by the Foundation; this claim can therefore immediately be set aside, without any

further investigation as to whether moral damages are in fact available to corporate or like

38! See paragraph 76 above.
82 OR, paras. 476-488.

91

entities, as opposed to natural persons. The second is that the claim to damage caused by
the Respondent’s conduct in the arbitral proceedings must also fall in imine, for the reasons
given in paragraph 216 above. But the most decisive factor of all is that a claim to damages
of a moral character does not escape the burden of proof resting on a claimant, as described
in paragraphs Error! Reference source not found.-206 above. The Tribunal notes, in this
context, the clear expression of view by the First Tribunal on two occasions, at paragraphs
689 and 704 of the First Award, that the Claimants had simply failed to meet this burden,
and that a mere likelihood that damage might have been suffered does not suffice.
Admittedly, both paragraphs fall within Section VIII of the First Award, but, as they relate
to matters of factual evidence and proof, they are not tainted by the criticisms of the ad hoc
Committee relating to the assessment of material damages; and they accord, moreover,
entirely with the opinion of the present Tribunal on the basis of the written and oral
submissions made to it by the Claimants. The claim to moral damages must therefore be
rejected. Had the Tribunal found the claim to material damage to have been established, it
would have been prepared to consider the Claimants’ subsidiary and alternative submission
that moral injury (assuming it to be made out) was a factor to be taken into account in
assessing the appropriate reparation for the breach of fair and equitable treatment; but, as

the claim to material damages has itself been rejected, this submission, too, must fail.

M. The Options Open to the Tribunal

244, The Tribunal regrets that the Claimants did not set themselves to the specific task of showing
what particular injury and damage could be proved to have been caused to them by the breach
of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4 of the BIT determined in the
First Award, which the First Tribunal had also established was legally and factually distinct
from the original expropriation claim that had been dismissed ratione temporis. The present
resubmission proceedings, which were thorough and complete, allowed the Claimants the
fullest opportunity to do so, an opportunity of which they did not avail themselves. Given
the seniority, skill and experience of Claimants’ counsel and their long familiarity with the
case, together with the unambiguous and repeated arguments on want of proof advanced by
the Respondent, this omission cannot be regarded as inadvertent. The Tribunal has given

anxious consideration to the options open to it in these circumstances. Despite the

92

difficulties in understanding some parts of the First Award, the Tribunal could plainly not
permit the original expropriation claim to be reintroduced by the back door in the guise of a
breach of fair and equitable treatment suffered many years later; this was not justifiable on
the facts or the law, and was in any case formally excluded by the combined effect of the
First Award and the Annulment Decision. The Tribunal could equally not have devised a
theory of damages of its own, separate from the arguments of the Parties; this is what the
First Tribunal had done, and for which it was rightly overruled by the ad hoc Committee in
the annulment proceedings. Nor could the Tribunal have awarded moral damages as a form
of consolation where actual damages had not been proved. Nor, finally (as already indicated
in paragraph 172 above), was the Tribunal empowered to decide the Claimants’ claims ex
aequo et bono. There was thus no other course open to it than to dismiss, virtually in their
entirety, the Claimants’ monetary claims. In doing so, it wishes however to make the
following observation. The Tribunal’s Award does not touch the finding in the First Award
that the Respondent had committed a breach of Article 4 of the BIT by failing to guarantee
fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants’ investments, including a denial of justice; that
finding is res judicata and was not part of the present resubmission proceedings. It thus
represents a subsisting obligation on the Respondent and one which, as the First Tribunal
found, arose out of a failure in the operation of the Chilean internal system for the redress of
acknowledged past injustices. The Tribunal has no doubt that, these resubmission
proceedings once out of the way, the Respondent will remain conscious of that obligation,

and will weigh its consequences appropriately.

B. The Respondent’s Cost Submissions

247. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent contends that :

Claimants’ consistent pattern of accusing Chile’s counsel of bad faith at every turn; making
such accusations public by uploading all of their pleadings and most of their correspondence on
their website; belaboring every procedural point; appealing every issue (see, e.g., Claimants’ 10
submissions on Chile’s arbitrator appointment) have all acutely exacerbated the dispute and

38 OR, para. 501(9).

94

have implied a massive waste of time and resources. As a result of Claimants’ vexatious
litigation tactics, and the fact that the entirety of Claimants’ Resubmission claims are
impermissible in the first place, the Tribunal should impose on Claimants the obligation to cover
all of Chile’s costs and expenses, including legal and expert fees. It would certainly seem
inappropriate— in light of the foregoing discussion — to award costs to Claimants, as they have
requested.***

LJ

For the reasons set forth in this Rejoinder, as well as those articulated in the Counter-Memorial,
Chile respectfully requests that the Tribunal:

and defamatory accusations, grant Chile a full award of any and all expenses and costs incurred

The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs

The Tribunal is of the view that, as a general principle, a successful litigant, whether claimant
or respondent, ought to be protected against the cost and expense of having to litigate. The
principle conduces to economy and efficiency, and is as applicable to investment arbitration
as to other forms of litigation. The Tribunal notes in this context that the First Tribunal took
a similar view, and ordered the Respondent to make a contribution to the costs of the
Claimants, while also deciding on an unequal division of the costs of the arbitration in favour

of the Claimants.

The present proceedings, being resubmission proceedings, are somewhat out of the ordinary
run of ICSID arbitrations. They are also rather complex in their outcome, when taken
together with the original proceedings. It is nevertheless the case that, in the resubmission,
the Respondent was plainly the successful party overall and the Claimants the losing party
overall. This would under normal circumstances have justified an order for substantial costs
in favour of the Respondent. That would have derived in particular from the consequences
that flowed from the Claimants’ reluctance to deviate from the claims they had originally
put to the First Tribunal (even where those claims were not upheld in the First Award or
were not treated with approval in the Decision on Annulment) and the Claimants’ consequent
unwillingness to bring their attention to bear instead on isolating, proving and quantifying a
claim to injury and damage focussing specifically on the breach of the BIT that had been
decided by the First Tribunal. Against this must however be set against the fact that,
following the partial annulment, the Claimants had good reason to bring the resubmission
proceedings as such, as well as the fact that the ambiguities and uncertainties remaining even
in those parts of the First Award that had not been annulled created real difficulties for both

Claimants and Respondent in handling the proceedings.

In these very particular circumstances, the Tribunal proposes to make full use of the
discretion left to it under ICSID Convention Article 61(2) and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47
and orders that the arbitration costs of the proceedings will be borne by the Parties in similar,
but opposite proportions to those decided by the First Tribunal, i.e. three quarters of the total
amount to be borne by the Claimants and the remaining one quarter by the Respondent. It

will make no further order as to costs; with the result that each side will bear in full its own

96

252.

254.

255.

legal costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel, witnesses and

experts).

The arbitration costs of the proceedings include: (i) the fees and expenses of each Member
of the Tribunal and the President of the Tribunal’s Assistant; (ii) payments made by ICSID
for other direct expenses, such as court reporting, interpretation, the charges of the
International Dispute Resolution Centre in London for hosting the hearing on 13 to
16 August 2015, and courier services, as well as estimated charges related to the dispatch of

this Award; and (iii) ICSID’s administrative fees.

These costs amount to (in US$):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses.

Other direct expenses (estimated) 194,075.65

ICSID’s administrative fees 96,000.00

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made to ICSID by the parties in equal
parts. Once the case account balance is final, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties
with a detailed financial statement; any remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties

in equal shares.

In consequence of paragraphs 251 to 254 above, the respective shares to be borne by the
Parties in the direct costs of the proceeding amount to US$478,528.29 for the Claimants,
US$159,509.43 for the Respondent, and the Claimants are accordingly under an obligation

to reimburse to the Respondent the amount of US$159,509.43.°8°

386 This amount includes an estimate of the other direct expenses as indicated at paras. 252 and 253 above.

V. DECISION

256. On the basis of the reasoning above, the Tribunal decides, unanimously:

1) That Ms Coral Pey Grebe cannot be regarded as a claimant in her own right in these

resubmission proceedings;

2) That, as has already been indicated by the First Tribunal, its formal recognition of the
Claimants’ rights and its finding that they were the victims of a denial of justice constitutes
in itself a form of satisfaction under international law for the Respondent’s breach of

Article 4 of the BIT;°*”

3) That the Claimants, bearing the relevant burden of proof, have failed to prove any further
quantifiable injury to themselves caused by the breach of Article 4 as found by the First

Tribunal in its Award;

4) That the Tribunal cannot therefore make any award to the Claimants of financial

compensation on this account;

5) That the Claimants’ subsidiary claim on the basis of unjust enrichment is without legal

foundation;

6) That there are no grounds in the circumstances of the case for the award of moral damages

either to Mr Pey Casado or to the Foundation;

7) That the arbitration costs of these resubmission proceedings are to be shared in the
proportion of three quarters to be borne by the Claimants and one quarter by the
Respondent, with the result that the Claimants shall reimburse to the Respondent the sum

of US$159,509.43;

8) That all other claims are dismissed.

387 Exh. R-27, First Award, 8 May 2008, para. 704: “... le Tribunal arbitral estime que le prononcé de la
présente sentence, par sa i des droits des d d et du déni de justice dont
elles furent victimes, constitue en soi une satisfaction morale substantielle et suffisante.”
