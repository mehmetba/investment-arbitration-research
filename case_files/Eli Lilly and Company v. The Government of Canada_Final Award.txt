INTRODUCTION

Parties

The claimant in this arbitration is Eli Lilly and Company (“Claimant” or “Lilly”), a
pharmaceutical company incorporated in the United States of America (“United States”)
under the laws of the State of Indiana, with its principal place of business located at Lilly
Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46205. Claimant brings its claims on its own
behalf and on behalf of its indirectly owned subsidiary, Eli Lilly Canada Inc., a Canadian
enterprise with its principal place of business located at 3650 Danforth Avenue, Toronto,

Ontario, M1N 2E8 (“Lilly Canada’).
Claimant is represented in this arbitration by its representatives listed on page i above.

The respondent in this arbitration is the Government of Canada (“Respondent” or
“Canada”). Respondent is represented in this arbitration by its representatives listed on

page i above.

Overview

Claimant has submitted the present dispute to international arbitration pursuant to Chapter
Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which entered into force on 1
January 1994 (“NAFTA”), and the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law’s Arbitration Rules as adopted by General Assembly Resolution 31/98 on 15
December 1976 (“UNCITRAL Rules”). By agreement of the Parties, the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) serves as the administering

authority for this proceeding.

In this arbitration, Claimant asserts claims arising from the invalidation of its Canadian
patents protecting the drugs marketed in Canada as Strattera and Zyprexa. The Canadian
courts invalidated these two patents in 2010 and 2011, respectively, on the ground that they
did not meet the requirement under Canadian patent law that an invention be “useful”.
According to Claimant, the basis for the Canadian courts’ decisions was their adoption in

the mid-2000s of the “promise utility doctrine”, which Claimant considers to be radically

1

new, arbitrary and discriminatory against pharmaceutical companies and products.
Claimant argues that the promise utility doctrine is inconsistent with Respondent’s
obligations related to patent protection under NAFTA Chapter 17. Further, Claimant
contends that the retroactive application of the doctrine to Claimant’s patents has resulted
in (i) the unlawful expropriation of Claimant’s investments under NAFTA Article 1110,
and (ii) a breach of Respondent’s obligation to provide the minimum standard of treatment
under NAFTA Article 1105. Claimant submits that Respondent’s jurisdictional objection
should be dismissed as untimely, and that in any event, it lacks merit; it asserts that this

Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis over Claimant’s claims.

Respondent’s position is that the Tribunal should dismiss all of Claimant’s claims for the
following four separate reasons: (i) the sole legal basis on which a national court decision
could result in a breach of NAFTA Chapter Eleven is a denial of justice, which Claimant
has not alleged; (ii) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis because Claimant’s
claim is time-barred under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2); (iii) there has been no
dramatic change in Canadian courts’ interpretation of the requirement under the Canadian
patent law that an invention be “useful”; and (iv) the invalidation of Claimant’s patents
does not constitute a breach of NAFTA Chapter Eleven or any other international
obligation. In this regard, Respondent argues that consideration of Canada’s compliance
with NAFTA Chapter 17 or other international obligations outside of Chapter Eleven is

beyond the mandate of this Tribunal.

The Parties’ specific requests for relief are set forth in Section IV below, and a fuller
summary of their positions is contained in Sections VI.B, VI.B(2) VILA, VIII.A, and IX.A
below. In its analysis, the Tribunal has considered not only the positions of the Parties as
summarized in this Award but the numerous detailed arguments made in the Parties’
written and oral pleadings as well. To the extent that these arguments are not referred to

expressly, they should be deemed to be subsumed into the Tribunal’s analysis.

The Tribunal has also received and considered written submissions from the United States
and the United Mexican States (“Mexico”) under NAFTA Article 1128 and from the amici

curiae identified in Section II below.

PROCEDURE

On 7 November 2012, Claimant delivered a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to
Arbitration to Respondent in respect of its patent for Strattera. Subsequently, on 13 June
2013, Claimant delivered a second Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration to
Respondent, which contained claims identical to those raised in the first Notice of Intent,
but added the Zyprexa patent to the complaint. Claimant later withdrew the first Notice of

Arbitration.

Claimant commenced this arbitration by its Notice of Arbitration dated 12 September 2013
(“NoA”), submitted pursuant to Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Apbitration Rules, and
Articles 1116, 1117, and 1120 of the NAFTA.

As envisaged in NAFTA Article 1123, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would comprise
three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each of the disputing parties and the third,

presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the disputing parties.

Claimant appointed Mr. Gary Born, a national of the United States, as arbitrator, and Mr.
Born accepted the appointment by letter of 18 November 2013. Together with his
acceptance, Mr. Born provided the Parties with a declaration of his independence and

impartiality and a disclosure statement. !

Respondent then appointed Sir Daniel Bethlehem, a national of the United Kingdom based
in London, as arbitrator, and Sir Daniel accepted the appointment on 17 December 2013.
Together with his acceptance, Sir Daniel provided the Parties with a declaration of his

independence and impartiality and a disclosure statement.”

On 4 March 2014, Claimant requested that the Secretary-General of ICSID appoint the

third, presiding arbitrator pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128. Claimant informed the

' By letters of 9 June 2015, 10 and 22 July 2015, 7 September 2015, 22 April 2016, 27 June 2016, 4 October 2016 and
14 March 2017 Mr. Gary Born provided the Parties with supplemental disclosure statements. No Party raised any
objections or queries regarding these statements.

? By letter of 3 February 2017, Sir Daniel Bethlehem provided the Parties with a supplemental disclosure statement.
No Party raised any objections or queries regarding this statement.

Secretary-General of an agreement of the Parties that this appointment be made through a
strike-and-rank list of seven candidates. The Secretary-General accepted Claimant’s

request by letter of 6 March 2014.

On 18 March 2014, in accordance with the Parties’ agreed procedure, the Secretary-
General provided the Parties with a list of seven candidates. Each party submitted its

ranking of candidates on | April 2014.

By letter of 2 April 2014, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the overall most
preferred candidate was Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of the Netherlands
based in Brussels, and that he was therefore appointed as President of the Tribunal. The
Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted on that date in accordance with the

UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

In consultation with the Tribunal, the Parties agreed that ICSID would serve as
administering authority for the arbitration. By Claimant’s letter of 10 April 2014 to the
Secretary-General of ICSID, the Parties requested that ICSID provide full administrative
services. On the same day, the Secretary-General confirmed that ICSID would provide
such services and informed the Parties that Ms. Lindsay Gastrell, ICSID Counsel, would

serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.

In response to a request from the Tribunal, the Parties filed a joint submission on procedural
issues and confidentiality (including a jointly proposed Procedural Order No. 1, jointly
proposed Confidentiality Order, and a proposed Procedural Calendar from each Party) on
14 April 2014. As there were a number of issues upon which the Parties could not reach
agreement, the Tribunal invited each Party to submit its observations on the outstanding
issues. On 2 May 2014, Claimant filed its Observations on Outstanding Issues for the First

Procedural Hearing, and Respondent filed its Submission on Procedural Issues.

The Tribunal held a procedural hearing with the Parties on 10 May 2014, with the President
of the Tribunal and the Parties attending in person at the World Bank Headquarters in
Washington, D.C., and the co-arbitrators participating by videoconference from the World

Bank office in London.

together with Exhibits R-357 to R-473, amended Exhibits R-243, R-333 and R-345,

Authorities RL-088 to RL-118, and the following two witness statements and five expert

reports:

- Second Witness Statement of Dr. Michael Gillen dated 7 December 2015 (“Gillen
Second Statement”);

- Second Expert Report of Mr. Ronald E. Dimock dated 4 December 2015 (“Dimock

(“Lindner Second Report’), in Spanish with English translation; and

- Second Expert Report of Mr. T. David Reed dated 7 December 2015 (“Reed Second
Report”).

In a letter to Respondent dated 17 December 2015, copied to the Tribunal, Claimant
requested that Respondent unilaterally withdraw its objection to jurisdiction ratione
temporis raised for the first time in the Rejoinder. In response, by letter dated 18 December
2015, Respondent declined to withdraw its jurisdictional objection. On 21 December 2015,
Claimant informed Respondent that it would seek relief from the Tribunal for non-
compliance with Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and Section 10.2 of
PO 1 immediately following the holidays.

By letter of 5 January 2016 to the Tribunal, Claimant set forth observations on the timing
of Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis and sought leave to respond in

writing to the objection.

By letter of 8 January 2016, Respondent stated that it did not object to Claimant submitting
a response to its jurisdictional arguments, provided Respondent would be allowed to
respond in writing to Claimant’s submission. Respondent also proposed that if the Tribunal
were to grant Claimant’s request for additional written submissions, the deadline for the
NAFTA Article 1128 submissions and applications for leave to file amicus submissions

should be postponed.

On the same date, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it agreed with an extension of the
deadline of the NAFTA Article 1128 submissions but objected to altering the amicus filing
deadline. Additionally, Claimant proposed to shorten the period for the Parties to respond

to the NAFTA Article 1128 submissions.

Also on 8 January 2016, Mexico and the United States submitted letters to the Tribunal
proposing an extension to the filing deadline for the non-disputing NAFTA Party
submissions under NAFTA Article 1128.

Following a further exchange of comments by the Parties in relation to the procedural
calendar (Respondent’s letter of 12 January 2016 and Claimant’s letter of 13 January
2016), the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 dated 15 January 2016 (“PO 3”). In PO
3, the Tribunal ordered that: (i) Claimant would be allowed to respond to Respondent’s
objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis raised in the Rejoinder; (ii) further submissions
from Respondent on its jurisdictional objection were not necessary; and (iii) the deadlines
for Article 1128 submissions and applications for leave to file amicus submissions would

be extended. PO 3 contained a revised procedural calendar reflecting these decisions.

ICSID informed Mexico and the United States of the extended deadline for the non-
disputing NAFTA Party submissions under NAFTA Article 1128 and posted an
announcement on its website regarding the new deadline for applications for leave to file

amicus submissions.

On 22 January 2016, Claimant submitted its Opposition to Respondent’s Jurisdictional
Objection (“Opposition on Jurisdiction”), together with Exhibit C-515 and Authorities
CL-167 to CL-177.

Nine applications for leave to file an amicus curiae submission were submitted on 12
February 2016. The applicants were: (i) a group of academics from the United States, the
United Kingdom, Switzerland, South Africa and Nepal; (ii) the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce; (iii) the Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association; (iv) the Samuelson-
Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic and the Centre for Intellectual
Property Policy; (v) Dr. Henning Grosse Ruse-Khan, Dr. Kathleen Liddell and Dr. Michael
Waibel of the University of Cambridge; (vi) Innovative Medicines Canada and
BIOTECanada; (vii) seven intellectual property law professors from universities in the
United States; (viii) the National Association of Manufacturers; and (ix) Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, Mexican Association of the Research Based

Pharmaceutical Industry, and Biotechnology Innovation Organization.

In accordance with the revised procedural calendar, on 19 February 2016, each Party

submitted comments on the applications for leave to file amicus submissions. Claimant

46.

attached to its comments Authorities CL-178 to CL-179, and Respondent attached to its

letter an Annex A.

On 23 February 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“PO 4”) concerning the

applications for leave to file amicus submissions. The Tribunal granted six of the

applications, accepting into the record the submissions of the following amici:

a.

Dr. Burcu Kilic, Professor Brook K. Baker, Professor Cynthia Ho and Mr. Yaniv
Heled: In summary, the position of these intellectual property law experts is that
NAFTA does not impose a uniform standard of patentability criteria, and that
Respondent has acted well within its rights under NAFTA to set its own utility
requirement. They also contend that Claimant’s initiation of this arbitration is an

abusive attempt to influence the Canadian Parliament to change the law on utility.

Canadian Chamber of Commerce: In summary, this submission states that deviation
from international norms on utility and sound prediction will negatively affect
Canada’s economy, and that the Canadian courts’ interpretation of promise utility can

be linked to declining investments in the Canadian pharmaceutical sector.

Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association (“CGPA”): In summary, CGPA urges
the Tribunal to dispose of this arbitration without commenting upon any substantive
principles of Canadian patent law, which it argues could upset longstanding Canadian
jurisprudence. According to CGPA, the “promise doctrine” as described by Claimant

does not exist, and is a only construct to support its arguments in this proceeding.

. Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Canadian Internet Policy & Public Interest Clinic and

Centre for Intellectual Property Policy: In summary, this submission raises several
points in objection to Claimant’s case, including: (i) a patent is not an unconditional
property right, as it is always subject to a risk of litigation and invalidation by the court;
(ii) there are no formal or informal international standards of utility, including under
NAFTA; and (iii) Claimant’s arguments confuse the aims of trade law with those of

intellectual property law.

Gregory Dolin (University of Baltimore School of Law), Christopher Holman
(University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law), Jay Kesan (University of Illinois
School of Law), Erika Lietzan (University of Missouri-Colombia School of Law), Adam
Mossoff (George Mason University School of Law), Kristen Osenga (University of
Richmond School of Law), and Mark Schultz (Southern Illinois University School of
Law): In summary, these intellectual property law professors challenge many aspects
of Respondent’s law on utility, which in their view departs from NAFTA Article
1709(1). They argue that Respondent’s approach runs counter to global norms and the
long historical trend toward increasing harmonisation of the utility standard in a liberal

direction.

National Association of Manufacturers: In summary, this manufacturing association
based in the United States submits that Respondent’s promise utility doctrine is
inconsistent with established international norms for patent protection and in violation
of NAFTA Chapter Eleven. In its view, Respondent has injected uncertainty into the
system and put at risk manufacturers’ ability to file a single global patent application

under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (the “PCT”).

On 18 March 2016, Mexico and the United States filed written submissions pursuant to

NAFTA Article 1128 (“Mexico Article 1128 Submission” and “United States Article

1128 Submission”). These submissions are discussed where applicable in the sections

below.

On 8 April 2016, the Parties provided the Tribunal with a jointly proposed draft Procedural

Order No. 5 concerning the procedural rules for the hearing on jurisdiction and merits.

After considering the Parties’ proposed draft order, on 12 April 2016, the Tribunal provided

the Parties with a draft agenda for the pre-hearing procedural teleconference. At the same

time, the Tribunal sought the Parties’ views on certain outstanding procedural items

relating to the hearing. Once the Tribunal received and considered the Parties’ comments,

it provided the Parties with an updated draft Procedural Order No. 5.

On 22 April 2016, the Parties filed the following submissions:

a. Respondent’s Observations on Issues Raised in 1128 Submissions of Mexico and the

United States (“Respondent’s Observations on 1128 Submissions”);

b. Respondent’s Observations on Issues Raised in Amicus Submissions (“Respondent’s

Observations on Amicus Submissions’); and

c. Claimant’s Comments on NAFTA Article 1128 Submissions and Non-Disputing Party
(Amicus) Submissions (“Claimant’s Observations on 1128 and Amicus

Submissions”).

On 27 April 2016, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing teleconference with the
Parties. Following the teleconference, on 29 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 5 (“PO 5”), reflecting the Parties’ agreements and the Tribunal’s decisions on

the procedural rules to govern the hearing.

Also on 29 April 2016, each Party notified the other Party and the Tribunal of the witnesses

and experts it intended to call during the hearing.

As contemplated in PO 5, on 6 May 2016, the Tribunal issued to the Parties a list of

questions to be addressed during their opening statements.

The same day, a news alert was posted on the ICSID website announcing that the hearing
would be open to the public and providing instructions for accessing the public viewing

room.

By letter of 25 May 2016, Respondent requested “that the Tribunal clarify for the Parties
that the documents referenced by the non-disputing parties in their amicus curiae
submissions are, in fact, considered part of the record in this arbitration”. Claimant
responded the following day, opposing “Canada’s attempt to introduce hundreds of new
exhibits into the record five days before the beginning of the hearing”. The Tribunal
addressed this issue in Procedural Order No. 6 (“PO 6”), issued on 27 May 2016. In PO 6,

the Tribunal decided, inter alia, that either Party would be permitted to rely on documents

14

referenced in the amicus curiae submissions that were not already part of the record, as

long as that Party notified the other Party and the Tribunal at least 24 hours in advance.

55. The hearing on jurisdiction and merits was held at the World Bank Headquarters in
Washington, D.C. from 30 May to 8 June 2016 (excluding Sunday, 5 June and Tuesday, 7
June 2016) (the “Hearing”).* In accordance with PO 1, the Hearing was broadcast to a

public viewing room at the World Bank Headquarters.

attended the Hearing in the hearing room.

On the final day of the Hearing (Day 8), the United States (through its representative Ms.
Lisa Grosh) sought leave to make an oral submission to present further views in connection
with its NAFTA Article 1128 written submission of 18 March 2016. At the Tribunal’s
invitation, the Parties’ made oral observations on the issue, by which Claimant asked the
Tribunal to deny the United States’ request, and Respondent sought to have it granted. The
Tribunal took a short recess to deliberate and then ordered that the United States would not
be permitted to make an oral submission during the Hearing because it had not provided
the required advance notice under NAFTA Article 1128. Instead, the Tribunal invited the
United States to submit a written note setting forth its views by midday. By email of later
that day, the Supplemental Submission of the United States was provided to the Parties and
the Tribunal. The Parties were then given an opportunity to make oral observations on the

United States’ position.

At the close of the Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed a number of post-
Hearing procedural steps. The Tribunal then confirmed the agreed post-Hearing schedule

by letter on 9 June 2016.

In accordance with that schedule (as revised by the Parties’ agreement), on 25 July 2016,
each Party submitted its Post-Hearing Memorial (“C-PHM” and “R-PHM”). On 8 August
2016, each Party submitted its Reply Post-Hearing Memorial (“C-RPHM” and “R-

On 22 August 2016, Claimant submitted its submission on costs, together with Authorities
CL-200 to CL-206 (““C-CS”), and Respondent submitted its submission on costs, together
with Authorities RL-160 to RL-173 (“R-CS”).

BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE

Canadian Patent Law

The patent system in Canada is rooted in the Canadian Patent Act (the “Patent Act”).* As
explained by the Supreme Court of Canada, an “inventor gets his patent according to the

terms of the Patent Act, no more and no less”?

Under the Patent Act, the day-to-day administration of the patent system is carried out by
the Patent Office, which is part of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (“CIPO”). The
Commissioner of Patents has ultimate responsibility for granting and issuing patents, and
patent examiners work on his or her behalf to review each patent application for compliance
with the Patent Act and the Patent Rules.° Decisions of patent examiners may be appealed
to the Commissioner, although the review is in fact conducted by the Patent Appeal Board,

a body within the Patent Office, and then approved by the Commissioner.’

Both Parties have referred to the patent system as a bargain between society and the
inventor. On one side, the invention must be new, useful and non-obvious, and the inventor
must adequately describe it to the public.® In exchange, the inventor is given certain

exclusive rights to the invention for a prescribed period.

Accordingly, the Patent Act defines “invention” as “any new and useful art, process,
machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement”, and
sets forth requirements pertaining to disclosure.’ One of these requirements—that an
invention be useful—is at the heart of this dispute. Section VIII below elaborates the
Parties’ positions on the utility requirement in the Patent Act and its application by

Canadian courts.

no common law right to a patent. The patent system is entirely rooted in legislation.”).

67. Here, the Tribunal simply notes that, under Canadian judicial authority, utility may be
either demonstrated or “soundly predicted”. The doctrine of sound prediction was adopted
by the Supreme Court of Canada in Monsanto Co. v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents).'°
Sound prediction has particular applicability to patents for pharmaceuticals, as it allows an
inventor to predict that untested chemical compounds would behave in the same way to
other structurally similar compounds. The doctrine of sound prediction may permit those

untested compounds to be patented. '!

68. Since 1987, the Patent Act has allowed inventors to patent pharmaceutical compounds,
provided that the patentability requirements identified above are satisfied.!? Initially,
however, Canada maintained a compulsory licensing system under which generic
pharmaceutical manufacturers could license and produce patented pharmaceutical products

before the expiry of the patent.'* Generic manufacturers that paid a statutory fee of four or

five per cent to the patentee were permitted to bring the generic to market. '+

69. In 1993, Canada eliminated the compulsory licensing regime, partly in recognition of its
international obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (“TRIPS”) and NAFTA. "> It was replaced with a set of regulations entitled
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance Regulations) (“PM(NOC)”), which are
uniquely applicable to the pharmaceutical sector.'° PM(NOC) requires any pharmaceutical

market entrant, such as a generic manufacturer, to obtain a Notice of Compliance (“NOC”)

that an inventor who had tested three related compounds to inhibit the vulcanization of rubber could soundly predict
the utility of the remaining compounds in the same genus without testing each one).

a medicine or food. In 1987, however, section 41 of the Patent Act, which prohibited such claims, was repealed. Until
then, a pharmaceutical compound could only be claimed in connection with the process by which it was made”).

Commission on Pharmaceutical Services 25 (1971) (recognizing that the Canadian patent law regime effectively
denies market exclusivity to pharmaceuticals); C-322, Celotex Corp. v. Donnacona Paper Co., (1939) 2 C.P.R. 26, at
41 (Ex. Ct.) (recognizing the pharmaceutical patent regime as impractical and oppressive).

from the Minister of Health.'? However, before any NOC is issued, the patent-holder has
an opportunity to bring an application in the Federal Court to prohibit the Minister from

issuing an NOC. !®

Patent law cases can also come before the Federal Court in other ways, such as on appeal
from a decision of the Patent Commissioner.'? In addition, under the Patent Act, “any
interested person” may challenge a patent in invalidation proceedings before the Federal

Court.”

Zyprexa Patent (Olanzapine)

In 1975, Lilly Industries Limited U.K. filed for a Canadian patent covering 15 trillion
compounds, including olanzapine, which was one of the “most preferred compounds”.?! In

1980, this patent was issued with Canadian Patent No. 1,075,687 (the “‘687 Patent”).?*
According to Claimant, Zyprexa was first synthesized in 1982 in the United Kingdom.??

On 24 April 1991, Eli Lilly and Company Limited U.K. filed Canadian Patent Application
No. 2,041,113 in relation to olanzapine, as a selection from the genus of the ‘687 Patent
(the “Zyprexa Patent” or “‘113 Patent”).4 The patent application mentions the invention
as a novel organic compound, to be used as a pharmaceutical in the context of the “category
known as antipsychotics for treating serious mental conditions such as schizophrenia and

schizophreniform illnesses”.?°

74. On 13 October 1995, Lilly Canada requested examination of the Zyprexa Patent by the
Canadian Intellectual Property Office (“CIPO”).

75. On 28 October 1996, Health Canada issued an NOC with the relevant requirements of the
Food and Drug Regulations in relation to “Zyprexa Tablets”, in which the active ingredient
was olanzapine.”’ Zyprexa was approved for the treatment of the symptoms of psychotic

disorders.”

76. Claimant states that it lainched Zyprexa in Canada in 1996.7°

77. Following the patent examination process, on 17 March 1998, CIPO gave notice that the

Zyprexa Patent application would be accepted.*”

78. On 14 July 1998, the Zyprexa Patent was issued.*! According to Claimant, it obtained

patents for olanzapine in 81 jurisdictions, including Mexico and the United States.*

79. On 6 June 2007, Canadian drug manufacturer Novopharm Limited (“Novopharm’, now
Teva Canada Limited) obtained regulatory approval from Health Canada to market a
generic version of Zyprexa.** Lilly Canada had attempted to obtain an order prohibiting
the Minister of Health from issuing that NOC to Novopharm, but its action was dismissed
by the Federal Court on 5 June 2007.*4 Lilly Canada’s appeal in relation to the NOC was

dismissed as moot, given that the NOC had already been issued.*°

80. Lilly Canada filed suit against Novopharm for patent infringement. On 5 October 2009,
the Federal Court dismissed the action. In the same judgment, Justice James W. O’Reilly
invalidated the Zyprexa Patent on the basis that it “is not a valid selection patent”, holding
that it “does not describe an invention over and above what was disclosed in the ‘687

patent”.*° The judgment held further that:

One does not have to discredit a product or those who make it in
order to invalidate its patent. I am satisfied that olanzapine is a useful
drug for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, Lilly had a patent
for it that lasted from 1980 to 1997. It sought a separate and
supplementary patent for it, no doubt, to try to recuperate some of
its corporate investment in its neuroleptic programme. . . . But as the
sun began to set on the ’687 patent, it became important to try to
extend the patent protection for olanzapine. The ’113 patent was
clearly drafted with a view of justifying a fresh patent. But the
evidence just was not there, yet. Accordingly, I must conclude that
the ’113 is not a valid selection patent. The claims set out above are
invalid. Novopharm is entitled to relief under s. 8 of the Patented
Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, to be determined in
a separate proceeding, and to its costs.*”

81. Lilly Canada appealed this judgment. The appeal was allowed, and the Federal Court of
Appeal set aside the Federal Court’s decision on 21 July 2010. The Federal Court of Appeal
found that Justice O’Reilly had erroneously treated the conditions for a valid selection
patent as “an independent basis upon which to attack the validity of a patent”.** The Federal
Court of Appeal remanded the issues of “utility” and “sufficiency of disclosure” to the

Federal Court for re-determination.*

82. Justice O’Reilly reconsidered the case on the basis of the directions of the Federal Court
of Appeal. By judgment dated 10 November 2011 (the “Zyprexa Decision”), he found the

Zyprexa Patent to be invalid for lack of utility, noting that:

Novopharm has established that the patent’s promise had not been
demonstrated and could not have been soundly predicted on the

Accordingly, I must conclude that the ‘113 is not a valid selection

September 2012, the appeal was dismissed.*!

Strattera Patent (Atomoxetine)

In 1979, Claimant obtained a Canadian patent for a genus group of compounds including
atomoxetine (Canadian Patent No. 1,051,034). The patent specification mentions

compounds “useful as psychotropic agents, particularly as anti-depressants”.**

In 1985, Claimant filed for a second patent relating only to atomoxetine, stating that “[t]he
compound of this invention is used as an antidepressant in the method of this invention,
which comprises administering to a human suffering from depression an effective

antidepressant dose of the compound”.*+

According to Claimant, it approached doctors at the Massachusetts General Hospital
(“MGH_”) in the United States, with a proposal for a joint human clinical trial to test the
efficacy of atomoxetine in treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”). The
trial was carried out from January to April 1995, and a report was subsequently published

in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

On 4 January 1996, Claimant filed a “new use” patent application for atomoxetine under

the PCT, requesting entry into the Canadian national phase on 7 July 1997 (the “Strattera

“invalid on the basis of inutility” (the “Strattera Decision”).*4 Justice Barnes held that:

to the extent that the ‘735 Patent is based on a sound prediction from
the MGH Study that atomoxetine is useful in the treatment of
ADHD, the patent fails for want of disclosure before some reference
to those findings was required to be set out in the patent.

Respondent confirms this request in the Counter-Memorial, the Rejoinder and its Post-

Hearing Memorial.

INTRODUCTION TO THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Jurisdiction of the Tribunal and Questions of Applicable Law

The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is rooted in Section B of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA. In
this regard, insofar as may be material for purposes of these proceedings,°* NAFTA Article
1116(1) provides that a Party may submit to arbitration under Section B of Chapter Eleven
a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under Section A of Chapter Eleven.

This provision is echoed in Article 1117(1) in respect of claims on behalf an enterprise.

It follows from these provisions that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited, in the

circumstances of this case, to claims of a breach of obligations under Section A of NAFTA

© Opposition on Jurisdiction 450.
& SoD 4120.
© Counter-Memorial $421; Rejoinder 1283; R-PHM 273.

© The Tribunal notes for completeness the reference in NAFTA Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1) to claims under NAFTA
Articles 1503(2) and 1502(3)(a) falling within the jurisdiction of a tribunal established under Section B of NAFTA
Chapter Eleven.

26

Chapter Eleven. A NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal is not a tribunal of general jurisdiction

with competence to adjudicate claims of a breach of other provisions of NAFTA.

102. Without prejudice to this appreciation, the Tribunal notes, as will be evident from the
discussion that follows on the question of applicable law, that the proper limitation of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to alleged breaches of Section A of NAFTA Chapter Eleven does
not require the Tribunal to ignore other provisions of the NAFTA, other agreements
between the NAFTA Parties, or other relevant and applicable rules of international law, for

purposes of assessing the claims before it.

103. As regards applicable law, NAFTA Article 1131(1), under the heading “Governing Law”,
provides: “A Tribunal established under this Section shall decide the issues in dispute in
accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law”. This reflects,
for purposes of proceedings under NAFTA Chapter Eleven, the requirement in NAFTA
Article 102(2), addressing the objectives of the NAFTA, that “The Parties shall interpret
and apply the provisions of this Agreement in the light of its objectives set out in paragraph
1 and in accordance with applicable rules of international law”. Having regard also to the
terms of Article 33(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules,™ the Tribunal accordingly observes that
the applicable law for purposes of these proceedings is the NAFTA and applicable rules of

international law.

104. The Tribunal notes also the terms of NAFTA Article 1112(1) and Article 103(2), which
provide further clarity on the relevant applicable law in the event of any inconsistency,
first, between NAFTA Chapter Eleven and other chapters of the NAFTA, and, second,
between the NAFTA and other agreements. Thus, Article 1112(1) provides: “In the event
of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter, the other Chapter shall
prevail to the extent of the inconsistency”. Article 103(2) provides: “In the event of any

inconsistency between this Agreement and such other agreements [to which the Parties to

© Article 33(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976 provides: “The arbitral tribunal shall apply the law
designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute. Failing such designation by the parties, the
arbitral tribunal shall apply the law determined by the conflict of laws rules which it considers applicable”.

27

105.

106.

the NAFTA are party], this Agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency,

except as otherwise provided in this Agreement”.

The Tribunal notes, additionally, the terms of NAFTA Article 1131(2), which provides:
“An interpretation by the [NAFTA Free Trade] Commission of a provision of this
Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section”. In this regard,
the Tribunal notes that the Commission adopted interpretations of, inter alia, NAFTA

Article 1105(1), on 31 July 2001 (“FTC Note”).©

As will be evident from the FTC Note interpretation of Article 1105(1), a tribunal seised
of a dispute concerning, inter alia, the interpretation and application of this provision is
required to have regard at the very least to customary international law to determine the
content, under customary international law, of the minimum standard of treatment
requirement for purposes, inter alia, of interpreting and applying the concepts of “fair and
equitable treatment” and “full protection and security”. It follows, and in the Tribunal’s
view this accords with a plain reading of both NAFTA Article 1131(1) and Article 102(2),
that the phrase “applicable rules of international law” addresses not simply, for example,
tules of interpretation of treaties, such as those reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”), but also any other applicable rules of
international law that may be relevant to the case before it. This would include, for
example, relevant and applicable rules on State responsibility, such as go to questions of
attribution of conduct, as well as other relevant and applicable rules of international law
that inform the interpretation and application of the provisions, inter alia, of Section A of
NAFTA Chapter Eleven that are in issue in the proceedings. It will be a matter for each

tribunal constituted under Section B of NAFTA Chapter Eleven to evaluate, with the

® Under the heading “Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law”, the Commission
adopted the following interpretations: “1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum

standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investor

s of

 

another Party. 2. The concepts of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and security’ do not require
treatment in addition to or beyond that which us required by the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment of aliens. 3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a
separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1)”.

assistance of submissions of the parties on the matter, the precise scope of the phrase

“applicable rules of international law” in the circumstances of the case of which it is seised.

As regards the interpretation of the NAFTA, the Tribunal will proceed by reference to the
commonly accepted customary international law rules of interpretation of treaties reflected

in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.

Burden of Proof

The Tribunal shall be guided by Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which
provides that “[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support

his claim or defence”.

The Tribunal shall apply the well-established principle that the party alleging a violation
of international law giving rise to international responsibility has the burden of proving it.
If that party adduces evidence that prima facie supports its allegation, the burden of proof

may shift to the other party when the circumstances so justify.

Roadmap to the Tribunal’s Analysis

During the Hearing, each Party proposed a decision tree setting forth what it considered to
be the issues to be addressed by the Tribunal, and the order in which those issues should
be addressed. The Parties agree on the fundamental issues to be decided, although they
disagree on the order of the analysis. Having considered the decision tree of each side, the

Tribunal will approach the issues in the following order:

(i) What is the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, if any? (Section VI)

(ii) Is denial of justice the only basis of liability for judicial measures under

NAFTA Chapter Eleven? (Section VII)

(iii) | Has there been a dramatic change in the utility requirement in Canadian

patent law? (Section VIII)

(iv) Is the utility requirement in Canadian patent law, as applied to the Zyprexa

(v) Tf (iii) and/or (iv) is answered in the affirmative, did the invalidations of the
Zyprexa and Strattera Patents breach Respondent’s obligations under

NAFTA Article 1110 and/or Article 1105?

JURISDICTION

Applicable Law

Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules states that “A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not

have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than in the statement of defence ...”.
NAFTA Article 1116(2) provides:

An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have
elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should
have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge
that the investor has incurred loss or damage.

NAFTA Article 1117(2) provides:

An investor may not make a claim on behalf of an enterprise ... if
more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge
of the alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred
loss or damage.

The Parties’ Positions

In the Rejoinder, Respondent raised for the first time an objection to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction ratione temporis. Respondent’s position is that Claimant recast its claim in the
Reply in a way that brought it outside of the three-year limitation period set forth in
NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2). In response, Claimant argues that this jurisdictional

objection should be rejected as untimely and, in any event, fails as a matter of law.

67 Although not listed as a fundamental issue on the Parties’ decision trees, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to address
Claimant's allegations of arbitrariness and discrimination in a separate section, as explained further below at 1389.

30

(1) Respondent’s Position

a. Timeliness of Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objectic

 

115. Respondent contends that its jurisdictional objection is timely because (i) it was raised as
early as possible; (ii) Claimant was not prejudiced by the timing of this objection; and (iii)
an objection to jurisdiction pursuant to NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) cannot be

waived.

116. According to Respondent, Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules applies only to the extent
that a respondent knew or should have known of the jurisdictional objection at the filing of
the statement of defence.®? When a claimant is permitted to make additional written
submissions after the statement of claim and reorients its claim therein, Article 21(3)

cannot be used to bar a jurisdictional objection arising from the new version of the claim.”

117. Respondent argues that in this case, prior to the Reply, Claimant’s claims were seemingly
based on the invalidation of the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents, and Respondent therefore
did not raise an objection under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2). Then, when
Claimant began to reorient its claim during the document production phase, Respondent
immediately objected.’! According to Respondent, it became clear only in the Reply that
the measure Claimant was challenging was the promise utility doctrine itself, creating the
basis for Respondent’s jurisdictional objection. Respondent asserts that it made this

objection to the Tribunal as soon as possible—in its next written submission, the Rejoinder.

118. In any event, according to Respondent, even if the Tribunal were to find that Respondent

should have brought the objection sooner, Article 21(3) cannot be interpreted to bar its

7 R-PHB 4179. Respondent points out that under Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Rules, a claimant does not have a
presumptive right to make another written submission following the statement of claim.

7| R-PHB 481, citing Procedural Order No. 2, Annex B, in which Respondent stated: “In order to establish jurisdiction
in this matter, Claimant stated the measures to be the invalidation of two of its patents by the Federal Court. Having
asked the Tribunal to assert jurisdiction on the s of these two specific measures, Claimant cannot now recast the
measure as ‘Canada’s development of a new utility doctrine’. This goes beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, extending
to an undefined time period and cases involving unspecified patents that did not form any part of Claimant's
investment.”

120.

objection in the present circumstances, because Claimant suffered no prejudice from the
timing of the objection. Respondent argues that the purpose of Article 21(3) “is to prevent
surprise and prejudice to a claimant at the hearing”.’* This is not a concern in this case, as
Respondent raised its jurisdictional objection six months before the Hearing, and Claimant

had the opportunity to respond in writing.”

Finally, Respondent argues that the Tribunal must address its jurisdictional objection in
any event, because an objection made pursuant to NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)
cannot be waived by a disputing party.” These provisions set a temporal limit on a
tribunal’s jurisdiction that forms part of the NAFTA Parties’ consent to arbitration.

According to Respondent:

variation of the terms of a State Party’s consent to arbitration in the
context of any particular dispute is not possible, unless allowed for
in the treaty, because it would amount to an amendment of the terms
of the underlying treaty itself. Therefore, in a treaty-based investor-
State arbitration, in order to ascertain the limits of its jurisdiction,
the Tribunal must look not to the conduct or agreement of the
particular disputing parties before it, but rather to the terms of the
treaty by which it is governed and the agreement of the States that
are Parties to it. 7°

Respondent’s view is that the UNCITRAL Rules do not change this required approach;
they cannot expand the jurisdiction of a Chapter Eleven tribunal.’° To support its position,

Respondent points to the following provisions: Article 1(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules,”
NAFTA Article 1120(2)”* and NAFTA Article 1122(1).”

b. Claimant’s Compliance with NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)

121. Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis because Claimant
failed to satisfy the temporal limit on Respondent’s consent to arbitrate found in NAFTA
Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2). According to Respondent, Claimant’s claim is
fundamentally a challenge to the promise utility doctrine. On Claimant’s own case, this
doctrine crystalized when it was applied to Claimant’s patent for raloxifene (the
“Raloxifene Patent”) by the Federal Court on 5 February 2008 (the “Raloxifene
Decision”).*° Although Claimant suffered a loss as a result of the Raloxifene Decision, it

chose not to submit its claim within three years of the alleged measures and loss.

122. Respondent interprets the three-year limitation period set out in NAFTA Articles 1116(2)
and 1117(2) as a strict precondition to its consent to arbitration, such that a tribunal lacks
jurisdiction ratione temporis over claims falling outside that time period.*! It notes that a

number of NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunals have declined jurisdiction on this basis.*?

123. For Respondent, the inclusion of the word “first” in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) is critical
“because it identifies the precise moment at which the three-year time limitation begins to
run”: the instant when the investor or enterprise acquired knowledge of the alleged breach
and a loss, as opposed to the middle or the end of such a breach.** Thus, the time-bar clock
does not stop or restart even if a measure is alleged to have a continuing effect or to have

been applied many times after original adoption.**

89 In the Raloxifene case, Claimant applied to the Federal Court for an order barring the Minister of Health from
allowing the generic pharmaceutical company Apotex to market a generic version of Raloxifene before the expiration
of Claimant's patent for the drug. The court held against Claimant on the ground that Claimant had failed to
demonstrate or soundly predict utility as of the filing date of its Raloxifene Patent. C-115/R-200, Eli Lilly Canada

Respondent submits that all three NAFTA Parties have repeatedly expressed their view
that this is the proper interpretation of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).®° According to
Respondent, such a clear, consistent position constitutes “a ‘subsequent agreement between
the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty’ and/or ‘subsequent practice’ which

‘shall be taken into account’ when interpreting NAFTA” under the VCLT.**

Similarly, Respondent asserts that tribunals interpreting Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) have
found that the limitation period is not subject to suspension or extension on account of
subsequent actions of the respondent State.*” Only the tribunal in UPS v. Canada held
differently, deciding that a continuing breach tolls the limitations period. According to
Respondent, the UPS approach, which has been rejected by the NAFTA Parties and
endorsed by no other tribunal, fails to give meaning to the word “first” and is therefore

contrary to the principle of effet utile.**

Applying this interpretation to the present case, Respondent asserts that Claimant failed to
submit its claim within the prescribed three-year period. According to Respondent,
Claimant’s claim as stated in the Reply is actually a challenge to the judiciary’s alleged
adoption of the promise utility doctrine, not to the invalidation of the Zyprexa and Strattera
Patents. On Claimant’s own case, this doctrine was developed through Canadian federal

court decisions issued between 2002 and 2008.*?

Respondent considers one of those court decisions, the Raloxifene Decision, particularly
significant because it concerned Claimant’s own patent, and “[aJll three aspects of

Canadian patent law that Claimant now challenges in this arbitration as a violation of

Canada’s obligations under Chapter Eleven were applied to Claimant” in that case.*°
Further, according to Respondent, Claimant suffered a loss as a result of the Raloxifene
Decision on 30 March 2009, when the Minister of Health issued an NOC to the generic
pharmaceutical company Apotex, which allowed Apotex to market a generic raloxifene

product.?!

Therefore, Respondent submits that “Claimant first acquired knowledge of all relevant
aspects of what it calls Canada’s ‘promise utility doctrine’ and a loss as a result of that
doctrine” when the Supreme Court denied Claimant’s application for leave to appeal the
Raloxifene Decision on 22 October 2009.” Accordingly, the three-year limitation period

started to run no later than that date.°?

According to Respondent, by waiting nearly four years after that critical date to submit its
claim to arbitration, Claimant has run afoul of NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).%4 In
Respondent’s view, the only claim on which Claimant could rely would be a denial of
justice in the specific court proceedings concerning the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents, but

Claimant has conceded that there was no such denial of justice.

Respondent considers it irrelevant that the Raloxifene Decision was rendered in a
PM(NOC) proceeding that did not result in an invalidation of the Raloxifene Patent (unlike
the proceedings concerning the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents). According to Respondent,
the important fact is that Claimant undeniably suffered a loss as a result of the Raloxifene

Decision, which was based on the same judicial doctrine that Claimant now challenges.”

131. Respondent also finds it insignificant that the Raloxifene Decision does not relate to the
Zyprexa or Strattera Patents, which are at issue in this case. In this regard, Respondent

argues:

Claimant cannot have first acquired knowledge of the alleged
NAFTA breach in the raloxifene proceedings with respect solely to
its raloxifene patent, and then again first acquired knowledge of the
alleged breach years later with respect to its atomoxetine and
olanzapine patents. The fact that the impugned “promise utility
doctrine” continued to affect Claimant’s other investments is
irrelevant for the purpose of the limitations period imposed by
NAFTA.”

132. Citing the award in Grand River v. United States, Respondent argues that finding
jurisdiction in this case “would allow Claimant to base its claim on the most recent
transgression, even if it had knowledge of earlier breaches and injuries”.°* It would also
erase the temporal limitation with respect to judicial doctrines, as court decisions are

always limited to a specific dispute.”

133. In its Post-Hearing Memorial, Respondent argues in the alternative that Claimant’s claim
would be barred by NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) even if the Tribunal were to
consider the promise utility doctrine solely with respect to the Zyprexa and Strattera
Patents.'”° According to Respondent, “given the lack of data supporting those patents when
they were filed, Claimant knew of at least some loss of value after the decision in

raloxifene”.!°!

(2) Claimant’s Position

a. Timeliness of Re lent’s Jurisdictional Objectic

sp

 

134. Claimant submits that Respondent’s jurisdictional objection is untimely and therefore
should not be considered. '°? Under Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, any objection
to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction must be raised no later than in the statement of defence.
According to Claimant, Respondent has violated this provision by failing to raise its
objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis until the filing of the Rejoinder.
Prior to that submission, Respondent had expressly declined to object to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction on several occasions: during the First Procedural Hearing, in the Statement of

Defence and in the Counter-Memorial.!%

135. Claimant further argues that the timing of Respondent’s objection is prejudicial, as
highlighted by Respondent’s attempt to deny Claimant an opportunity to respond.!° In
addition, it is not responsive to the Reply and thereby conflicts with Section 10.2 of
Procedural Order No. 1!° governing the scope of written submissions.!°° Moreover, in
Claimant’s view, the late objection has increased costs and compromised the efficiency of

this proceeding. '°”

136. According to Claimant, tribunals have consistently found untimely jurisdictional
objections to be procedurally improper and declined to entertain them on that basis, even
where a party had attempted to reserve its right to raise an objection later than the statement

of defence.!

137. Claimant submits that Respondent’ s justification for delay—that Claimant “recast” its case
in the Reply—is untenable and directly contradicted by the record.'°? According to
Claimant, it has consistently argued that the measures at issue are the invalidations of the
Zyprexa and Strattera Patents, not the promise utility doctrine itself or any action taken in
respect of its Raloxifene Patent.'!° Claimant argues that it discussed the content and
operation of the promise utility doctrine in the factual background section of the Reply
only to provide the factual context for its case and to respond to arguments advanced in

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial.!!!

138. According to Claimant, Respondent’s interpretation of UNCITRAL Rule 21(3) is flawed.
In particular, Respondent provides no valid reason why this Rule should not be enforced

in complex cases with multiple rounds of briefing. !!”

139. Claimant also rejects Respondent’s position that UNCITRAL Rule 21(3) is pre-empted by
NAFTA. Claimant considers this argument “nonsensical” because NAFTA itself specifies
that Chapter Eleven proceedings may be governed by the UNCITRAL Rules! Although
NAFTA can modify the UNCITRAL Rules, ''* “there is nothing in Articles 1116 and 1117
that indicates an intent to modify Rule 21(3). Instead, without any conflict between them,
Rule 21(3) and Articles 1116 and 1117 operate together in a coherent fashion”.!!> Indeed,
in set-aside proceedings concerning the award in S.D. Myers v. Canada, the Canadian
Federal Court recognized that a NAFTA Party can waive a jurisdictional objection by

failing to timely raise it.!!°

b. Claimant’s Compliance with NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)

Claimant submits that it filed the NoA squarely within the three-year limitation period set
forth in NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2), and that Respondent has failed to meet its
burden of showing otherwise.!!7 In this regard, Claimant stresses that its case concerns just
two of its patents: the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents. Therefore, the facts relevant to
Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) are that: (i) the Supreme Court rejected Claimant’s
application to appeal the invalidation of the Strattera Patent on 8 December 2011; (ii) the
Supreme Court rejected its application relating to the Zyprexa Patent on 16 May 2013; and
(iii) Claimant filed its NoA on 12 September 2013, within three years after the dates of

these final judgments. ''® Thus, Claimant concludes that its claims are timely.

According to Claimant, Respondent’s jurisdictional objection mistakenly focuses on the
treatment of Claimant’s Raloxifene Patent, which is not being challenged in this
arbitration.''? This approach is contrary to the principle that a claimant’s case is defined
by its own submissions.'?° Further, Respondent fails to show how the treatment of this
patent can trigger the limitations clock for claims concerning two other investments, which
are legally and factually distinct.'*! For Claimant, it is unclear how it could have acquired
“knowledge [of] loss or damage” to the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents in 2009, before the

courts had issued any decision invalidating them.!?

Claimant argues that Respondent has not cited a single case that supports its position.!?
Rather, it contends, NAFTA tribunals have consistently held that acts occurring more than

three years before a claimant’s claim “may provide necessary and vital context for the

evaluation of host state actions that take place within the limitation period”.'*4 For

example, in Bilcon v. Canada, the tribunal stated:

While Article 1116(2) bars breaches in respect of events that took
place more than three years before the claim was made, events prior
to the three-year bar ... are by no means irrelevant. They can provide
necessary background or context for determining whether breaches
occurred during the time-eligible period.'?>

Thus, Claimant argues, its references to earlier Canadian court decisions are appropriate
and do not have the effect of shortening the limitation period. They instead serve only as a
factual predicate to the challenged measures and the development of the promise utility

doctrine. !2°

According to Claimant, NAFTA tribunals have not taken issue with references to acts
outside of the limitation period, even if those prior acts could themselves have been the
basis of a NAFTA claim.!27 In this regard, Claimant cites Apotex and Bilcon, cases in which
the tribunal was asked to consider a series of interrelated but distinct government acts.!°
In both cases the tribunal found certain of the claimant’s claims to be time-barred, but
found no time-bar difficulty for later, related acts that took place within the limitation

period. !??

Claimant also considers Respondent’s reliance on past submissions by NAFTA Parties
regarding Article 1128 unavailing. While these submissions may support the proposition

that an allegation of a continuing breach does not stop the time-bar clock, that point is

irrelevant because Claimant has neither alleged a continuing breach nor advanced any

Finally, Claimant submits as a factual matter that, given the unpredictable and inconsistent
application of the promise utility doctrine, Claimant had no way of predicting a loss in

invalidation of the Raloxifene Patent. '3!
NAFTA Party Article 1128 Submissions

(1) Mexico

In its NAFTA Article 1128 Submission, Mexico also offers its views on the interpretation

of NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).

Mexico agrees with Respondent’s submissions in paragraphs 66 to 80 of the Rejoinder,
which fall under the headings: “Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) Establish a Strict Three-Year
Time Limit to Submit a Claim to Arbitration” and “The Time Limit in NAFTA Articles
1116(2) and 1117(2) Begins to Run from the First Date a Claimant Acquires Knowledge
of the Alleged Breach and a Loss”. !*?

Mexico states that the jurisdiction ratione temporis of a tribunal established under NAFTA.

Chapter Eleven depends on a claimant’s compliance with Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).!°

In addition, according to Mexico, Tribunals have recognized that noncompliance with
Article 1116(2) or 1117(2) is a “clear and rigid limitation defense—not subject to any
suspension, prolongation or other qualification”. '*4 Thus, “neither a continuing course of
conduct nor the occurrence of subsequent acts or omissions can renew or interrupt the

three-year limitation period once it has commenced to run”.!*

(2) United States

In its NAFTA Article 1128 Submission, the United States offers two main observations on

the interpretation of NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).

First, the United States observes that these provisions apply to claims by an “investor of a
Party”, which is defined in Article 1139 as a national or an enterprise of a NAFTA Party
“that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment”. According to the United States,
the limitation period “must therefore relate to the particular investment for which the
investor seeks a remedy for the breach and loss” and begins to run “when the investor first
acquires knowledge of the alleged breach and loss in connection with that particular

investment”. !*

Second, the United States submits that knowledge of an alleged breach and loss is “first
acquired” on a particular date, not on multiple dates or on a recurring basis. Therefore,
once an investor “first acquires” the relevant knowledge, the limitation period begins to
run and cannot be renewed by subsequent acts of the State Party arising from a continuing

course of conduct.'*7

The Parties’ Observations on the NAFTA Party Article 1128 Submissions

(1) Claimant’s Observations

In its observations on the NAFTA Party Article 1128 Submissions, Claimant first discusses
generally the role and nature of Article 1128 submissions, before turning to the specific
comments offered by the United States and Mexico.'** Specifically, Claimant challenges
Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal should afford such submissions special weight in

interpreting NAFTA. According to Claimant, the only entity granted authority to issue

interpretations of NAFTA is the NAFTA Free Trade Commission; Article 1128

submissions have no such status. !°

155. Further, Claimant submits that “Article 1128 submissions are inextricably linked to
NAFTA Parties’ litigation positions when they act as respondents”. '*° Thus, the arguments

presented in those submissions are not entitled to special deference, but rather must be

“afforded weight solely in proportion to their persuasive merit”. '*!

156. While maintaining that Respondent’s jurisdictional objection is not properly before the
Tribunal, Claimant nevertheless offers a number of observations regarding the specific
Article 1128 submissions relating to that objection.'*? According to Claimant, the United
States’ interpretation of the limitation period in NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117 confirms
that Respondent’s objection has no merit.'*? In particular, Claimant cites the United States’
statement that the “time limitations period in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) must ... relate
to the particular investment for which the investor seeks a remedy for the breach and

loss”.'#4 In Claimant’s view, “Canada’s proposed dates for the commencement of the

157. In addition, Claimant raises no objection to the United States’ submission that “a
continuing course of conduct ... does not renew the limitations period”, but argues that this
principle is irrelevant in the present case. According to Claimant, its claim relates to the
invalidation of its Zyprexa and Strattera Patents, which occurred within the three-year
limitation period, and its references to earlier Federal Court decisions are appropriate to

provide factual context for this claim. '“°

(2) Respondent’s Observations

158. Like Claimant, Respondent makes observations concerning Article 1128 submissions
generally before addressing the specific submissions of the United States and Mexico.!4”
In particular, Respondent asserts that the submissions of the NAFTA Parties in this and
other proceedings reflect a common interpretation of NAFTA Articles 1105, 1110, 1116
and 1117.'48 In accordance with VCLT Article 31(3), the Tribunal must give “considerable

weight” to this agreement of the NAFTA Parties.'”

159. Referring to the specific submissions of the United States and Mexico on Articles 1116
and 1117, Respondent argues that the NAFTA Parties have a shared understanding of the
NAFTA limitation period. For Respondent, three points of agreement are particularly
relevant: (i) the limitation period is “not subject to any suspension, prolongation, or other

qualification”;'°° (ii) it begins to run when the investor first acquires knowledge of the

course of conduct cannot stop or renew the time-bar clock. !°? For Respondent, the result
of applying this common interpretation to the present case is that “Claimant’s recast

challenge to the ‘promise utility doctrine’ per se is time-barred”. °°
E. The Tribunal’s Analysis

1) Timeliness of Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objection
Pp J

160. The Parties disagree as to whether Respondent’s jurisdictional objection should be barred
as untimely under Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal need not decide
this issue, as Respondent’s objection must be dismissed in any event for the reasons set

forth below.

(2) Claimant’s Compliance with NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)

161. The three-year limitation period set forth in NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) begins
to run on “the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired,
knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or
damage”. As a consequence, the merits of Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction ratione temporis turn on the identity of the “alleged breach”.

162. Respondent has endeavored to show that the basis of Claimant’s claim is the alleged
promise utility doctrine, adopted by the Canadian judiciary in decisions issued from 2002

to 2008.

163. However, as Claimant is the Party asserting the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide its

substantive claim, the “alleged breach” must, in the first instance, be identified by reference

151 Respondent’s Observations on 1128 Submissions 98, citing, inter alia, Mexico Article 1128 Submission 4 (“once
the investor first acquires knowledge of the alleged breach and that it has suffered damage, the limitation period for
filing a claim commences and will end at the three-year mark regardless of whether the impugned measure continues
thereafter”); United States Article 1128 Submission 4 (“An investor or enterprise first acquires knowledge of an
alleged breach and loss at a particular moment in time ... Such knowledge cannot first be acquired at multiple points

to Claimant’s submissions. '*4 Claimant has repeatedly asserted that the measure at issue is
the Canadian courts’ invalidation of the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents by application of the
promise utility doctrine; Claimant denies that it is challenging the promise doctrine in the

abstract or the doctrine’s application to the Raloxifene Patent.

The Tribunal has carefully examined Claimant’s written and oral submissions to evaluate
whether Claimant’s characterization of its claim for the purpose of jurisdiction is supported
by its position on the merits. In light of Respondent’s argument that Claimant “recast” its
claim in the Reply, the Tribunal has paid particular attention to this pleading. An overall
reading of the Reply confirms that Claimant’s challenge is aimed solely at the invalidation
of the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents. '> Indeed, this is clear even if one focuses specifically
on the paragraphs of the Reply cited by Respondent for its portrayal of the claim.'*°
Claimant does not allege that the promise utility doctrine itself in the abstract is a violation

of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

Therefore, Respondent’s attempt to re-characterize Claimant’s case cannot be accepted.
The Tribunal finds that the “alleged breach” for purposes of NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and
1117(2) is the invalidation by the Canadian judiciary of the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents

through application of the promise utility doctrine.

This finding of the Tribunal about the nature of the case has repercussions both for
Respondent’s jurisdictional objection and for the Tribunal’s ability to have regard to

developments that occurred more than three years before this arbitration was initiated.

170.

With respect to jurisdiction, the critical question is obviously: when did Claimant first
acquire knowledge, or constructive knowledge, of the alleged breach and the ensuing loss?
Given the Tribunal’s finding on the identity of the alleged breach, the Tribunal sees no way
in which Claimant could have acquired the requisite knowledge before the court
invalidated the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents. An investor cannot be obliged or deemed to
know of a breach before it occurs. Further, any loss suffered by Claimant before the date
of the alleged breach with respect to a different investment (the Raloxifene Patent) is
irrelevant to the application of NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) to the investments at

issue in this arbitration (the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents).

In its Post-Hearing Memorial, Respondent appears to offer an alternative argument, that,
after the Raloxifene Decision, Claimant knew that the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents
themselves had suffered “at least some loss of value”.'°? Aside from the fact that
Respondent does not fully explain the loss that it purports here to identify, its argument
fails as a consequence of the Tribunal’s finding of the content of Claimant’s claim. Quite
simply, Claimant did not suffer, and could not have suffered, the loss of which it complains
here (i.e., invalidation of the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents) before those patents were

invalidated.

This remains true even assuming that the Raloxifene Decision increased the risk that the
Zyprexa and Strattera Patents would one day be invalidated. Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)
do not require investors to bring claims for possible future breaches on the basis of potential
(and therefore necessarily hypothetical) losses to their investments or the increased risks
of such losses. Thus, the Tribunal declines to impute knowledge of a future breach and loss

to Claimant.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds the relevant dates for the commencement of the
limitation period to be 8 December 2011 and 16 May 2013, when the Supreme Court denied
Claimant leave to appeal the invalidation of the Strattera Patent and the Zyprexa Patent,

respectively. '°* Claimant submitted its NoA on 12 September 2013, within the three-year

Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis is denied.

171. A remaining issue concerns the Tribunal’s treatment of those events that did occur more
than three years before this arbitration was initiated. Although the alleged promise utility
doctrine is not the substantive basis of Claimant’s claim, it plays a prominent role in
Claimant’s submissions. Indeed, one critical element of Claimant’s case is establishing that
judicial decisions issued from 2002 to 2008 effected a dramatic change in the Canadian

utility requirement.

172. In this context, many previous NAFTA tribunals that have found it appropriate to consider
earlier events that provide the factual background to a timely claim. As stated by the
tribunal in Glamis Gold v. United States, a claimant is permitted to cite “factual predicates”
occurring outside the limitation period, even though they are not necessarily the legal basis
for its claim.'© The tribunal in Grand River v. United States reached the same conclusion,

drawing on past decisions:

The Mondev and Feldman tribunals both considered the merits of
claims regarding events occurring during the three-year limitations
period, even though they were linked to, and required consideration
of, events prior to the limitations period or to NAFTA’s entry into
force. In Mondev, the Tribunal considered (and rejected) the
Claimant’ s claim that it had suffered a denial of justice in connection
with state court proceedings occurring after NAFTA entered into
force, although the dispute underlying the litigation arose years
before. In Feldman, the Tribunal awarded damages in respect of
discrimination occurring during the three-year limitations period,

Strattera and Zyprexa Patents on the ground of inutility were issued on 14 September 2010 and 10 November 2011,
both within the three-year limitations period. C-160/R-027, Novopharm Ltd. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 2010 FC 915; C-
146/R-016, Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd., 2011 F.C. 1288.

'5° The Tribunal notes the submissions of Respondent, Mexico and the United States stating that the limitation period
under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) is not subject to suspension, prolongation or other qualification, and that in
particular, a continuing course of State conduct cannot stop or renew the time-bar clock. In the present case, Claimant
has not advanced a theory of continued breach or otherwise advocated the suspension or extension of the limitation
period. Nor does the Tribunal adopt any such approach in reaching its decision. This case is simpler: the alleged breach
for each investment—the invalidation of the patent—occurred at a single point in time within the three-year period.

but its analysis of this and other claims again required consideration
of earlier events. !°

The Tribunal also adopts this well accepted approach. The following analysis of the merits
of Claimant’s claim will be informed where appropriate by reference to earlier relevant

events, including the Canadian judiciary’s interpretation of the utility requirement over

time. NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) in no way limit or preclude such consideration.

LIABILITY FOR JUDICIAL MEASURES UNDER NAFTA CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Parties’ Positions

(1) Claimant’s Position

Claimant rejects Respondent’s position that under international law, the only possible

theory of liability for judicial measures is a denial of justice.

In this regard, Claimant highlights Respondent’s acknowledgment that ‘a State is
responsible in international law for the conduct of its organs, including the judiciary”.!°
As stated in Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility: “[t]he conduct of
any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether

the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions”. !

Further, Claimant argues that NAFTA Chapter Eleven does not distinguish among
executive, legislative, or judicial actions.'® To the contrary, under NAFTA Article 201, a

“measure” includes “any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice”, and

(“events or conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation for the respondent State may be relevant in determining
whether the State has subsequently committed a breach of the obligation. But it must still be possible to point to
conduct of the State after that date which is itself a breach”); CL-109/RL-058, Marvin Feldman v. Mexico.

tribunals have found the terms “procedure” and “requirement” to be sufficiently broad to

encompass judicial actions involving private parties.!®

177. In Claimant’s view, Respondent has failed to explain why the creation of a new legal rule
by courts should be treated differently from the creation of the same legal rule by another
branch of government.'® The result of Respondent’s position would be to exempt all

judge-made law from the requirements of international law.'®7

178. In addition, Claimant considers Respondent’s approach to be inconsistent with the
principle that a State’s internal political system cannot alter its obligations under customary
international law. To the extent that judges serve a greater law-making function in common
law jurisdictions, those countries would be advantaged over others by a heightened

standard for judicial measures. '®

179. According to Claimant, when a national court violates a procedural norm of international
law, the State may be liable for a denial of justice, but when a court violates a substantive
rule of international law, it is “a freestanding basis of liability”.'© Professor Jan Paulsson
states in his treatise on denial of justice: “[a] national court’s breach of other [non-
procedural] rules of international law, or of treaties, is not a denial of justice, but a direct

violation of the relevant obligation imputable to the state like any acts or omissions by its

agents”.!7°

Canadian court. Reply 9332 and fn 671, citing CL-158, The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law, p.

Claimant also cites the tribunal in Azinian v. Mexico, which quoted former ICJ President

Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga’s statement that:

The responsibility of the State for acts of judicial authorities may
result from three different types of judicial decision. The first is a
decision of a municipal court clearly incompatible with a rule of
international law. The second is what is known traditionally as a
‘denial of justice.’ The third occurs when, in certain exceptional and
well-defined circumstances, a State is responsible for a judicial
decision contrary to municipal law.'7!

a. NAFTA Article 1110

In the context of its expropriation claim, Claimant argues that “tribunals have concluded
that judicial measures qualify as indirect expropriations when they result in a substantial
deprivation and violate a rule of international law”.!”? For example, in Saipem v.
Bangladesh, the tribunal found the annulment of a commercial arbitration award by the
Bangladeshi courts to be an indirect expropriation under the Italy-Bangladesh BIT. In its
analysis, the tribunal looked at two factors: (i) the impact of the court’s action, finding a
“substantial deprivation”; and (ii) whether that action was unlawful under international
law, finding that it violated, inter alia, Bangladesh’s obligations under the New York

Convention. !” Claimant cites in particular the Saipem tribunal’s statement that:

While the Tribunal concurs with the parties that expropriation by the
courts presupposes that the courts’ intervention was illegal, this does
not mean that expropriation by a court necessarily presupposes a
denial of justice. !”*

Claimant argues that other tribunals have similarly recognized that when judicial measures
violate an international obligation, they may constitute an expropriation, even in the

absence of a denial of justice. These include the tribunals in: (i) ATA v. Jordan, which

decision of a court in fact depriving an owner of the use and benefit of his property may

amount to an expropriation of such property that is attributable to the state of that court”.!””

b. NAFTA Article 1105

183. In the context of its claim under NAFTA Article 1105, Claimant argues that multiple
arbitral awards have confirmed that denial of justice is not the only protection against
judicial action offered by the minimum standard of treatment. In particular, Claimant relies

upon:

a. Liman Caspian Oil v. Kazakhstan, in which the tribunal observed that denial of justice
is just one example of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, and that the standards
of fair and equitable treatment and denial of justice “are not synonymous” with respect

to acts of courts;!78

b. White Industries v. India, in which the tribunal analysed the acts of India’s courts under
three distinct aspects (denial of justice, protection of legitimate expectations and

transparency);!”? and

c. Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic, in which the tribunal considered whether a court

184. Claimant also points to Mondev v. United States. Although the tribunal in that case found
no violation of Article 1105, it considered whether the court decision at issue was based on
a retroactive application of new law, suggesting that if this could be shown, the claimant

would not have been confined to arguing a denial of justice. '*!

185. According to Claimant, Respondent cannot identify a single arbitral decision supporting
its position that a denial of justice is the only basis of liability for court decisions. '*? Waste
Management v. Mexico, Azinian v. Mexico and Loewen vy. United States cannot help
Respondent, because in the specific circumstances of each of those cases, denial of justice

was the only relevant theory of liability before the tribunal.'**

(2) Respondent’s Position

186. As its primary defence, Respondent asserts that “Claimant has failed to state a claim under
Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1) for a breach of Articles 1110 and 1105 because it admits that
there has been no denial of justice”.!*+ Respondent accepts that a State is responsible under
international law for the conduct of all of its organs, including the judiciary, but contends
that different State functions attract different types of liability. According to Respondent,
the only substantive obligation under NAFTA Chapter Eleven with respect to judicial

measures is to ensure that the investments of an investor from another NAFTA Party are

187. Respondent denies that this rule advantages common law jurisdictions over civil law
jurisdictions, where the role of the courts is more limited. According to Respondent, the

adjudicative function in both systems is protected by the same rule of denial of justice. !8’

a. NAFTA Article 1110

188. Focusing specifically on Claimant’s claim under Article 1110, Respondent argues that
denial of justice is the only basis on which a domestic court judgment on the validity of a

property right could constitute an expropriation. !**

189. To support this position, Respondent cities the tribunal’s statement in Loewen v. United
States that: “[i]n the circumstances of this case, a claim alleging an appropriation in
violation of Article 1110 can succeed only if Loewen establishes a denial of justice under
Article 1105”.'®° Similarly, Respondent points to Azinian v. Mexico, which involved a

contract found to be invalid by the Mexican court. The tribunal determined that in the

absence of a denial of justice, the domestic court’s ruling must stand. !°°

190. Respondent rejects Claimant’s main submission that domestic court decisions can be
expropriatory if they violate a rule of international law. According to Respondent, if
Claimant’s position is accepted, “NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunals will be transformed

both into tribunals with plenary jurisdiction over all international treaties and supranational

courts of appeal in domestic property law issues”.!°!

191. According to Respondent, Claimant’s approach confuses distinct international law
obligations. The international law on expropriation requires first establishing the existence
of a property right under domestic law, and an investor “cannot circumvent an adverse
determination of its rights at domestic law simply by pointing to an alleged inconsistency

with some other, independent international obligation owed between States”. !°*

192. In Respondent’s view, Claimant bases its proposed rule on a mischaracterisation of past
arbitral decisions, beginning with the speech of Judge Aréchaga that was quoted by the
Azinian tribunal. Respondent contends that this speech concerned State responsibility
generally, not the international rules governing expropriation or the possibility of judicial
expropriation. It stands for nothing more than the proposition that States are responsible
for the acts of their courts.'°> Thus, the Azinian tribunal, after quoting Judge Aréchaga on
that point, proceeded to hold that there was no expropriation because the claimant had not

proven a denial of justice.!°*

193. Respondent also denies that Saipem v. Bangladesh supports Claimant’s position, arguing
that (i) “the asserted right at issue in Saipem was an international arbitral award, not a right
purely derived from domestic law”; and (ii) the tribunal based its holding of expropriation
on its finding that the Bangladeshi courts’ conduct was so irregular that it amounted to
abuse of right.!°° Respondent points to commentary suggesting that Saipem was in fact
about judicial conduct amounting to a denial of justice, but the tribunal was prevented from

reaching that outcome. !°°

194. In addition, Respondent opposes Claimant’s reliance on Professor Paulsson’s statement
that when “national courts disregard or misapply international law, they are subject to

international censure like any other organ of a state”.!°’ According to Respondent, given

that the first step of the expropriation analysis—identifying the property right—is purely a
question of domestic law, the most apt quotation from Professor Paulsson, which Claimant
also cites, is: “[t]o the extent that national courts disregard or misapply national law, their
errors do not generate international responsibility unless [there is] technical or procedural

denial of justice”. !°*

195. Respondent argues that Claimant cannot point to any (i) examples of a judicial
expropriation in the absence of a denial of justice; (ii) instances where a judicial
determination that a property right was invalid under domestic law was found to be an

expropriation under international law; or (iii) evidence of state practice. !°

b. NAFTA Article 1105

196. In the context of NAFTA Article 1105, Respondent points to the FTC Note, which makes
clear that the only source of obligations in Article 1105 is the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment of aliens. Respondent argues that denial of justice is the
only rule of customary international law applicable to State organs exercising an

adjudicative function.2” Thus, Claimant has not stated a claim under Article 1105.

197. Respondent points to the statement of the tribunal in Waste Management II that to establish
a breach of Article 1105, the conduct must have either been “arbitrary, grossly unfair,
unjust or idiosyncratic” or “involve[d] a lack of due process leading to an outcome which
offends judicial propriety—as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice

in judicial proceedings...”.?°! According to Respondent, this requirement is confirmed by

198. According to Respondent, the Mondev v. United States tribunal recognized that domestic
courts are to be afforded substantial deference, and that NAFTA tribunals cannot “‘second-
guess the reasoned decisions of the highest courts of a State”.?°? Respondent relies upon
the finding of the Mondev tribunal that even if a domestic court were to elaborate a new
interpretation of the law, as Claimant alleges in this case, this is not unexpected in a
common law jurisdiction. In the absence of a denial of justice, there would be no violation

of Article 1105.7

199. To the extent that Claimant argues that the minimum standard of treatment prohibits
conduct other than a denial of justice, Respondent argues that Claimant bears the burden
of establishing the existence of such rules and has failed to do so.2 In its view, arbitral
decisions can elucidate but not create state practice and opinio juris. Thus, reliance on such

decisions does not help Claimant meet its evidentiary burden.?°°

Third, in Frontier Petroleum Services v. Czech Republic, the tribunal essentially found that
there had been no denial of justice.” Furthermore, Respondent highlights that no breach
of the fair and equitable treatment standard was found in these three cases, demonstrating

the high threshold for court actions to constitute a breach.7!°
B. NAFTA Party Article 1128 Submissions

(1) Mexico

201. Mexico agrees with the statement by the United States in the context of other NAFTA
proceedings that customary international law has crystallized a minimum standard of
treatment in only a few areas, one of which is fair and equitable treatment.?!! In the

particular case of judicial acts of a State, Mexico’s view is that there are

fundamental distinctions that international law has made and
continues to make between acts of the judiciary and the acts of other
organs of the State. International tribunals defer to the acts of

expert in matters of a State’s domestic law, but also because of the
judiciary’s role in the organisation of the State.7!”

justice is the only rule of customary international law clearly identified and established so

far as part of the minimum standard of treatment of aliens.

204. According to the United States, under international law, the actions of domestic courts are
accorded a greater presumption of regularity than legislative or administrative acts are.
Foreign nationals have no cause for complaint at international law about a domestic system
of law if it conforms to a “reasonable standard of civilized justice” and is fairly
administered.?'4 Thus, unless there is a denial of justice, international tribunals will defer

to domestic courts interpreting matters of domestic law.?!°

205. The United States provides examples of instances where a denial of justice may exist.7!°
In its view, there is a high threshold required for judicial measures to rise to the level of a

denial of justice in customary international law.

Cc. The Parties’ Observations on the NAFTA Party Article 1128 Submissions

(1) Claimant’s Observations

209. Claimant argues that the United States’ position ignores the rule that the “conduct of any
State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law”.??* In this way,
the United States’ approach would create an unworkable distinction among the functions

of government branches, and such a distinction “may provide common law jurisdictions

with an advantage over jurisdictions where judge-made law is less prevalent”.?74

International tribunals cannot favor some forms of State organization over others.??>

210. Regarding the United States’ view that investment tribunals will defer to domestic courts
interpreting domestic law, Claimant does not consider this proposition to be implicated in
this arbitration. Claimant emphasizes that it alleges that Respondent’s conduct is at odds
with its international commitments, not that the courts have misapplied Canadian law.?°
Claimant submits that the United States has recognized in other contexts that a State’s
judiciary may violate substantive international norms to the same extent that any other

branch of government may.”2”

211. Claimant specifically challenges the United States’ submission that a denial of justice is
required for judicial acts to result in an expropriation under Article 1110.2?* Claimant

argues that the United States has offered no authority to support this view, and that it has

5 Claimant notes the exception proposed by the United States: a judicial measure may constitute an expropriation
without a denial of justice where the “judiciary is not separate from other organs of the State”. According to Claimant,
“[t]his proposed exception is subjective, and simply compounds the risk that states will be subject to different rules

ignored the decisions presented by Claimant, in which tribunals have found “judicial

measures to be expropriatory based on violations of substantive norms of international

212. Claimant points to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Stop the Beach Renourishment v.
Florida Department of Environmental Protection to counter the United States’ assertion
that the concept of “judicial takings” is not recognized in US law.”! According to
Claimant, a plurality of the Court found that judicial measures can constitute takings under

the Fifth Amendment.?”

213. With regard to Article 1105, Claimant disagrees that judicial measures may form the basis
of a claim only if denial of justice is proven.*** According to Claimant, tribunals and
scholars have repeatedly recognized that a national judiciary may contravene substantive
norms protected under Article 1105, and not only procedural standards under international
law.?*4 Claimant sees the United States’ submission on this point as lacking authoritative

support. In this regard, Claimant rejects the United States’ reliance upon the article of

Professor Zachary Douglas, which in its view is not supported by authority.?*>

(2) Respondent’s Observations

214. Respondent cites the United States’ statement that “as a matter of customary international
law, international tribunals will defer to domestic courts interpreting matters of domestic

law unless there is a denial of justice”.?*°

215. According to Respondent, “[a]ll three NAFTA Parties agree that where a neutral and
independent domestic court determines legal rights, there can be no expropriation under
Article 1110”.7°” In this regard, Respondent highlights the United States’ observations that
the concept of judicial takings is not recognized under U.S. law, and that in the international

context, there is a “dearth” of precedents.”°*

216. With respect to Article 1105, Respondent points out that the NAFTA Parties’ agree that
denial of justice is the only basis on which judicial measures can breach the minimum
standard of treatment.”°°

217. For Respondent, this agreed interpretation of Articles 1110 and 1105 is fatal to Claimant’s
claim, as there is no allegation that the Federal Courts that invalidated the Zyprexa and

Strattera Patents were not acting as neutral and independent arbiters.7“°

D. The Tribunal’s Analysis

218. The issue of a respondent State’s liability, in proceedings such as this, for the decisions and
actions of its courts is much disputed. The debate about whether such liability is restricted
to conduct that amounts to a denial of justice turns on how denial of justice is defined.
There was considerable discussion of this issue in the Hearing, including whether there is
a distinction to be drawn between a substantive denial of justice and the requirements of

procedural due process, and whether the concept of denial of justice encompasses notions

of egregious irrationality or manifest unreasonableness. At bottom, Respondent’s position
appears to be that, as long as it is possible to say that a court acted on a reasoned and
rational basis, no question of liability could arise, whether, for present purposes, under

either NAFTA Article 1105 or Article 1110.

This acknowledges the possibility that a decision of a court, or other judicial conduct, that
falls so far below accepted minimum standards—in the words of counsel for Respondent,

that “had a result that was so surprising that propriety and competence had to be

 

questioned” —might engage the liability of the respondent State. The Tribunal agrees with
this acknowledgment by Respondent. The question that follows is whether conduct that
does not constitute a denial of justice may nonetheless be capable of qualifying as a

violation of NAFTA Articles 1105 or 1110.

For the reasons and conclusions set out in the section that follows on the utility requirement
under Canadian law, the Tribunal does not need to reach a decision on the Parties’
submissions on these issues, and judicial economy dictates that it should not do so. Having
regard to the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal accordingly limits itself to the following

brief observations on these points.

First, the judiciary is an organ of the State. Judicial acts will therefore in principle be
attributable to the State by reference to uncontroversial principles of attribution under the
law of State responsibility. As a matter of broad proposition, therefore, it is possible to
contemplate circumstances in which a judicial act (or omission) may engage questions of
expropriation under NAFTA Article 1110, such as, perhaps, in circumstances in which a
judicial decision crystallizes a taking alleged to be contrary to NAFTA Article 1110. This
said, the Tribunal emphasizes the point made below in respect of NAFTA Article 1105(1)
that a NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal is not an appellate tier in respect of the decisions

of national judiciaries.

Second, as regards NAFTA Article 1105(1), the Tribunal accepts in principle the analysis
and conclusions of the NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal in Glamis Gold on the content of
the customary international law minimum standard of treatment addressed in NAFTA

Article 1105(1) and, in particular, its conclusion as follows:

64

223.

The Tribunal therefore holds that a violation of the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment, as codified in
Article 1105 of the NAFTA, requires an act that is sufficiently
egregious and shocking—a gross denial of justice, manifest
arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process,
evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons—so as to fall
below accepted international standards and constitute a breach of
Article 1105. Such a breach may be exhibited by a “gross denial of
justice or manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable
international standards;” or the creation by the State of objective
expectations in order to induce investment and the subsequent
repudiation of those expectations. The Tribunal emphasizes that,
although bad faith may often be present in such a determination and
its presence certainly will be determinative of a violation, a finding
of bad faith is not a requirement for a breach of Article 1105(1).74!

 

Third, adopting this analysis, it is evident that there are distinctions to be made between
conduct that may amount to a denial (or gross denial) of justice and other conduct that may
also be sufficiently egregious and shocking, such as manifest arbitrariness or blatant
unfairness. It is also apparent, in the Tribunal’s view, that concepts of manifest arbitrariness
and blatant unfairness are capable, as a matter of hypothesis, of attaching to the conduct or
decisions of courts. It follows, in the Tribunal’s view, that a claimed breach of the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment requirement of NAFTA
Article 1105(1) may be properly a basis for a claim under NAFTA Article 1105
notwithstanding that it is not cast in denial of justice terms. As noted above, the conduct
of the judiciary will in principle be attributable to the State by reference to uncontroversial
principles of State responsibility. As a matter of principle, therefore, having regard to the
content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, the Tribunal is
unwilling to shut the door to the possibility that judicial conduct characterized other than
as a denial of justice may engage a respondent’s obligations under NAFTA Article 1105,
within the standard articulated in the award in Glamis. The Tribunal considers that this
assessment is consistent with the approach, inter alia, of the NAFTA Chapter Eleven

tribunal in Mondev, with which it is content to agree.

226.

VII.

227.

Fourth, this said, as has also already been noted, the Tribunal emphasizes that a NAFTA
Chapter Eleven tribunal is not an appellate tier in respect of the decisions of the national
judiciary. It is not the task of a NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal to review the findings of
national courts and considerable deference is to be accorded to the conduct and decisions
of such courts. It will accordingly only be in very exceptional circumstances, in which
there is clear evidence of egregious and shocking conduct, that it will be appropriate for a
NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal to assess such conduct against the obligations of the
respondent State under NAFTA Article 1105(1).

Fifth, the Tribunal notes that NAFTA Article 1110(1)(c) includes the requirement that, to
be concordant with NAFTA Article 1110(1), the nationalization or expropriation of an
investment must be “in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1)”. As
regards decisions of the national judiciary, the interplay between obligations under NAFTA
Articles 1105(1) and 1110 will be a matter for careful assessment in any given case, subject
to the controlling appreciation that a NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal is not an appellate

tier with a mandate to review the decisions of the national judiciary

Sixth, as will emerge from the discussion and conclusion in the section that follows, the
Tribunal has concluded that the factual predicate, in this case, that would be necessary to
sustain Claimant’s case of a breach of Article 1105(1) and/or Article 1110 has not been
established. Regardless of the debate about the denial of justice limits of liability of a
respondent State, therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant’s case does not meet the

threshold requirement to proceed under this head.

THE ALLEGED DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE UTILITY REQUIREMENT
UNDER CANADIAN LAW

The Parties’ Positions

(1) Claimant’s Position

Claimant argues that the promise utility doctrine is a radical departure from Canada’s

traditional utility standard and the utility standards applied by Canada’s NAFTA partners,

66

228.

229.

the United States and Mexico.” It claims that for decades Canada applied the traditional
utility test for which a “mere scintilla” of utility sufficed, and under that test,
pharmaceutical patents were never found to lack utility until the advent of the promise

utility doctrine in the mid-2000s.747

a. The Traditional Utility Test

According to Claimant, in the mid-1990s when NAFTA entered into force and when the
Zyprexa and Strattera patents were granted, the utility requirement enshrined in the Patent
Act had “a well-established meaning that was applied by the Federal Courts, the Patent
Office, and inventors”.*“* It was a “mere scintilla” test, under which “very little” or a “slight
amount” of utility satisfied the low threshold of utility required.*4> Patents that were held
to lack utility under this standard were wholly inoperable.”*° Claimant’s expert Professor
Siebrasse points to two classic examples of inoperable inventions: a “death ray” and a
“perpetual motion machine”.*” In other words, so long as an invention was capable of
being put to a specific use, even if that use had no commercial value, then it was “useful”

under the Patent Act.”4*

As evidence of the low threshold for utility, Claimant asserts that from 1980 to 2004 there
were only 28 utility challenges in Canadian trial courts.” Four of the challenges related
to pharmaceutical patents, all of which eventually were found to be useful under the Patent

Act.2° Claimant contends that this “point bears emphasis: for a quarter of a century — from

1980 to 2004 — not a single pharmaceutical patent was found to lack utility in any Canadian

court”.25!

Claimant also points to the Manual of Patent Office Practice (“MOPOP”), which it
characterizes as “guidelines relied upon by patent examiners as a practical summary of
applicable patent law in Canada”.* According to Claimant, Section 12 of the 1990

MOPOP restated the application of the “mere scintilla” to pharmaceutical patents.”

Claimant’s expert, Mr. Wilson, explained that patent examiner practice under the

traditional utility test was in keeping with MOPOP guidance and the “mere scintilla” test:

Unless the examiner had reason to doubt that the invention worked,
the inquiry [into utility] ended there . . . . [I]t was neither required
nor typical for applicants to provide much, if any, data derived from
real world use, whether through clinical data of pharmaceuticals, or
through road testing of machines.”

According to Claimant, if a utility challenge arose during this era, then “testing or other
evidence that had been generated after the date of the patent application” could be used to
show utility.°> Such evidence took two forms, according to Claimant’s expert. First,
commercial success of a patent “was considered good evidence of utility on the view that
a useless invention could not be commercially successful”.*°° Second, evidence of post-
filing testing could prove utility on the assumption that “if a process works today, it must
also have worked yesterday. The fact that it was not tested yesterday does not mean it did

not work yesterday”.2>7

According to Claimant, the traditional utility test requiring a “mere scintilla” of utility was

consistent with the requirement in NAFTA Chapter 17 that patents be made available for,

inter alia, inventions that are “capable of industrial application”.*°* It was also consistent

with a low threshold for utility required in the United States and Mexico.?°?

b. Creation of the Promise Utility Doctrine

Claimant argues that a decade later, in the mid-2000s, after the patents for Zyprexa and
Strattera were granted but before they were invalidated by the courts, Canada’s utility
requirement “underwent a dramatic transformation” as the promise utility doctrine

emerged.”

Claimant submits that the promise utility standard imposes three elements that drastically
depart from the traditional utility test. In practice, the three elements operate as an
integrated, single, heightened utility requirement.”*! First, patent examiners and judges
seek to identify a “promise” in the patent disclosure, and this promise becomes the
measuring stick for utility. Second, evidence submitted with the patent application to show
fulfilment of any promise in the patent description is subject to heightened scrutiny, and
post-filing evidence such as commercial use may not be relied upon. Third, pre-filing
evidence may not be considered to support a sound prediction unless that pre-filing

evidence was referenced in the patent application itself.?°

c. Promise Standard
Claimant asserts that, since 2005, “the Canadian courts have identified or inferred
additional promises of utility from the disclosure that go beyond the utility of the claimed

invention, imposing an elevated requirement for utility”.*°? Thus, identifying the patent’s

“promise” is “inherently arbitrary and unpredictable”, and a promise may be found even if

not intended as such.?*+ Claimant cites the statement of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Sanofi-Aventis that “[a]n inventor whose invention is described in a patent which would
otherwise be valid can nonetheless promise more for his invention than required by the Act

so as to render his patent invalid’”.?°

Claimant’s expert, Professor Siebrasse, opines that the “standard against which utility is
assessed now has two branches. The first branch corresponds to the long standing
requirement of a mere scintilla of utility, while the second branch sets an elevated standard

according to the ‘promise of the patent’”.?® Essentially, according to Claimant, a patentee

can now invalidate its own patent—one which would have easily satisfied the mere scintilla

 

test—if it inadvertently over-promised what the invention could do.

Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s contention that the promise utility doctrine has been
long “recognized as an integral part of Canadian law”.?®7 In particular, it argues that
Consolboard, a Supreme Court case from 1981, which Respondent claims is the seminal
decision on the utility standard, actually has nothing to do with the promise utility doctrine
at all. In Consolboard, the Supreme Court of Canada, quoting with approval Halsbury’s
Laws of England, a comprehensive narrative statement of English law, stated that an
invention lacks utility if “the invention will not work, either in the sense that it will not
operate at all or, more broadly, that it will not do what the specification promises to do”.7°*
According to Claimant, the use of the word “promise” in Consolboard is not akin to its
meaning within the promise utility doctrine; it is simply “shorthand for the invention’s
intended use”.*® Thus, the holding of Consolboard actually reaffirms the low bar for utility

and the “mere scintilla test”.?”? In any event, Professor Siebrasse opines that Canadian

d. Post-Filing Evidence

241. Claimant asserts that a second major change in Canadian patent law raised the evidentiary
burden on patentees to prove any “promises” of utility. Claimant’s position is that this
change occurred in 2002, when the Canadian Supreme Court ruled in AZT that evidence of
utility such as scientific effectiveness and commercial use is inadmissible if it was
generated after the filing date of the patent.?’* According to Claimant, AZT reversed a
contrary Federal Court of Appeal ruling below and overturned the prior ruling of the

Federal Court of Appeal in Ciba-Geigy.”” In Ciba-Geigy, the court held:

if indeed what is in the patent specification was mere speculation or
prediction, the speculation or prediction having turned out to be true,
ought to be considered to have been well founded at the time it was
made.?8°

242. Claimant rejects Respondent’s position that the ban on post-filing evidence predates

AZT.**' Claimant contends that there is “voluminous case law allowing post-filing

282

evidence of utility” prior to that case.“°“ Respondent’s argument that these cases relate to

operability is misplaced, given that operability is the core of the utility requirement.?**

243. Claimant argues that Respondent cannot point to a single utility case before AZT excluding

post-filing evidence.*** Respondent’s reliance on inventorship disputes is unavailing

298 See C-213/R-004, Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., 2002 SCC 77, at 146, 80-85. According to Claimant,

because as such disputes do not require any proof of utility; they concern who filed for a

patent first.2°5

Claimant also points to testimony from the Hearing to show the novelty of AZT. Professor
Siebrasse testified that, prior to AZT, no commercially successful product was ever held to
lack utility.?°° Indeed, Respondent’s expert, Mr. Dimock, could not identify a single such
case.?8’ Nor could Mr. Dimock cite any case before 2002 in which a court expressly

disallowed a patentee to rely on post-filing evidence to prove utility.7**

e. Disclosure for Sound Prediction

Claimant submits that another heightened evidentiary burden was imposed beginning with
the 2008 Raloxifene Decision. This was the first time a Canadian court declined to consider
pre-filing evidence of soundly predicted utility that was not disclosed in the patent.?®? Now,
when utility is based on a sound prediction, the patent must contain the factual basis for

that prediction, including the evidence and line of reasoning that supports the prediction.

Again, Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument that this is a long standing rule in Canadian
law. According to Claimant, Respondent primarily relies on Monsanto, a 1979 decision of
the Supreme Court of Canada, which does not support its position.?”° Rather, “Monsanto
reversed a decision of the CIPO Patent Appeal Board that effectively required disclosure
of the factual basis for sound prediction”.??! Further, the court held that the burden is on
the patent office to disprove utility, not on the applicant to prove it.” Indeed, at the

Hearing, Respondent’s expert, Mr. Dimock, conceded that Monsanto did not expressly

require disclosure of the factual basis for sound prediction.?*> Claimant accepts
Respondent’s point that Monsanto draws upon a 1969 English decision, Olin Mathieson.?*
However, in Claimant’s view, Olin Mathieson actually stands for the proposition that that

evidence supporting sound prediction does not need to be in the patent.””°

Claimant also accepts that the court in the Raloxifene Decision applied language from AZT
regarding disclosure, but according to Claimant, the “AZT ruling itself expressly declined
to decide what would be considered ‘proper disclosure’ where utility is based on a sound

tian? 2
prediction”.”°°

Claimant asserts that the testimony of Respondent’s witness and expert at the hearing
demonstrates the novelty of the rule. For example, Dr. Gillen explained that it was only
after the Raloxifene Decision that Patent Office examiners were instructed to require the
factual basis and line of reasoning for sound prediction to be in the patent itself.2°7 Mr.
Dimock conceded that: (i) there were no cases between the 2002 AZT decision and the
Raloxifene Decision that imposed an additional disclosure requirement for sound
prediction;”° (ii) during that same period, the Federal Court of Appeal considered evidence
from outside the patent in a sound prediction case;””” and (iii) the scope of this evidentiary

rule is still in dispute.*°°

f£ MOPOP Amendments and CIPO Practice

Claimant submits that MOPOP amendments in 2009 and 2010 incorporated all three
elements of the promise utility doctrine and demonstrate the sea-change in the law on

utility.°°! For example, Chapter 12 of MOPOP was revised in 2009 to include for the first

Dimock Testimony, Tr. 1086:6-10 (“Agree or disagree. Monsanto made no finding that the factual basis had to be

disclosed? MR. DIMOCK: It didn’t make that explicit finding. Yes, it did not.”).

time a utility requirement that an inventor had to meet every “promise” made in the patent

application.*°

In addition, the 2010 MOPOP included the requirement that the factual basis for a sound
prediction be disclosed in the description.*” It also included a new section entitled “Office
Actions on Utility,” which would have been useless before 2005 when rejections on the

ground of utility were rare.*

Claimant submits that “MOPOP is a reliable restatement of Canadian patent law’,
reflecting the Canadian Patent Office’s interpretation of the Patent Act.*°° It follows that
the 1990s MOPOPs represented the Canadian utility requirement when the Zyprexa and
Strattera patents were issued, and that the 2009 and 2010 MOPOPs show the dramatic
change that occurred thereafter.*°° According to Claimant, neither of these points is

rebutted by Respondent’s characterization of MOPOP as a “high-level summary”.*””

For Claimant, there is no question that the MOPOP amendments were based on changes in
Canadian law. The new MOPOP sections on utility and sound prediction contain citations
to new cases, including AZT and the Raloxifene Decision, as acknowledged by Dr.
Gillen.*° Claimant asserts that MOPOP did not cite the “promise” language in

Consolboard until the 2000s.5

Claimant further argues that the “dramatic changes to the MOPOP were accompanied by
parallel changes in Patent Office practice”.*'° According to Claimant, utility objections

were raised for the first time in Office Actions in the mid-2000s.*!! Indeed, Respondent’s

experts were unable to identify any example of a patent application rejected on the basis of

the promise utility doctrine prior to the 2000s.

Finally, Claimant asserts that the reactions of several CIPO examiners, who expressed
concerns and confusion about how to implement the new MOPOP sections on utility, serve

as contemporaneous evidence of the dramatic change in the law on utility.*!?

g. Statistical Evidence

Claimant also puts forth statistical evidence on the number of patents that were invalidated
by Canadian courts for inutility, arguing that this data reflects the dramatic change in the
law. Claimant asserts that since 2005, there has been a “sudden and unprecedented spike”
in patent invalidations by courts for lack of utility, and that this change is exclusively in
the pharmaceutical sector.*!? Claimant updated its statistical evidence at the Hearing to

show that:

In the early period utility was rarely challenged in that sector and
never successfully but, since 2005, given the change in Canada’s
test, utility challenges have spiked and 28 cases (41 percent) have
been successful.3!4

Claimant argues that Respondent has given no plausible alternate explanation for the spike
in invalidations based on inutility. In particular, Claimant challenges Respondent’s position
that the spike is somehow due to the end of compulsory licensing and the introduction of
the PM(NOC) regulations in 1993.>'> Not only did those changes take place more than 10
years before the spike in 2005, but the increased volume of litigation does not account for

the increase in the rate of invalidations.*'© Further, according to Claimant, Respondent’s

attempt to rely on case-specific factors (such as experience of the fact finder and the

evidence presented) fails to explain the overall increase in invalidations.?!”

Finally, Claimant does not accept that changing the cut-off date between pre- and post-
2005 invalidations (from 1 January to 2 September 2005), as Respondent suggests, would
diminish the evidence of a dramatic change; the jump in invalidations would still be
significant, from 2 to 26 (rather than 0 to 28).*!® Claimant accepts that the rate of
invalidities in the pre-2005 category would increase but argues that this is due to the small

data set.>"

hh. Comparison with Other Jurisdictions

Claimant argues that the dramatic change in Canadian law is also evident from the “recent
divergence” between the utility requirement in Canada and in the other NAFTA Parties.*”°
According to Claimant, the utility requirement remains a low bar in both the United States
and Mexico.*?! This difference in law is reflected in “a stark divergence in outcomes”;
while invalidations based on utility have become frequent in Canada, utility “is a non-issue
in the rest of North America’”.*? In this regard, Claimant’s expert, Professor Merges, cited
a survey of 239 cases in the United States over several years in which only one patent was
found invalid for lack utility.*?? Claimant also points to the testimony of Respondent’s
expert on Mexican law, Ms. Lindner, confirming that no Mexican patent has ever been

invalidated for lack of “industrial application” (the utility standard in Mexico).°7*

262.

According to Claimant, in comparing the utility requirement across the NAFTA
jurisdictions, it is inappropriate to consider other, distinct patentability requirements (e.g.,
enablement), as Respondent attempts to do. In any event, even comparing patent law as a
whole across NAFTA jurisdictions, Canada remains an “outlier”, as demonstrated by the
difference in invalidations.*?° For Claimant, this explains why the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative (“USTR”), in its “Special 301” report, has expressed “serious concerns”

regarding Canada’s heightened patent utility standards since 2013.*?°

Claimant also points to negotiating documents of the World Intellectual Property
Organization (“WIPO”) to show a broader global consensus on the meaning of utility.
Claimant states that this evidence “confirms that Canada’s promise utility doctrine
constitutes a new and radical departure from the traditional patent law concept of utility,

as reflected in the laws of many countries”.*?7

i. Legitimate Expectations

Claimant submits that it had “legitimate expectations that its Zyprexa and Strattera patents
would not be invalidated on the basis of a radically new utility requirement.”**8 According
to Claimant, this expectation was reasonably grounded in (i) Canadian patent law, (ii)
Respondent’s grant of the Strattera and Zyprexa Patents, and (iii) Respondent’s

international commitments under NAFTA and the PCT.*”°

Claimant argues that multiple NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunals have held the that NAFTA
Article 1105 protects expectations that are reasonable in light of the respondent’s conduct,

including its established legal and regulatory framework.?°°

263. In this regard, Claimant alleges that it reasonably relied upon the traditional utility
requirement in Canadian patent law throughout the process of developing Zyprexa and
Strattera, and continued to do so as it brought the drugs to market.**! For support, Claimant
offers the testimony of Eli Lilly’s former General Counsel, Mr. Armitage, and the
executives who oversaw the launch of the two products.**? These witnesses testify that
confidence in the ability to secure patent protection was critical to the decision to proceed

with launch of the drugs in Canada.**

264. Claimant further submits that its legitimate expectations were also based on Respondent’ s
specific commitments to Claimant with respect to the patent protection of Strattera and
Zyprexa.*** First, Respondent's traditional utility requirement was a specific commitment
to Claimant because patentability standards are technical regulations aimed at, and relied
upon, by a discrete identifiable group.**> Second, Respondent made a commitment to
Claimant in the form of the grant of the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents themselves.**°
According to Claimant, the patents specifically assured Claimant that it would have
exclusive rights to make, use, and sell its invention until the expiry of the patents. Thus, in
Claimant’s view, the patents were more than mere representations; they were bundles of

legally enforceable rights.**”

265. According to Claimant, it relied upon the Strattera and Zyprexa Patents when making

significant investment decisions in relation to the drugs, such as investing in regulatory

approvals and marketing.*** In this context, Claimant cites the testimony of Mr.

launch”).

   

344 As a legal matter, Claimant rejects Respondent’s position that legitimate expectations must be based on a State’s
specific commitments to an investor, but as a factual matter, Claimant states that Respondent did in fact make such
commitments.

Postlethwait and Ms. Nobles, who state that patent protection was critical to the market

success of both products.*?

266. In response to Respondent’s argument that patents are subject to judicial invalidation and
therefore cannot be the basis of legitimate expectations, Claimant contends that the normal
tisk of invalidation is different from the unacceptable risk that a patent will be tested against
a new patentability requirement that could not have been foreseen at the time the patent

was granted.*°

267. Claimant also relies on Respondent’s international obligations. According to Claimant, its
“legitimate expectations were reinforced by NAFTA Chapter 17, under which Canada was
obligated not to develop and retroactively apply a doctrine like the promise utility
doctrine”.**! Specifically with regard to the Strattera Patent, Claimant asserts that it had a
legitimate expectation that its application, which was valid under the PCT, would be
sufficient to meet Canadian requirements. For Claimant, this follows from the fact that the
PCT (i) does not require evidence of the utility of an invention to be disclosed, and (ii)
prohibits member countries from imposing additional or different form and content

requirements. **”

268. Claimant contends that its expectations of patent protection were objectively reasonable.
In this regard, Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument that Claimant’s expectations were
insufficiently informed.*4? According to Claimant, it has a network of qualified patent
agents and attorneys to advise management and ensure compliance with Canadian patent

law.** For Claimant, the reason that none of these experts gave specific advice on the

utility requirement in relation to the filing of the Strattera and Zyprexa Patents is precisely
because the traditional utility test was well understood to be a low bar, and analysis was
not required.*° Thus, Claimant contends that its expectations were reasonably rooted in
Canadian patent law as it existed at the time of its investments, before the law underwent

a dramatic change.

269. Claimant’s position is that the dramatic change in the Canadian utility requirement was
outside the “acceptable margin of change” that investors must anticipate.*#° Therefore, in
its view, the invalidation of the Strattera and Zyprexa Patents through application of the
promise utility doctrine violated its legitimate expectations. In this regard, Claimant draws
“a distinction between measured change in the law or clarification of previously unsettled

law, on the one hand, and the adoption of a completely new doctrine in a well-settled area,

on the other”.*#” According to Claimant, it could not reasonably have expected that
Canadian courts would create and then retroactively apply a new utility requirement.*#*
Furthermore, for Claimant, “it is not just the extent of the change that is striking. It is also

the inconsistency between Canada’s new promise utility doctrine and relevant international

treaties and practices.”

(2) Respondent’s Position

270. Respondent rejects Claimant’s allegation of a recent sea-change in the Canadian law on
utility. According to Respondent, the term “useful” is not defined in the Patent Act, and its

meaning has therefore necessarily evolved through jurisprudence. Respondent argues that

patents around the world, and in the case of Canada included highly competent Canadian patent agents located in
Canada who routinely provided that kind of advice to Lilly”).

was so low”).

what Claimant presents as a unitary “promise utility doctrine” is in reality three distinct

long-standing patent law rules, discussed below.

a. Promise Standard

271. According to Respondent, the first long-standing rule is that a patentee will be held to any

promises contained in the patent. Utility has long been a bifurcated standard.**”

272. Respondent observes that Claimant has narrowed its allegation regarding the promise
standard, such that the “dramatic change that it now alleges occurred in 2005 is not holding
patentees to promises of utility per se, but holding them to promises found in the disclosure
portion of the patent”.*>! Respondent finds this to be a confusing aspect of Claimant's case,
as Claimant continues to rely on cases where the promise was found in the language of the

claims (rather than the disclosure) as examples of the promise utility doctrine.*°”

273. In any event, Respondent argues that even Claimant’s narrowed allegation is incorrect.

Indeed, Respondent points out that Claimant itself acknowledged that the promise standard

was an established principle of patent law in submissions to the Supreme Court.*?

Claimant’s expert, Professor Siebrasse, in his academic writing, also recognized the place

of the promise doctrine in earlier Canadian law.***

350 Counter-Memorial (92, quoting R-050, E. Richard Gold and Michael Shortt, “The Promise of the Patent in Canada
and Around the World”, 30:1 Canadian Intellectual Property Review 35, 54 June 2014 (“First, where the patent
document itself makes no promise of utility, a ‘mere scintilla of utility’ will suffice; this requirement has normally
been interpreted as requiring that the invention produce some minimally useful result. Second, where the inventor
makes a promise, the patent will have utility only if it fulfils that promise, regardless of whether it possesses a scintilla
of utility”).

351 R-PHM {1 13. See Tr. 911:4-19 (“MR. REDDON: In my report, and I think I’m very clear, it’s not so much suddenly

274. Respondent points to what it considers “extensive historical evidence demonstrating the
existence of the promise standard in Canadian law long before Claimant filed its patents or

NAFTA entered into force”.*5

275. Respondent relies in particular on the 1981 Supreme Court decision in Consolboard, which
holds that that “not useful” means an invention “will not do what the specification promises
that it will do”.*°° Contrary to Claimant’s position, Respondent argues that there are

numerous pre-2005 cases that cite Consolboard for the promise standard.*°”

276. For example, Respondent points to the Federal Court of Appeal in the 1995 Wellcome
Foundation Ltd. v. Apotex decision, which stated that “[s]ince the utility of a patent must
ultimately be judged against its promise, the exercise requires that the specification be
carefully construed to determine exactly what the promise is”.*** Indeed, Professor
Siebrasse characterized the holding in Wellcome as the “clearest support for the promise of
the patent doctrine”.*? The Canadian government also referred to the bifurcated test in

submissions to WIPO in 2001 and 2003.3

Respondent also cites other commentary, including a 1960 article by leading Canadian
patent lawyer Mr. Donald Hill and the 1969 treatise of Dr. Harold G. Fox, both of which

refer to promises in the specification.*°!

Finally, according to Respondent, Claimant overlooks that patentees have always been held
to promises under other doctrines such as overbreadth. Respondent states that the “doctrine
of overbreadth has for decades held patentees to promises of utility by prohibiting claims

that are broader than the invention made or disclosed” >

b. Post-Filing Evidence

Respondent also rejects Claimant’s assertion that the 2002 Canadian Supreme Court
decision in AZT changed the law by disallowing post-filing evidence of utility. Respondent

argues that Claimant’s characterization of AZT is inaccurate for four main reasons.

First, according to Respondent, the principle that utility must be established before filing
is enshrined in the Patent Act and early cases. Claimant’s “file now, pay later approach”
has no basis in Canadian jurisprudence; post-filing evidence was never permissible to
prove utility in Canadian law.*°’ For Respondent, this is confirmed by the Supreme Court’s
adoption of the doctrine of sound prediction in 1979 in Monsanto.* The sound prediction
doctrine would be unnecessary if a patent could be granted based on speculations of utility

that would only be confirmed with post hoc testing.*®

Second, Respondent argues that nothing in Justice Binnie’s decision in AZT suggests the
Supreme Court was changing or making new law. Instead, the Court interpreted various
provisions of the Patent Act and concluded that it required that utility be proven at the time
of the patent application. It also interpreted jurisprudence such as the 1930 Supreme Court

decision in Rice v. Cristiani and the 1979 case Procter & Gamble, in which the Supreme

Court stated, “Knowing a new process without knowing its utility is not in my view

knowledge of an ‘invention’”.*%

   

282. Respondent disagrees with Claimant’s position that cases prior to AZT allowed post-filing
evidence to prove utility. In particular, Respondent argues that Claimant misreads Ciba-
Geigy. According to Respondent, the Federal Court of Appeal in Ciba-Geigy determined
that there was enough pre-filing evidence to soundly predict utility.*°” Respondent argues
that the other cases cited by Claimant as allowing post-filing evidence are off point, as
those cases allowed post-filing evidence to prove obviousness and operability, elements of

patent law that are separate from utility.*%*

283. Third, Respondent asserts that the legal community did not regard AZT as a dramatic
change in the law.*©? Respondent offers as an example commentary by a leading Canadian
intellectual property law firm that published a contemporaneous comment on AZT stating
that it “reaffirmed a long-standing position” on post-filing evidence and “confirmed” the
disallowance of post-filing evidence.*”” Respondent argues that Claimant has offered no
evidence to the contrary. Claimant misreads the two cases which it interprets as confirming
the AZT changed the law.>”! Further, Claimant’s expert, Mr. Reddon, offered no
documentary evidence to support his claim that other practitioners regarded AZT as a

change in the law.>””

284. Fourth, Respondent argues that there is no other heightened evidentiary standard for utility
as aresult of AZT. Here, Respondent addresses Claimant’s allegation that pharmaceutical

companies would now be required to conduct and finalize human clinical trials in order to

prove or soundly predict the utility of a drug for human use.*”? Respondent points to AZT
itself, in which in vitro tests were sufficient to prove or soundly predict utility.*”*
Respondent also suggests that Claimant’s perception of a heightened evidentiary standard
may be the result of a strengthened adversarial process in which litigants rigorously seek

to validate or invalidate a patent.*’°

c. Disclosure for Sound Prediction

According to Respondent, Claimant is also wrong to assert that the requirement to disclose
the factual basis and reasoning for a sound prediction of utility in the patent is new.

Respondent offers three main reasons to reject Claimant’s position.

First, Respondent argues that the need to disclose the basis for a sound prediction in the
patent has been recognized in Canadian law since the 1979 Monsanto decision, the seminal
case on sound prediction in Canada.*”° In Monsanto, the Supreme Court allowed a claim
for a group of compounds whose utility was soundly predicted, based only on three
examples disclosed in the patent and affidavit evidence of the common general
knowledge.*”’ Both types of evidence are still used today.*”* Thus, Monsanto established

the need to substantiate the basis for a sound prediction at the time of filing.

In addition, Respondent argues that Patent Office practice in the 1990s confirms that the
disclosure requirement for the basis of a sound prediction existed long before the
Raloxifene Decision. According to Dr. Gillen, in that era “the examiner would determine

whether or not the prediction appeared to be sound based on the type of research disclosed

alleged heightened standard to prove utility.

in the application, the results obtained, and the explanation provided in the specification as

to how those results could predict the utility of a subject compound”.>”

288. Second, Respondent argues that AZT affirmed Monsanto and the need to disclose the basis
for a sound prediction. In AZT, the Supreme Court explained that “the sound prediction is
to some extent the guid pro quo the applicant offers in exchange for the patent
monopoly”.**° It follows that a patentee must substantiate the basis for a sound prediction
before obtaining the patent, as did the patentee in AZT.**! Respondent asserts that
practitioners, including Claimant’s law firm Gowlings, interpreted AZT as requiring

disclosure of the basis for a sound prediction.*** Indeed, the Federal Court in the Strattera

Decision specifically cites AZT for the disclosure rule.***

289. For Respondent, Claimant cannot claim that it did not know of the requirement to disclose
the basis for a sound prediction in the patent. Before the Raloxifene Decision, Claimant

had received CIPO Office Actions that called for disclosure of the basis for a sound

prediction and cited AZT for the requirement.***

Third, Respondent argues that there is no precedent in Canadian law that would have
supported finding a sound prediction in relation to the Strattera Patent, which disclosed no

information at all to evidence of sound prediction.**°

d. MOPOP Amendments and CIPO Practice

According to Respondent, MOPOP is neither an authoritative statement of the law nor a
comprehensive summary of Canadian patent law or Patent Office practice. Respondent
quotes the Foreword to eleven versions of MOPOP from 1989 to 2014, which states that it
“is to be considered solely as a guide, and should not be quoted as an authority. Authority
must be found in the Patent Act, the Patent Rules, and in decisions of the Courts interpreting
them”.**° Further, Respondent argues that conclusions about the state of the law cannot be
drawn from MOPOP because revisions come about slowly and are incomplete.**” As an
illustration, Respondent highlights that the 1990 MOPOP does not include the doctrine of

sound prediction, which was adopted in Canadian law in 1979.

In any event, Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument that MOPOP and Patent Office
practice reflect the creation of the promise utility doctrine in the mid-2000s. In particular,
Respondent notes that the 1990 MOPOP did not exclude the promise standard, and it

reflected a longstanding requirement to establish utility before filing.***

Further, according to Respondent’s witness Dr. Gillen, “The only situation in which an
examiner would accept evidence of utility after filing was one in which the examiner had

doubts about the credibility of an allegedly demonstrated (not predicted) utility. However,

385 See C-160/R-027, Novopharm Lid. v. Eli Lilly and Co., {2010] F.C. 915, at 936 (“...the [Strattera] Patent offers no
information about the nature or sources of the evidence relied upon by the inventors to support the promise of
atomoxetine’s utility to treat ADHD by demonstration or by sound prediction”).

88

294.

295.

296.

even then the evidence would be required to have pre-dated the filing of the application in

question”.**?

e. Statistical Evidence

Respondent characterizes Claimant’s statistical evidence as “anecdotal” and detached from
Claimant’s own theory of the case. Claimant’s statistics are not keyed to the events in 2002,
2005, and 2008 that Claimant claims to have caused a dramatic change in the law on
utility.*°° The date selected by Claimant for the introduction of the promise utility doctrine
(1 January 2005) is nine months before Claimant alleges the promise standard was adopted,

and correcting the date materially changes Claimant’s results.**!

While Respondent acknowledges that there has been an uptick in pharmaceutical patent
litigation on the issue of utility, it insists that the increase is due to “developments in the
patent regime that strengthened intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals”.*°?
Respondent points specifically to the introduction of PM(NOC) proceedings in 1993,
which allowed pharmaceutical patent holders to pre-emptively block generic

manufacturers from entering the market.>”?

Respondent’s witness, Dr. Brisebois, identifies a number of methodological errors in
Claimant’s statistics. For example, he argues that Claimant’s expert, Professor Levin,
inappropriately includes in his 2005-2014 data set pharmaceutical cases in which the patent
was successfully challenged on other grounds, in addition to utility.*°* Also, Claimant
includes PM(NOC) proceedings that do not result in true “invalidations”. Correcting for
these flaws shows that only three, not 23, pharmaceutical patents were invalidated for a

lack of utility alone during this period.*” In addition, Claimant counts all utility-based

invalidations as examples of the promise utility doctrine, whether or not the promise

standard was actually applied in the case.**°

f. Comparison With Other Jurisdictions

Like Claimant, Respondent has submitted extensive evidence relating to the patent law
regimes in the United States and Mexico. According to Respondent, the other NAFTA
Parties’ laws on utility are not in discord with Canada’s bifurcated standard.*?’ Of
particular relevance in the current context, Respondent argues that U.S. and Mexican patent
law has evolved since NAFTA. For example, the U.S. enablement and written description

doctrines are similar to Canada’s law on utility,*°*

and the enablement requirement has
become more rigorous since the passage of NAFTA.*” Similarly, Respondent contends
that Mexico’s industrial applicability requirement requires a rigorous showing of claimed
utility as of the filing date.*°° In any event, Respondent finds any differences in patent law
regimes across jurisdictions irrelevant, as it contends that international patent law is not

harmonized by NAFTA or otherwise. *°!

Respondent further argues that no other State or international organization voiced any
concern over Canada’s law on utility prior to this arbitration, confirming that there has been
no dramatic change in the law.*°? Respondent challenges the reliability of the 2014 and
2015 editions of the USTR Special 301 Report cited by Claimant, in which the United
States expresses “serious concerns” over Canada’s utility requirement.* According to
Respondent, “the Special 301 Report is based not on empirical evidence and analysis, but

on industry allegations made to USTR, including representations made by the Claimant

397 See, e.g., Counter-Memorial §1I(G)-(H).

388 Counter-Memorial §{J171-172; Holbrook First Report §{[21-33.. According to Respondent, These doctrines,
particularly as applied to pharmaceutical compounds, require that claims of utility be substantiated with credible test
results in the patent description as of the filing date.

and its industry associations”.*°* In addition, these reports were not issued
contemporaneously with the changes in the law that Claimant alleges, but rather at the time
of the commencement of this arbitration. Thus, Respondent supposes that the reports were

the result of Claimant’s own lobbying efforts to bolster its claims in this arbitration.4”

299. Respondent confirms that it knows of no other complaint or comment received by Canada
in the PCT, WIPO, or WTO context relating to its utility requirement during the relevant

period.4°°

g. Legitimate Expectations

300. In response to Claimant’s submissions regarding its alleged legitimate expectations,
Respondent argues that a mere failure to fulfil an investor’s expectations does not breach
the minimum standard of treatment in NAFTA Article 1105(1), although it may be relevant
to the analysis of whether a measure was sufficiently egregious to breach customary

international law.*°”

301. In any event, even if Claimant’s legal arguments were accepted, Respondent submits that
Claimant has failed to establish its alleged legitimate expectations. For Respondent, a
legitimate expectation must: (i) be objective, not subjective;*”* (ii) involve a specific
assurance or promise by the State to induce the investment, which was relied upon by the

investor;*” (iii) exist at the time the investor decided to make the investment;*!° and (iv)

be reasonable in the circumstances, including the political, socioeconomic, cultural and

historical conditions prevailing in the host State.*!!

302. According to Respondent, Claimant’s alleged expectations do not satisfy these criteria. In
particular, Respondent contends that it made no specific assurances to Claimant regarding
the Strattera and Zyprexa Patents. Respondent argues that Claimant cannot rely on the grant
of the patents as a basis for its alleged legitimate expectations because patents issued by
the Patent Office are only presumptively valid, subject to challenge and to final
determination by the judiciary.*!? In this regard, Respondent cites Claimant’s annual public
filings, which state that “there is no assurance that ... patents we have been granted would

be found valid if challenged”.*!

303. Moreover, Respondent argues that Claimant’s alleged expectations were not reasonable. In
Respondent’s view, the record shows that the decision-makers within the company were
not sufficiently informed about Canadian patent law.*!* Claimant’s employees testified that
they did not know of any reason why their patents would be invalidated for lack of
utility.445 Yet, according to Respondent, “the record is full of Canadian patent law
publications ... warning about including promises in your patent, and of disclosing a
sufficient basis for a sound prediction long before Claimant filed its patent applications”.*!

More generally, Respondent argues that when Claimant filed the Strattera and Zyprexa

Patents, it knew, or should have known, that its patents could be invalidated if they did not

Respondent dismisses Claimant’s specific argument that its expectations relating to the
Strattera Patent were grounded on the PCT. Respondent contends that Claimant could not
have expected that mere compliance with the PCT’s form and contents requirements would
meet Canada’s substantive disclosure requirements.*!® For Respondent, this is obvious
because (i) the PCT is a strictly procedural treaty that says nothing about the substantive
conditions of patentability, (ii) Claimant did not make an appropriate attempt to comply

with country-specific validity requirements,*!?

and (iii) Respondent’s actions were
consistent with the PCT’s form and contents requirements, as evidenced by the lack of

evidence of any complaints being lodged by its treaty partners.*?°

According to Respondent, the only legitimate expectation Claimant could have had was to
receive a fair hearing from the Federal Court in the event of a challenge to its patents.47!
Respondent contends that Claimant did in fact receive one; the application of the rules to

Claimant's patents revealed that they were latently defective at the time of filing.*”?

Respondent rejects Claimant’s position that its legitimate expectations were violated as a
result of a dramatic change in the law. As summarized above, Respondent denies that the
law dramatically changed after the Strattera and Zyprexa Patents were granted. In its

response to Claimant’s position on legitimate expectations, Respondent further argues that:

[e]ven if such a change had occurred, it is trite to say that the
common law evolves over time. Any sophisticated investor expects
developments in the law, particularly in the area of patent law. It
simply cannot be that every time a court overrules a precedent, it
violates customary international law.*?°

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Canadian courts’ interpretation of the utility requirement under Canadian patent law,
and in particular their adoption of the promise utility doctrine in the mid-2000s, allegedly
departing dramatically from prior Canadian patent law, is the factual premise for
Claimant’s case.** The Parties agree that a fundamental question before this Tribunal is
whether there was a “dramatic” change in the utility requirement in Canada.*?> Claimant

has confirmed that it must succeed on this issue to prevail in this arbitration.*”°

Claimant bears the burden of establishing the facts on which it relies for this aspect of its
claim. Therefore, the Tribunal will analyse in this section whether Claimant adduced
sufficient evidence to prove its allegation that “[i]n the mid-2000s, after the patents for
Zyprexa and Strattera had been examined and granted, but prior to their invalidation by the
courts, Canada’s patent utility law underwent a dramatic transformation”.*?’ As discussed

below, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has not met its burden in relation to this allegation.

(1) Preliminary Observations

Claimant has asserted that the promise utility doctrine is a unitary doctrine that crystalized
with the 2008 Raloxifene Decision, contending that this transformed the utility requirement
in Canadian law. As a preliminary observation, the Tribunal considers that it is difficult for
Claimant to establish that there has been a dramatic change in Canada’s patent utility law
where the relevant Canadian judicial decisions were handed down over a period of more
than six years, encompassing a range of cases from first instance to appellate tier.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal will examine more closely the evidence put forward by
Claimant with regard to each of the three alleged elements of the promise utility doctrine

and the doctrine as a whole.

24 See §VLLE(2) above.

314.

In undertaking this analysis, the Tribunal is mindful of the role of the judiciary in common
law jurisdictions. Claimant’s position in this proceeding rests on an implicit premise that
common law decisions must follow in a reasonably foreseeable and predictable channel,
without significant or material changes. Yet evolution of the law through court decisions

is natural, and departures from precedent are to be expected.*?*

Finally, the Tribunal observes that the present case is one in which the facts are the law.
Thus, this analysis necessarily touches upon aspects of Canadian patent law previously
unfamiliar to the Members of the Tribunal. The Tribunal has been greatly assisted by the
Parties’ submissions and the testimony of their experts and witnesses, and thereby reaches

its conclusions with confidence.

(2) The Utility Requirement in Canadian Jurisprudence

The Patent Act defines an invention as follows:

“invention” means any new and useful art, process, machine,
manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful
improvement in any art, process, machine, manufacture or
composition of matter?”

As summarized above, Claimant alleges that Canadian courts dramatically changed the
application of this provision through a series of cases adopting the promise utility doctrine.
To recall, the doctrine comprises three elements: (i) the identification of a “promise” in the
patent disclosure, against which utility is measured; (ii) the prohibition on the use of post-
filing evidence to prove utility; and (iii) the requirement that pre-filing evidence to support

a sound prediction of utility must be included in the patent.

a. The Promise Standard

The Tribunal understands Claimant’s specific allegation regarding the promise standard to

be that courts now look beyond the claims in the patent to the disclosure in order to construe

#8 See CL-007/RL-004, Mondev v. United States (finding that even if one were to accept the claimant’s argument

that the Massachuset

 

upreme Judicial Court had made new law, “its decision would have fallen within the limits

of common law adjudication”).
+29 C.050/R-001, Patent Act, RSC 1985, c P-4, §2.

95

the “promise” against which utility is assessed.**° Claimant asserts that this practice was
adopted by the Canadian judiciary in the mid-2000s without any basis in prior

jurisprudence.**!

315. The Tribunal further understands that Claimant is not arguing that the promise standard
replaced the traditional “mere-scintilla” test, but rather that the two tests co-exist today.+*?

This is one point on which the Parties agree.

316. In determining whether Claimant has established that the promise standard is new law, the
Tribunal must begin by considering the much discussed 1981 Canadian Supreme Court

decision in Consolboard, in which Justice Dickson wrote:

There is a helpful discussion in Halsbury’s Laws of England, (3rd
ed.), vol. 29, at p.59, on the meaning of “not useful” in patent law.
Tt means “that the invention will not work, either in the sense that it
will not operate at all or, more broadly, that it will not do what the
specification promises that it will do ... the practical usefulness of
the invention does not matter, nor does commercial utility, unless
the specification promises commercial utility” ... Canadian law is
to the same effect. 4°

430 See, e.g., C-PHM SILC.a. (“Finding Elevated ‘Promises’ Beyond the Claimed Invention’s Use Is New”); id. 189
(“It is common ground that under Canada’s traditional test, the invention as claimed must work and be operable, such
that specific assertions of utility in the claims (which is part of the specification) must be fulfilled”).

 

43! Reply 473; Siebrasse Second Report {[72. In light of Claimant's assertion that this was a dramatic change in the
law, it is striking that nowhere in its Memorial or Reply does Claimant identify the name or date of the first court
decisions adopting this standard. One has to look to a footnote in Professor Siebrasse’s expert report to find the
citations to two trial court decisions in 2005 and a 2008 Court of Appeal decision, which he identifies as the first cases
applying the promise standard. Siebrasse First Report fn. 98. (“The original Federal Court cases were Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co v. Apotex Inc, 2005 FC 1348 [C-520], Pfizer Canada Inc v Apotex Inc, 2005 FC 1205 (C-250) and Aventis
Pharma Inc v Apotex Inc, 2005 FC 1283 (C-209)”). The first Court of Appeal decision affirming the promise of the
patent analysis was Atorvastatin 2008 FCA 108, supra note 51 [C-235]”). During the Hearing, a typographical error
in this footnote was corrected. The reference to C-190 was replaced with C-520. Tr. 1194:3-1195:20. The Tribunal
notes that it also misidentified C-235 as C-234.

482 See, e.g., Memorial 57; Siebrasse First Report 941 (“The standard against which utility is assessed now has two
branches. The first branch corresponds to the long standing requirement of a mere scintilla of utility, while the second
branch sets an elevated standard according to the “promise of the patent”); Claimant’s Opening Statement, Tr. 21:4-
12.

96

317. The Tribunal notes that “specification” in this context refers to both the claims and the
disclosure of the patent.**+ Thus, the utility test articulated by Justice Dickson, at least in
its language, is strikingly similar to Claimant’s presentation of the co-existing “mere

scintilla” and promise standards.

318. Claimant has argued that Consolboard was never cited for the promise standard before
2005. The record contradicts this position. Respondent has submitted a number of pre-2005
cases that rely on Consolboard for the proposition that “not useful” means “the invention
will not work, either in the sense that it will not operate at all or, more broadly, that it will
not_do_what the specification promises _that_it_will do”.*5 Like Consolboard, these
decisions do not appear to have applied the promise standard (in the sense of looking to the
patent disclosure for a promise of utility), but the citations cannot be ignored as indications

of similar analysis and policy considerations to that of the promise doctrine.

319. For the Tribunal, it is also relevant that Canadian courts have cited Consolboard for the
promise standard after 2005, a fact which Claimant does not contest. Notably, when the
promise standard was applied to Claimant’s patents, the courts relied on Consolboard. The
Strattera Decision includes a section titled “Utility — Legal Principles” in which the
“promise” language of Consolboard is quoted, followed by citations to authorities from
the 1960s.“*° The 2010 Court of Appeals decision in the Zyprexa Patent litigation also cited
Consolboard, together with a 2008 Court of Appeals case.**7

4M See Tr. 621:14-17, where Professor Siebrasse confirms that “specification” as used by the court includes the

disclosure portion of the patent.

322.

As highlighted by Respondent, when Novopharm sought leave to appeal the 2010 Court of
Appeals decision in the Zyprexa case, Claimant opposed it. In its submission to the
Supreme Court, Claimant did not seek revision of the utility standard set out by the Court

of Appeals. Rather, it stated that the court had done “nothing more than follow established

 

o 438

principles of patent law and the jurisprudence of this Court”.

Faced with all of this evidence, the Tribunal is not persuaded to dismiss Consolboard as
an authority on the basis of Claimant’s nuanced argument that the case does not in fact
stand for the promise standard, or Mr. Reddon’s view that practitioners thought the
Supreme Court was talking about promises in the claims.** Fundamentally, the Tribunal
sees no basis for questioning the Canadian judiciary’s interpretation of its own Supreme

Court precedent.

In addition, the Tribunal has taken note of other pre-2005 Canadian authorities for the
promise standard in the record. Most notably, the Federal Court of Appeal in 1995 in

Wellcome reasoned:

Since the utility of a patent must ultimately be judged against its
promise, the exercise requires that the specification be carefully
construed to determine exactly what that promise is. The question is
then to decide whether the number of possible results, with or
without other evidence, leads to the inference that the process lacks
utility.4°

of Argument of the Respondent, Application for Leave to Appeal, 26 October 2010, 92 (emphasis added) (“While
Novopharm suggests that the Federal Court of Appeal has changed established law, a review of the Reasons for
Judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal shows that it did nothing more than follow established principles of patent
law and the jurisprudence of this Court. It certainly did not lower the threshold for the validity of patents in Canada
as alleged by Novopharm”). The Tribunal acknowledges that Novopharm was not arguing that the Court of Appeal
had changed law by adopting the promise standard, and that Claimant's statement was therefore not specifically aimed
at that rule.

4° Testimony of Reddon, Tr. at 910:16-20 (“As a practitioner you have to contend with the words after the ‘or’ and
be ready to deal with them if it ever is applied, and what practitioners thought was that you needed to show some
promise in the claims”).

98

323. Before this arbitration, Claimant’s expert, Professor Siebrasse, opined that the holding in
Wellcome was the “clearest support for the promise of the patent doctrine”.**! The Tribunal

also finds Professor Siebrasse’s explanation of the jurisprudence in this article helpful:

The promise of the patent doctrine played no significant role in
Canadian patent law until 2005. There were only two cases of which
Tam aware that considered a heightened utility requirement based
on the promise of the specification [Wellcome and Corning Glass
Works],*#? and one more which arguably did so [Mobile].* In all
three cases the promise was modestly construed and the claimed
invention was held to be useful. A fourth case implicitly rejected the
doctrine [Unilever]. A few more cases used “promise” language
in discussing the utility of the patent, but only in the uncontroversial
senses as a synonym for utility,*#> or as referring to the claim as
construed. “4°

324. This reading of the case law offers a realistic summary of the record before the Tribunal.
While the promise standard may not have played a significant role in the Canadian
jurisprudence before 2005, and courts looked to the disclosure for the promise in relatively
few cases, the rule was clearly “out there”, to be ignored at a patentee’s peril.*4”
Furthermore, the rule has a strong foundation in the language of Consolboard, which

Canadian courts still cite for the promise standard today, as already discussed.

(1991), 39 CPR (3d) 176 (FCA). Professor Siebrasse states that in TRW “the Court of Appeal used language which
strongly suggests the application of the promise of the patent doctrine, but on my reading, the case really turns on
claim construction and traditional inoperability”.

#7 As Claimant points out, there were very few utility cases before 2005. See Section VIII.B(4) below. While many
cases appear to have applied the “mere scintilla” standard, this alone does not support Claimant's position, given its
acknowledgement that this lower standard still exists in parallel with the promise standard.

99

325. Therefore, Claimant’s argument that the promise standard constitutes a dramatic change in

the law fails.

b. Post-Filing Evidence

326. In respect of the second element of the promise utility doctrine, Claimant alleges that in
the 2002 AZT decision, the Supreme Court changed prior law and imposed a new ban on
post-filing evidence to prove utility. The Tribunal notes the Parties’ agreement that, under
the Patent Act, the date on which utility is assessed is the date of the patent application.*#*
The question is whether AZT changed prior law that allowed patentees to offer post-filing

evidence to show the claimed invention possessed utility.

327. In examining Claimant’s allegation, the Tribunal begins by reviewing the AZT decision. In
doing so, the Tribunal recalls that the sole purpose of this analysis is to assess the factual
basis of Claimant’s case, not to judge the Supreme Court’s ruling against any legal

standard, in NAFTA or elsewhere.

328. In AZT, the Supreme Court reversed a Federal Court of Appeal decision admitting post-
filing evidence of utility. The most relevant portions of Justice Binnie’s judgment,

delivering the Judgment of the Court, are reproduced here:

Nor, in my view, is it enough for a patent owner to be able to buttress
speculation with post-patent proof, and thereby to turn dross into
gold. Utility is an essential part of the definition of an “invention”
(Patent Act, s. 2). A policy of patent first and litigate later unfairly
puts the onus of proof on the attackers to prove invalidity, without
the patent owner’s ever being put in a position to establish validity.
Unless the inventor is in a position to establish utility as of the time
the patent is applied for, on the basis of either demonstration or
sound prediction, the Commissioner “by law” is required to refuse
the patent (Patent Act, s. 40). [...]

The Patent Act defines an “invention” as, amongst other criteria,
“new and useful” (s. 2). If it is not useful, it is not an invention within
the meaning of the Act. [...]

+88 See Reply 498.

100

The question was whether AZT did the job against HIV that was
claimed; in other words, whether on February 6, 1985, there was any
invention at all within the meaning of s. 2 of the Patent Act.
Canadian case law dealing with inventorship has to be read keeping
the particular factual context in mind. In Christiani v. Rice, [1930]
S.C.R. 443, this Court held, per Rinfret J. (as he then was), at p. 454:

... for the purpose of section 7 [now s. 27], “it is not enough for a
man to say that an idea floated through his brain; he must _at least
have reduced it to a definite and practical shape before he can be
said to have invented a process”. [Emphasis added.]*?

329. Justice Binnie recognized that the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in its 1981 Ciba-Geigy
decision offered some support for the argument that post-filing evidence could be used to

support a finding of utility.4°° In that case, the Court of Appeal stated that:

if indeed what is in the patent specification was mere speculation or
prediction, the speculation or prediction having turned out to be true,
ought to be considered to have been well founded at the time it was
made. Even at the time it was made it is not improbable that it would
have been considered well founded.**!

330. Considering this language, Justice Binnie explains that (i) reading Ciba-Geigy as endorsing
post-filing validation of “bare speculation” would be inconsistent with the 1979 Monsanto
decision, and (ii) on the facts of Ciba-Geigy, the Court of Appeal had determined that it
was probable that the invention’s utility would have been considered well-founded at the

time of filing (suggesting that the language was obiter dicta).*°” He then reasoned that:

In the broader context of the Patent Act, as well, there is good reason
to reject the proposition that bare speculation, even if it afterwards
turns out to be correct, is sufficient. ... Accordingly, to the extent
Ciba-Geigy stands for a contrary position, I do not think it should be
followed.*°3

founded [i.e., a sound prediction]””).

453 C.213/R-004, AZT, 184-85.

 

101

331. A number of observations are in order. First, contrary to Claimant’s arguments, the fact
that the Supreme Court’s AZT decision reversed the lower court decision on appeal is not
evidence of a change in the law; reversal serves various critical functions in a tiered judicial
system. Second, the AZT decision is expressly and satisfactorily based on the Patent Act,
jurisprudence and policy considerations. Third, although the contrast between the language
of Ciba-Geigy and AZT is apparent, Justice Binnie is able to read Ciba-Geigy in a way that
is not entirely inconsistent with the court’s ruling in AZT.**4 Claimant would have the
Tribunal dismiss the court’s analysis of Ciba-Geigy in AZT on the basis that it is
“unpersuasive”.*>> That is not the Tribunal’s role. Rather, its role is to determine whether
there was a dramatic change in Canadian patent law in this respect, a conclusion which it

is unable to reach on the record before it.

332. In light of these observations, the Tribunal finds that the AZT decision, on its face and as it
relates to Monsanto and Ciba-Geigy, cannot be considered a “complete and surprising
reversal from prior law”, as alleged by Claimant.**° For completeness, the Tribunal will

also look beyond the decision to consider the entire record on this issue.

333. Professor Siebrasse has presented several court decisions handed down before AZT in
which courts allowed post-filing evidence of utility.4°’ Respondent’s expert Mr. Dimock
has asserted, inter alia, that these cases relate not to utility but to “operability”, which is
relevant because post-filing evidence of operability is still admissible today.*** In response,
Professor Siebrasse has argued that (i) operability and utility are indistinguishable, and (ii)
Mr. Dimock misreads the cases. The Tribunal found both of these experts credible and

competent, and considers that each has made a reasoned case. The only appropriate

102

conclusion, then, in the Tribunal’s view, is that reasonable minds may differ in the

interpretation of the cases.*°

334. Similarly, the record shows that after AZT was handed down, there was divergence among
Canadian judges and practitioners regarding the case’s relationship with prior law. For
example, as Claimant points out, in 2002, Apotex sought to amend its pleadings in a
Federal Court case on the basis that AZT had changed the law, and the trial judge expressly
accepted that position.*° On review, however, the Federal Court of Appeal took no view

on whether there had been a change.*°!

335. From the practitioner perspective, Mr. Reddon explained that AZT was a surprising,

462

dramatic change.*°~ On the other hand, a 2003 article in the newsletter of the patent law

firm Smart & Biggar referred to the relevant portion of AZT as a confirmation of an existing

principle:

After-the-fact-Validation

The Court confirmed that bare speculation, even if it afterwards
turns out to be correct, will not amount to sound prediction. It
rejected the suggestion, arising from earlier Canadian Federal Court
of Appeal decisions, that mere speculation which later turned out to
be true would be considered a sound prediction.*°

336. Taking a broader perspective, the Tribunal accepts Claimant’s point that before AZT, no

commercially successful products were found to lack utility, whereas now this is not

filing evidence, so this has to be determined based on the facts of the case.

uncommon.*™ This is a notable fact, but Claimant has not established this to be the result

of changed law.4

In sum, the Tribunal recognizes that the outcome in AZT was unexpected for some
practitioners and even judges who had understood the language of the Court of Appeal in
Ciba-Geigy to mean that utility could be demonstrated through post-filing evidence (most
notably commercial success). Still, having considered all of the evidence, the Tribunal
cannot conclude that the Supreme Court effected a dramatic change from previously well-

established law when it clarified this rule in AZT.

c. Disclosure for Sound Prediction

The Tribunal now turns to Claimant’s allegation that the judiciary changed the law in the
2008 Raloxifene Decision by requiring the basis of sound prediction to be disclosed in the

patent.

As discussed above, the Raloxifene Decision concerned one of Claimant’s own Canadian
patents. In this litigation, Claimant appealed the trial court decision, arguing that the court
erred in holding that the Raloxifene Patent lacked adequate disclosure. In its decision

dismissing this appeal, the Court of Appeal stated:

The importance of the disclosure obligation in applying for a patent
has been emphasized by the Supreme Court of Canada on a number
of occasions in recent years (Pioneer Hi Bred Ltd. v. Canada
(Commissioner of Patents), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1623 at paragraph 23;
Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd., [1999] 1 S.C.R. 142 at
paragraph 46; Free World Trust v. Electro Santé Inc. 2000 SCC 66,
[2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024 at paragraph 13; Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome
Foundation Ltd., 2002 SCC 77, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153 at paragraph 37
(commonly referred to as AZT and hereinafter referred to as such)).

The decision of the Supreme Court in AZT is particularly significant
to the disposition of this appeal. According to AZT, the requirements

4 Courts cite AZT as the authority for disallowing evidence of commercial success. See C-209, Aventis Pharma Inc
v. Apotex Inc, 2005 FC 1283, {157 (“There is no question that the ‘206 patent turned out to be a very useful invention.
However, this sort of ‘after the fact validation’ was specifically rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Wellcome”). Such citations do not suggest one way or the other whether AZT was a departure from prior law.

of sound prediction are three-fold: there must be a factual basis for
the prediction; the inventor must have at the date of the patent
application an articulable and sound line of reasoning from which
the derived result can be inferred from the factual basis; and third,
there must be proper disclosure (AZT, supra, at paragraph 70). As
was said in that case (para. 70): “the sound prediction is to some
extent the quid pro quo the applicant offers in exchange for the
patent monopoly”. In sound prediction cases there is a heightened
obligation to disclose the underlying facts and the line of reasoning
for inventions that comprise the prediction. [...]

The appellant argues that in requiring the complete disclosure of the
factual basis underlying the sound prediction (i.e. requiring data to
substantiate the invention), the Federal Court Judge has changed the
disclosure requirements as set out in subsection 27(3) of the Patent
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4. I respectfully disagree. In AZT, the
Supreme Court, with obvious reference to subsection 34(1) of the
Patent Act (the predecessor to subsection 27(3)), held that where the
claimed invention had not yet actually been reduced to practice, the
patent must provide a disclosure such that a person skilled in the art,
given that disclosure, could have as the inventors did, soundly
predicted that the invention would work once reduced to practice.
Significantly, in AZT, the Court went on to state that the disclosure
requirements had been met given that both the underlying facts (the
test data) and the sound line of reasoning (the chain terminator
effect) were in fact disclosed (AZT, para. 70).*°°

The Tribunal finds this analysis highly instructive. It shows that Claimant raised the “new
requirement” argument in the Raloxifene proceeding, and the Court of Appeal rejected it
on the basis of Supreme Court precedent. This evidence weighs heavily against Claimant’ s
position. Again, however, as part of its factual analysis, the Tribunal has carefully reviewed

the full record on this issue to assess whether Claimant is able to rebut this evidence.

The Parties and their experts have debated at length the implication of the Supreme Court’s
1979 Monsanto decision. On one side, Respondent asserts that Monsanto “emphasized that
a sound prediction must not go beyond the consideration provided by the disclosure”.*”

On the other, Claimant finds nothing in the case to imply that the factual basis of sound

Justice Hughes, the trial judge who authored the Raloxifene Decision, “was a patent practitioner with decades of
experience before being appointed to the bench”. Siebrasse Second Report 476.

prediction must be disclosed. During the Hearing, it became clear to the Tribunal that (i)
Monsanto does not expressly hold one way or the other on this issue;** (ii) the court in

Monsanto did not admit any undisclosed evidence of sound prediction that would not be

9

admitted in Canadian courts today;*” and (iii) Monsanto draws upon a 1969 English

decision, Olin Mathieson, in which the court did admit evidence from outside the patent.*”°
Therefore, Monsanto does not offer a specific answer to the question of disclosure for

sound prediction.

342. There is some evidence that after Monsanto the Patent Office understood that applicants
should disclose the basis of a sound prediction. Dr. Gillen highlights a 1995
Commissioner’s Decision which concluded that the patent at issue did not contain anything
in its disclosure upon which to base a sound prediction.*”! The Tribunal finds the language
of this decision instructive but notes that the refusal to grant the patent was based on a

provision of the Patent Act that does not concern utility (disclosure).

343. The Parties have also discussed AZT extensively in this context. The Tribunal has before it
numerous sources indicating that AZT was understood to set out the disclosure requirement
for sound prediction. As Claimant’s counsel stated at the Hearing, “the AZT decision

basically stated an additional disclosure rule, or what might have looked like an additional
disclosure rule, but didn’t actually apply it in that case because it wasn’t at issue”.*””
Professor Siebrasse also conceded that the language of AZT could be interpreted to support

the disclosure rule.473

468 See, e.g., Tr. 1083:2-17.

4 Tr. 699: 24-700:4 (*MR. JOHNSTON: But in Monsanto the court did not admit any evidence that would not still
be admissible under Canadian law to justify a sound prediction. PROFESSOR SIEBRASSE: Well, yes, that’s right.”).

decision cites Monsanto and Olin Mathieson in relation to sound prediction.

472 Claimant’s Opening Statement, Tr. 49:1-5. See also Tr. 68:15-20 (“MS. WAGNER....the disregarding of post-
filing evidence, does absolutely date to AZT 2002. It's the extra disclosure requirement that’s uncertain because the
court alluded to it but then never applied it, and then it wasn't until 2008 that it actually was applied.”’)

43 Tr, 684:11-685:2 (“PROFESSOR SIEBRASSE: It made some statements that certainly could be interpreted as
supporting this disclosure ... those words are amenable to that interpretation, although they’re amenable to other
interpretations as well.”).

   

106

344. Notably, the judges in both the Raloxifene Decision, discussed above, and the Strattera

Decision, traced the disclosure rule to AZT. The Strattera Decision states:

In a case involving a claimed sound prediction of utility, it is ...
beyond debate that an additional disclosure obligation arises.
According to Justice Binnie in AZT, above, this obligation is met by
disclosing in the patent both the factual data on which the prediction
is based and the line of reasoning followed to enable the prediction
to be made.*”4

345. In fact, Claimant was aware of this interpretation of AZT many years earlier. In 2003,
Claimant received an Office Action regarding one of its patent applications for the use of

atomoxetine (active ingredient of Strattera), stating that:

The description fails to provide a sound line of reasoning for the
utility claimed. The factual support described does not lead to the
conclusion that the subject matter of these claims would have the
predicted utility. ({citing AZT])*”>

346. One year later, Claimant received a similar notice with respect to one of its applications for

a use of olanzapine (active ingredient of Zyprexa).*”°

347. Canadian patent law firms also noted that the disclosure requirement was set forth in
AZT.“ Indeed, after the Raloxifene Decision was handed down, Claimant’s law firm,
Gowlings, wrote that the Supreme Court had “reiterated the test articulated by the Supreme

Court in AZT”.478

foregoing.”).

350.

On the other hand, another law firm considered the Raloxifene Decision to be a “watershed
decision that is particularly relevant to the filing of patent applications henceforth”.*”
Moreover, Claimant has presented cases decided in the period between AZT and the
Raloxifene Decision, in which the courts appear to have relied on evidence not disclosed

in the patent to assess whether utility could be soundly predicted.**°

Taking together all of the documents and testimony, the Tribunal cannot accept Claimant’s
position that the Raloxifene Decision radically changed a well-settled rule of Canadian law.
Instead, the Tribunal sees the progressive development of the doctrine of sound prediction
over decades, specifically in relation to the required disclosure. When the Supreme Court
first adopted the doctrine in Monsanto, it did not set a clear disclosure rule. Over the
following years, during which there was little litigation over utility, the law was not
significantly clarified. Then, the 2002 AZT decision set out the requirements for a sound
prediction, identifying proper disclosure as one of those requirements. As proper disclosure
was not at issue on the facts of AZT, it was not until the 2008 Raloxifene Decision that the
requirement was applied by a court (although the Patent Office began applying it much
earlier, including in relation to Claimant’s patents).**! Indeed, the doctrine may develop
further. According to Professor Siebrasse, the details of the disclosure requirement for
sound prediction are still being debated in the courts, with some judges opining that it

should apply only to new use patents.

This process has of course involved some elements of change, but based on the record, that

change is more incremental and evolutionary than dramatic.

that when a patent is based on sound prediction, the disclosure must include the underlying factual basis for the

studies] were likely not in the Canadian patent as filed”).

351. The Tribunal concludes that the facts surrounding each of the three elements of the alleged
promise utility doctrine do not demonstrate a dramatic transformation of the utility
requirement in Canadian law. In this regard, the Tribunal is cognizant of Claimant’s
position that these three elements are part of a unitary, cohesive doctrine and must be
considered together. Therefore, in the following sections, the Tribunal examines the

evidence Claimant has produced in relation to the promise utility doctrine as a whole.

(3) MOPOP Amendments and CIPO Practice

352. Claimant submits that all three elements of the promise utility doctrine were included in
MOPOP for the first time in the 2009 and 2010 versions, which stand in stark contrast to
the 1990 MOPOP that was in place at the time the Zyprexa and Strattera patents were

granted, and which reflected the traditional “mere scintilla’” test.

353. The Tribunal will first address the authoritative weight of MOPOP, which has been a matter

of contention in this case. The introductory language of MOPOP speaks to this point:

The manual has been prepared by the Patent Office to instruct patent
examiners in Office policy relating to the examination of
applications for patents. [...] This manual is to be considered solely
as a guide, and should not be quoted as an authority. Authority must
be found in the Patent Act, the Patent Rules, and in decisions of the
Courts interpreting them.**?

354. The Tribunal notes this caveat and yet also agrees with Claimant that MOPOP could be a
reliable statement of Canadian patent law even if it lacks the force of law. Indeed, it is
common ground that MOPOP is relied upon by Canadian patent examiners in reviewing

applications, as stated in the text above.

355. The question of whether MOPOP is in fact reliable in the present context, as evidence of a
change in the law, turns on whether it is reasonably comprehensive and current. In this
regard, the Tribunal tends to agree with Respondent that MOPOP provides high level

internal guidance but cannot be considered a complete summation of Canadian patent

+83 C.054, Canadian Intellectual Property Office — Patent Office, Manual of Patent Office Practice (January 1990),
Foreword.

109

law.**4 Further, it would be unreasonable to expect MOPOP to reflect all relevant
jurisprudence at any specific point in time, as understood by anyone tasked with keeping a

legal treatise up to date.

356. Notably, Chapter 12 of the 1990 MOPOP, covering subject matter and utility, was
relatively sparse at just five pages (English and French), compared to the 38-page Chapter
12 in the 2009 MOPOP (English only). Claimant’s expert Mr. Wilson tried to explain that
this was because “utility was so basic” in the 1990s.**° But that is not the whole story. Mr.
Wilson had to accept that the 1990 MOPOP included no reference to Monsanto, the 1979
Supreme Court decision that established the principle of sound prediction of utility.**°
Indeed, there is no mention of “sound prediction” at all.“*’ Yet it is undisputed that
Monsanto was a seminal utility case, and that patent examiners were accepting sound
predictions of utility in 1990.*88 MOPOP’s evolution over time has not necessarily always

precisely tracked the case law or determined Patent Office practice.**?

357. Therefore, the Tribunal finds MOPOP to be relevant as a general guide to Canadian patent

law but proceeds with caution in drawing any conclusion from specific amendments.

358. Claimant cites, inter alia, the following sections of the 1990 MOPOP as a statement of the

traditional “mere scintilla” test:

12.02.01 An invention must be useful:

Section 2 of the Act requires utility as an essential feature of
invention. If an invention is totally useless, the purposes and objects

484 Gillen First Statement (24 (“I am unaware of any examiner, patent applicant, or patent agent who would consider
the MOPOP to be a complete and authoritative guide on Patent Office practice or patent law in Canada at any given
point in time.”); Tr. 791:5-8 (“MR. WILSON: [MOPOP] doesn’t provide instructions on how to examine each specific
application, no, but it gives principles on how to examine all applications.”).

485 Tr. 794:10-19 (“MR. WILSON: Utility was so basic, it didn’t need pages to describe it. Utility was “not totally
useless”. You can describe it in three or four words, not five pages.”).

486 Tr, 794:14-24. See R-023, Monsanto Co. v. Canada, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1108 (SCC), 99[24-25.

487 Tr, 794:14-24. See C-061/R-023, Monsanto, (124-25.

488 See, e.g., Tr. 793:18-22 (*MS. ZEMAN: But you agree that examiners were accepting sound predictions of utility
in 1990, right? MR. WILSON: I'm pretty sure they were, yes.”).
489 More generally, it is reasonable to accept that the Patent Office may expand and clarify MOPOP even when there
has been no change in the law, as suggested by the modernization of MOPOP between 1990 and 2009. See Gillen
Second Statement 931 (discussing the addition to Chapter 9 (Description) in 2010 that discu in detail the person
of ordinary skill in the art (POSITA), although the POSITA analysis did not change in the 1990s or 2000s).

of the grant [of a patent] would fail and such grant would
consequently be void on the grounds of false suggestion, failure of
consideration and having tendency to hinder progress.

12.02.02 Utility must be disclosed:

An application for patent must not only describe the invention, but
also its operation or use (Section 34(1)). The operation or use of the
invention must, of course, show the purpose for which the invention
was intended. An invention may have several uses, but it must
always have at least one.

The claims must be drafted to an invention having the utility
disclosed. If the claims cover only things that have utility other than
that disclosed or if they included inoperable and therefore useless
embodiments, they are bad.4”°

359. Claimant then points to the following portion of the 2009 MOPOP:

12.08.01 Operability

Where, however, the inventors promise that their invention will
provide particular advantages (e.g. will do something better or more
efficiently or will be useful for a previously unrecognized purpose)
it is this utility that the invention must in fact have.*?!

360. Claimant is correct that the promise standard set forth in the 2009 MOPOP does not appear

in the 1990 MOPOP, and this new language appears to have signalled a change in practice

492

to at least some patent examiners.*”~ Indeed, Claimant’s expert Mr. Wilson explains that

the first Commissioner’s Decision dealing with the issue of promised utility was issued in

2010.43

40 Memorial $47 quoting C-054, MOPOP §§ 12.02, 12.03 (January 1990) (emphasis added by Claimant).

491 Counter-Memorial 1124, quoting C-059, MOPOP § 12.08.01 (December 2009). The section continues: “Although
an invention need only have one use in order to be patentable, where several uses are promised the applicant must be
in a position to establish each of them. For example, if a composition is promised to be useful as a drug, the applicant
must be in a position to show that it is useful in the therapy of at least once disease. If, however, it is promised to be
useful as a drug for treaty many diseases, the applicant must be in a position to establish its utility . . . in treating each
of the diseases”.

492

  

 

As summarized above, Claimant has submitted emails and comments of patent examiners stating that application
of this provision would be a change in examination practice. See, e.g., C-358, Comments on MOPOP Chapter 12
Compiled from Section C5 Biotech,” Comments of Linda Brewer, (17 March 2008) [Canada Doc. No. 910, at 065407]
(commenting that Section 12.8.01 of the draft 2009 MOPOP “does not appear to be in line with our practice”).

of Patents number 1303 (June 4, 2010) , {28 (“What we need to determine then is whether the compositions defined

111

361. However, as noted above, the Tribunal must be cautious in drawing conclusions from
additions to MOPOP’s text. The obvious inquiry is whether MOPOP itself indicates that
this promise standard is derived from new jurisprudence. It does not. None of the cases
cited by Professor Siebrasse for the promise standard is referenced. Instead, MOPOP cites

Consolboard:

The Supreme Court affirmed in Consolboard Inc. v. MacMillan
Bloedel (Saskatchewan) Ltd. that, for the purposes of Canadian law,
a lack of utility exists if “the invention will not work, either in the
sense that it will not operate at all or, more broadly, that it will not
do what the specification promises that it will do” and that “[i]f and
when used in accordance with the directions contained in the
specification, the promised results are obtained, the invention is
useful in the sense in which that term is used in the patent law”. This
was merely the reiteration of a long-accepted and extant standard.4

362. Accepting Claimant’s position would require the Tribunal to dismiss this clear statement
of the Patent Office regarding the source of the promise standard in MOPOP. The Tribunal

is not prepared to do so.

363. With respect to the other elements of the promise utility doctrine (prohibition on pre-filing
evidence and disclosure of the factual basis for sound prediction), Claimant cites the

following provisions:

12.08.05 Relevant date

The applicant must be in a position to establish the utility of their
invention no later than at their filing date. Consequently, the factual
basis upon which either the demonstration or sound prediction are
based must necessarily exist as of the filing date. Similarly, if a
sound prediction is to be relied upon, the articulable and sound line
of reasoning referred to in 12.08.04 must also exist as of the filing
date. As put by Binnie J. in Apotex, “[nJor, in my view, is it enough

in these claims could be soundly predicted to have the promised utility; viz. to be superconductive at a temperature of
77 K or higher. This determination is based on the disclosure, the state of the art and the common general knowledge
available to a person skilled in the art”).

for a patent owner to be able to buttress speculation with post-patent
proof, and thereby to turn dross into gold”.4°>

9.04.0la Disclosure of the factual basis

The factual basis needed to render the line of reasoning sound must
be disclosed. If some or all of the facts being relied on are found in
another publicly available document, this document must be
properly identified. Any necessary facts that are not otherwise
publicly available must be included in the description.*”°

The Tribunal has discussed above the prohibition on post-filing evidence and found that
the Supreme Court clarified this rule in the 2002 AZT decision. This is reflected in the
citation to Justice Binnie’s decision in Section 12.08.05. In the present context, the Tribunal
observes that (i) nothing in the 1990 MOPOP suggests that post-filing evidence of utility
would be admitted, and (ii) the rule set out in AZT finds support in the 1990 MOPOP

requirement that “Utility must be disclosed”.*”

Regarding the requirement that the factual basis for sound prediction be disclosed, the
Tribunal does not see how MOPOP assists Claimant, given that sound prediction was not

addressed at all in the 1990 MOPOP.

On the basis of this analysis, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant’s evidence relating to
MOPOP and Patent Office practice does not support its allegation of a dramatic change in

the law.

(4) Statistical Evidence

Setting aside the details of patent law jurisprudence and CIPO practice, Claimant argues
that the stark effect of the promise utility doctrine on litigation outcomes speaks for itself.
In this context, Claimant puts forward quantitative evidence (through its expert, Professor

Levin) to illustrate a spike in (i) the number of successful utility challenges, and (ii) the

rate of success of such challenges since 2005. Claimants’ data is summarized in Table 1

368. At the outset, the Tribunal notes its doubts regarding Claimant’s selection of 1 January
2005 to serve as the dividing line between “before” and “after” the promise utility doctrine.
First, on Claimant’s case, the final element of this allegedly unitary doctrine did not come
into existence until 2008.*” Second, this date does not correspond to any of the court
decisions cited by Claimant, or for that matter, any other event that is apparently relevant
to Claimant’s case. Professor Levin explained that he was not the one who selected this
date, describing it as a “legal decision”.»°’ However, the legal significance of this date is
questionable, and Claimant has failed to adequately explain the basis of its instruction to

Professor Levin.

369. The difficulty for Claimant is that, given the small number of cases before 2005, changing
the cut-off date, even just slightly, erases any increase in the rate of utility-based
invalidations of pharmaceutical patents, thereby undermining the conclusions Claimant
seeks to draw from the statistical evidence. Respondent illustrated this during the Hearing
by moving the cut-off date to 2 September 2005, the date of the first decision cited by
Professor Siebrasse for the promise standard. The results are shown in Table 2 below,

370. Similarly, if the cut-off date is set at the date of the Raloxifene Decision (5 February 2008),
when the court adopted the final element of the promise utility doctrine, the increase in the
rate of invalidations of pharmaceutical patents for lack of utility becomes barely

apparent.*°?

371. The small data set poses a more fundamental problem for Claimant, even when | January
2005 is applied as the cut-off date. Professor Levin did not identify any statistically
significant difference between the rate of invalidations pre- and post-2005, as there are
simply too few pre-2005 cases.*°? As Professor Levin explained, it cannot be concluded

from the data whether there was a significant increase in invalidity rates or not.°*

372. Clearly, the number of utility-based invalidations of pharmaceutical patents has increased
sharply. There were essentially no such court decisions until 2005, compared to almost 30
over the last decade.* The Tribunal understands that Claimant would be concerned by

this development. However, it is undisputed that at the same time there has been a spike in

501 Respondent’s Opening Presentation, slide 85; R-PHM 4164.

said I draw no conclusion from the lack of significance between pre and post, and the reason is precisely that. The

pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical patents held invalid on grounds of utility in the post-2005 period, not showing
the difference in invalidity rates over time.

utility challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.*°° Absent evidence of a corresponding
increase in the rate of invalidations, there is nothing striking about an increase in

invalidations as more patents are challenged.>”

Notably, around the same time in the mid-2000s, validity challenges of pharmaceutical
patents on other grounds (such as obviousness and anticipation) also increased, as did the
number of invalidations, to varying degrees.*°* This suggests a broader trend of increasing

pharmaceutical patent litigation and greater numbers of invalidations.

The increase in utility litigation could plausibly be motivated by developments in the law
that make success more likely for generic manufacturers, but again there is nothing on the
record to demonstrate a greater rate of success (much less any causal connection). And
there are other plausible causes for an escalation in litigation relating to a particular sector
or statutory provision. Respondent has offered some explanations of its own, such as the

introduction of PM(NOC) proceedings and the growing prevalence of secondary patents.*°°

Without having been presented with any strong indication toward a single factor, the
Tribunal considers it most likely that a combination of developments, including those in
patent litigation procedures, the application of substantive patent law, and the
pharmaceutical sector, has led to a rise in challenges directed at pharmaceutical patents and

more invalidations.

In sum, Claimant’s quantitative data provides insufficient evidentiary support for its

allegation of a dramatic change in the law.

96 See Claimant’s Opening Statement, Tr. 95:12-16(“In the early period utility was rarely challenged in that sector
and never successfully but, since 2005, given the change in Canada’s test, utility challenges have spiked and 28 cases
(41 percent) have been successful.”).

°° The Tribunal accepts the logic of Claimant's statement that “the mere fact that there was a higher absolute incidence
of pharmaceutical patent litigation after 1993 cannot explain the higher rate (or proportion) of invalidity findings
under the utility doctrine”. Reply (196. However, as discussed, no significant increase in the rate of invalidations has
been shown.

508 See Brisebois Second Statement, Figure 1, p. 15 and Figure 2, p. 16.

50° R-PHM 4167. The Tribunal notes that PM(NOC) proceedings were introduced in 1993 and have not been shown
to have sparked the increase in litigation in 2005. However, many of the post-2005 cases cited by Claimant are
PM(NOC) proceedings, suggesting that the availability of this process has played a role during this period.

116

(5) Comparison with Other Jurisdictions

377. In its Post-Hearing Memorial and Reply Post-Hearing Memorial, Claimant submits that
the dramatic change in Canadian law is confirmed by the utility requirement in United
States and Mexican law, as well as by discussions among the members of WIPO and the
WTO.*!? Although it is difficult to see how a comparison across jurisdictions can
demonstrate a change over time within a single jurisdiction, the Tribunal has carefully

considered the Parties’ extensive submissions and evidence on these issues.

378. The Tribunal has paid particular attention to the 2014 and 2015 editions of the Special 301
Report of the USTR. In these documents, USTR notes that the United States “has serious
concerns about the lack of clarity and the impact of the heightened utility requirements for
patents that Canadian courts have applied recently”.*!! This comment cannot be dismissed
outright as a lobbying effort by Claimant, as suggested by Respondent. However, the
Special 301 Report stands alone in the record as a complaint regarding Canada’s utility
doctrine from any other State, including Mexico, in the decade since the promise utility
doctrine was allegedly adopted.*'? For the Tribunal, that silence speaks louder than the

single, brief criticism contained in the USTR’s Special 301 Report.

379. Ultimately, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimant’s comparative analyses alters our

findings above.

>! Claimant has argued throughout this arbitration that Canada’s utility requirement is unlike that of its NAFTA
partners or other countries, but in its Post-Hearing Memorial, it tied this issue directly to its allegation of a change in
the law.

(“The United States also has serious concerns about the lack of clarity and the impact of the heightened utility
requirements for patents that Canadian courts have applied recently. Under this amorphous and evolving standard,
courts can invalidate a patent on utility grounds by construing the “promise of a patent” years after the patent has been
granted, leading to uncertainty for patent holders and applicants and undermining incentives for investment in the
pharmaceutical sector. In applying this standard, courts have invalidated a number of patents held by U.S.
pharmaceutical companies, finding now that those products lack utility (i.e., not capable of industrial application),
even though such products have been in the market and benefiting patients for years.”). (emphasis added); C-332,

(6) Legitimate Expectations

Claimant alleges that the Canadian courts’ application of the alleged promise utility
doctrine to invalidate the Strattera and Zyprexa Patents contravened its legitimate
expectations. The Tribunal notes that this allegation, made primarily in the context of
Claimant’s claim under NAFTA Article 1105, depends on Claimant establishing a dramatic
change in the Canadian law on utility.*!? Therefore, Claimant’ s allegation of a violation of

its legitimate expectations must be dismissed on the basis of the Tribunal’s findings above.

The Tribunal has considered whether there is any other factual basis on which Claimant
could establish a violation of any legitimate expectation. For this limited purpose, the
Tribunal need not, and does not, determine the contentious legal question of whether a
violation of an investor’s legitimate expectations can constitute a breach of NAFTA Article

1105.

As summarized above, Claimant argues that its asserted expectations were reasonably
based on the traditional utility requirement in Canadian patent law, as well as the grant of
the Strattera and Zyprexa Patents. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that all patentees,
including Claimant, understand that their patents are subject to challenge before the courts

on the ground that the invention does not satisfy one or more patentability requirements.

The record shows that at the time Claimant made its investments, it was aware that
Canadian patent law required patented inventions to be useful. Eli Lilly executives testified
that they understood the Canadian utility requirement to be a low threshold.>"4 In fact, it
appears that the utility of Strattera and Zyprexa in Canada was taken for granted within the

company. Claimant expected its patents would not be invalidated for lack of utility.

However, this perception cannot amount to a legitimate expectation. For the reasons stated
above, the Tribunal has found that each of the three elements of the alleged promise utility

doctrine had a foundation in Canadian law when Claimant’s patents were filed. At that

See Claimant’s Closing Presentation, slide 140.

5!4 For example, Claimant’s former General Counsel, Mr. Armitage, stated that he would have been “shocked if there
were evidence that advice on Canadian utility law had been given during that time frame, since it was so well
understood that the threshold for meeting the Canadian utility requirement for pharmaceutical inventions was so low”.

sis

time, although Claimant may not have been able to predict the precise trajectory of the law
on utility, it should have, and could have, anticipated that the law would change over time
as a function of judicial decision-making. The record in this case shows that the law did in

fact undergo a reasonable measure of change and development.

Therefore, for these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has not met its burden of

proving a violation of its legitimate expectations.*!>

(7) Conclusion

Taken as a whole, the evidence before the Tribunal shows that Canada’s utility requirement
underwent incremental and evolutionary changes between the time that the Zyprexa and
Strattera Patents were granted and then invalidated, in particular during the six-year period
that Claimant highlights (2002-2008). Over those years, there was an increase in the
number of utility-based challenges of pharmaceutical patents, which appears to have
increased the pace of the development of the law most relevant to that sector. The Tribunal
also sees that each of the three rules that Claimant considers part of the promise utility
doctrine has a reasonably solid foundation in prior authority, even if there is a question

about the extent to which that prior authority was applied in practice.

For all of the reasons in subsections (1) to (5) above, the Tribunal finds that, on the record
in this arbitration, Claimant has not demonstrated a fundamental or dramatic change in
Canadian patent law. For the interrelated reasons in subsection (6) above, the Tribunal
finds that Claimant has not demonstrated, as a factual matter, that its legitimate
expectations were violated by the application of Canadian patent law to the Zyprexa and

Strattera Patents.

As noted above, Claimant has acknowledged that it must demonstrate a dramatic change

in the law to succeed on its claims under NAFTA Articles 1105 and/or 1110.5!© The

Claimant has also alleged that its legitimate expectations were grounded in, or at least reinforced by, Respondent’ s

obligations under NAFTA Chapter 17 and the form and contents requirement of the PCT. The Parties have exchanged
extensive submissions on these international instruments, all of which the Tribunal has considered. However, nothing
therein alters the Tribunal’s analysis. For all of the reasons stated above, Claimant has failed to establish, as a matter
of fact, that Respondent breached any international obligations by invalidating the Strattera and Zyprexa Patents.

Tribunal agrees that this is what Claimant is required to show to establish a breach of

Article 1105 or 1110 in the circumstances of this case.

Having failed to demonstrate a fundamental or dramatic change in Canadian patent law,
the Tribunal would properly dismiss the claims without further inquiry. Without detracting
from this, for completeness and the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes that in the course
of the proceedings Claimant alleged that the promise utility doctrine is both arbitrary and
discriminatory.>!’ Given that an arbitrary or discriminatory measure could, as a matter of
hypothesis, violate NAFTA Articles 1105 and/or 1110 in the absence of a fundamental or
dramatic change in the relevant area of law, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to address

Claimant’s allegations in the following section.

THE ALLEGED ARBITRARY AND DISCRIMINATORY NATURE OF THE
UTILITY REQUIREMENT UNDER CANADIAN LAW

The Parties’ Positions
(1) Claimant’s Position

a, Arbitrariness

Claimant alleges that the promise utility doctrine is arbitrary because it (i) “is unpredictable

and incoherent”, and (ii) “serves no legitimate public purpose”.*!®

According to Claimant, all three elements of the promise utility doctrine contribute to its
arbitrariness. First, as stated by Professor Siebrasse, the subjective process of construing
the promise of a patent is “inherently arbitrary” in that it allows courts to ignore the
distinction between the claims and the disclosure.*!? Claimant argues that the process

differs from court to court and that even the same court can reach conflicting conclusions

as to the promised utility of a patent in two different cases.°?° According to Claimant,
generic drug companies—the principal beneficiaries of the promise doctrine—have
acknowledged that it is “a hopeless tangle of contradictory approaches” in which the
“outcome of cases depends upon the particular judge or panel hearing the dispute, rather

than legal authority”.*?!

392. Second, Claimant submits that the heightened evidentiary burden is arbitrary and
unpredictable because it bars post-filing evidence that validates earlier tests showing a
drug’s likely effectiveness.°” In Claimant’s view, patent applicants currently have no way
of knowing how much, and what type, of evidence a judge will require to demonstrate or
soundly predict a patent’s utility.°?> Claimant argues that the rule leaves pharmaceutical
companies caught, because if they invest in extensive clinical trials (which may or may not
be required by the court) before filing a patent application, the drug may no longer meet
the obviousness and novelty conditions of patentability.°*+ In addition, Claimant finds the
application of the bar on post-filing evidence arbitrary; while the use of such evidence is
prohibited to establish utility, it is permitted to demonstrate other patentability criteria and

to attack utility.°?°

393. Third, Claimant contends that the heightened disclosure obligation for sound prediction is

“unprincipled and unfair”.°”° According to Claimant, this rule introduces an unjustified
distinction whereby Canadian courts rely on evidence outside of the patent application to
determine whether utility was demonstrated at the date of filing, but that same evidence

cannot be relied upon to establish whether utility was soundly predicted. The resulting

°20 Claimant refers to the Canadian patent for Latanoprost, a glaucoma drug, arguing that it was construed differently
by two Federal Court of Appeal panels, resulting in one determination of validity and one determination of invalidity
for inutility. Claimant argues that Latanoprost is not an isolated or extreme case. Memorial {{[64, 68, 263; Reply

unpredictability is compounded by the fact that the disclosure obligation’s scope of
application remains unclear.*”’ Claimant also argues that the disclosure rule is unfair

because it is used to invalidate patents that were filed when rule did not exist.*7*

According to Claimant, the unpredictable and incoherent nature of the promise utility
doctrine as a whole is illustrated by the invalidation of the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents:
the Canadian courts implied a promise of long-term effectiveness without any basis in the
patents, discounted pre-filing scientific studies, and applied the heightened disclosure
requirement.*” As a result, the courts determined that these revolutionary, successful drugs

were not useful.>*°

Claimant submits that the promise utility doctrine serves no legitimate policy purpose.
Citing Occidental v. Ecuador, Claimant asserts that an incoherent rule of law such as the
promise utility doctrine cannot support a policy objective because it leads to inconsistent

results and does not promote compliance.**!

In any event, Claimant argues that Respondent has failed to identify any credible policy
objective advanced by the promise utility doctrine.**? Specifically, Claimant rejects
Respondent’s position that the doctrine is meant to enforce the patent bargain in relation to
new use and selection patents. According to Claimant, there is no legal basis for applying
special rules to such patents, and in fact, the promise utility doctrine has been applied to
invalidate all types of pharmaceutical patents.>** Similarly, Claimant argues that no
evidence supports Respondent’s assertion that the doctrine addresses speculative

patenting.***

b. Discrimination

397. Additionally, in the context of its claims under both NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1110,
Claimant submits that the promise utility doctrine discriminates against pharmaceutical

patents as a field of technology, which NAFTA Article 1709(7) expressly prohibits.*>

398. According to Claimant, although the promise utility doctrine is facially neutral, it has
“differentially disadvantageous effects” on the pharmaceutical sector.**° As evidence of

these effects, Claimant refers to statistical data presented by Professor Levin showing that:

a. Before 2005 (when the Federal Courts began to apply the doctrine), no pharmaceutical

patents were invalidated for lack of utility.*°”

b. Since 2005, courts have found that more than two dozen pharmaceutical patents lack
utility, but have not reached this conclusion with respect to a patent in any other

technological field. This constitutes a statistically significant difference between

utility-based invalidity rates for pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical patents.>**

c. Also since 2005, 41 percent of utility decisions concerning pharmaceutical patents have

found a lack of utility, compared to zero percent in all other sectors.>?

399. Claimant asserts that Respondent’s counter-arguments fail in light of these undisputed

facts.°4°

400. Further, Claimant argues that although evidence of discriminatory intent is not required,
such intent on the part of Respondent can be inferred.**! In this context, Claimant makes

the following allegations:

a. The promise utility doctrine was adopted by the courts in litigation over pharmaceutical

patents.

b. The Federal Court has expressly acknowledged the gap between treatment of
pharmaceuticals and other sectors, holding that the “basis for sound prediction, at least
in respect of a pharmaceutical, must be disclosed in the descriptive part of the
patent”.>4?

c. There appears to be an elevated evidentiary standard for pharmaceutical inventions,
given that the utility of mechanical inventions can be shown by a model without

testing.

d. The doctrine’s requirements “conflict, and would objectively be known to conflict, with

the reality of innovative drug development”.*“+

401. Claimant further submits that “[a]nother, less prominent aspect of discrimination, relating
to nationality, is also present in the application of the promise utility doctrine by Canadian
courts”.>*> In support of this position, Claimant points out that only patents held by foreign
firms have been invalidated pursuant to this doctrine, despite its facially neutral character.
According to Claimant, the main beneficiary is the prominent Canadian generic drug

industry.*#°

(2) Respondent’s Position

a. Arbitrariness

In response to Claimant’s allegations of arbitrariness, Respondent again contends that the
promise utility doctrine is not a unitary doctrine, but rather several distinct rules of
Canadian patent law. In Respondent’s view, Claimant’s attempt to show that this fictional

doctrine is arbitrary fails as a matter of principle and fact.**”

In any event, Respondent denies that any of the elements of the alleged promise utility
doctrine are arbitrary. First, Respondent rejects Claimant’s assertion that identifying the
promises contained in a patent is inherently unpredictable.*#* Respondent argues that the
interpretation of a patent is based on sound principles of construction, as confirmed by
Claimant’s expert.*“? This includes the longstanding principle that the patent is construed
as a whole (i.e. both disclosure and claims).°°° For Respondent, the interpretation of the

patent is therefore not “arbitrary”, but rather what judges are called upon to do every day.>*!

In this context, Respondent also disagrees with Claimant’s argument that judges “scour”
patent applications to find promises; in fact, judges decide on the basis of competing
evidence presented by patent litigants and their lawyers.°°? In response to Claimant’s
assertion that this exercise results in inconsistent outcomes, Respondent contends that
different outcomes are a product of the highly fact-dependent circumstances of each

case.>°3

125

405. As a policy matter, Respondent argues that there is nothing arbitrary about holding
patentees to the promises they make in their patents. Respondent points out that patentees
are not required to include any promise in the patent; they do so to satisfy other patent law
requirements, such as showing the advantages of a selection over a genus or the specified

new use of a known compound.>™

406. Second, in response to Claimant’s criticism of the ban on post-filing evidence, Respondent
argues that it is not arbitrary to require inventors to demonstrate or soundly predict the
utility of an invention at the time of filing a patent.* In Respondent’s view, this is
necessary to prevent patents on the basis of “bare speculation”, which is reasonable even
where the speculation later turns out to be correct.**° Respondent points to the testimony
of Claimant’s expert Professor Siebrasse, who acknowledged that the ban on post-filing
evidence is “rationally connected” to the goal of preventing patenting too far upstream.°*”
According to Respondent, Claimant’s argument that the ban leaves pharmaceutical
companies caught in relation to the timing of the patentability requirements is untenable
because (i) Canadian law does not require the clinical trials to which Claimant refers, and
pharmaceutical patents are routinely granted on the basis of animal studies; and (ii) the

number of pharmaceutical patents granted in Canada has increased each year since 2005.°**

407. Third, Respondent contends that requiring patentees to disclose the basis of their sound
predictions in the patent is not arbitrary, but rather “an essential part of the patent
bargain”.**? The Supreme Court of Canada set out the rationale for this rule clearly in

AZT.°© According to Respondent, sound prediction is a permissive doctrine allowing

inventors to obtain a patent before utility can be demonstrated; in return, the patentee must

explain to the public what makes its prediction sound.**!

In sum, Respondent’s position is that all three of these elements of the alleged promise
utility doctrine serve important policy objectives, and while Claimant may disagree with
these policies, it has failed to show any evidence of arbitrariness. In the same way,
Respondent asserts that the application of the various rules of Canadian patent law to the
Strattera and Zyprexa patents “was well-reasoned and grounded in findings of fact rendered
after careful consideration of extensive adversarial records”; there is no indication that the

courts acted arbitrarily.>°

b. Discrimination

Respondent submits that Claimant has also failed to establish that any aspect of the
Canadian courts’ interpretation and application of the utility requirement is
discriminatory.*®? Respondent highlights Claimant’s acknowledgment that the alleged
promise utility doctrine does not on its face discriminate against the pharmaceutical

field.°°*

According to Respondent, there is also no evidence of de facto discrimination against
pharmaceutical patents, as Claimant alleges. Respondent finds the evidence that Claimant

puts forward in an attempt to show de facto discrimination to be flawed in several ways.°°

With respect to Claimant’s statistical evidence, Respondent alleges several errors in the

data set Claimant provided to Professor Levin, including the following:

a. In cases involving findings of both utility and inutility, Claimant used inconsistent

coding rules to support its arguments.*°

More fundamentally, Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to demonstrate any causal
connection between Professor Levin’s findings and the alleged promise utility doctrine.
Respondent highlights Professor Levin’s testimony acknowledging that he was “not
opining on causality”.*”* For Respondent, this problem in Claimant's case is illustrated by
the fact that Claimant improperly counted every inutility finding as an application of the
promise utility doctrine.*”> Thus, the most that can be concluded from Claimant’s data is
that the utility requirement has more relevance in the pharmaceutical field than other
sectors.*”° In Respondent’s view, this greater relevance is not surprising given

pharmaceutical patenting practice, and it in no way amounts to discrimination.*””

Finally, in response to Claimant’s assertion that the principal beneficiaries of inutility
decisions are domestic generic drug makers,*’* Respondent highlights that half of the top
18 generic drug makers (based on sales) are not Canadian-owned. In addition, contrary to
Claimant’s argument that foreign brand-name drug makers face discrimination,
Respondent submits that Canadian biopharmaceutical companies are subject to the same

rules as Claimant.
The Tribunal’s Analysis

(1) Preliminary Observations

As noted above, notwithstanding the Tribunal’s rejection of Claimant’s contention that
there was a fundamental or dramatic change in Canadian patent law, it is appropriate to
address Claimant’s allegations of arbitrariness and discrimination for the reason that, as a
matter of hypothesis, an arbitrary or discriminatory measure could violate NAFTA Article

1105 and/or Article 1110 in the absence of a fundamental or dramatic change in the law.

For purposes of framing the discussion that follows, the Tribunal observes that, although

NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1110 address distinct issues and impose discrete obligations,

595 R-PHM 165.

they are closely related. This relationship is illuminated by the reference to the requirement,
in NAFTA Article 1110(1)(c), that, to be concordant with NAFTA Article 1110(1), the
nationalization or expropriation of an investment must “be in accordance with due process
of law and Article 1105(1)”. The relationship between these provisions is engaged most
acutely in circumstances in which the allegations at issue go to acts of the judiciary, inter
alia, for the reason that an alleged breach of the minimum standard of treatment

requirement of Article 1105(1) informs an alleged breach of Article 1110(1).

Nonetheless, as noted above, NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1110 are separate provisions,
imposing distinct obligations. It is however unnecessary for present purposes to explore
the different standards applicable under Articles 1105(1) and 1110(1) in the present case.
That is because the Tribunal is satisfied that, under any plausible standard, the challenged
decisions of the Canadian courts are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, nor can it be said
that the judicial measures taken were expropriatory within the meaning of Article 1110 in
the present case. The patent grants to Claimant were made in a legal system that historically
has, and necessarily, evolves, and this evolution resulted in later decisions, rationally and
not unforeseeably, that concluded the initial patent grants were invalid, just as the Canadian
statutory patent regime envisions. As such, the challenged decisions of the Canadian courts

cannot constitute either a breach of NAFTA Articles 1105 or 1110.

(2) Arbitrariness

Claimant alleges that the promise utility doctrine applied by Canadian courts is arbitrary
because it is “unpredictable and incoherent” and lacks a legitimate public purpose.*”? The
Tribunal has examined the record to determine whether there is evidence to support this
allegation with respect to the three elements of the doctrine identified by Claimant, taken

individually or together.

First, regarding Canadian courts’ process of construing the promise of the patent, Claimant
relies primarily on (i) its own description of the subjective nature of the process, (ii)

examples of inconsistent judicial decisions, and (iii) statements made by a generic drug

59 C-PHM § IV.C.2(a).

130

422.

423.

company in the context of patent litigation.**° Through these submissions, Claimant clearly
sets out its disagreement with the practice of looking to the disclosure for the promise of a
patent, but it has not shown that the exercise is unpredictable or incoherent. Rather, the
interpretive process undertaken by Canadian courts, as described by Claimant, falls well
within the scope of duties that courts are asked to perform every day. Claimant’s own
expert, Professor Siebrasse, agreed that in interpreting the disclosure, Canadian courts
apply sound principles of construction consistent with principles of statutory

construction.**!

The Tribunal is unpersuaded by examples of courts (or a single court) reaching inconsistent
determinations of a patent’s promise. Some level of unpredictability is present in the
application of all law. In the Tribunal’s view, inconsistency in judicial interpretation at this
limited scale is to be expected, especially in an adversarial system in which courts are

presented with different evidence and expert testimony across cases.

The Tribunal is also unwilling to put significant weight on Apotex’s isolated statements
about the unpredictable nature of the promise doctrine.**? Claimant finds these statements
notable because it considers generic drug manufactures like Apotex to be the principle
beneficiaries of the promise doctrine. The Tribunal notes, however, that Apotex made this
statement in an application for leave to appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court a lower court
decision with which it was presumably unhappy.>*? In this context, such criticism is

unexceptional.

Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has asserted a legitimate public policy
justification for the promise doctrine. In particular, Respondent has explained that
enforcing promises contained in the disclosure helps ensure that “the public receives its
end of the patent bargain” (particularly but not solely in connection with “new use” and

“selection” patents) and that it “encourages accuracy while discouraging overstatement in

patent disclosures”.**+ The Tribunal need not opine on whether the promise doctrine is the
only, or the best, means of achieving these objectives. The relevant point is that, in the
Tribunal’s view, the promise doctrine is rationally connected to these legitimate policy

goals.

424. Second, the Tribunal has considered Claimant’s submissions concerning the alleged
arbitrary nature of the ban on post-filing evidence of utility.°*° The Tribunal finds that
Claimant provided no persuasive evidence showing that this rule is unpredictable or
incoherent. To the contrary, it is a bright line rule that sets a clear date by which patentees

must prove utility.

425. Respondent states that it has chosen to set that deadline as the patent application’s filing
date to prevent patents from being granted on the basis of speculation. In the Tribunal’s
view, there is a rational connection between the rule and this stated goal, as Claimant’s
own expert has acknowledged.**° All patent regimes must determine the line between
speculation and invention, and as Respondent highlights, there is no perfect place to draw
this line. However, the Tribunal does not find anything arbitrary about selecting the patent

application’s filing date.

426. The Tribunal understands the difficulty for companies in innovative industries described
by Claimant, in terms of timing investments and patentability requirements.°*’ With many
potential products, it may be challenging to identify when all patentability requirements
can be met and thereby when to file a patent application. However, this is the consequence

of a rational policy approach in Canada, not an indication of arbitrariness in the law. In

584 R-PHM 41244, citing Dimock First Report §§{72-74, 219.
°85 Tn this context, Claimant has also stated that patentees have no way of knowing how much evidence will be required
by the courts to prove utility. Thi not supported by the record. Claimant has not attempted to show, for example,
that courts have systematically applied different evidentiary rules in similar utility cases, or that they have required
evidence on the basis of personal preference.

986 Tr, 665:24-666:5 (“MR. JOHNSTON: And you would say that the court’s statement that utility must be
demonstrated or soundly predicted at the time of filing is rationally connected to the objective of patenting too far
upstream? PROFESSOR SIEBRASSE: I would say it’s rationally connected, yes.”).

587 See 4392 above.

°88 The Tribunal need not analyse Claimant’s argument that the disclosure rule is unfair because it i
patents that were filed when the rule did not exist. This allegation is dismissed for the reas

such circumstances, it is not the role of a NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal to question the

policy choices of a NAFTA Party.

Third, the Tribunal has reviewed the record in relation to Claimant’s allegation that it is
arbitrary for Canadian courts to require patent applicants to disclose the basis of a sound
prediction of utility in the patent. Claimant’s submissions on this point focus primarily on
the fact that the disclosure rule applies in cases of sound prediction but not in cases of

demonstrated utility. **°

In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent has advanced a legitimate justification for this
distinction: the sound prediction doctrine allows inventors to obtain a patent before they
can demonstrate that the invention is useful. In exchange for the monopoly granted, the
patentee must disclose to the public the basis of its prediction of utility and what makes it

sound. Whether or not this is the preferred approach, it is plainly not an irrational one.

With regard to Claimant’s argument that the scope of this disclosure rule remains unclear,
the Tribunal finds nothing unusual about this level of potential uncertainty. Questions about
the precise scope of application of legal rules abound in nearly all legal regimes. If that

were to render a legal rule arbitrary, the concept of arbitrariness would lose all meaning.

For the above reasons, the Tribunal finds, based on the record before it, that none of the
three elements of the promise utility doctrine identified by Claimant is arbitrary. Even if
the Tribunal were to accept Claimant’s position regarding the legal standards applicable,
i.e., that a measure is arbitrary: (i) when it is unpredictable and incoherent, even if it is not
motivated by bad faith; and (ii) when it has no legitimate purpose,**? Claimant would not
succeed in its allegation of arbitrariness. Furthermore, Claimant has not demonstrated
arbitrariness in the Canadian courts’ application of these rules in any combination. Notably,
this conclusion is supported by the decisions rendered in the Strattera and Zyprexa

litigations. As discussed above, these decisions have a foundation in Canadian law.” They

433.

are also coherent and consistent with the policy justifications stated by Respondent. It is
worth stating again that in these circumstances, the Tribunal will not question the

correctness of the policies or the courts’ decisions.

(3) Discrimination

Claimant’s principal submission under the heading of discrimination is that the promise
utility doctrine discriminates against pharmaceutical patents as a field of technology.**!
Claimant acknowledges that the doctrine is facially neutral but alleges that it has
“differentially disadvantageous effects” on the pharmaceutical sector, amounting to de
facto discrimination. As summarised above, Claimant’s primary support for this allegation
is Professor Levin’s statistical analysis of the outcomes of utility cases.**? Professor Levin
concludes that there is a statistical difference between between utility-based invalidity rates

for pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical patents since 2005.

As a preliminary point, for the reasons set out in Section VIII above, the Tribunal does not
accept Claimant’s attempt to artificially divide utility cases into “before” and “after” the
creation of the promise utility doctrine.°? In addition, the Tribunal finds some of
Claimant’s coding choices questionable. But the critical deficiency of the evidence is not
found in these methodological issues. Even if the Tribunal were to fully embrace
Professor’s Levin’s statistical determination, the Tribunal could not reach Claimant’s
conclusion that the promise utility doctrine has “differentially disadvantageous effects” on

the pharmaceutical sector.°**

Throughout this proceeding, Claimant has asserted a causal relationship between the
promise utility doctrine and higher invalidity rates in the pharmaceutical sector. Yet this is

unsupported by the record.*° Professor Levin explained:

See, e.g., Memorial {220 (“A review of all patent utility decisions by the Federal Courts shows the striking,

I am not opining on causality. I was not asked to do that; I am not
qualified to offer an opinion. I offered a statistical opinion which is
the rejection of the null hypothesis was consistent with a causal
hypothesis, that of Claimants. I agree there could be other causes;
I’m not here to say one way or the other.**°

When the Tribunal posed a question to Claimant on this point, counsel acknowledged that
Professor Levin “does not provide an opinion on causation. He provides an opinion on
whether the dramatically disproportionate numbers would be due to chance or due to

something else. And he says they’ re not due to chance”.*°”

Thus, setting aside methodological issues, the Tribunal can conclude from Professor
Levin’s analysis only that the higher proportion of inutility findings in the pharmaceutical
sector is not by chance. Claimant has not presented evidence establishing the crucial link
between that fact and the alleged promise utility doctrine. Based on the record, the Tribunal
cannot rule out the possibility that alternative factors may give rise or contribute to the
difference in rates of inutility finding. To offer just one example, Respondent has proposed
that the patenting practices of pharmaceutical companies result in patents more susceptible
to utility challenges. The Tribunal cannot determine on the basis of the record whether this
proposal is sound, but simply notes that it is one plausible alternative explanation for

Professor Levin’s conclusion.

In this context, it is worthwhile to identify another methodological issue because it both

illustrates and exacerbates the limitations of Claimant’s statistical analysis. Although

 

Claimant has acknowledged that, today, Canadian courts do not apply the promise utility
doctrine in all utility cases, Claimant did not attempt to isolate “promise cases” for the

purpose of its data set.>°*

‘attributable to the ground of utility alone.’”); Claimant’s Closing Statement, Tr. 2120:21-2121:3 (“40 percent
invalidity decisions only in the pharmaceutical sector, we would posit are discrimination as to field of technology,
because no other sector is experiencing the invalidation rates of their patents under Canada’s promise utility doctrine
standard, other than the pharmaceutical sector. So yes, we would posit that there’s causation.”).

439.

440.

In sum, Claimant asks the Tribunal to find a causal link between the alleged promise utility
doctrine and higher rates of inutility decisions in the pharmaceutical sector on the basis of

mere assumptions. The Tribunal will not do so.

Claimant also asks the Tribunal to infer discriminatory intent for the reasons set out in
paragraph 400 above. Claimant’s first allegation—that the Canadian courts adopted the
doctrine in pharmaceutical litigation—must be dismissed for the reasons stated in Section
VIII above.” The Tribunal is also unpersuaded by Claimant’s reliance on the Federal
Court’s statement that “[t]he basis for sound prediction, at least in respect of a
pharmaceutical, must be disclosed in the descriptive part of the patent”.°° Claimant does
not allege that the disclosure rule for sound prediction applies only to pharmaceutical
patents, and has expressly acknowledged that the promise utility doctrine is facially neutral.
Therefore, the Tribunal does not see how the court’s reference to pharmaceuticals, in a
pharmaceutical patent case, expresses discrimination. Claimant’s remaining criticisms of

the doctrine simply do not speak to discriminatory intent.

For all of these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has not proven its allegation
that the promise utility doctrine discriminates against pharmaceutical patents. Even if the
Tribunal were to accept Claimant’s position regarding the legal standards applicable, i.e.,
that a measure is discriminatory where there is (i) “any differential treatment of a foreign
investor. . . based on unreasonable distinctions and demands”,! and (ii) “facially neutral
measures that in practice produce differentially disadvantageous effects on a particular

field of technology”,®™ Claimant would not succeed in its allegation of discrimination.

The Tribunal notes that Claimant has advanced another allegation of discrimination,
“relating to nationality”.°? Specifically, Claimant’s position is that “the promise utility

doctrine discriminates in favor of a prominent domestic industry at the expense of foreign

did not make any distinction between utility and promise utility outcomes in your analysis. Is that right? PROFESSOR
LEVIN: I did not, no.”).

patent holders”. Claimant does not allege that the promise utility doctrine discriminates
against foreign patent holders on its face, or that Canadian courts have shown any intent to
discriminate against foreign patent holders. Rather, Claimant argues that, in practice, the
application of the promise utility doctrine has resulted in the invalidation of patents held
by foreign firms only, and that the primary beneficiaries have been domestic generic drug

manufacturers.

It appears to the Tribunal that Claimant has not made much effort to fully develop this
theory of de facto nationality-based discrimination. The only facts Claimant has come close
to establishing are that (i) since 1 January 2005, the pharmaceutical patents invalidated on
the ground of inutility (whether through the application of the promise utility doctrine or
not) have been held by foreign pharmaceutical companies, and (ii) the largest
pharmaceutical companies in the world are not Canadian.©® The Tribunal will not infer
discrimination from such a bare record. Claimant has wholly failed to demonstrate that the

promise utility doctrine discriminates against foreign patent holders.

(4) Conclusion

For the above reasons, the Tribunal holds that even if it were to accept Claimant’s position
regarding the legal standards applicable to its allegations of arbitrariness and
discrimination, Claimant has failed to establish the factual premise on which its allegations
of arbitrariness and discrimination are based. The Tribunal has already concluded that
there was no fundamental or dramatic change in Canadian patent law. In the circumstances
presented in these proceedings, the evolution of the Canadian legal framework relating to
Claimant’s patents cannot sustain a claim of arbitrariness or discrimination going to a

violation of NAFTA Articles 1105(1) or 1110(1).

COSTS

Applicable Law

NAFTA Article 1135 states that “[a] tribunal may ... award costs in accordance with the

applicable arbitration rules”.
Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall
in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the
arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the
parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking
into account the circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance
referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal,
taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free
to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion
such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable.

Claimant’s Submission on Costs

Claimant submits that it should be awarded its costs of the arbitration under UNCITRAL
Article 40(1) and its costs of legal representation under Article 40(2) because: (i) Claimant
is the proper prevailing party in this arbitration, and (ii) Respondent introduced a number

of inefficiencies into the proceeding.*”

In particular, Claimant identifies three ways in which Respondent’s conduct was
inefficient. First, Respondent raised an untimely, unfounded jurisdictional objection, which
delayed briefing on the amicus and Article 1128 submissions and forced Claimant to
prepare an additional written pleading. The way in which Respondent then pursued its
objection increased Claimant’s burden of defending against it.’ Second, Respondent,
through the testimony of Dr. Marcel Brisebois, introduced evidence on 68 patents related

to raloxifene and 27 patents for certain uses of olanzapine and atomoxetine, none of which

08 C-CS 45.

138

was at issue in this case. Third, Respondent’s expert, Professor Daniel Gervais,

introduced extensive documentary evidence concerning the substantive patent law

obligations of non-NAFTA States, which is entirely irrelevant.°!°

447. In contrast, Claimant asserts that it “consistently presented reasonable and focused

evidence” throughout the proceeding, and its costs are therefore reasonable.°!!

448. In these circumstances, Claimant argues that even if Respondent were to prevail, Tribunal

could reasonably order the Parties to bear their own costs. In this regard, Claimant notes

that:

Tribunals have recognized that claimants in investment arbitration
must often present “novel issues of international law, the resolution
of which cannot be easily predicted.” Moreover, arbitrators have
noted that awards of costs against claimants may deter investors
from seeking to enforce the rights accorded under investment
treaties,°!?

Respondent’s Submission on Costs

Respondent argues that it should be awarded all of its costs in this arbitration under
UNCITRAL Rules Article 40, including both its share of the Tribunal’s fees and expenses
and the reasonable costs of its legal representation and assistance.°!* According to
Respondent, Canadian taxpayers should not be forced to pay the cost of Respondent’s

defence in this arbitration, which Claimant should never have initiated.°!>

Respondent asserts that each of the factors that tribunals normally consider in determining
the apportionment of costs (the relative success of the parties, quality of the claims,
complexity of the issues, and the reasonableness of the parties’ incurred expenses) weighs
in favor of awarding Respondent all of its costs.°'® First, Respondent should prevail in this
arbitration because it has demonstrated that Claimant’s claim is manifestly without legal
merit for several independent reasons.°'’ Further, “[t]he lack of quality in Claimant’s

claims goes beyond a typical unsuccessful claim” because Claimant is seeking from the

452. In addition, Respondent argues that Claimant’s conduct in this proceeding introduced
unnecessary complexity into the proceeding. For instance, Claimant has (i) failed to clearly
articulate the nature and scope of its claim, (ii) taken inconsistent positions on certain
issues, (iii) changed its claim in the Reply, (iv) submitted extensive expert evidence that

The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs

Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules adopts the “loser pays” principle in relation to the
“costs of arbitration”, unless the circumstances of the case weigh in favor of a different
apportionment. In respect of the “costs of legal representation and assistance”, Article
40(2) confers broad discretion on the Tribunal to determine any reasonable apportionment

of such costs in light of the circumstances of the case.

Although the UNCITRAL Rules do not elaborate upon the relevant “circumstances of the
case” to be considered, Article 40 has been interpreted and applied by numerous tribunals.
In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent has correctly identified four of the circumstances most
commonly examined in this context: (i) the relative success of the parties, (ii) quality of
the claims, (iii) complexity of the issues, and (iv) the reasonableness of the parties’ incurred

expenses. The Tribunal will consider each of these factors.

a. The relative success of the parties: Respondent is the successful Party, except in

relation to its objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

b. Quality of the claims: Although Claimant has not succeeded in this arbitration, its

claims were not in any sense frivolous, and Claimant pursued them in good faith.

142

Indeed, it must be noted that both Parties displayed the highest level of professionalism,

efficiency and courtesy in presenting their cases.

c. Complexity of the issues: This arbitration involved many complex issues of fact and
law, some of them before a NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal for the first time. The
complexity of the case is evidenced not only by the Parties’ submissions, but also by

the amicus and Article 1128 submissions.

d. Reasonableness of the parties’ expenses: In light of the complexity of the case, the

Tribunal does not consider the Parties’ expenses to be unreasonable.

456. Taking into account these factors and all of the surrounding circumstances, the Tribunal
does not see any reason to depart from the “loser pays” principle reflected in Article 40(1)
in relation to the costs of the arbitration. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that both Parties

have referred to the “loser pays” principle in their submissions on costs.

457. Therefore, Claimant shall bear the costs of this arbitration, including the Tribunal
Members’ fees (at USD 375/hour) and expenses, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct

expenses, amounting to (in USD):°*

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.°*°

As a result, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 374,848.99, and

Claimant shall reimburse Respondent’s share of the costs.

Regarding the costs of legal representation and assistance, in the exercise of its discretion
under Article 40(2), and considering that Respondent prevailed on the merits but not on
jurisdiction, the Tribunal has concluded that it is appropriate for Claimant to bear its own

costs and to reimburse Respondent for 75 percent of Respondent’s costs.

Therefore, Claimant shall pay to Respondent the amount of CAD 4,448,625.32,
representing 75 percent of the sum of (i) Respondent’s legal fees amounting to CAD

4,579,260.92 plus (ii) Respondent’s additional disbursements of CAD 1,352,239.50.

CONCLUSIONS

In this Section the Tribunal sets forth its conclusions reached in this Award with respect to
(i) jurisdiction; (ii) the merits; and (iii) costs, fees and expenses.

Jurisdiction

Respondent submits that Claimant’s claim is time-barred.’ In its view, Claimant’s claim
falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis.°*

As set out at [97 above, Claimant on the other hand requests that the Tribunal:

(i) reject Canada’s jurisdictional objection as untimely under
UNCITRAL Article 21(3) or, in the alternative, reject Canada’s
objection on the merits[...]°

In Section VI.E above, the Tribunal determines that Claimant’s NoA was timely, and that

Claimant’s claims fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis.°*°

©6 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

465. The Tribunal therefore dismisses Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione temporis and finds that it has jurisdiction to hear Claimant’s claims as submitted to
it in this arbitration. Claimant’s request to reject Respondent’s objection on the merits is

granted.

466. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to decide whether
Respondent’s jurisdictional objection should be barred as untimely under Article 21(3) of

the UNCITRAL Rules.“*!

B. Merits

467. In relation to the merits of its claim, Claimant seeks the following relief, as set out at {95

above:

(i) damages for the full measure of direct losses and
consequential damages sustained as a consequence of
Respondent’s breach of its obligations under Chapter 11 of
the NAFTA, estimated in an amount not less than CDN $500
million plus any payments Claimant or its enterprise is
required to make arising from the improvident loss of its
Zyprexa and Strattera Patents or its inability to enforce its
Zyprexa and Strattera Patents;

(iii) pre-award and post-award interest;

(iv) payment of a sum of compensation equal to any tax
consequences of the award, in order to maintain the award’s
integrity[...]°°?

468. Respondent, on the other hand, requests an award “dismissing Claimant’s claim in its

entirety”.

473.

As a consequence of the findings set forth in Sections VIII and IX above, the Tribunal
concludes that Claimant has failed to establish the factual premise of its claims.
Specifically, the Tribunal holds that, based on the record of this case, the challenged
measures—the invalidation of the Zyprexa and Strattera Patents through application of the
legal rules that Claimant refers to as the promise utility doctrine—cannot form the basis of
an expropriation claim under NAFTA Article 1110 or a claim for a violation of the
minimum standard of treatment under NAFTA Article 1105. The Tribunal also finds that
there was not an arbitrary or discriminatory measure in violation of NAFTA Article 1110
or NAFTA Article 1105.4 The Tribunal must dismiss Claimant’s claims without further

inquiry.

Since there has been no breach of Respondent’s obligations under Chapter Eleven of
NAFTA, the Tribunal denies Claimant’s primary relief sought in the form of damages.
Claimant’s further requests for (i) pre-award and post-award interest, and (ii) a “sum of

compensation equal to any tax consequences of the award”, therefore fall away.

Accordingly, the Tribunal grants Respondent’s request for an award dismissing Claimant’s

claim in its entirety.

In light of the Tribunal’s conclusions in relation to liability, there will be no second phase

of this arbitration in relation to damages.

The Tribunal does not deem it necessary or appropriate to give further consideration to the
Parties’ respective requests for “such further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal may deem just

635 and “any other relief that may seem just”.°° No argument or

and appropriate’
particularized request has been made in relation to these requests. The Tribunal considers
that it would violate its mandate if it were to grant relief outside the pleaded cases of the
Parties. In the absence of further substantiation, these requests for relief are in the

Tribunal’s view meaningless legal recitations.

Costs

Claimant seeks the following relief in relation to costs, as set out at {95 above:

the full costs associated with these proceedings, including all
professional fees and disbursements, as well as the fees of the
Arbitral Tribunal.°”

Claimant also seeks its costs specifically in connection with Canada’s jurisdictional

objection.©*

As set out at [98 above, Respondent requests an award “awarding Respondent its costs,
with applicable interest, pursuant to Article 1135(1) of the NAFTA and Article 40 of the
UNCITRAL Rules”.°?

As the Tribunal determines in Section X above, in accordance with the “loser pays”
principle, Claimant shall bear the costs of this arbitration, including the Tribunal Members’

fees and expenses, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses.°

With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance, in the exercise of its
discretion under Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and considering that Respondent
prevailed on the merits but not on jurisdiction, the Tribunal concludes that it is appropriate
for Claimant to bear its own costs and to reimburse Respondent for 75 percent of

Respondent’s costs.!

The Tribunal therefore rejects Claimant’s requests for relief in relation to costs.
Respondent’s request for its costs is granted in full in relation to the arbitration costs, and

partially to the extent of 75 percent of its costs of legal representation and assistance.
