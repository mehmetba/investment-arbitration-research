Protocol for discussion and agreement on the procedural timelines. On the same

day, the Respondent’s solicitor replied that it would confer with the Claimant’s

solicitor.

On 7 March 2014, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties were still

discussing the draft Procedural Protocol.

On 15 April 2014, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had
agreed on a partial Procedural Protocol on the timelines only up to the discovery

stage. On the same day, the Tribunal, with the consent of the Parties, issued a

8

15.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 13 of 263

partial Procedural Protocol which set out the timelines for the service of the
Statement of Claim (“S/C”) by the Claimant, the service of the Statement of

Defence and the production of documents.

On 7 May 2014, the Claimant applied for an extension of time to file the
Statement of Claim on the ground that it was waiting for the formal Certificate
to be issued by the independent auditors pursuant to clause 16.3 of the
Concession Agreement (as defined in the Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration) for
the purposes of quantification of the Claimant’s claim. On the same day, the
Respondent’s solicitors informed the Tribunal that they were taking instructions

on the Claimant’s request.

On_8 May 2014, the Respondent consented to the request for extension of time,
whereupon the Tribunal, with the consent of the Parties, issued an Amended

Procedural Protocol to extend the procedural timelines.
On 14 May 2014, the Claimant filed its S/C.

On 24 June 2014, the Respondent requested an extension of time of three weeks

from 25 June 2014 to file its Defence and Counterclaim (“D/C”). On 26_June

 

2014, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Claimant was not
agreeable to any extension of time. In response, the Respondent filed an
application for an extension of time to serve its D/C by 16 July 2014 on the
following grounds; (a) the S/C set out a number of substantive issues going
back to 2010 which the Respondent needed to address: (b) a number of these
issues involved Maldivian law; (c) the S/C also enclosed an anditor’s report
which the Respondent needed to review and respond to; (d) many of the
documents are in the Dhivehi language which have yet to be officially

translated, and the Respondent was doing its best to get them translated...

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 14 of 263

On 27 June 2014, the Claimant served a lengthy response to the Respondent’s

 

application in which it sets out the reasons for its objections. On the same day,

the Respondent responded to the Claimant’s objections, point by point.

On 28 June 2014, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s application for an
extension of time to file its D/C by 16 July 2014.

On 16 July 2014, the Respondent filed its D/C.

On 13 August 2014, the Claimant filed its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim
dated 13 August 2014 (“CR to D/C”).

On 10 September 2014, the Respondent filed its Reply to CR to D/C.
On 20 October 2014, the Respondent -

a. applied to the Tribunal for an order that the Respondent need only file one
Redfern Schedule after both rounds of voluntary disclosure were
completed, and not as provided in the APP; and

b. informed the Tribunal that, following the Tribunal’s e-mail dated 28
August 2014, the Parties had agreed to amend the timelines for voluntary

disclosure under clause 3.1 of the APP, to (i) 7 October 2014 for the first
tranche, and (ii) 27 October 2014 for the second and final tranche.

On 23 October 2014, the Claimant informed the Tribunal by letter that it had no

 

objection to the Respondent’s application regarding the filing of one Redfern
Schedule. The Claimant also proposed other timelines for further requests for
production of documents, and the final timeline for the submission of the

Redfern Schedule by 5 January 2015.

On 23 October 2014, the Respondent responded by agreeing to the Claimant’s
proposals, whereupon the Tribunal issued the directions as per the agreement of

the Parties set out at [21]-[22] above.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 15 of 263

On 13 November 2014, the Respondent applied to the Tribunal for an order
under section 12(1)(a) of the International Arbitration Act (the “IAA”).and
Rule 24 (k) of the SIAC Rules that the Claimant provide security for costs in the
amount of $$150,000 by way of a banker’s guarantee on the grounds that: (a)
the Claimant had been in voluntary administration in Australia around 27 June
2014; (b) it had ceased trading since September 2012; (c) it had entered into a
deed of company arrangement with its creditors under which a third party would
fund A$376,000 to settle the Administrator’s fee and a priority creditor’s claim;
and (d) a third party was funding the Claimant in relation to this Arbitration.

On 20 November 2014, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s application
for security for costs and stated that if the Tribunal were minded to grant the
application, the amount sought was excessive in that the costs should not be
higher than $$50,000 at that stage of the proceedings, and that the Parties

should be given time to agree on the matter among themselves.

On 20 November 2014, the Tribunal ordered the Claimant to furnish security
for costs in the sum of $$150,000 by way of a bankers’ guarantee within two
weeks from its order, and that the Tribunal would settle the terms if the Parties
could not agree on them. The Tribunal also ordered that the costs of the
application to be reserved, with liberty to the Respondent to apply for further

security for costs.

On 27 November 2014, the Respondent requested the Claimant to produce 18
categories of documents set out in a Redfern Schedule. On 11 December 2014,

the Claimant objected to the production of 12 categories in the Request.

On 17 December 2014, the Respondent made an application to the Tribunal to
settle the terms of the banker’s guarantee as security for the costs, and also for

an extension of time to produce the banker’s guarantee. The application set out

the grounds of disagreement between the Parties and exhibited two Annexes,
“A” and “B”, being the disputed drafts of the banker’s guarantee.

On 17 December 2014, the Tribunal prepared a new draft of the banker’s

 

guarantee based on the said Annexes and forwarded it to the Parties as the
banker’s guarantee approved by the Tribunal. The Tribunal also directed the
Claimant to procure the guarantee to be issued within two weeks from 17

December 2014.

On 5 January 2015, the Respondent filed a 35-page submission (to which was
annexed exhibits totaling 329 pages), together with a bundle of five authorities
(totaling 55 pages) setting out the arguments that it was entitled to the
production of 12 of the categories of documents which the Claimant had

objected to on the ground of irrelevancy to “the case in hand”.

On 5 January 2015, the Tribunal commented in its email to the Respondent that
some of the documents it sought discovery were in the public domain. On 6
January 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it could not find many
of the public documents in the relevant public registries, and acknowledged that
there were other documents it had sought which were also in the public domain

and that it would look for them in the relevant registries,

On 6 January 2015, the Claimant, in reply to the Respondent’s email dated 6
January 2015 that the Claimant had failed to procure the banker’s guarantee,
informed the Tribunal that it had submitted an application to a Malaysian bank
to issue the guarantee but that the bank was not agreeable to issuing a guarantee
which did not provide for an expiry date, and that it would need to apply for

clearance from higher management.

On 7 January 2015, the Tribunal issued its order directing the Claimant to

produce certain documents requested by the Respondent in its Request for

Production of Documents. On the same day, the Claimant sought the Tribunal’s
leave to address the Respondent’s submission relating to the production of
documents (see [31] above) on the ground that it had not been given the
opportunity to do so. On the same day, the Respondent objected to the
Claimant’s application on the ground that the Claimant had failed to make its
submissions after having received the completed Redfern on 22 December
2014. On 8 January 2015, the Claimant responded to the Respondent’s

objections. On the same day, the Tribunal ruled that its order was final.

On 13 January 2015, the Respondent applied to the Tribunal to suspend the
proceedings on the ground that the Claimant had failed to furnish the banker’s
guarantee. On 15 January 2015, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it was
trying its-best to procure the banker’s guarantee and would abide by any order
of the Tribunal.

On 22 January 2015, the Respondent sought the Tribunal’s further directions on
the Claimant’s non-compliance with the Tribunal’s directions of 17 December
2015.

On 22 January 2015, the Claimant filed its Redfern Schedule, its written
submissions in respect of the Claimant’s Request to Produce Documents dated
22 January 2015, including Appendices B to F to the written submissions, and
stated that Appendix A (Parts I and I) would be sent separately due to size

constraints.

On 27 January 2015, Providence Law Asia LLC (“PLA”) informed the Tribunal
that it had been appointed by the Claimant to act in place of Rodyk & Davidson
LLP (“R&D”).

On 3 March 2015, the Claimant applied to the Tribunal that it be allowed to
provide security for costs of S$150,000 by way of a solicitor’s undertaking to be

given by PLA. On 4 March 2015, the Respondent responded that it had

 

proposed that the Claimant pay the security in cash to an escrow account, which
the Claimant had rejected, and that the Respondent would prefer a banker’s

guarantee to a solicitor’s undertaking, but left it to the Tribunal to decide.

 

On 4 March 2015, the Tribunal granted the Claimant’s application that a

solicitor’s undertaking be provided in place of a banker’s guarantee.
On 9 March 2015, PLA provided its undertaking on security for costs.

On 20 April 2015, the Claimant produced the Third List of Documents (with an
Index) relating to the documents it was ordered to produce earlier (see [33]
above), but reserving the right to object to the use of the documents at the

hearing.

On 28 April 2015, the Tribunal requested the Parties to agree on the next set of
timelines for the remaining procedural steps to be taken and on the hearing

dates.

On 6 May 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had
agreed to the Tribunal fixing the hearing dates at 5-9 October 2015 and 12-16

 

October 2015. On 7 May 2015, the Tribunal issued the order fixing the said
hearing dates as agreed by the Parties.

On 3 June 2015, the Respondent filed an application (8 pages of text and
Annexes “A” and “B” totaling 116 pages) to amend its D/C, setting out the
reasons for the application, as follows: (a) they did not fall outside the
arbitration agreement; (b) they could be largely dealt with by written

submissions; and (c) they would not cause prejudice to the Claimant.

On 11 June 2015, the Claimant filed a submission (5 pages of text and Annexes

“A” to “G” “totaling 274 pages) that: (a) the proposed substantive amendments

to the D/C at [36A], [36B] and [77.4] should be disallowed; and (b) the Tribunal
should convene an oral hearing of the Respondent’s application in order to be
fully apprised of the Claimant’s objections, supported by relevant documents

and legal authorities.

On 11 June 2015, the Respondent replied to the Claimant’s submissions and

 

argued that its proposed amendments were necessitated by the Claimant
producing a letter from KordaMentha to the Claimant dated 5 June 2015 and
relying on it to assert that the Claimant “had ceased operations since 2012”
(and was accordingly insolvent) and which, on its face, was an erroneous
interpretation of those words. The Respondent alleged that KordaMentha’s
comment was “made based ot [its] understanding at that time and that the
[Claimant] was delisted in September 2012”. KordaMentha’s comment was not

factually correct.

On 11 June 2015, the Tribunal, after considering the arguments of the Parties,
allowed the Respondent to amend its D/C as marked in the draft (“D/C Am1”),
and directed the Respondent to file the same by the next day, with leave to the
Claimant to file its amended CR to D/C by 16 June 2015.

On 12 June 2015, the Respondent filed its D/C Am1.

 

On 16 June 2015, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had mutually

 

agreed on the timelines on the next procedural steps leading to the hearing fixed
for 5~ 9 October 2015 and 12 ~ 16 October 2015. A draft Procedural Protocol
No 2 was enclosed for the Tribunal’s endorsement. A corrected draft was
forwarded to the Tribunal on the same day. The Tribunal issued the corrected
Procedural Protocol No 2 later on 16 June 2015.

On 16 June 2015, the Parties mutually agreed to extend the date for filing the
Claimant’s Amended Reply to D/C Al by 17 June 2015, which the Tribunal

noted. On 17 June 2015, the Claimant filed its Reply (Amendment No 1) dated
17 June 2015”).

On 22 June 2015, the Respondent applied (11 pages of text and Annexes “A” to

 

“D” totalling 115 pages) (‘Application for Further Disclosure”) for an order
for further production of documents by the Claimant, viz. (1) in relation to
Request 18 of the Respondent’s Request to Produce Documents , inter alia, the
board minutes discussing, but not limited to, the Claimant’s assets, the delisting
of the Claimant’s shares on the ASX and its cessation of operations in 2012; and
(2) the Claimant’s audited accounts or management accounts for Y/2012-
Y/2014.

On 26 June 2015, the Claimant responded to the Respondent’s application for
further discovery (7 pages of text and Annexes “A” to “totaling 215 pages) and
contended, for the reasons stated therein, that the Respondent was not entitled to
the requested disclosures. The Claimant requested the Tribunal to hold an oral
hearing on the matter to enable its Counsel to fully argue its case before the

Tribunal.

On 26 June 2015, the Tribunal, having regard to the extensive objections of the
Claimant to the Respondent’s application for further disclosure of documents by
the Claimant, the voluminous exhibits, and the change of legal representation of
the Claimant, informed the Parties by email that it had decided to hear the
Parties orally on the Application for Further Disclosure. The Tribunal directed

the Parties to agree on a date for the oral hearing.

On 29 June 2015, the Claimant applied (58 pages of text, including Annexes
“A” to “D”) for a ruling from the Tribunal that, notwithstanding the
Respondent’s intention to call an expert witness on Maldivian law in relation to

the issues in this Arbitration, it was not necessary for expert evidence of

Maldivian law to be given as a question of fact as the Parties could submit on

Maldivian law.

On 1 July 2015, the Tribunal was notified by Aldgate Chambers LLC that it had
been appointed as solicitors for the Respondent in place of Advocatus Law
LLP.

On 1 July 2015, with the consent of the Claimant, the Respondent’s new
solicitors, Aldgate Chambers LLC, filed the Respondent’s Reply (Amendment
No 1).

On 8 July 2015, the Respondent responded (42 pages of text, including Annexes
“A” and “B”) to the Claimant’s request to the Tribunal for a ruling on the need
to call expert evidence on Maldivian law, and contended that, inter alia, such
expert evidence was beneficial to the Tribunal in view of the complexity of
Maldivian law and that the Respondent should not in any event be precluded

from calling such evidence.

On 9 July 2015, the Tribunal ruled that it had no reason to prevent the
Respondent from calling expert evidence on Maldivian law, and that it was a
matter for the Claimant to decide on its own course of action. If expert evidence
were called, the Tribunal would hear the witness in the normal way, like any

other expert witness.

On 9 July 2015, the Tribunal, in view of the Parties’ inability to agree on a date
for the oral hearing of the Application for Further Disclosure for further
discovery, issued the following directions: (a) the application to be heard on 27
July 2015 at 10 am; (b) the Parties are to exchange written submissions on 17
July 2015 (this date was later changed to 20 July 2015); and (c) if the
Claimant’s counsel could not attend the hearing on 27 July 2015, the Tribunal

would give its decision based on the written submissions.

On 20 July 2015, the Claimant filed its written submissions in the Respondent's
application dated 22 June 2015 regarding the Claimant's Production of
Documents (20 pages), together with a bundle of authorities (467 pages). On the
same_day, the Respondent filed its submissions (29 pages), together with a
bundle of authorities (83 pages), on the same subject matter. On the same day,
the Claimant confirmed that the Parties would be available for the oral hearing

On 20 July 2015, the Claimant sought the Tribunal’s directions as to whether it
required the Claimant to prove Maldivian law as a question of fact at the
hearing or if the Tribunal is prepared to accept submissions on Maldivian law
from the Claimant’s Maldivian co-counsel. On the same day, the Tribunal
responded that it had not taken any position that Maldivian law, being a foreign
law, has to be proved as a fact or that it has to be disproved as a fact. Hence, the
Claimant must make up its own mind on how it wishes to proceed with respect

to the expert evidence on the basis of international arbitration practice.

On 26 July 2015, the Tribunal issued directions on the procedure to be followed
at the 27 July 2015 hearing, and that with reference to the redacted documents,
the Parties should consider whether the un-redacted versions should be
produced to the Tribunal for relevancy/materiality, and that the Tribunal would

rule immediately or as soon as possible.

On 27 July 2015, the Tribunal heard submissions from the Parties on the
Application for Further Disclosure and issued its orders for the production of

documents as requested by the Respondent.

Respondent to answer the Interrogatories set out at Annex “A” to the

2015, the Claimant clarified, at the request of the Tribunal, that the application
was made under section 12(1)(b) of the LAA.

On 3 August 2015, the Respondent filed its response (9 pages), together with a
PDF of annexures (378 pages) objecting to the Application for Interrogatories
on the grounds that: (a) the Claimant was effectively serving on the Respondent
interrogatories to amplify and elucidate a document that has been disclosed; (b)
the answers sought by the Claimant are irrelevant; and/or (c) interrogatories in
international arbitration were rare, particularly where these issues could be dealt
with by way of cross-examination of the factual witnesses, and that there were

no good reasons offered by the Claimant to depart from this.

On 7 August 2015, the Tribunal, after considering the submissions of the Parties
on the Application for Interrogatories, issued its order directing the Claimant to
answer the interrogatories itemised as 4.1 and 4.2 under [10] and [11] therein.
Consequent upon the order, [10] of the Procedural Protocol No 2 was amended
to require the Parties to exchange witness statements on 24 August 2015, and

[11] to remain unchanged, subject to any application for extension of time.

On 12 August 2015, the Respondent served on the Claimant and the Tribunal

IX. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL EVENTS

A. THE MATERIAL EVENTS PRIOR TO THE ISSUE OF THE NOTICE OF
ARBITRATION

119. The material facts giving rise to this Arbitration are as follows:

a. The Claimant was one of four short-listed parties who submitted bids
(consisting of a technical bid and a price bid) for the MIBCS Project to

be implemented on a BOT basis for a concessionary period of 20 years.

b. The four technical bids were opened on 30 May 2010. The Claimant’s
bid was evaluated by the TEB as the best bid, but it was cancelled for an
irregularity in the evaluation. A second TE was done by an independent
panel of experts who also gave the highest marks to the Claimant. The
price bids were opened on 22 September 2010, and the Claimant’s bid
was also evaluated as the best bid. On 29 September 2010, the
Respondent informed the Claimant that it was the successful bidder for
the MIBCS Project.

c. On 17 October 2010, the ACC directed the DOIE not to award the
MIBCS Project to any party until instructed otherwise. The Respondent
(represented by the DOJE) ignored the ACC’s instruction as the AGO
had cleared the legality of the award. The Parties executed the CA on 17
October 2012. It is not clear from the documentary evidence whether the
CA was executed before or after the DOIE received the ACC’s directive
not to execute the CA.

d. Between 21 October 2010 and April 2011, the implementation works on

the project were interrupted by various decisions of the agencies of the

46

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 51 of 263

Respondent. However, on 22 May 2011, the PO directed that the works

on the project be proceeded with.

e. Between May 2011 and October 2011, the works were again interrupted
by the Respondent. On 31 October 2011, the Cabinet decided to proceed
with the project.

f. Between 2 November 2011 and September 2013, the ACC instituted a
number of court proceedings against the DOIE in the Maldivian courts in
order to stop the implementation of the project on the basis that the
DOIE was under a legal obligation to comply with the ACC’s directives.
The Claimant was given leave by the court to intervene in the
proceedings. Eventually, when the case reached the Supreme Cowt of
Maldives on appeal, the Court decided that the ACC had only
investigative powers under the ACC Act, and that it had no power to
direct the DOIE not to sign the CA or to implement it (see Chronology
of Events at [118] above).

g. The Claimant completed the installation of the border control system in
accordance with the terms of the CA. The system became operational] on
20 September 2012 when the Claimant issued the Certificate of
Acceptance in respect of the Border Contro] Module which was signed
off by the DOIE.

h. The Certificate of Acceptance was endorsed by the Respondent on 20
September 2012. Consequently, the 20-year concession period under the
CA commenced on 20 September 2012. Thereafter, the Claimant was
entitled to payment of the arrival/departure fee of non-Maldivians of
either US$2 or USS4 per passenger, depending on the interpretation of
clause 5 of the CA.

47

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 52 of 263

i. Between 19 December 2012 and August 2013, the Claimant sent to the
Respondent a series of invoices based on US$4 per passenger for

payment of the monthly fee due under the CA. These were not paid.

j. On 20 December 2012, the Finance Committee examined the terms of
the CA and recommended that the CA be terminated and that its
recommendation be included in the annual budget to be passed by the
Parliament in the manner provided in the Constitution of the Republic of
Maldives (“Constitution”) (Report No. MLK/2012/R-9).

k. On 23 December 2012, the Budget Review Committee also
recommended that the CA be terminated and that its recommendation be
included as part of the 2013 national budget to be passed by Parliament
as required by the Constitution.

1. On 25 December 2012, Parliament unanimously passed the Finance

Committee’s report on the CA.
m. On27 December 2012, Parliament passed the National Budget for 2013.

n. On 5 August 2013, the Respondent notified the Claimant by letter that,
for the reasons given therein, it was not bound by the CA and giving 14
days’ notice that it would take over the management of the border

control of the Maldives for the reasons stated therein.

o. From 19 to 20 August 2013, the Respondent disconnected the MIBCS

installed by the Claimant and took over border contro] of the Maldives.

p. On 5 November 2013, the Claimant (through its solicitors) notified the
Respondent by letter that its actions amounted to breaches of the terms
of the CA and/or a repudiatory breach of the CA, and accordingly, gave
notice under clause 12.1 of the CA, and that if the Respondent persisted
in breaching the CA, the Claimant was entitled to elect to terminate the

CA under clause 12.2 of the CA, and further or alternatively under the

48

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 53 of 263

general law, it would claim damages and losses totaling US$268.8

million.

q. On 20 December 2013, the Claimant gave the Respondent notice of
termination under clause 12.2 of the CA and, in the alternative, the
Claimant’s acceptance of the Respondent’s repudiatory breach of the
CA,

r. On 9 January 2014, the Claimant served its Notice of Arbitration on the
Respondent.

the MIBCS that the Claimant is rightfully entitled to be paid pursuant to, inter alia,
clauses 5.2 and 5.3 of the Concession Agreement.

122. At [16]- [41] of S/C Am], the Claimant pleaded the factual and legal bases of

the said claims, and at [42] claimed as follows:

By reason of the above, the Claimant claims:

a. Damages for delays in implementation of the Concession Agreement to be

f. Such further and other relief as the Tribunal may see fit to award.

B. THE RESPONDENT’S DEFENCE AND COUNTERCLAIM ON 30 SEPTEMBER
2015

123. The Respondent’s pleaded defence and counterclaim are set out at [2]-[77] of its

D/C Am2 and may be summarized as follows:

(2]-[6] (a) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction as the Claimant’s Notice of
Arbitration was issued in breach of clause 19.1 of the CA (which requires
service of notice of a dispute followed by a mutual discussion to resolve
the dispute). Subsequently, in its Opening Statement dated 3 October 2015,
the Respondent abandoned its jurisdictional objection.

[8] (b) The CA was void/voidable on the following grounds:

8.1 The [CA] is tainted with corruption;

8.2 The [CA] is illegal under the laws of the Republic of Maldives and / or
pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Maldives;

8.3 The Controller had acted ultra vires by entering into a [CA] which exceeded
his scope of authority; and / or

84 The [CA] was deemed contrary to national security and public interest.

(9]-[36] (c) These paragraphs elaborate on the allegations of fact and
propositions of law in support of the grounds set out at [8].

[36A]-[36B] (d) The Respondent is entitled to terminate the CA on 5
August_2013 under clause 11.1:1(ii) of the CA on the ground that the
Claimant had ceased operations in September 2012, and was insolvent on 5
August 2013, as it had stopped payment and/or was unable to pay its debts
by that date.

[37]-[38] (e) Without prejudice to its defence that the CA is void and/or
had been frustrated, the Claimant is not entitled to the amount of damages
sought, and that since clause 12.3 and clause 16 of the CA effectively
allow the Claimant to recover the total revenue of the MIBCS project, they
are not a genuine pre-estimate of the Claimant’s loss and are in the nature
of a penalty, and are therefore void and/or unenforceable,

59

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 64 of 263

[39]-[40] (f) If clause 12.3 and clause 16 of the CA are valid, the
Claimant is not entitled to the sum claimed as the Respondent disputes the
invoices produced. by the Claimant and, further and/or in the alternative,
the certificate purportedly issued by the “independent firm of auditors
appointed out by the Company” should be set aside for the reasons that: (a)
the auditors were not independent; (b) the relevant certificate is erroneous
and/or based on incorrect and/or unjustifiable assumptions; and (c) the sum
claimed is limited to the period before ihe Claimant entered into
Administration or such period before the Claimant became unable to pay
its debt.

[41]-[75] (g) Detailed responses to the Claimant’s averments in the S/C
Am, admitting some, denying some, and admitting and avoiding some.

[76]-[77] (h) By reason of the above, the Respondent counterclaims:

77.1. A declaration that the [CA] is void as the Controller had acted ultra
vires by entering into a [CA] which exceeded his scope of authority;

77.2. Further and / or in the alternative, the Respondent seeks a declaration
that the [CA] has been frustrated and had come to an end on 25 December
2012, or such other date as the Tribunal deems fit;

77.3. Further and / or in the alternative, the Respondent seeks a declaration
that under public law, due to matters of national security and public interest,
the [CA] has been rendered void;

774, Further and / or in the alternative, the Respondent seeks a declaration
that the Respondent had validly terminated the [CA].

witnesses:

(a) Chua as a factual witness,

(b) Suood as a factual witness,

(c) Munawvar as its Maldivian law expert, and
(d) Tam, as its financial expert.

the CA.

The Respondent adduced the statements and testimonies of the following

witnesses:

(a) Naseer as a factual witness,
(b) Siraj as its Maldivian law expert, and
(c) Leow as its financial expert.

The Respondent’s factual witness was also unable to speak to the facts relating

terms of the CA or the signing of the CA.

In the course of the hearing on 9 October 2015, the Parties admitted in evidence

the agreed joint statement dated 4 October 2015 of their respective financial

experts, Tam and Leow, on the computation of the compensation or damages

based on US$2 or US$4 per passenger, as the case may be.

In the course of the hearing, Munavvar and Siraj, the Parties’ Maldivian law
experts, also filed an agreed joint statement dated 4 October 2015 on Maldivian

law.
B. LIST OF ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION PROPOSED BY THE PARTIES
At (25] of its Opening Statement dated 4 October 2015, the Claimant referred to

a draft list of issues for determination by the Tribunal:

(a) Whether the Respond hed its obligations under the C
Agreement by preventing the Claimant’s implementation of the MIBCS (the
“Prevention Issue”);

 

(b) | Whether the Respondent breached and/or repudiated the [CA] (the
“Breach and/or Repudiation Issue”);

(c) Whether and to what extent the Claimant is entitled to claim damages
for the Respondent’s premature termination of the [CA] (the “Damages
Issue”);

(d) Whether the [CA] is “tainted with corruption” so as to render it void /
unenforceable (the “Corruption Issue”);

(e) whether the [CA] is void because the Controller of the DOIE [Ilyas]
allegedly acted ultra vires in entering into the [CA] which provides for the
imposition of the Charges, which was in excess of what was allowed under the
Maldives Immigration Act 2007 (the “Want of Authority Issue”);

(f) Whether the [CA] is void under public law due to matters of national
security and public interest (the “Public Law Issue”);

(g) Whether the [CA] was frustrated by reason of the motion passed by the
Maldivian Parliament on 25 December 2012 instructing the Maldivian
Government to terminate the [CA] (the “Frustration Issue”); and

(h) Whether the Claimant had allegedly ceased operations in September
2012 and had subsequently become insolvent/unable to pay its debts as they
fell due. If so, whether the Respondent was entitled to rely on Clause 11.1.1(ii)
of the [CA] to terminate the [CA] on 5 August 2013 (the “Insolvency Issue”).

62

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 67 of 263

130. At [26] of its Opening Statement dated 4 October 2015, the Claimant states that
it appears from the draft list of issues that the Respondent was no longer
contending that:

{a) This Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this matter [the Public Law Issue];
and

(b) The [CA] is void for illegality as imposition of the Charges amount to a
tax in contravention of Articles 97 and 247(b) of the Maldivian
Constitution [the Want of Authority Issue].

131. In its Opening Statement dated 3 October 2015, the Respondent confirmed at
[1] and [78], respectively, that it was no longer pursuing these two issues set out
at [129] above.

132. At[17] of its Opening Statement, the Respondent proposed the following as the

material issues for determination by the Tribunal, viz:

17.1 Was the [CA] void and/or validly terminated on 5 August 2013;

17.2 Could [the Respondent] have validly terminated the [CA] under clause
11.1.1(ii) of the [CA] in any case;

17.3. Would [the Respondent] be liable for the sums already invoiced by [the
Claimant] and if not, what would the appropriate amount be;

17.4 If [the Respondent] was found to be in breach, what is the appropriate
sum of damages payable to [the Claimant] (if any)?

133. At [4] of its Reply Submissions dated 4 February 2016, the Claimant submitted
that the Respondent, in its Closing Submissions dated 23 December 2015, had

jettisoned the following defences:

a. The Respondent is no longer contending that [Ilyas] entered into the CA
without authority, as it was ultra vires his powers under the MIA 2007 [the
Want of Authority Issue];

b. When addressing its defence that the CA was voidable for being “tainted
with corruption”, the Respondent also makes no reference to its pleaded
allegation that the Claimant had engaged in corrupt conduct by providing
75 laptops to the Respondent, or by meeting a High Court judge when one
of the Maldivian court cases was ongoing.

63

134.

135.

136.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 68 of 263

¢. The Respondent is no longer pursuing that the CA could be terminated on
the basis that the Claimant had stored sensitive information in Malaysia,
out of reach of the Maldives, and that this amounted to a national security
threat [the Public Law Issue].
At [5] of its Reply Submissions, the Claimant stated that the only defences
which the Respondent was pursuing (after filing its Closing Submissions) were
as follows:

a. The CA is voidable for being tainted with corruption. These corrupt
acts involve only Samee and Ilyas.

b. The CA was frustrated by a parliamentary motion passed on 25 or 27
December 2012 that the [Respondent] should terminate the CA;

G The Respondent was entitled to terminate the CA on national security
grounds as a result of the “pop-ups” which appeared on the Respondent’s
computer screens; and

d. The Respondent was entitled to terminate the CA pursuant to Clause
11.1.1(ii) of the CA.

To clear any uncertainty as to the issues that the Respondent had agreed to
withdraw from the arbitration, the Tribunal requested the Respondent, at the
conclusion of the oral hearing on 30 March 2016, to confirm in writing what the

issues or defences were.

On 27 April 2016, the Respondent, without admission to the Claimant’s
allegations, confirmed that it would no longer pursue the following issues:
2.1. Paragraphs 2 to 6 of the Respondent’s Statement of Defence and

Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) (“DCC”); [ie, that this Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to hear the dispute]

2.2. Paragraphs 8.2 and 25 of the DCC; [ie, that the CA is illegal under the
laws of the Republic of Maldives and/or pursuant to the Constitution of the

Republic of Maldives];

2.3. Paragraphs 8.3 and 26 to 28 of the DCC; [ie, that the ControJler had acted
ultra vires by entering into the CA which exceeded his scope of authority.]

140.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 69 of 263

2.4, Paragraph 7 of the Respondent’s Reply (Amendment No. 2) [ie, there was
corruption in that the Claimant had met the former High Court Chief Justice of
the Maldives in Bangkok while the case concerning the MIBCS was pending in
the Maldivian courts (resulting in his demotion), and that the Claimant had
issued seventy five (75) laptop computers to the DOJE officers during the time
the Maldivian court had ordered a temporary halt to the MIBCS project]; and

2.5. Insofar as the backup system of the MIBCS was stated to be stored in
Kuala Lumpur, the Respondent is no longer pursuing this.

XII. THE ISSUES FOR THE TRIBUNAL’S DETERMINATION

Having regard to the Respondent’s confirmation above, the Tribunal was left

with the following issues to determine:

1) the Prevention Issue,
2) the Frustration Issue, and

3) the Breach and/or Repudiation Issue.

Subsumed under issue (3) are the Corruption Issue, the Insolvency Issue, and

the Compensation/Damages Issue.

With respect to the Prevention Issue, the Claimant did not make any substantive
arguments on it in its Opening Statement, its Closing Submissions and Reply
Submissions. For this reason, the Tribunal requested the Claimant by email on 7
June 2016 to confirm whether or not it would be pursuing its claim for damages
against the Respondent for preventing it from implementing the CA, as pleaded
at [42(a)] of the S/C/ Am1.

On 13 June 2016, the Tribunal recalled its email of 7 June 2016 (as it had
already determined the issue provisionally). However, subsequent to the recall,
the Claimant responded to confirm that it would not be pursuing the Prevention

Issue.

141.

142.

143.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 70 of 263

The Tribunal will examine the Frustration Issue first. With respect to the issues
subsumed under the Breach and/or Repudiation Issue, the Tribunal will examine
the Insolvency Issue, followed by the Compensation/Damages Issue and finally

the Corruption Issue (which is the crux of the Respondent’s defence).

A. THE FRUSTRATION ISSUE
1. The Respondent’s pleaded case and submissions

At [34]-[36] of its D/C Am2, the Respondent pleads:

34 The Respondent avers that the [CA] had been frustrated by a motion
passed by the Maldivian Parliament, on or about 25 December 2012, which
instructed the Respondent to terminate the [CA].

35 This instruction was then included in the budget recommendations for
the 2013 budget passed by the Parliament.

36 Pursuant to section 34(c) of the Public Finance Act (Act No. 3/2006) of
the Republic of Maldives, read with the 1* Amendment Bill to the Public
Finance Act, it is mandatory for the Respondent to act on such
recommendation and to terminate the [CA].

At [62]-[67] of its Opening Statement dated 3 October 2015, the Respondent

contends:

62. Further and/or in the alternative, it is GOM/DOIJE’s case that the [CA]
has been frustrated by a motion passed by the Maldivian Parliament on or
around 25 December 2012, directing GOM/DOIE to terminate the [CA].

63. Under the doctrine of separation of powers in the Maldivian
Constitution, the [Maldivian Parliament] is considered as separate arm from the
Executive.

64. Generally, a motion passed by the Maldivian Parliament is treated as a
recommendation and a mere recommendation would not have the force of law.
However, this is different when it comes to recommendations of the budget
review committee passed by the Parliament in relation to the implementation of
the budget.

66

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 71 of 263

65. The 1 Amendment Act to the Public Finance Act amends Section 34(c)
of the Public Finance Act to state as follows:

“In implementing the budget, the Government shall comply with the
recommendations of the budget review committee, as passed by
Parliament.”

66. In our present case, the motion to terminate the [CA] was included in
the budget recommendations for the 2013 budget passed by the Parliament.

67. Therefore, it was necessary for GOM/DOIE to terminate the [CA], in
compliance with the Public Finance Act and any future performance of the
[CA] Agreement, after the budget recommendations for the 2013 budget,
would not have been possible.

144. At [240]-[290] of its Closing Submissions, the Respondent reiterated the
arguments as set out in its Opening Statement and elaborated on some of them.
At [274]-[288] of its Reply Submissions, the Respondent, in responding to the
Claimant’s submissions, reiterated its position as set out in its Opening

Statement and Closing Submissions.

2. The Claimant’s pleaded case and submissions

145. The Claimant pleads at [17] of its Reply (Amendment No 2):

17 Paragraph 20 of the RDC is denied. The Respondent avers that there is
a separation of powers between the Executive (Cabinet) and the Legislative
(the Maldivian Parliament) arms of the government.

146. At[60]-[61] of its Opening Statement, the Claimant contends:

60 The Respondent claims that the [CA] was frustrated by a motion passed
by the Parliament instructing the Respondent to terminate the [CA].

61 The Claimant will show that the Maldivian  Parliament’s
recommendation that the Respondent should terminate the [CA] does not have
the force of law and therefore cannot frustrate the [CA].

147. At [337]-[341] of its Closing Submissions, the Claimant submits that (a) the

budget recommendation passed by Parliament is not legislation and does not

67

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 72 of 263

have the force of law; and (b) even if the Respondent was obliged to terminate

the CA, it was not absolved from liability to compensate the Claimant.

148. At [145]-[214] of its Reply Submissions, the Claimant responds to the
Respondent’s arguments in its Closing Submissions more fully. At [145], the

Claimant restates the Respondent’s arguments as follows:
145 At [21] to [30], and [242] to [326], RCS, the Respondent asserted that:-

a The CA was frustrated either on 25 December 2012 or 27 December
2012 as a result of the motion passed by Parliament that the CA should be
terminated; ([242], RCS)

b. In this regard, the Claimant’s position that the Respondent is only
required to adhere to the recommendations that were made in connection with
or relate to the implementation of the budget is not borne out by a plain reading
of section 34(c), Public Finance Act; ([254] to [258], RCS)

c. The Parliamentary motion amounted to a “supervening illegality”
which frustrated the performance of the CA; ([283] to [288], RCS)

d. In this regard, the Respondent submitted that the Parliamentary motion
to terminate the CA was a law;

e. The CA was an administrative contract with a State, and a state can do
generally whatever it pleases on its own territory. The Respondent was
therefore permitted to terminate the CA; ([11], [21] to [30}; [278] to [280],
RCS)

f. As a result of the doctrine of separation of powers, the Government of
Maldives cannot be said to have any part to play in the decision made by the
Maldivian Parliament to terminate the CA; ([244] to [247], RCS); and

g. As the contract has been frustrated, the Frustrated Contracts Act
applies, under which damages are only compensatory; ({291] RCS).
149. The specific responses of the Claimants to these arguments, in the same order,
are set out at [146]-[152] as follows:
146. First, this Tribunal can dismiss outright the assertion that the CA was
frustrated on 25 December 2012, On 25 December 2012, the Parliament passed
68

150.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 73 of 263

a recommendation of the Finance Committee that the CA should be terminated.
As conceded by Mr Siraj in cross-examination a recommendation of the
Finance Committee which is passed by Parliament is not binding on the
government: Transcripts, Day 7, p.62. There is no legislation which says that is
the case as well.

147. The Maldivian Civil Court also decided in Civil Court Case no.
2240/Cy-C/2012 that the decision of the Finance Committee of Parliament is
only a recommendation put to Parliament, and that there was no obligation on
the Parliament to comply with these recommendations: CCS, Annex 3;
Suood’s Witness Statement, p. 118.

148. Second, as we show below, when section 34(c), Public Finance Act is
read in its context, it is plain that the GOM was only obliged to follow a
recommendation made by the budget review committee that related to the state
budget for the following year prepared by the MOFT. As we also show, the
recommendation was completely divorced from the state budget and had
nothing to do with it, In the circumstances, the GoM was not obliged to follow
it under section 34(c), Public Finance Act.

149. Third, recommendation of the budget review committee passed by
Parliament did not amount to law, and therefore cannot constitute a
“supervening illegality” which frustrated the CA.

150. Fourth, there is no merit to the Respondent’s argument that it could “do
whatever it pleases on its territory” because the CA was an administrative
contract.

151. Fifth, the Respondent “self-frustrated” the CA by the passing of the
Parliamentary motion to terminate the CA. In this regard, it will be shown that
the Respondent cannot rely on the doctrine of “separation of powers” to deny
its contractual responsibility to the Claimant.

152. Sixth, as the CA was not frustrated, the Frustrated Contracts Act does
not apply.

3. Discussion and finding of the Tribunal

It may be noted, first of all, that with respect to this argument, the Respondent
makes a distinction between the roles of the Parliament and the “GOM”, which
is the Executive, as two arms of “government” (in its largest sense) under the

separation of powers doctrine under the Constitution. The argument is that

69

151.

152.

153.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 74 of 263

Parliament is authorised to pass the annual budget under the Public Finance Act

which, when passed, binds the Executive to act in accordance with it.

The separation of powers doctrine requires each constitutional organ, viz, the
legislative, the executive and the judicial arms of the state, to act within its
constitutional spheres of power as granted to themi by the constitution. The
legislature may pass laws, but may not execute them. The executive may
execute laws but may not pass them unless lawfully delegated to it by the
legislature. The judiciary may not pass laws or execute them except to the

extent lawfully delegated to it either by the legislature or the executive.

These principles have been declared by the Supreme Court of the Maldives in
Supreme Court Order No 2012/SC-SJ/05 dated 28 November 2012. The
declaration was made in the following circumstances: on 26 November 2012,
the then opposition political alliance released a statement that it intended to
commence a campaign of public rallies in respect of the border control issue. At
that time, the opposition was also involved in an active campaign against the
presence of GMR, an Indian company operating the Ibrahim Nasir International
Airport (Haveeru Daily, November 26, 2012).

In response to these announcements, the Supreme Court on its own volition on
28 November 2012 issued an order which inter alia, declared that: (a) the three
organs of the state, namely, the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary
established by Articles 5, 6 &7 of the Constitution are within a constitutional
system where powers are separate; (b) all organs are to be free from the
influence or encroachment from the other; and (c) none of these organs may act
ultra vires the constitution or beyond the powers necessarily prescribed therein.
The law of the Constitution determines the powers of the three arms of
“government”, and each must act in accordance with any law passed by the

Parliament in accordance with the Constitution, including Parliament itself.

70

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 75 of 263

(a) The Annual Budget

154. Article 96 of the Constitution provides for the annual budget of the Government

155.

156.

as follows:
Annual budget

96. (a) Prior to the commencement of each financial year, the Minister of
Finance shall submit for approval to the People’s Majlis a budget containing
the projected revenue and expenditures for the year, and a statement of actual
revenue and expenditures for the preceding year.

(b) The People’s Majlis may approve or amend the budget submitted by the
Minister of Finance as in its discretion it deems fit.

(c) No supplementary expenditures shall be added to an approved budget
without further approval by the People’s Majlis. Expenditures included in the
budget shall be applied solely for the specified purpose. Taxation and
expenditures

97. The Executive shall not:

(a) spend any public money or property;

(b) levy any taxation;

(c) obtain or receive any money or property by loan or otherwise;
(d) _ provide any sovereign guarantees;

except pursuant to a law enacted by the People’s Majlis.

The provisions of Articles 96 and 97 are self-explanatory. Prior to the
commencement of each financial year, the Minister of Finance shall submit for
approval to Parliament a budget containing the projected revenue and
expenditures for the year, and a statement of actual revenue and expenditures
for the preceding year. Parliament may approve or amend the budget submitted
by the Minister of Finance as in its discretion it deems fit. The Executive shall
not spend any public money or property except pursuant to a law enacted by

Parliament.

There is nothing in Articles 96 or 97 that empowers the Minister of Finance to

submit for approval by Parliament a budget other than one that contains the

71

157,

158.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 76 of 263

projected revenue and expenditures for the year. How the revenue is to be spent
is subject to any law passed by Parliament. In the present case, the relevant law
is the Public Finance Act, section 34(c) of which (as amended) states as follows:

“In implementing the budget, the Government shall comply with the
recommendations of the budget review committee, as passed by Parliament.”

The Respondent has not referred the Tribunal to any provision in the Public
Finance Act that confers authority on the Finance Committee or the Budget
Review Committee to recommend that the Government may break its
contractual obligations to third parties when making its recommendations on
how and to what extent public money is to be spent by the Government. Yet,
this was precisely what the Finance Committee and the Budget Review

Committee did in the present case.

Furthermore, the Respondent has not referred to any provision in the
Constitution or any statute to support its contention that the Legislature
(Parliament) has the power under the Constitution to direct the Executive
(Government) to terminate unilaterally any valid agreement between the
Government and a third party. On the basis of the doctrine of separation of
powers (which forms part of the structure of the Maldivian Constitution),
Parliament’s power is confined to passing laws within its legislative powers
under the Constitution and also to approving the annual budget of the
Government. In the Tribunal’s view, Parliament will be acting outside its
constitutional powers in making it unlawful for the Government to perform its
contractual obligations to a third party by including it as an item of revenue or
expenditure in passing the annual budget of the Government. When passed, the

budget binds the Government to spend public money within the budget.

160.

161.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 77 of 263

(b) The Finance Committee’s recommendation
The Tribunal also finds that section 34(c) of the Public Finance Act (as
amended) refers specifically to the recommendations of the Budget Review
Committee. Accordingly, the recommendation of the Finance Committee is
irrelevant. The Government’s statutory duty under section 34(c) is to comply
with the recommendations of the Budget Review Committee when passed by

Parliament, and not those of the Finance Committee.

(c) The Budget Review Committee’s recommendations
The function of the Budget Review Committee, which is an ad hoc committee,
is to review the budgetary proposals of the various ministries and agencies of
the Government, and make recommendations to Parliament on its proposals. Its
function is not to review the reasonableness or legality of any contract entered
into by the Government, even though such contract may impact on the revenues
of the Government. How the Government is to augment or increase its revenues
to meet its budgetary requirements is a matter of policy for the Government to
decide. It is not for the Budget Review Committee to advise the Government
that it has entered into an improvident agreement with a third party and that it
should terminate the contract as part of its budgetary recommendations to

Parliament.

(d) Power of Parliament to approve the Budget
Parliament is vested with a constitutional power under Article 96 of the
Constitution to approve the budget (see [154] above). When Parliament
approves the recommendations of the Budget Review Committee, it is not
exercising any legislative power to enact a law. The passing of a budget is not
and does not constitute a legislative act. Parliament is only exercising a
constitutional power to approve the budget under Article 96(b) of the

Constitution. The Constitution has vested Parliament with a power to control

73

163.

164.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 78 of 263

public spending by the Government. The budget is now a law. Until and unless
it has been approved by Parliament, the Government will not have any money to
spend. If Parliament refuses to pass the budget, the Government will have no

money to run the country. Such an event usually creates a constitutional crisis.

Of course, Parliament, being a sovereign legislature, may exercise its legislative
power to pass a law to annul or void a contract to which the Government is a
party if it is not a breach of fundamental rights entrenched in the Constitution.
In the present case, Parliament did not pass such a law. What it passed was the
recommendations of the Budget Review Committee, a very different kind of
act. Whether, if Parliament had passed legislation to annul the CA, the
Respondent could plead frustration under Maldivian or Singapore law, is not an

issue before the Tribunal. Therefore, it need not be addressed.

The Claimant cites C. Czarnikow Ltd. v. Centrala Handlu Zagranicznego
Rolimpex [1978] 1 QB 176, (“Rolimpex”) where Lord Denning held that where
the government is a party to a contract, and it intervenes to escape its own
obligations under the contract, it could not rely on a self-induced "intervention"
any more than it could rely on a self-induced frustration, citing Maritime
National Fish Ltd. v. Ocean Trawlers Ltd [1935] A.C. 524, or a self-induced
incapacity to perform or a self-induced prevention of performance: see Roberts
v. Bury Improvement Commissioners (1870) L.R. 5 C.P. 310. Rolimpex was
affirmed by the House of Lords in [1979] 1 AC 351.

In response, the Respondent in its Skeletal Submissions dated 30 March 2016

contends at [71] that Rolimpex referred to the judgment of Devlin J in

Commissioners of Crown Lands v Page [1960] 2 Q.B. 274 (“Page”) as follows:
“Devlin J. there divided government acts into two categories: (i) those which a
government does for the public good in the interests of the country as a whole;

and (ii) those which it does so as to avoid its own liabilities under a particular
contract or contracts. So far as the first category is concerned, a government

74

165.

166.

167.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 79 of 263

cannot fetter its duty to act for the public good. It cannot bind itself-by an

implication in the contract-not to perform its public duties. This first category

is illustrated by Commissioners of Crown Lands v. Page [1960] 2 Q.B. 274.”
The Respondent also contends that Page considered the case of William Cory &
Sons Ltd v City of London Corporation [1951] 2 K.B. 476 (“William Cory”)
where the city corporation had contracted with the plaintiff to remove refuse.
However, the city corporation passed a by-law which resulted in the
performance of the contract being rendered impossible. Harman J held that there
was no frustration and that it was irrelevant that the supervening event was

brought about by the defendant corporation itself in another capacity.

It is the Tribunal’s view that neither Page nor William Cory is relevant to the
Frustration Issue. William Cory was decided on the basis that the City of
London Corporation had a statutory duty to make by-laws for the collection of
refuse. In the present case, the Maldivian Parliament had no constitutional or
statutory obligation to enact any law to nullify a contract entered into by the

Government.

The Respondent also relies on the statement (italicised) of Lord Wilberforce in

the House of Lords in Rolimpex, where his Lordship said:

“Before the courts and this House the buyer took a different line. It appealed to
a group of English cases dealing with actions taken by or on behalf of the
Crown in which a distinction has been made, broadly, between the acts which
are performed by a government for the public good or for a general executive
purpose and acts which a government does so as to avoid liability under a
contract or contracts...Lord Denning M.R. was disposed to hold that this
distinction might be applied to the present case if, but only if Rolimpex was to
be regarded as a department of government : he then proceeded to hold that it
was not. I have very great doubt whether the doctrine developed by these cases,
which is very much one of English constitutional law, can viably be
transplanted into the constitutional climate of foreign States-particularly such
states as Poland which we are entitled to know have an entirely different
constitutional structure from ours, Such a transplantation, if possible at all,
would involve English courts in difficult and delicate questions as to the
motivation of a foreign State, and as to the concept of public good, which

75

168.

169.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 80 of 263

would be unlikely to correspond with ours. I am not saying that there may not

be cases when it is so clear that a foreign government is taking action purely in

order to extricate a state enterprise from contractual liability, that it may be

possible to deny to such action the character of government intervention,

within the meaning of a particular contract, but that result cannot, in my

opinion, be achieved by means of the doctrine mentioned above: it would

require clear evidence and definite findings. It is certain that no such evidence

or findings exist in the present case.”
In the Tribunal’s view, the constitutional structures of the Republic of Maldives
and the United Kingdom are similar in so far as they give effect to the
separation of powers. However, the constitutionality of any Act of the English
Parliament may not be challenged in the English courts since the English
Parliament is sovereign. However, the Maldivian Parliament is not sovereign in
the same sense since its powers are subject to and limited by the Constitution. If
the Maldivian Parliament were to pass a law declaring the CA null and void,
different constitutional issues would arise, such as, whether it had the

constitutional power to pass such a law.

The Claimant has also submitted that according to well-established international
law rules, the conduct of any organ of a State must be regarded as an act of the
State. As stated by the Tribunal in The Claims of Rosa Gelbtrunk and the
“Salvador Commercial Company et al” (1902) 15 RIAA 455:

“(T]he State is responsible for the acts of its rulers, whether they belong to the
legislative, executive, or judicial department of the Government, so far as the
acts are done in their official capacity.”

This principle has also been codified in Article 6 of the Draft Articles on
State Responsibility which provides:

“[T]he conduct of an organ of the State shall be considered as an act of that
State under international law, whether that organ belongs to the constituent,
legislative, executive, judicial or other power, whether its functions are of an
international or an internal character, and whether it holds a superior or
subordinated position in the organization of the State.”

76

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 81 of 263

170. The Claimant has contended that, in the present case:

171.

172.

173.

a. The CA is a contract between the Claimant and the Government of the
Republic of Maldives as the Executive branch of the Republic of
Maldives. Any act of the Parliament in passing a motion to terminate the
CA is also an act of the Republic of Maldives. In the circumstances, the
Respondent is effectively seeking to “self-fiustrate” the CA, which is not
permitted by law.

o>

. Self-frustration is also not permitted under the terms of the CA. Clause
10.1 of the CA provides that an “Event of Force Majeure” means an
“event, not within the control of the party affected, which that party is
unable to prevent, avoid or remove. ..”. The Republic of Maldives cannot
claim that the parliamentary motion was not within its control.

This argument, interesting as it is, need not trouble the Tribunal. The Tribunal is

of the view that the Budget Review Committee has no power to recommend to

Parliament to terminate the CA as a budgetary recommendation, and

Parliament’s approval of the recommendation has no legislative effect on the

CA.

For the reasons given above, the Tribunal finds that the CA was not frustrated
by the Parliamentary approvals given to the recommendations of the Finance
Committee and the Budget Review Committee to terminate the CA. The
approvals did not absolve the Respondent from having to, or make it illegal for

the Respondent, to perform its contractual obligations under the CA.
B. THE INSOLVENCY ISSUE

1. The Respondent’s pleaded case on clause 11.1.1 of the CA

Clause 11.1.1 of the CA provides that if at any time the Claimant, inter alia,
stops payment or is unable to pay its debts, the Respondent has the right to
terminate the CA forthwith by giving notice to that effect, provided that the

Claimant may ask for time to rectify its default or remedy such breach, and the

77

174.

175.

176.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 82 of 263

Respondent has to give a reasonable extension of time to the Claimant if
satisfied that the Claimant has taken reasonable steps and/or has implemented

such efforts in good faith to remedy the default in question.

At [36A] of its D/C Aml, the Respondent contends that it was entitled to
terminate, and could have terminated, the CA on 5 August 2013 under clause
11.1.1@i) as the Claimant had ceased operations, stopped payment or was
unable to pay its debts. At [36B], the Respondent contends it discovered these
facts only after 5 August 2013, after discovery of documents. Hence, the
Respondent was not able to invoke clause 11.1.1 to give notice of termination of
the CA on or before 5 Augusts 2013.

The Respondent contends that it is entitled to invoke clause 11.1.1 of the CA by
way of defence on the basis of the legal principle as set out in The Law of

Contract in Singapore (Academy Publishing 2012) at [17.199] that:

“Following Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd v Comfort Resources Ltd ([2009] 4
SLR(R) 602) (“Alliance Concrete”) the rule in Singapore appears to be settled in that
it is generally open to a party to discharge a contract in reliance on any ground which
might have been available at the time it elected to discharge that contract, even one
which, at the time, was unknown to the party seeking to discharge that contract. This
is, however, subject to (at least, perhaps) two qualifications. First, it must not be
unfair or unjust for the party to make such an election between alternate grounds and
second, if it were possible for the party in breach to have been notified of the breach
so as to prevent the breach from occurring, no election would be possible if the party
seeking to discharge the contract had failed to inform the party in breach of such
possibility.”

The Respondent also contends at [359]-[362] of D/C Am] that neither
exception to the general rule applies to it, i.e., it is not unfair or unjust for the
Respondent to plead insolvency and the Claimant would not have been in a

position to rectify the breach if notice of termination had been given.

2. The Claimant’s pleaded case on clause 11.1.1 of the CA

177. In response, the Claimant pleads as follows at [20A] of its Reply and Defence to
Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) (“CR to D/C Am2”) dated 6 October 2015:

20A. Paragraphs 36A and 36B are not admitted and the Respondent is put to strict
proof thereof. The Claimant avers that:

(i) the Claimant had not ceased operations in September 2012 and had not
“subsequently become insolvent”;

Gi) on 5 August 2013, the Claimant had not “stopped payments”;
Giii) on $ August 2013, the Claimant was not unable to pay its debts;

(iv) as of 11 July 2012, the Claimant was delisted (i.e. its shares ceased to be
traded on the Australian Stock Exchange). It continued to operate after 1! July 2012
as a private limited company (as opposed to a publically listed company);

(vy) between September 2012 and until the [CA] was terminated by the
Respondent on 5 August 2013, the Claimant was operating the MIBCS;

(vi) between 11 October 2012 to 3 September 2013, the Claimant issued 12
invoices to the Respondent covering the period between 1 September 2012 to 19
August 2013;

(vii) at the 6" MIBCS Project Steering Committee on 19 December 2012 attended
by representatives from the Respondent and the Claimant, it was noted that the
MIBCS was fully implemented and operational since July 2012, the Claimant had
submitted invoices for the months of September 2012 to December 2012 for the
Respondent’s further action and the Respondent acknowledged receipts of these
invoices; and

(viii) at the 7 MIBCS Project Steering Committee on 19 February 2013 attended
by representatives from the Respondent and the Claimant, it was noted that the
MIBCS was fully implemented and operational since July 2012, the Claimant had
submitted invoices for the months of December 2012 to January 2013 for the
Respondent's further action and the Respondent acknowledged receipts of these
Invoices

178.

179.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 84 of 263

The Claimant does not dispute the principle as set out at [175] above, and its
applicability in this case (if in fact the Claimant were insolvent at the date of

termination of the CA), but contends:
a. that the Claimant was not insolvent at all material times;

b. that in any event, the principle does not apply to the facts of the case
because if the Claimant were unable to pay its debts, it was caused or
contributed to by the Respondent’s actions in delaying the completion of
the MIBCS Project, and hence, the Respondent was relying on its own
wrong as a reason for alleging that the Claimant was insolvent; and

2

. that, if the Respondent had given notice of termination on the ground that
the Claimant was unable to pay its debts, the Claimant would have been
able to rectify the breach.

3. The test of insolvency

At [350] of its Closing Submissions, the Respondent cites the following
passages in the judgment of the High Court of Singapore in Kon Yin Tong and
another v Leow Boon Cher and others [2011] SGHC 228 (“Kon Yin Tong”) as
a useful summary of the principles applicable to determine whether a company

is insolvent:

“(33] Despite the fact that no one single test is conclusive as a measure of solvency,
it is commonly accepted that the two primary indicia of a company’s inability to pay
debts are the cash flow test and the balance sheet test. For most purposes, it is the
present inability to pay debts that is the crucial factor.

[34] It is important to bear in mind, however, that the determination of whether a
company is insolvent is essentially a question of fact...

[35] | Generally, the burden of proof is borne by the party making the allegation of
insolvency...

[36] The cash flow test deems a company insolvent when it cannot meet its
obligations as and when they fall due. The balance-sheet test, on the other hand,
would deem a company insolvent when the current liabilities of the company exceed
its assets.

80

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 85 of 263

[37] With respect to the cash flow test, the court will look at the company’s
financial position taken as a whole. The relevant factors which can be taken into
consideration include:

(a) all of the company’s debts as at that time in order to determine when those
debts were due and payable;

(b) all of the assets of the company as at that time in order to determine the
extent to which those assets were liquid or were realisable within a timeframe
that would allow each of the debts to be paid as and when it became payable;

(c) the company’s business as at that time in order to determine its expected
net cash flow from the business by deducting from projected future sales the
cash expenses which would be necessary to generate those sales; and

(d) arrangements between the company and prospective lenders, such as its
bankers and shareholders, in order to determine whether any shortfall in liquid
and realisable assets and cash flow could be made up by borrowings which
would be repayable at a time later than the debts.

[38] It should also be noted that the court adopts a commercial rather than a
technical view of insolvency. Thus, while the phrase “is unable” might be thought to
refer to the inability at the relevant time to pay debts which have then fallen due, its
conjunction with the phrase “as they fall due” indicates a continuous succession of
debts rather than a calculation of debts existing on any particular day. The essential
question is whether the company’s financial position is such that it can continue in
business and still pay its way. The court therefore has to consider whether any
liquidity problem the company may have is purely temporary and can be cured in the
reasonably near future. Further, the court may also have regard to claims falling due
in the near future and to the likely availability of funds to meet such future claims and
the company’s existing debts.

[39] | On the other hand, the balance sheet test deems a company insolvent if its
assets are insufficient to meet its liabilities, including contingent and prospective
liabilities. It is thus a wider test than the “cash flow” test which only takes into
account debts.

[40] A “contingent liability” would refer to a liability or other loss which arises out
of an existing legal obligation or state of affairs, but which is dependent on the
happening of an event thal may or may not occur. “Prospective liability” however,
has been judicially defined as “a debt which will certainly become due in the
future, either on some date which has already been determined or on some date
determinable by reference to future events”. It thus embraces both future debts, in
the sense of liquidated sums due, and non-liquidated claims.”

[Emphasis added]
81

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 86 of 263

180. The Claimant does not dispute the principles stated in Kon Yin Tong. However,
at [242] of its Reply Submissions, the Claimant refers to the English case of
BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd where the court discussed the balance

sheet test under section 123(2) of the English Insolvency Act as follows:

[40] In practical terms, it would extraordinary if section 123(2) was satisfied every
time a company’s liabilities exceeded the value of its assets. Many companies which
are solvent and successful, and many companies early on in their lives, would be
deemed unable to pay their debts if this was the meaning of section 123(2)”: BNY
Corporate Trustee Services Ltd, at [40].

[41] A company should not be at risk of being wound up simply because the
aggregate value (however calculated) of its liabilities exceeds that of its assets. Many
companies in that position are successful and creditworthy, and cannot in any way be
characterised as “unable to pay their debts”. Section 123(2) does not give such a
mechanistic and artificial reason for permitting a creditor to present a petition to wind
up a company.

[42] Section 123(2) requires the court to make a judgment whether it has been
established that, looking at the company’s assets and making proper allowance for its
prospective and contingent liabilities, it cannot reasonably be expected to meet those
liabilities. If so, it will be deemed insolvent although it is currently able to pay its
debts as they fall due. The more distant the liabilities, the harder this will be for the
creditor to establish that the company is unable to meet them.

{43] Where the company’s liabilities can be deferred for over many years and
where the company is (without any permanent increase in borrowings) paying its
debts as they fall due, the court should proceed with the greatest caution in deciding
that the company is in a state of balance-sheet insolvency under section 123(2).

4. The Respondent’s evidence/arguments on the Claimant’s insolvency

181. The Respondent relies on the following matters as evidence of the Claimant’s

insolvency:

a. The Claimant’s sole director (and factual witness) tampered with the
Claimant’s 2013 Management Accounts. One version was marked ‘8
July 2015’, and another version was marked ‘3 August 2015’. There
were differences between them as to the debts due from related
companies. The witness also reversed some debts which have been

82

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 87 of 263

written-off in the accounts. The witness tampered with the July accounts
because they could not be reconciled with the August accounts which
had been sent to and used by KordaMentha (see [367]-[378] of the
Respondent’s Closing Submissions).

b. Due to the lack of information on the Claimant’s cash flow and debts,
the Respondent's Financial Expert could only perform the balance sheet
test to determine the Claimant’s solvency: see [382]-[398] of the
Respondent’s Closing Submissions, reproduced in the endnote.’ In
summary, the evidence is as follows:

i.

iii.

The Claimant had neither intangible asset, property, plant &
equipment, trade receivable nor trade payable. Instead, the main
assets of the Claimant comprised a sum of A$2.9m due from
ASN and a sum of A$59m due from NSA only.

The Claimant was dormant. There was no revenue generated (at
[9.64(a)], and the Claimant was not trading as there were no trade
receivables or payables (at [9.64(c)].

The Claimant had no assets. There was no investments or
intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet (at [9.64(b) &

(dp.

The Claimant was making a loss. Operating expenses of A$0.9m
were incurred despite the Claimant being dormant, with directors’
fees of A$0.5m and business entertainment of A$0.1m being the
major operating expenses (at [9.64(e)].

The Respondent’s Financial Expert was of the view that the
Claimant was insolvent by A$1.58m as at 30 June 2013 if certain
debts owing to or by the Claimant had been set-off (as they
should have been), and that “[bJased on the above adjusted [the
Claimant’s] balance sheet, there is a sum of A$1m “due to ASN”
after the “set-off” of A$2.9m which [the Claimant] would not be
able to settle. In 2014, the sum due to ASN increased to A$1.7m
before the Claimant went into voluntary administration” (see
[385]-[387] of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions).

83

182.

183,

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 88 of 263

Although the Respondent’s Financial Expert was not able to perform the cash

flow test, there is substantial evidence that the Claimant was not able to pay its
debts, such as the debt to Peter Dykes amounting to A$475,000 before the Deed

of Company was entered into. Furthermore, for the purposes of clause 11.1.1(ii)

of the CA, it is clear that the Claimant had “stopped payments” to Peter Dykes.

The Respondent also made the following assertions at [420]-[430] of the

Respondent’s Closing Submissions:

s

°

a.

@

ya

. The Claimant caused its own insolvency;

The ACC’s actions caused or contributed to the Claimant’s insolvency;
and

. In its letter dated 19 December 2012, the Claimant stated “it agreed not to

forward its monthly invoices during the implementation period” (See
[4CHB 2726]), and therefore, it cannot blame any delay of payment.

. Furthermore, the invoices were never rendered by the Claimant to the

Respondent and therefore, it was not the Respondent’s non-payment of
invoices that rendered the Claimant insolvent. Even though the Malaysian
Company was called ASN / S5 Systems, the invoices were craftily
rendered with the Nexbis logo to deceive the Respondent.

. The Claimant had ceased operations as stated by KordaMentha,

notwithstanding it was later induced to correct the statement. Tam, the
Claimant’s financial expert, admitted that he was advised by the Claimant
that ASN incurred all the costs to procure the hardware and software and
also provided the necessary manpower and resources in relation to the CA
on behalf of the Claimant.

The Claimant did not record any revenue or trade receivables and did not
have any investments or intangible assets.

. The Claimant did not send any invoices to the Respondent. They were

sent by Nexbis Sdn Bhd.

84

184.

185.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 89 of 263

h. From the above, it is clear that what had actually transpired was that the
Claimant had essentially ‘assigned’ the contract to ASN/S5 Systems and
had ceased operations.

i. The Claimant had to invest a sum of US$35m (undiscounted) over 20
years - a substantial amount of money. Tam had recognised (see RBD
2730) that in the first year, if the Claimant was performing the CA, it
would be projected to make a loss of US$10.1m.

j. The fact that the project was projected to have positive cash flow does not
mean that the Claimant could never become insolvent.

k. The Claimant’s management had intended for the money payable under
the CA to be diverted away to ASN/ 5 Malaysia. There was no evidence
that any money paid to the Malaysian entity would be transferred to the
Claimant. The Claimant certainly did not produce any agreements
evidencing such arrangements.

The Respondent also asserted at [432]-[438] of the Respondent’s Closing
Submissions that the Claimant would not have been able to remedy its default,
if the Respondent had served notice of termination prior to the termination of
the CA on 5 August 2013 as it was or remained insolvent even until 27 June
2014, when its sole director decided to enter into voluntary administration. The
Claimant’s debts to its directors and ASN Solutions/S5 Systems caused it to go

into administration.

5. The Claimant’s evidence and arguments on its solvency
In its rebuttal of the Respondent’s allegations that the Claimant was insolvent
prior to the termination of the CA, the Claimant contends at [224] and [229]-
[232] of its Reply Submissions dated 4 February 2016, as follows:

[224] a. Had the implementation of the CA not been delayed, the Claimant would
have started earning revenues much earlier;

b. Had the Respondent paid the Claimant for operating the MIBCS
system (which it did for a year without getting paid), the Claimant’s cash flow
position would have been much better; and

85

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 90 of 263

c. Once the MIBCS project was implemented, it would have been a
profitable project that would have been self-sustaining by the second year of
operations, provided the Respondent paid its dues.

[229] Under cross-examination, Mr Leow admitted that had the Respondent done
what they were supposed to do under the CA, the Claimant’s cash flow position
would have been better, because:-

a. Had the kick-off meeting occurred immediately after the CA was
signed, the revenues that would have been generated from the MIBCS project
would have started flowing to the Claimant 1.5 years earlier: Transcripts, Day
5, p. 53-54.

b. In other words, the Claimant would have notionally begun receiving
income 6 months after the CA was signed;

c. The Claimant also would not have suffered any holding costs for the
1.5 years when the project was still up in the air: Transcripts, Day 5, p. 78-80.

[230] [Mr Leow’s] opinion that the Claimant was insolvent as at 5 August 2013 is
fundamentally flawed and inherently lop-sided because [he] had failed to properly
account for what would have been the Claimant’s position as at 5 August 2013 if the
Respondent had performed its obligations under the CA fairly and timeously. In other
words, Mr Leow had failed to account for the Respondent’s prolonged delay and
obstruction in not allowing the Claimant to implement the Project immediately “as
time is of the essence”.

[231] Secondly, Mr Leow purported to include the costs of the MIBCS project into
the Claimant’s balance sheet, but not the healthy cash flow which the Claimant would
have earned in the form of the charges that the Respondent was obliged to pay under
the payment mechanism of the CA.

[232] The Respondent’s assertion that the Claimant was insolvent as at 5 August
2013 turns on this unprincipled and unbalanced accounting treatment by Mr Leow
(which he readily conceded under cross-examination, as elaborated below).

The Claimant argues that as at 5 August 2013, the Claimant was not insolvent
on an “as is” basis, and a fortiori, if the Respondent had performed its
fundamental obligations under the CA. The arguments are set out at [235]-

(261]." In summary, they are as follows:

86

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 91 of 263

(a) Whether or not a company is solvent is a question of fact. A
company in debt does not prove it is unable to pay its debts. A temporary
inability to pay its debts is not evidence of a company’s insolvency.

(b) Under the balance sheet test, the Claimant was solvent between 30
June 2013 and 5 August 2013, as its management accounts as at 30 June
2013 shows it had a net current asset position of A$2.4m (5 CHB 3236).

(c) | Under the cash flow test, the Claimant was solvent as it was able
to meet its obligations as and when they fell due.

187. With respect to the balance sheet test, it is argued that the Respondent’s
argument has no merit because (as set out at [185above, and also at [248] in the

endnote):

248 In order to advance their position that the Claimant was in a net liability
position, the Respondent had to rely on several unsustainable premises:

a. The Respondent takes the unreasonable position that the costs of the MIBCS
project as at 30 June 2013 should be included [in] the Claimant’s balance sheet,
but that the revenues generated by MIBCS project up till 30 June 2013 should be
excluded from the balance sheet;

5. Based on this unreasonable position, the Respondent asserts that the sum of
A$2,970,090.75 due to the Claimant from ASN Solutions Sdn Bhd (“ASN”)
should be set-off against the A$3.9M that ASN had incurred for the MIBCS
project by 30 June 2013 and which had later been invoiced to the Claimant.
However the Claimant does not similarly add to the Claimant's balance sheet the
revenues for the MIBCS project; and

c. The Respondent also asserts that the sum of A$59,004,501.78 due to the Claimant
from NSA Solutions Sdn Bhd should have been written-off as at 30 June 2013.

6. The Claimant’s financial condition prior to 5 August 2013

188. Clause 11.1.1 of the CA provides that:

If at any time the [Claimant] ...stops payment or is unable to pay its debts; then the
[Respondent] shall, have the right to terminate this [CA] forthwith by giving notice to
that effect.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 92 of 263

PROVIDED THAT notwithstanding the [Respondent’]s right to issue the termination
notice as aforesaid, the [Claimant] may request in writing for a further extension of
time to rectify its default or remedy such breach, AND the [Respondent] shall grant a
reasonable extension of time to the [Claimant] upon being satisfied that the
{Claimant] has taken reasonable steps and/or has implemented such efforts in good
faith to remedy the default in question.

7. Did the Claimant stop payment to its creditors prior to 5 August
2013?
The Tribunal is of the view that the words “stops payment” in the context of
clause 11.1.1 mean “stops payment to its creditors”. They refer to a corporate
decision not to pay creditors because the company is unable to do so for lack of
cash or credit facilities from banks, or inter-company loans. Those words are
intended to refer to a situation where the company is in a state of insolvency and

unable to carry on its business.

Applying this test, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not adduced any
or sufficient evidence that the Claimant had stopped payment to its creditors
prior to 5 August 2013. The fact that the Claimant had ceased operations in
September 2012 (as noted by KordaMentha) does not mean that it had stopped
payment to its creditors. The fact of the matter is that the Claimant had already
secured the MIBCS Project by 17 October 2010 although its implementation
was delayed or interrupted by the actions of the ACC and also of some officers
of the DOIE (see Chronology of Events at [118] above). Whether the Claimant
has stopped payment to its creditors is purely a question of fact, and it is not
possible for the Tribunal, looking backwards from today, to conclude on the
evidence that the Claimant had stopped payment simply on an analysis of the

Claimant’s accounts and inferences to be drawn from the state of the accounts.

It may be recalled that on 20 September 2012, the Claimant issued the
Certificate of Acceptance in respect of the Border Control Module which was

signed off by the DOIE, i.e., from that day onwards, the Claimant was entitled

88

192.

193.

194,

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 93 of 263

to payment under the CA of either US$2 or US$4 per passenger from the
Respondent arriving/leaving the Republic of Maldives, depending on what the
Parties had agreed to.

It should also be noted that the Claimant is not a stand-alone company. It is part
of or affiliated with a group of companies (although its cross-shareholding
structure appears to be complex). However, unless there is credible evidence
that the group of companies was insolvent, the probability of the Claimant being
allowed to breach the CA, and thereby lose its rights thereunder, is
commercially very low. The CA was a very profitable long-term contract for the

Claimant.

Furthermore, it should also be noted that the Respondent has referred to the
Claimant’s letter dated 19 December 2012 to the Respondent (see [183(c)]
above) agreeing not to send monthly invoices during the implementation period,
beginning in September 2012. The first three invoices: Invoices No 11049 dated
11 October 2012 for US$70,347.50, No 11050 dated 14 November 2012 for
US$229,761.30, and No 11051 dated 13 December 2012 for US$257,104.20

were sent on 19 December 2012.

8. Was the Claimant unable to pay its debts as at 5 August 2013?

Under the cash flow test, a company is deemed to be insolvent when it cannot
meet its obligations as and when the debts fall due: Kon Yin Tong at [36].
Having considered the evidence and the arguments of the Parties, the Tribunal
finds that the Respondent has not adduced any or sufficient evidence to show
that as a matter of fact the Claimant was unable to pay its debts prior to 5
August 2013. It is not possible to infer from reading the management accounts
of the Claimant that it was unable to pay its debts as and when they fell due. As
mentioned earlier, it was highly improbable that the Claimant would be allowed

to breach the CA and lose its valuable rights thereunder.

195.

196.

197.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 94 of 263

It is not disputed that from September 2012, the MIBCS Project was financially
self-sustaining, and a very profitable contract for the Claimant, so profitable in
the Respondent’s view, that it suspected that the Claimant might have obtained
the CA corruptly, especially when the CA appeared to state that the Claimant be
paid US$4 per foreigner arriving and departing the Maldives when its price bid

was only U$2 per passenger.

9. Would the Claimant have been able to remedy any breach if it had
been notified of the breach by the Respondent under clause 11.1.1(ii)
of the CA?

The Tribunal’s answer to this question is “Yes” for the reasons given by the
Claimant at [229] to [232] of its Reply Submissions (see [192] and [194]
above). Further, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s argument that, given the
profitability of the MIBCS Project, the Claimant would have been able to obtain
bank financing easily on the security of the receivables under the CA. In any
event, it is not disputed that the Claimant completed the installation and
implementation of the project with whatever financial resources it had or had
obtained. It is the Tribunal’s view that the commercial purpose of clause 11.1.1
of the CA was to ensure that the MIBCS would be completed in a timely
manner, and insolvency on the part of the Claimant would affect the date of
completion. This was not the case here. In fact, the completion of the MIBCS

project was delayed for reasons for which the Claimant was not responsible.

10. Finding on whether the Claimant breached clause 11.1.1 of the CA

For the reasons given above, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to
prove that the Claimant was in breach of its obligations under the CA before
and after 5 August 2013 which would have entitled it to terminate the CA under

clause 11.1.1(ii) thereof.

90

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 95 of 263

198. The Tribunal further finds that if the Respondent had been entitled to give
notice of termination, and had given such notice under clause 11.1.1(iv) of the
CA, the Claimant would have been able to remedy the breach within the time
specified therein,

C. THE DAMAGES ISSUE

1. The pleaded cases of the Claimant and of the Respondent

199. The Claimant terminated the CA on the basis of the Respondent’s alleged
repudiatory breaches. Initially, at [42]'* of its S/C Am1, the Claimant claimed
liquidated damages under clause 12.3 and clause 16 of the CA:

a Damages for delays in implementation of the [CA] to be assessed;

b. The sum of US$3,771 308.10 being the total outstanding invoiced amounts;

c. Damages in the form of actual costs and expenses and loss of investment
incurred by the Claimant to be assessed;

d. Damages in the form of loss of revenue and/or loss of profit for termination of the [CA]
to be assessed and/or for the sum of US$258,234,764.00.

Claims (a) and (c) were withdrawn in the course of these proceedings.

200. At [37]-[40} of its D/C Am1, the Respondent pleaded that, even if it were in
breach of the CA:

(a) the Claimant was not entitled to the amount of the damages claimed;

(b) in any event, clause 12.3 and clause 16 of the CA were not a genuine
pre-estimate of the Claimant’s loss and were in the nature of a penalty.
The claims were therefore void and/or unenforceable;

(c) even if clause 12.3 and clause 16 of the CA were valid, the amounts of
the invoices were disputed, and that the certificate issued by the
“independent firm of auditors appointed out by the Company” should
be set aside as the certifier concerned was not independent; and

201.

202.

203.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 96 of 263

(d) even if the Claimant were entitled to damages (which was not
admitted), such sum should be limited to the period before the
Claimant entered into administration or such period before the
Claimant became unable to pay its debts.

In its Opening Statement dated 4 October 2015", the Claimant clarified at [33]
that it was claiming contractual damages under clause 12.3 (Alternative A) or
common law damages (Alternative B) in the event that the Alternative A claim

is a penalty. Under Alternative A, the Claimant claims as follows:
(a) “Value of the Completed Works”,

(b) Loss of gross revenue of US$4 for each foreign traveler projected for
the remainder of the Concession Period and discounted for present
value of between US$64,938,053 and US$74,074,855 (in substitution
for the initial claim for US$258,234,764); and

(c) Loss of gross revenue of US$15 per work visa projected to be been
issued / renewed / extended for the remainder of the Concession Period
and discounted for present value.

Under Alternative B, the Claimant claims loss of net profit it would have earned
through the gross revenues generated through the Foreign Traveler Charges and
Foreign Worker Charges, the present value of which for the remainder of the
20-year Concession Period would be between US$29,571,944 and
US$34,381,332 [see paragraphs 6.1 — 6.18 of Tam’s valuation report].

On 9 October 2015, five (5) days into the hearing, the Parties admitted in

 

evidence the Joint Statement of their financial experts, viz, Tam and Leow, that
they had agreed on “the following areas of their respective reports as follows”
in relation to the Claimant’s claim for damages against the Respondent under

Alternative B:

(Per passenger) @ US$2 @US$4
(a) Value of Completed Works US$2,063,458 US$2,063,458
(b) Amount payable from 20 US$1,885,654 US$3,771,308

(c) Loss of revenue (Present Value) US$37,740,652 US$58,790,178

(d) Loss of profits (Present Value) US$15,200,000 US$37,000,000

2. The Claimant’s Closing Submissions

In its Closing Submissions dated 23 December 2015, the Claimant reiterates its
damages claim at [145]-[149].”

At [150]-[200] of its Closing Submissions”, the Claimant contends that it is
entitled to claim for loss of revenue based on US$4 per passenger arriving and

departing the Maldives for the following reasons:
(a) The contextual meaning of clause 5.2.1 is clear.

(b) The CA is an entire agreement and no evidence of previous
negotiations may be admitted to contradict the meaning of clause 5.2.1.

(c) Even though the Claimant’s price bid for the MBICS Project was
based, inter alia, on US$2 per passenger on arrival (including
Maldivians), and accepted by the TEB on that basis, the fee was increased
to US$2 per passenger on arrival and US$2 on departure during the
negotiations on the terms of the CA. Clause 5.2.1 of the final draft of the
CA reflected this change.

(d) The ACC, AGO, MOFT, DOIE, the Budget Review Committee,
the Finance Committee and the Parliament all understood clause 5.2.1 to
have the same meaning and effect.

(e) The Claimant sent a series of invoices to the Respondent for
payment based on US$4 per passenger which the Claimant had
acknowledged without objection.

93

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 98 of 263

(f) While the Claimant’s consistent position was that it was entitled to
impose a fee of US$4 per foreign passenger, the Respondent only
objected to the fee on 7 September 2015, almost four years after CA was
signed, and just before the hearing of this arbitration..

3. The Respondent’s Closing Submissions

206. At [439]-[461] of its Closing Submissions dated 23 December 2015, the

Respondent contends:

(a) that the Claimant is not entitled to claim US$3,771,308.10 ( the
total value of the unpaid invoices) as they were not sent by the Claimant,
and furthermore, the Respondent had not accepted them (at [439] and
{441};

(b) that the Claimant cannot base its claim on clause 12.3 and clause
16.1 of the CA, as it had abandoned its independent auditor’s certificate
(at [448]);

(c) that the Claimant’s claim for damages of US$258,234,764.00,
being a loss of revenue is not made pursuant to clause 12.3 of the CA (at
[449]});

(d) that clause 12.3 would entitle the Claimant to double
compensation, and is therefore in the nature of a penalty which is
unenforceable (at [453]-[461]).”"

4, The Claimant’s Reply Submissions on the passenger fee

207. Inits Reply Submissions dated 4 February 2016, the Claimant submits at [328]-
[335]:

(a) First, the Parties originally contemplated that the Claimant would
charge every passenger (regardless of nationality), a US$2 fee, but after
negotiations the Claimant would charge only non-Maldivian passengers
US$2 upon arrival and US$2 upon departure (as seen from a previous
draft of the CA reviewed by Abdullah Muiz, Solicitor General) (at [328]).

94

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 99 of 263

(b) Second, the CA contains an entire agreement clause. The
Respondent cannot rely on the Claimant’s original proposal if it is
different from that set out in the CA (at [329]).

(c) Third, the common understanding of the AGO, MOFT, DOIE and
ACC was that the Claimant was entitled to charge every non-Maldivian
passenger US$2 upon arrival and US$2 upon departure. The Parties’
subsequent conduct also evidenced this common understanding (at
(330).

(d) The Respondent’s argument that post-contractual conduct may not
be used to explain the meaning of a clause in the contract is incorrect.
The Singapore Evidence Act does not apply in this arbitration. It is open
to the Tribunal to adopt a robust approach to contractual interpretation,
and consider the post-contractual conduct of the parties, as has been done
in New Zealand, several civil Jaw jurisdictions and in transnational
conventions (at [331]).

(e) Fourth, the Respondent cannot rely on the statements of Ahmed
Waheed and Ibrahim Waheed on the following grounds: (i) they did not
testify at the hearing; (ii) there is no reason to prefer their statements to
those of the Solicitor General and of Ageel; (iii) Anmed Waheed was not
present at the negotiations or the discussions of the CA; and (iv) Ibrahim
Waheed’s recollection that he did not recall the US$2 that was to be
charged upon departure as well, does not prove anything (at [332]-[333]).

(f) Fifth, Naseer confirmed in his testimony that the Respondent’s
case that the Claimant was entitled to charge only US$2 originated from a
suggestion by its expert witness, Leow (at [334]).

(g) | Sixth, the Respondent also has not explained why it only took the

position that the Claimant was only entitled to charge every foreign US$2
at the threshold of the hearing, on 7 September 2015 (at [335]).

95

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 100 of 263

 

5. The Respondent’s Reply Submissions on the p ger fee

208. In its Reply Submissions dated 4 February 2016, the Respondent submits at
[105] to [188];

(a) The Respondent’s argument that the Claimant was entitled to
charge only US$2 for every foreigner entering and leaving the Maldives
did not originate from Leow. He was asked to calculate the Claimant’s
loss on the basis that “[t]he total fee per foreign passenger who arrives
and departs Maldives is US $2...” (at [105]-[111]).

(b) The Respondent had raised the issue at [39.1]-[39.2] of its D/C (at
[112}-[113)).

(c) The principles applicable to contractual interpretation are set out at
YES. F&B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd
(formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd [2015] 5
SLR 1195 (“¥.E.S. F&B”). Applying those principles to the evidence
looked at objectively in this case, the Claimant is only entitled to charge
US$2, and this interpretation is consistent with business common sense
(at [114}-[188)).

(d) The key phrase in clause 5.2.1 is “arriving into and departing
from”. These words should be read conjunctively, i.e. every foreign
passenger arriving into and departing from Maldives would pay a total of
US $2. The addition of the phrase “departing from” would prevent the
Claimant from claiming in the future that it was entitled to claim an
additional $2 upon departure. This construction is consistent with the
wording of clause 12.3 of the CA (the liquidated damages/penalty clause)
which provides that the Respondent would pay the Claimant, upon
termination, a compensation sum equivalent to the total Charges
multiplied by the projected number of passengers entering into and
departing from Maldives (at [115]-[119]).

(e) The requirements of the bid and the bidding process support the

Respondent’s interpretation. All bidders submitted bids based on a “per
passenger” basis. The Respondent’s intention was for incoming tourists to

96

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 101 of 263

be charged as low a price as possible as “there were concerns that the
increase in taxes would cause tourist arrivals to decline” (at [121]-[128]).

(f On a comparison of the Claimant’s unsigned financial bid which
states “USD 2 per passenger (per arrival and per departure)” [3CHB
1233], its original bid submitted on 20 May 2010 [2.2 CHB 975] and
clause 5.2.1 of the CA [1 CHB 22], if the Claimant had intended to
charge per arrival and per departure in clause 5.2.1, it would have used
the same phrase found in its “draft” financial bid — “per passenger per
arrival and per departure”. That phrase is very clear, instead of “every
passenger arriving into and departing from” show that it was not the
Parties’ intention (at [129]-[133]).

(g) There was no evidence of any extensive negotiations that led to the
Claimant being allowed to charge US$4 per passenger (at [134]-[147]).

(h) A comparison between the unsigned draft and the CA is unhelpful
because:
(i) __ the status of the unsigned draft is uncertain and is unreliable;

(ii) no evidence has been led on the draft;
(iii) the Claimant’s interpretation is subjective;

(iv) an objective interpretation should give effect to clause 12.3
which allows the Claimant to claim damages multiplied by
passengers entering or departing from the Maldives; and

(v) | the words “entering into and departing from” should be read
conjunctively.

6. Discussion on Damages Issue
(a) Alternative A claim — liquidated damages under cl 12.3 of the CA

The Claimant’s Alternative A claim was initially for liquidated damages (or
compensation) comprising: (a) Value of Completed Works for US$2,063,458;
and (b) US$258,234,764 (at US$4 per passenger), as certified by the Parties’

97

210.

211.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 102 of 263

financial experts, for loss of revenue for the remainder of the Concession Period
of 20 years. The Alternative A claim is made under clause 12.3, read with
clause 14, of the CA (see [120] for the text).

The Respondent’s submission is that the claim for US$258,234,764 is not a
genuine pre-estimate of any loss that the Claimant could have suffered by
reason of the termination of the CA by the Claimant under clause 12.2, and is

therefore a penalty and accordingly not enforceable.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s submission that (a) and (b) of the
Alternative A claim are not a genuine pre-estimate of the Claimant’s loss and is

a penalty for the following reasons:

(a) The claim for loss of revenue of US$258,234,764 (based on US$4
per passenger) for the remainder of the Concession Period is completely
out of proportion to any legitimate interest of the Claimant in the CA.

(b) Ifthe Respondent had performed its obligations under the CA for
20 years, the Claimant would have incurred the cost of maintaining (i.e.,
servicing, repairing and renewing), the border control system for that
period. The claim is based on gross revenue, even though the Claimant
would have to maintain the MIBCS throughout the Concession Period, if
the CA had not been terminated.

(c) Clause 12.3 requires the Respondent to pay damages upfront from
the date of breach which means that the Claimant would be paid
US$258,234,764 immediately, and interest would accrue on this sum for
the next 15 years.

(d) Damages payable to the Claimant under the CA are calculated on
the basis of the passenger fees. Without the completed works, no
passenger fees would be collectible. Hence, the value of the completed
works is subsumed in the damages. To claim such value separately would
amount to a double claim.

98

212.

213.

214.

215.

216.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 103 of 263

Even though the Claimant lawfully terminated the CA pursuant to the
Respondent’s wrongful repudiation of the CA on 5 August 2013, the Claimant
is not entitled to claim the value of the completed works because clause 12.3 is
a penalty clause (see [213] below). Furthermore, under its Alternative B claim,
the value of the completed works is subsumed in the claim for general damages,

otherwise it would result in a double claim (see [219] below).

In the course of the proceedings, the Claimant has reduced its Alternative A
claim with respect to (b) at discounted or present value, of either
US$37,740,652 (at US$2 per passenger) or US$58,790,178 (at US$4 per
passenger). Discounting the gross revenue does not erase its character as a
penalty. It merely renders it a discounted penalty. Once a penalty, always a

penalty.

Furthermore, the discounted claim is also contrary to the terms of clause 12.3,
read with clause 16.3 of the CA in that clause 12.3 does not provide for
compensation payable at a discounted value. The Claimant is not entitled to
make a smaller claim under clause 12.3 in order to validate it as a genuine pre-

estimate of its loss.

The same reasoning applies to the claim for compensation for the total charges
for visas for foreign workers issued or renewed or extended by the Respondent
under clause 12.3 for the remainder of the Concession Period under the same

clause.

The certificate of an independent firm of auditors

The Respondent has also argued that the Claimant cannot rely on clause 12.3,
read with clause 16.1 of the CA to claim compensation, as it had abandoned its
reliance on its independent auditor’s certificate under clause 16.3. As clause
12.3 is a penal provision, it is not necessary to deal with this argument.
However, the Tribunal wishes to point out that there may be an inadvertent

99

217.

218.

219.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 104 of 263

omission in clause 16.3 in that it provides that the certificate is required only
where the claim for compensation is made “pursuant to the proviso of Clause
16.1 & 16.2.” (Emphasis added). There is no proviso in clause 16.1, although
there is a proviso in clause 16.2. Since clause 16.1 does not contain a proviso, it

may be that no certificate is necessary for a claim made pursuant to clause 12.3.

(b) Alternative B claim - common law damages

With respect to the Claimant’s Alternative B claim for common law damages,

the claim is for:

(a) for loss of revenue for the remainder of the 20-year Concession
Period at the present value (i.e., discounted to date) of US$37,740,652 (at
US$2 per passenger) or US$58,790,178 (at US$4 per passenger); or

(b) for loss of projected profit for the remainder of the Concession

Period at the present value (i.e., discounted to date) of US$15,200,000 (at

US$2 per passenger) or US$37,000,000 (at US$4 per passenger).
The Tribunal agrees with the submission of the Respondent in that at common
law, the Claimant is only entitled to be put in the same position as if the CA had
been performed. If the Claimant had performed its obligations under the CA, it
would have to incur expenditure to maintain the MIBCS in order to earn the
revenue under the CA. Therefore, the Claimant is only entitled to claim the net
profit from operating the border control] system. Hence, the Claimant may only
claim damages arising from loss of profit, and not the loss of revenue. On this
basis, the Claimant is entitled to claim US$15,200,000 (at US$2 per passenger)
or US$37,000,000 (at US$4 per passenger), as the case may be, as agreed
jointly by the Parties’ financial experts.

For the reason given at [218] above, the Tribunal also finds that the Claimant
may not claim the Value of the Completed Works as it is subsumed in the claim

for profits.

100

220.

222.

223,

224.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 105 of 263

Likewise, the claim with respect to the work permits of foreign workers is also

not permissible as that too is subsumed in the claim for loss of profit.

(c) The claim as per the invoices
The Claimant claims as damages the total value of the invoices issued and sent
to the Respondent between 20 September 2010 and August 2013 amounting to:
{a) US$1,885,654 (at US$2 per passenger); or (b) US$3,771,308 (at US$4 per

passenger).

The Respondent denies this claim on the ground that the said invoices were not
rendered by the Claimant but by Nexbis Sdn Bhd. The evidence is not clear as
to the precise relationship between the Claimant and Nexbis Sdn Bhd, but they
appear to be affiliated or related under a group of companies alleged to be
controlled by the same person. It is also not clear from the testimony of the
Claimant’s sole director as to the capacity in which Nexbis Sdn Bhd sent the

invoices.

As the Respondent has not pleaded, or argued, that the Claimant is not entitled
to claim damages against the Respondent for breach of the CA on the ground
that it had assigned the benefit of the CA to Nexbis Sdn Bhd, the Tribunal can
only proceed on the basis that the Claimant is still the contracting party entitled
to all the rights under the CA, and therefore, even if the invoices had not been
sent on behalf the Claimant, that circumstance would not disentitle the Claimant
to claim for the same amounts as shown in the invoices. The Respondent has
not disputed that the amounts invoiced are inaccurate based on a fee of US$4

per passenger.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant is entitled to claim
either the sum of US$1,885,654 (at US$2 per passenger) or US$3,771,308 (at
US$4 per passenger), as the case may be.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 106 of 263

(d) Are damages payable up to voluntary administration?

225. The Respondent has argued that since the Claimant went into voluntary
administration on 23 October 2014, any damages it is entitled to should stop at
that point of time because the Claimant would have stopped payment to its
creditors, with the consequence that the Respondent would have terminated the
CA under clause 11.1.1 (at [513]-[517] of its Closing Submissions®).

226. The Respondent refers to the decisions in The Mihalis Angelos [1970] 3 WLR
601 (“The Mihalis Angelos”) and Golden Strait Corporation v Nippon Yusen
Kubishika Kaisha (“The Golden Victory’) for the following principles:

(a) damages may be reduced if an event had occurred such that a
contracting party would have had the option of terminating the contract;

(b) damages may be reduced if an event would inevitably occur; and

(c) damages may be reduced if an event may occur.

227. The Respondent argues (at [510]-[513]) that principle (a) is applicable here
because the Respondent would have been entitled to terminate the CA forthwith

under clause 11.1.1 by reason of the following circumstances:

(a) the Claimant had no assets or revenue to settle its liabilities;
(b) the Claimant had entered into a scheme of arrangement with its
creditors (see the Deed of Company Arrangement dated 23 October 2014,
[6CHB 3927]), as the parent company could not settle all debts but
merely paid some and transferred the rest to a creditor’s trust;
(c) the Claimant:

(i) had stopped paying its former Chief Financial Officer (Peter

Dykes) who resigned when the Claimant was delisted on or around
July 2012;

102

229.

231.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 107 of 263

(ii) became insolvent and entered into voluntary administration
on 30 June 2014; and

(iii) entered into an arrangement with its creditors on 23 October

2014.
The Tribunal is unable to accept this argument. Principle (a) at [226] has no
application to the facts in the present case. On 5 August 2013, when the
Respondent repudiated the CA, it was under a liability to pay the Claimant the
sum of US$1,885,654 (being 50% of the total outstanding invoiced amounts
based on US$4 per passenger). From August 2013 to 30 June 2014 and 23
October 2014, the Claimant would have been entitled to be paid US$2 per
passenger multiplied by the number of non-Maldivian visitors entering the
Maldives during this period. If the Respondent had paid these sums to the
Claimant, the latter would not have found it necessary to enter into voluntary

administration.

Further, as the Tribunal concluded earlier, the Claimant would have been in a
position to remedy any breach of the CA if the Respondent had given notice of

termination of the CA under clause | 1.1 thereof.

The Tribunal finds that the Respondent’s submission on this point is entirely
speculative. It is not possible to know, even with hindsight, what would have
happened had the Claimant been allowed to continue to perform the CA and/or
the Respondent had paid to the Claimant the payments due to it in a timely

manner.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent’s argument on this issue
fails, and that the damages payable to the Claimant are not limited to the date

when it entered into voluntary administration.

103

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 108 of 263

(e) Is the passenger fee US$4 or US$2?

232. This issue is highly contentious. The Parties cannot agree on whether clause
5.2.1 of the CA provides for a passenger fee of US$2 for arrival and departure,
or US$2 each for arrival and for departure. The Claimant’s case is that clause
5.2.1 clearly provides for US$2 each for arrival and for departure, i.e., USS4.
The Respondent’s case is that clause 5.2.1 is ambiguous and should be
interpreted to provide for US$2 for arrival and departure, i.e., US$2, as initially
offered by the Claimant in its price bid and on the basis of which, inter alia, the

MIBCS Project was awarded to the Claimant.
233. Clause 5.2.1 provides as follows:

“The Company is authorised by the Government to impose upon and collect levy or
fee from:
Each and every passenger using non-Maldivian passport arriving into and
departing from the Republic of Maldives, a fee of USD2.00 (UNITED
STATES DOLLAR TWO ONLY) per passenger via a levy or fee imposed or
to be imposed by the Government to be charged on such a passenger.”

(i) The Respondent's Submissions on the passenger fee
234. At [465]-[490] of its Closing Submissions*, the Respondent contends:

(a) that the Claimant was entitled to charge only US$2 per passenger
arriving in and departing from the Maldives for the following reasons:

(i) the Claimant has admitted that it had submitted a financial
bid for the MBICS project at US$2 per passenger;

(ii) the Respondent accepted the Claimant’s bid as it was the
best proposal (as stated to DOJE by the MOFT in a letter dated 29
September 2010);

(iii) Recitals A and B of the CA state that the Respondent had
evaluated and accepted the Claimant’s proposal as “the competitive
solution with the highest scoring on technical and price bid.

 

104

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 109 of 263

(iv) the Parties intended that the charge would be US$2 per
passenger;

(v) for the above reasons, cl 5.2.1 should be read to mean that a
foreign passenger arriving and departing Maldives would only be
charged US$2.

(ii) The Claimant's Reply Submissions on the passenger fee

235. In its Reply Submissions dated 4 February 2016, the Claimant submits at [328]-
[335]:

(a) First, the Parties originally contemplated that the Claimant would
charge every passenger, regardless of nationality, a US$2 fee, but after
negotiations, the Claimant would be entitled to charge only non-
Maldivian passengers US$2 upon arrival and US$2 upon departure (as
seen from a previous draft of the CA reviewed by Abdullah Muiz, then
Solicitor General) (at [328], referring to CCS (Claimant’s Closing
Submissions)[159] at endnote vi).

(b) Second, the CA contains an entire agreement clause. The
Respondent cannot rely on the Claimant’s original proposal if it is
different from that set out in the CA (at [329]).

(c) Third, the AGO, MOFT, DOIE and ACC all understood that the
Claimant was entitled to charge every non-Maldivian passenger US$2
upon arrival and US$2 upon departure. The Parties’ subsequent conduct
also evidenced this common understanding (at [330]).

(d) The Respondent’s argument that post-contractual conduct may not
be used to explain the meaning of a clause in the contract is incorrect.
The Singapore Evidence Act does not apply in this arbitration. It is open
to the Tribunal to adopt a robust approach to contractual interpretation,
and consider the post-contractual conduct of Parties, as has been done in
New Zealand, several civil law jurisdictions and in transnational
conventions (at [331]).

105

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 110 of 263

(e) Fourth, the Respondent cannot rely on the statements of Ahmed
Waheed and Ibrahim Waheed on the following grounds: (i) they did not
testify at the hearing; (ii) there is no reason to prefer their statements to
those of the Solicitor General and of Ageel; (iii) Anmed Waheed was not
present at the negotiations or the discussions of the CA; and (iv) Ibrahim
Waheed’s recollection that he did not recall the US$2 that was to be
charged upon departure as well, does not prove anything (at [332]-[333]).

(f) Fifth, Naseer confirmed in his testimony that the Respondent’s
case that the Claimant was entitled to charge only US$2 originated from a
suggestion by its expert witness, Leow (at [334]).

(g) Sixth, the Respondent also has not explained why it only took the
position that the Claimant was only entitled to charge every foreigner
US$2 at the threshold of the hearing, on 7 September 2015 (at [335]).

(iii) The Respondent's Reply Submissions on the passenger fee

236. In its Reply Submissions dated 4 February 2016, the Respondent submits at
[105]-[188]":

(a) The Respondent’s argument that the Claimant was entitled to
charge only US$2 per passenger (arriving and departing Maldives) did
not originate from Leow. He was asked to calculate the Claimant’s loss
on the basis that “[t]he total fee per foreign passenger who arrives and
departs Maldives is US $2...” (at [105]-[111}).

(b) The Respondent raised the issue at [39.1]-[39.2] of its D/C (at
[112}-[113]).

(c) The principles applicable to contractual interpretation are set out at
Y.ES. F&B Group Pte Lid v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd
(formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd [2015] 5
SLR 1195 (“Y.E.S. F&B”). Applying those principles, the objective
evidence shows that the Claimant is only entitled to charge US$2, and
this interpretation is consistent with business common sense (at [114]).

106

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 111 of 263

(d) The key phrase in clause 5.2.1 is “arriving into and departing
from”. These words should be read conjunctively, i.e. every foreign
passenger arriving into and departing from Maldives would pay a total of
US $2. The addition of the phrase “departing from” would prevent the
Claimant from claiming in future that it was entitled to claim an
additional $2 upon departure. This construction is consistent with the
wording of clause 12.3 of the CA (the liquidated damages/penalty clause)
which provides that the Respondent would pay the Claimant, upon
termination, a compensation sum equivalent to the total Charges
multiplied by the projected number of passengers entering into and
departing from Maldives (at [115]-[119]).

(e) The requirements of the bid and the bidding process support the
Respondent’s interpretation. All bidders submitted bids based on a “per
passenger” basis. The Respondent’s intention was for incoming tourists to
be charged as low a price as possible as “there were concerns that the
increase in taxes would cause tourist arrivals to decline” (at [121]-[128]).

(f) On a comparison of the Claimant’s unsigned financial bid which
states “USD 2 per passenger (per arrival and per departure)” [3CHB
1233], its original bid submitted on 20 May 2010 [2.2 CHB 975] and
clause 5.2.1 of the CA [1 CHB 22], if the Claimant had intended to
charge per arrival and per departure in clause 5.2.1, it would have used
the same phrase found in its “draft” financial bid — “per passenger per
arrival and per departure”. That phrase is very clear, instead of “every
passenger arriving into and departing from” show that it was not the
Parties’ intention (at [129]-[133]).

(g) There was no evidence of any extensive negotiations that led to the
Claimant being allowed to charge US$4 per passenger (at [134]-[147]).

(h) A comparison between the unsigned draft and the CA is unhelpful
because:

(i) the status of the unsigned draft is uncertain and is unreliable;
(ii) no evidence has been led on the draft;

(iii) the Claimant’s interpretation is subjective;

107

238.

239.

240.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 112 of 263

(iv) an objective interpretation should give effect to clause 12.3
which allows the Claimant to claim damages multiplied by
passengers entering or departing from the Maldives; and

(v) the words “entering into and departing from” should be read
conjunctively.

(—) Discussion on the passenger fee
The Parties agree that an entire agreement clause (clause 32) does not prevent

the Tribunal from adopting a contextual approach to contract interpretation: Lee
Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow*".

The Claimant’s price bid proposed a charge of US$2 per passenger for entry
into and departure from the Maldives (including Maldivian nationals). The TEB
described and evaluated the bid on the basis of US$2 per “passenger (in and
out)” (see CHB 1857 and 1 RBD 3-5).

The charges clauses in the 290710 Draft (see 4 CHB 2365-2398) referred only
to passengers entering the Maldives. No mention was made of departing
passengers. However, the 171010 Draft (executed by the Parties) amended the
charges clauses to exclude Maldivian nationals, and also to add in references to
departing passengers. As a result, amended clause 5.2.1 is read as set out at

[233] above.

The executed CA was a negotiated text. In his statement to the ACC (see RBD
at 2552), Ilyas stated:

After tender valuation board awarded the bid and informed immigration, work
commenced to form an agreement with the awarded party. The draft agreement was
not one presented by Nexbis. | created the original of the draft by making reference to
previous agreements. The draft was completed based on several negotiations with
them. This would include a big input of Nexbis. (Emphasis added)

241.

242.

243.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 113 of 263

Similarly, in his statement to the ACC at [2567]-[2568], Abdulla Muiz, the
current Attorney General, said:
On behalf of the [AGO], I attended and gave legal opinion in 2 meetings, which was
to review the draft agreement that was to be signed with Malaysia’s Nexbis to
establish the [DOIE’s] Border Control System. No other person attended the meeting

from the [AGO]. The other attendees were from the [MOFT], Nexbis Ltd and the
[DOIE]. If I remember correctly, the meeting took about 45 minutes.

(i) Negotiations not prima facie evidence

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no doubt that the CA was a negotiated text to the
extent that representatives of the Claimant were present when the text of the CA
was finalised. There was at least one meeting where the Claimant’s
representatives attended at which the draft CA was discussed and amendments
to it were proposed and agreed by the Parties on 13 October 2012. However, the
fact that the text was a negotiated text does not, in itself, lead to the inexorable
conclusion that clause 5.2.1 bears the meaning as contended for by the
Claimant. It is not even prima facie evidence. Whether or not there was a
“bargain struck” between the Parties within the meaning of clause 5.2.1 does
not depend on the fact of negotiations, but on what terms were actually
negotiated. On this point, the Claimant has produced no evidence to show that
the Parties actually negotiated changes to the Charges Clauses in the 171010
Draft. As a matter of fact, the minutes of the meeting at which amendments
were proposed to the draft CA recorded amendments only to clauses 3.9, 3.9.2,
5.2.5, 5.2.6, 8.1 and 12.3 of “the draft concession agreement” (see 3RBD 2116).
The text of this “concession agreement” is not the same as the 171010 Draft.
There appears to be an intervening draft CA which has not been produced by
either Party.

(ii) Subsequent conduct
The Claimant relies strongly on the consensus view of the Respondent’s
agencies, including the Cabinet, the AGO and Parliament, that clause 5.2.1

109

244.

245.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 114 of 263

means what the Claimant was entitled to claim US$4 per passenger. For
instance, the Claimant argues at CCS 156(b) and CCS 164:
[156(b)] “The evidence shows that the Respondent’s AGO, MOFT, DOIE as well as
the ACC all understood the CA to mean that the Claimant was entitled to charge
every non-Maldivian passenger $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure. They shared

this understanding — consistently and universally - even before the Claimant rendered
its first invoice.”

[164] The evidence shows that the various functionaries of the Maldivian government,
the ACC, and the Parliament, at all points independently and collectively understood
the CA to mean that the Claimant was entitled to charge every non-Maldivian
passenger $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure.
The Respondent’s general response to this argument is two-fold. Firstly, none of
the Respondent’s officers whose subsequent conduct has been relied upon by
the Claimant was a member of the TEB or was present at the evaluation, and
therefore might not have known that the Claimant’s financial bid was for US$2
per passenger. Secondly, subsequent conduct may not be reliable as evidence of
fact as it enables a party to pick and choose the conduct that favours his

position, and ignores that which is against his position.
(iii) The Tribunal’s views
The Tribunal’s view on the argument based on subsequent conduct or

understanding is as follows:

(a) The meaning of clause 5.2.1 is a matter of interpretation solely for
the Tribunal to decide according to established principles of documentary
interpretation.

(b) The Respondent’s understanding of the meaning of clause 5.2.1
(which it has now rejected) is a factor the Tribunal may take into account,

but it is not, and cannot be, determinative of the issue.

(c) The past understanding of the Respondent on the meaning of
clause 5.2.1 is not binding on it. It could have been based on a mistake of

110

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 115 of 263

law or of fact. Hence, unless it has acted on the understanding in a way
that estops it from arguing that that clause has or was intended to have a
different meaning. .

(d) The fact that the Respondent did not question the accuracy of the
unpaid invoices when they were received does not mean that the amounts
claimed therein were correct on the true meaning of clause 5.2.1. Even if
the Respondent has acted on the basis of that interpretation, it could still
plead that it made a mistake, whether of fact or law, unless it is estopped
from doing so.

(e) Indeed, even if the Claimant had paid the invoices, the law would
still allow it to argue that it had made a mistake of fact or law. The
Claimant’s argument is valid only where, as a matter of law, the Claimant
is estopped from denying their correctness. This is not the case here.

(f) Accordingly, even though the Respondent failed to challenge the
correctness of the unpaid invoices, and has amended its pleading at the
last minute to do so (and it does not matter who suggested it) these two
facts do not strengthen the Claimant’s interpretation, or weaken its own.
There is no principle of law which says that the Respondent cannot now
deny their correctness, or that it had made a mistake in not rejecting them.

(g) For these reasons, the Claimant’s reliance on the subsequent
“conduct” of the Respondent’s agencies is misplaced. There is no
principle of law which says that the Respondent may not now deny their
correctness, or that it had made a mistake in not rejecting them.
On the issue of pleadings, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has pleaded a
general denial of the claim of the Claimant based on its interpretation of clause
5.2.1, and has put the Claimant to strict proof thereof (RDC [39.1]). This is

sufficient to put the issue in play.

The Tribunal also docs not accept the Claimant’s argument that it was Leow

who suggested the meaning of clause 5.2.] to the Respondent. Leow was given

i

248.

249.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 116 of 263

a list of subject matter for him to provide an opinion on (see “LQS-2” at [9]),
including:
“The total fee per foreign passenger who arrives and departs Maldives is US $2...
Please calculate the Claimant's loss for the [following] period[s]...”
The thrust of this subject matter is that the Claimant might only be entitled to
claim US$2 per passenger. In any case, this is an inconsequential issue. The
Tribunal is only concerned with whether the interpretation is correct in law, and

not with who suggested the interpretation.

(g) Differences between the 290710 Draft and the 171010 Draft
Two versions of the concession agreement are found in the CHB. The first
version bears the words “Dated 290710”. However, the front page contains the
typewritten words “Dated the day of October 2010”, but it also bears the
handwritten words on the top left hand corner “07/10 Afeef + Abd Waheed
visit... discussion” (Emphasis added). The second is the executed CA dated 17
October 2010 (1 CHB 22).

The Claimant’s case is that a comparison of the language used in clause 5.2.1 of
both versions puts it beyond doubt that, in the 171010 Draft, the Parties
intended the Claimant to be entitled to charge every passenger (excluding
Maldivian passport holders) US$2 upon arrival and US$2 upon departure, i.e.
US$4 per passenger. The Respondent’s case is that the language of clause 5.2.1
in the 171010 Draft is ambiguous, and that it should be interpreted to reflect the
Claimant’s price bid of US$2 per (arriving and departing) passenger, as it was
the bid that was accepted by the TEB. If clause 5.2.1 of the 171010 Draft were
intended to allow the Claimant to charge US$4 per passenger, it would have

used clear and unambiguous language.

(h) Who drafted the CA?

The Parties disagree on which Party prepared the CA. The Claimant contends
that it was Ilyas as he had admitted it in his statement to the ACC. The
Claimant’s factual witness, Chua, denied that it was the Claimant when he was
questioned on it. The Respondent contends that the CA was prepared by the
Claimant, even though Ilyas might have admitted it as he did not have the

expertise to draft such kind of agreement.

The relevance of this issue to the Respondent’s case is that Ilyas lied on this
issue as he did not want the ACC to know that it was the Claimant who had
prepared the draft CA. If he had told the ACC that it was the Claimant who had
prepared the CA, the ACC might suspect that he had allowed the Claimant to
insert in the CA terms and conditions that were not in the interest of the

Respondent.

However, the minutes of the 13 October 2010 meeting of the relevant
Respondent’s agencies (including the AGO) and the Claimant’s representatives
show that they discussed and finalised the amendments to the draft CA. The
final draft of the CA was the product of their joint efforts. Who then prepared

the draft CA that was discussed at this meeting?

In the Tribunal’s view, Ilyas did not draft the CA as he certainly did not have
the expertise or experience to draft an agreement of this nature. The Tribunal is
also of the view that Ilyas did not make any admission that he drafted the CA.
On the contrary, his statement suggested that it was the Claimant who had
prepared the draft CA and had given it to him to consider. His statement to the
ACC (at RBB) is as follows:

After tender evaluation board awarded the bid and informed immigration, work

commenced to form an agreement with the awarded party. And finance sent an

official letter to commence work of forming the agreement. The draft agreement
was not one presented by [the Claimant]. I created the original of the draft by

113

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 118 of 263

making reference to previous agreements. The draft was completed based on
several negotiations with them. This would include a big input of [the Claimant].
A lot of people’s discussions would be included. However original draft was
created from immigration by me. ...In drafting parts of the main parts of the
agreement, advice was sought from immigration legal counsel, Ibrahim Afeef,
Attorney General Abdullah Muiz was consulted on the draft of the agreement.
And meetings were held with all the relevant authorities. The party who won the
project took part in the discussions. As such, Attorney General Abdullah Muiz was
met with and requested to hasten the agreement, and as such [the Claimant], finance
ministry and immigration met with the [AGO] to discuss the agreement. This was a
meeting especially to finalize the draft of the agreement. This was an official meeting.
It was decided to proceed with the agreement with minor changes, after each clause of
the agreement was separately discussed and amended as needed. Home ministry was
also consulted at a policy fevel regarding the agreement. The points they raised
regarding the agreement were the issue of arbitration and tax issues. AG Abdullah
Muiz also pointed out the same issue issues. The agreement included clauses to levy a
$2 tax from all foreigners arriving and departing from the Maldives and a charge of
$15 for every visa card issued as doing so was discussed and approved by NPC in
official meetings and other meetings, and also after the current AG Abdullah Muiz
and former Finance Minister Hashim talked about it and said that it was possible to do
so. As this and other provisions of the agreement were finalized with the approval of
the Attorney General, I do not believe I have to be responsible for it. If anyone has to
bear responsibility, it has to be NPC, Finance Ministry and the [AGO]. The [AGO]
had even told immigration in writing to amend the agreement as per the discussions at
the [AGO] and to proceed after incorporating the amendments. NPC had also
instructed us similarly. Therefore, in this issue filed at the anti-corruption commission
regarding the border control system of the department of immigration. I have done
nothing to use my position to acquire an unfair advantage to anyone. Nor have I even
tried to acquire an unfair advantage for anyone.” (Emphasis added)

In this statement, Ilyas stated that

“The draft agreement was not the one presented by [the Claimant]. I created the
original of the draft by making reference to previous ones.”
Ilyas did not say the draft agreement was not presented by [the Claimant]. What
he said was that the draft agreement was not the one presented by [the
Claimant], implying that there was an earlier draft presented by the Claimant

which he had used to prepare his own draft for consideration by the Respondent.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 119 of 263

AG Abdullah Muiz (who represented the then Attorney General at the meeting)
confirms substantially Ilyas’ account. At RBD 2569-2570, he states:
We also discussed article 5.2.] of the agreement which states that every foreigner that
arrives in Maldives will be charged $2, every foreigner that departs Maldives will be
charged $2 and every visa will be charged $15....... The [AGO] was not asked to
assist in the drafting of the agreement signed between [Respondent] and [Claimant] to
establish the [MIBCS]. I was informed that the draft was prepared and sent by
the successful bidder, [the Claimant]. Since there was no lawyer working on the
Immigration at that time and since there was no such agreement among the
bidding documents prepared by Immigration, [ do not believe that the
agreement was drafted by Immigration.” (Emphasis added)
The objective evidence
The objective evidence shows that it was the Claimant who prepared the first
draft CA. Two draft versions are disclosed in the Common Hearing Bundles of
Documents filed in these proceedings. The first version contains the reference
“Draft 290710” (the 290710 Draft) on every page (see 4 CHB 2360). The front
page contains the reference “Dated this day of October 2010”. On the top left
hand corner appear in handwriting is the following entry: “07/10 Afeef + Abd
(?) Waheed visit... discussion”, indicating a visit by Waheed for a discussion
of the draft agreement. The entry “7/10” can mean either July 2010 or 7 October
2010. These entries indicate that there was discussion of the 290710 Draft on

either of these dates.

The second version is the CA dated 17 October 2012 (see CHB 22 and RBD
2141). This was the draft discussed by the Respondent’s agencies, viz, the AGO,
the MOFT, the DOIE, and the Claimant on 13 October 2010 at which a draft
CA was amended (see RBD 2116).

The Respondent argues that the Claimant prepared the 290710 Draft because

the following clues show it to have originated from a Malaysian source:

415

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 120 of 263

(a) It is marked “Draft 290710” indicating its calendar date as 29 July
2010, before the price bids were opened on 22 September 2010 (CHB
1587 — Evaluation on 29/9/2010].

(b) The definition of “Working Day” is “a day other than - (a)
Saturdays, Sundays...” As Sunday is a working day in the Maldives, the
definition could only have been drafted by someone who was unfamiliar
with the Maldivian work week. The definition was changed in the CA to
refer to “Friday” and “Saturday” which are non-working days in the
Maldives,

(c) The draft provided that the governing law of the contract would be
the laws of Malaysia and that Parties would submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Malaysian Courts. Furthermore, it was also stated that
any arbitration was to be held in Malaysia.

(d) The clause relating to “Notice to the Company” was filled in with
the Claimant’s details, while that of the Respondent was left blank.

(ec) Finally, the royalty clause reads that:

“8.4 Royalty

The company agree to pay to the Government a royalty fee amounting to 5%
on project net profits declared by the Company annually for the duration
of the Concession Period or until such time the Government implements a
corporate profit tax or GST.” (Emphasis added.)

The Claimant’s financial bid was that royalty would be 5% of the
Claimant’s income on a monthly basis. The MOFT also stated
“[rloyalties of 5% of the gross revenue per year for 20 years” in its letter
to the DOIE, informing them that the Claimant had been awarded the
MIBCS Project. The Respondent’s officers would not have reduced the
amount of royalty payable to itself.

 

259. The Tribunal accepts the analysis of the Respondent. In its view, the tell-tales
referred to at [258 (a)-(d)} are conclusive of the Malaysian source of the 290710

Draft. The denial of the Claimant’s factual witness on this issue is not credible.

(i) The Tribunal’s interpretation of clause 5.2.1 of the CA

Given the state of the evidence before the Tribunal, and especially the absence
of any oral testimony by any witness who attended the negotiations on 13
October 2010, the Tribunal’s interpretation is limited to the text of clause 5.2.1
in the context of the CA as a whole. Having regard to the entire agreement
clause, the wording of the Claimant’s price bid cannot be used to change the
meaning of clause 5.2.1 if its meaning is plain. However, if clause 5.2.1 is
ambiguous as expressed, or contextually, the Tribunal is entitled to take into
account the Claimant’s price bid in order to determine two issues: (a) whether
the Parties intended clause 5.2.1 to change the Claimant’s price bid; and (b)

whether it has changed the said bid.

The starting point is the undisputed fact that there was an initial agreement
between the Respondent and the Claimant, based on the latter’s price bid which
the Respondent had accepted, that the passenger fee would be US$2 per arriving
and departing passenger. The crux of the Claimant’s argument on the meaning
of clause 5.2.1 (which was amended after negotiations) is that it had superseded
the initial agreement. The Claimant’s case is that clause 5.2.1 has increased the
fee to US$4 per passenger, i.e., US$2 on arrival and US$2 on departure. It is the
Tribunal’s view that the Claimant has the burden of proving that clause 5.2.1
was amended to allow it to charge US$4 per non-Maldivian arriving and

departing passenger.

Entire agreement clause

The entire agreement clause (clause 32) provides as follows:

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties hereto with
respect to the matters dealt with herein and supersedes any previous agreement or
understanding between the Parties hereto in relation to such matters. Each of the
Parties hereby acknowledge that in entering into the Agreement, it has not relied on
any representation or warranty save as expressly set out herein or in any document
expressly referred to herein.

17

263.

264.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 122 of 263

As mentioned earlier, the Claimant bears the burden of proving that clause 5.2.1

has superseded the initial agreement between the Parties.

From a commercial perspective, the increase of a fee by 100% within a short
period between 29 September 2010 (the date of acceptance by the TEB of the
price bid) and 17 October 2010 (when the CA was executed), which is a short
period of about three weeks, is not only puzzling, but most unusual
commercially, to say the least, especially when the bid was accepted as a result
of a public tender. The Respondent has described any intention to increase the
passenger fee as “illogical”, presumably meaning “commercially illogical”.
Actually, it may be aptly described as highly suspicious had there been such
intention, given the circumstances in which the bid was awarded to the
Claimant, and in the context where the Respondent’s objective was to increase
tourist arrivals to the Maldives, even though an additional US$2 might appear to

be a small sum of money.

Any claim that the passenger fee had been increased from US$2 per passenger
to US$4 per passenger in these circumstances would, or should, not have
escaped the attention of the Respondent’s agencies, especially the AGO. If
clause 5.2.1 has the meaning or effect as claimed by the Claimant, it would have
to provide a justifiable commercial reason for the increase. From the
Respondent’s perspective, it would have to identify a good reason for the
increase and at the same time for giving an almost immediate windfall to the
Claimant. A normal functional and responsible government does not act in this
way in giving long- term concessions to the private sector. The Claimant has
argued that the Respondent agreed to the increase because the price bid of US$2
per passenger was reduced by excluding Maldivian nationals from the charge,
thereby reducing the price bid of the Claimant. However, the Claimant has

produced no evidence to show that the Respondent had agreed to allow the

118

265.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 123 of 263

Claimant to increase its fee to US$4 per foreign passenger to compensate such
prospective loss. Apart from interpreting the text of clause 5.2.1 itself, the
Claimant has produced no evidence, written or oral, of any such agreement. No
correspondence between the Parties has been produced. Even worse than that,
the Claimant has not been able to produce any contemporaneous internal record,
not even a contemporary email from its representatives who had attended the 13
October 2010 meeting, to celebrate such a windfall. In the Tribunal’s view, the
absence of any evidence of or reference to such an agreement is telling. It
suggests that, save for the drafting of clause 5.2.1, there was no discussion on its
meaning, or that it was intended to give effect to an agreement to allow the
Claimant to increase it price bid from US$2 to US$4 per passenger. Given these
circumstances, the probability is that clause 5.2.1 was not intended to change

the meaning of the charge clauses in the 290710 Draft.

The Claimant has advanced four arguments that clause 5.2.1 was amended to

allow it to charge a passenger fee of US$4:

(a) there were extensive negotiations between the Parties on the
drafting of the CA;

(b) the words of clause 5.2.1, the charge clauses, are clear and
unambiguous. They plainly mean that the Claimant is entitled to charge
per passenger US$2 on arrival and US$2 on departure, ie. US$4;

(c) _ the initial bid of US$2 per passenger was intended to apply also to
Maldivian passport holders. As the Respondent wanted to exclude
Maldivians from this imposition, it was agreed that the Claimant be
allowed to charge US$4 per passenger to make up for the loss of revenue;
and

(d) the Respondent was agreeable to the increase in the passenger fee
as it would double the royalty it would be receiving under the CA.

267.

268.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 124 of 263

The Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimant’s arguments, even collectively,

for the following reasons.

(a) Argument (a) is not borne out by the evidence as recorded in the
ACC Report which shows that there was only one meeting at which the
Claimant’s representatives were present, i.e., on 13 October 2010, and the
minutes of that meeting did not record any negotiations on clause 5.2.1 or
any of the charge clauses. Moreover, the recollections of the
Respondent’s officers who had attended the 13 October 2010 meeting
show that the quantum of the passenger fee was not discussed.

(b) The Tribunal does not accept argument (b). The meaning of clause
5.2.1 is neither plain nor clear. Contextually, its meaning is consonant
with the Respondent’s interpretation rather than the Claimant’s
interpretation (see [236] above).

(c) Argument (c) is entirely speculative. The Claimant has produced
no evidence to support it.

(d) Likewise, argument (d) is entirely speculative. The Claimant has
produced no evidence to support it. It makes no commercial sense for the
Respondent to agree to double the passenger fee to US$4 in order to
increase its royalty based on 5% of the total receipts, when it could have
collected 100% of the additional fee of US$4 per passenger for its own
benefit.

For the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to
discharge the burden of proving that there was an agreement by the Respondent
to revise the Claimant’s price bid of US$2 per passenger to US$4 per passenger

under clause 5.2.1, or that clause 5.2.1 reflected such an agreement.

In the Tribunal’s view, clause 5.2.1 of the CA does nothing more than to state in
different words the Claimant’s original formulation of the passenger fee. This
formulation was truncated in the 290710 charge clauses to refer only to arrivals,

but not departures. No reference was made to departing passengers, because it

120

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 125 of 263

was not necessary to do so. The fee collected on arrival would mean that no fee

would be charged for departure.
269. Here are the reasons for the Tribunal’s conclusion:
(a) The formulation of the Claimant’s price bid was “USD 2 per
passenger arrival and departure” (3CHB 1233). The TEB’s Evaluation
Sheet at (RBD 4, 5) shows that the TEB shortened the Claimant’s
formulation to read “Passengers (In & Out 2.00)”.

(b) The word “Charges” in clause 1 of the CA is defined as

“USD 2.00... for every passenger using a non-Maldivian passport arriving
into and departing from the Republic of the Maldives”

 

The definition of “Charges” is clear and precise. It is the same (i) as the
Claimant’s formulation of “USD 2 per passenger arrival and departure”,
and (ii) as the shortened version in the Evaluation Sheet “Passengers (In
& Out 2.00)”.

(c) The expression “Charges” as defined is used with the same
meaning in (i) clause 3.9.2 (Respondent agrees to review Charges during
the Concession Period if inflation in the Maldives exceed by 50% the
inflation rate for the previous year); (ii) clauses 5.2.4-5.2.7, (iii) clause
8.1, and (iv) clause 12.3.

(d) Clause 5.2 sets out the charging mechanism in clause 5.2.1. As a
mechanism, it cannot provide for a charge that exceeds the Charges as
defined in clause 1. Accordingly, it must be interpreted to mean what
Charges as defined means. In fact, this is what clause 5.2.1 does, as it
reads:

The [Claimant] is authorised by the [Respondent] to impose upon and collect
levy or fee from:

Each and every passenger using non-Maldivian passport arriving into and

departing from the Republic of the Maldives, a fee of USD2.00 per
passenger...

121

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 126 of 263

Clause 5.2.1 has two additional words, i.e., “per passenger” after the fee
of US$2. In the Tribunal’s views, these two words serve to confirm that
the fee is US$2 per passenger. There is no reason to add those two words
except for that purpose since the imposition of the fee is already prefaced
by the words “Each and every passenger”.

(e) Clause 5.2.7 provides that all invoices for the Charges shall be
calculated in accordance with the price mechanisms as set out in
Appendix B which provides:

1.1 The [Respondent] shall pay the [Claimant] on the following schedule:-
1.1.1 For each and every non-Maldivian passport holder passenger arriving
into and departing from the Republic of Maldives, the [Respondent] agrees to

charge and collect a levy or fee for onward payment to the [Respondent] of
USD2.00...per passenger.

The price mechanism in Appendix B makes it clear beyond doubt that the
onward payment to the Respondent is US$2 per passenger.

(f) There is no logical reason for clause 5.2.1 to provide, in the same
words, a passenger fee that is different from the passenger fee set out in
the other clauses.
@ The Tribunal’s finding on the meaning of clause 5.2.1 of the CA
For the reasons given above, the Tribunal finds that clause 5.2.1 allows the
Claimant to charge every foreign passenger only US$2 on arrival into and
departure from the Maldives, i.e., in and out, and not US$2 both ways for

arrival into and for departure from the Maldives.

D. THE CORRUPTION ISSUE
1. The Respondent’s defence that the CA was tainted with corruption
The main defence of the Respondent to the Claimant’s claim for damages for
breach of the CA is that the CA was tainted with corruption, and therefore
unenforceable. As the Respondent relies entirely on the ACC Report to support
this defence, it is necessary that the Tribunal first examine the role of the ACC

122

272.

273.

274.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 127 of 263

in the Maldives, the nature of the offences of bribery and corruption and other
related offences under the PPCA, and the ACC Report.

(a) The ACC
The ACC is a body constituted under Article 199 of the Constitution as an
independent and impartial institution to prevent and combat corruption within
all activities of the Maldives without fear in accordance with the Constitution
and any laws enacted by Parliament. To ensure its independence from the
Executive, the members of the ACC are appointed by the President from
persons approved by a majority of the members of Parliament present and
voting, from the names submitted to Parliament as provided for in the statute
governing the ACC. A member of the ACC may be removed from office only:
(a) on the ground of misconduct, incapacity or incompetence; and (b) a finding
to that effect by a committee of Parliament pursuant to article (a) and upon the
approval of such finding by Parliament by a majority of those present and
voting, calling for the member’s removal from office, such member shal] be

deemed removed from office.

(b) The Prohibition and Prevention of Corruption Act (PPCA)
The law enacted by Parliament to combat corruption in the Maldives is the
PPCA. Its scope is broad as it applies not only to acts of bribery and corruption
but also to the conferment of undue advantage by public officers through the
use of influence from its position, i.e., abuse of office. The preamble at section
1(a) of the PPCA states:
This Act is to prevent the offer and acceptance of bribery, the prevention and

prohibition of attainment of undue advantage or the facilitation of attainment of undue
advantage through use of influence from position, and the prevention of such.

Section 28 defines the words “bribery”, and “undue advantage”, to mean, unless

the context otherwise requires:

123

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 128 of 263

(a) ‘Bribery’ is referred to as money, goods and property, conveniences and
other benefits, other than salary, wages, benefits, perks and conveniences offered by
the employer commensurate to employment, offered or obtained in order to act or
omit to act or to lessen the burden, to ease, to benefit, to give any advantage

‘h » to i ience or to make burd or to inflict any harm
whatsoever on a specific party or to motivate or reward someone to carry out
such.

(b) ‘Undue advantage’ refers to anything other than bribery obtained through use
of influence from position in addition to salary, wages, benefits, perks and
conveniences commensurate with work offered by the employer.

(Emphasis added)

(i) Bribery offences
275. The bribery offences in the PPCA are as follows:

(a) Sections 2 to 5 provide for the offence of offering and accepting bribery
(i) in relation to a task undertaken by the government (section 2);
(ii) | by members of Parliament (section 3);
(iii) in the judicial sector (section 4); and

(iv) in relation to a task undertaken by a member of the public (section
5).

(b) Section 6 provides for the offence of offering bribery to a person without
powers to fulfil a purpose for which bribery was offered.

(c) Section 7 provides for the offence committing or attempting to commit a
bribery through a person or a group in relation to an offence under sections 2 to
5.

(d) Section 8 provides for the offence of bribery to exert influence, etc.

(e) Section 9 provides for the offence of failing to inform about an attempt to

offer bribery and the offer of bribery.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 129 of 263

(ii) Conferring undue advantage offences

The conferment of undue advantage offences are as follows:

(a) Section 12(a) provides that “[i]t is an offence for an employee of
Government or a Government venture to use position or influence from
position, to gain or confer an undue advantage pertaining to a task or
connected to a task being carried out by the agency or place of his
employment.”

(b) Section 13(a) provides that “[i]t is an offence for any government
employee to act in a manner that precludes the public or state from
attaining advantage of anything the public or state could have benefited
from, or to act in a manner that diminishes the benefits that could have
been attained, or diverts the benefits or a part of the benefits to the
employee or the employee’s wife or husband.”

(c) The ACC Report dated 27 November 2011
On 27 November 2011, the ACC published the ACC Report under section 21
of the Anti-Corruption Act of 2008 (see RBD [3-2609] in Dihevi, with English
translation, comprising a 94-page report, a 7l-page statement, and the
remainder annexes, including statements of officers involved in the MIBCS
Project). The ACC Report was the result of an investigation by the ACC
following a complaint made by an individual on 14 October 2010 that, in
relation to the award of the MIBCS Project to the Claimant which had tendered
the highest price, “the bid was awarded in a way that promotes corruption” (see

[21.1 of the ACC Report]).

The ACC investigators examined numerous documents, minutes of meetings of
the relevant committees, letters, the bid proposals, etc. contained in 60 annexes
and interviewed 29 persons who gave statements of their roles at all the relevant
stages of the MIBCS Project leading to its award to the Claimant. Although the
ACC’s investigation was a thorough investigation, it failed to find evidence of
bribery. The ACC found lapses in procedure and documentation of the

125

279.

280.

281.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 130 of 263

processes involved in the bid and evaluation of the MIBCS Project and issued a
number of directives for compliance in future cases by the DOIE, the NPC, the
TEB and the AGO (see [9.1]-[9.4] of the ACC Report).

The factual matters summarised in this section, including the findings of the
ACC against Ilyas and Ageel, are extracted from the ACC Report. The main
finding of the ACC was that there was non-compliance and/or irregularities in
the way the competing bids were evaluated. The bids for the MIBCS Project
were submitted in two parts, each with its own specifications, and were
evaluated separately. The first part was the technical bid which was evaluated
on the basis of 60 marks. The second part was the price bid which was
evaluated on the basis of 40 marks. The project was awarded to the Claimant on

the basis of its overall best or highest marks out of 100 marks.

(i) The technical evaluations

The first TE was done on 2 June 2010 by a committee consisting of Ilyas,
Ibrahim Asraf, Admed Waheed and Ahmad Naseem from the DOJE and
Ahmade Jinaah Ibrahim from the Tender Evaluation Section (“TES”) of the
DOIE. The TES awarded the highest marks to the Claimant. The result was
presented to the TEB for approval at its 16" meeting of 2 June 2010. At its 17"
meeting on 3 June 2010, the TEB decided that the evaluation was questionable
for the reason that the category of “Capacity building”, which was not specified
in the RFP, was evaluated by the committee which awarded the highest marks
to the Claimant. The TEB rejected the evaluation and declared it invalid and
directed or proposed that an independent team be appointed to conduct the TE
again. Such a team was formed by MOFT, but the ACC Report does not state

the date it was formed.

The independent team conducted the second TE on 1 September 2010, almost

three months after the first evaluation. There is no evidence on why the second

126

282.

283.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 131 of 263

evaluation took such a long time. The new team managed to evaluate only three
out of the six specified categories, viz, (1) Service Response (BOT Solution),
(2) Installation and Implementation details and (3) Training, due to pressure of
time. The team evaluated 40 out of the 60 marks specified for the three
categories. The remaining categories, viz. (4) Bidders Profile, (5) References
and experience, and (6) Supplemental Information, had a value of 20 marks, and

were later evaluated by either Ageel or the TES.

The ACC found that there was a difference in the marks given to the bidders in
the first and second evaluations, but nevertheless the Claimant scored the
highest marks in both evaluations. The ACC also concluded that the result of
the second evaluation was questionable as it could not determine who made the
evaluation of the remaining three categories. The minute sheet at CHB 2062
states that the additional scores were evaluated by the TES. In his statement to
the ACC, Ageel stated that the evaluation could only have been done by the

TES, for which he was responsible as its head.

(ii) The price evaluation
The TEB evaluated the price bids (which was allotted 40 marks) on 22
September 2010 at its 24" meeting. Under the RFP guidelines, the 40 marks
were subdivided into 10 marks for royalty, and 30 marks for the other three
categories. The minutes of the meeting recorded as follows (ACC Report at
143):
[5.7.2.1] ...at the meeting before opening the price proposal of the four
companies...the members decided to divide the total 40 marks given to the Price
Proposal equally among the four categories to which the Price Proposal was to be
offered, that is 10 marks for passenger fees, 10 marks for work permit fee, 10 marks

for visa card fee and 10 marks for royalty...the meeting started at 10 am and ended at
11.23.

[5.7.2.2] |... The [TEB] decided to divide the 40 marks allocated to the Financial
Evaluation on the same day the Price Proposals were opened.

127

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 132 of 263

[5.7.3.1]... it is not clear who did the financial evaluation.

284. The ACC Report noted the difference in the outcomes due to the TEB dividing
the parts and allocating marks which it found was contrary to the RFP

guidelines:

[5.7.4.2] The investigation revealed that the results are different because marks had
not been awarded according to RFP and it would not be [the Claimant] who would
have won the project if the RFP guidelines were followed.

[5.7.4.2] If financial evaluation marks are given according to RFP, Iris would get
the most marks. Iris is the party that proposed to pay the most to the government as
royalty. When the fees allocated in this section are combined, the lowest price is
proposed by Informatix. The second lowest price is proposed by Iris. It is noted that
the party who won the project, [the Claimant] proposed the third lowest price.

[5.8.2.1] [The Claimant] attained the most marks for this project by combining the
technical evaluation and financial evaluation score. That is 66.40% points...

[5.8.2.2] When looking at the total marks of this project after adding up the
technical evaluation and financial evaluation it is not [the Claimant] who attained the
most in these parts. If marks were given in this manner, Iris would attain the most
marks. That is 66.88 points. [The Claimant] would be second place. That is 1.5% less
than Iris.

(iii) Ilyas’ statement on the first technical evaluation
285. Ilyas’s statement to the ACC on his role in the first TE is as follows (at RBD
(2551, line 11 and 2552, line 4]):

[11] However, the form given by the ministry to evaluate the EOI, RFP and proposal
included 5 major parts to give marks for. Apart from the 4 parts mentioned in the EOI,
the additional part was called “Capacity Building”. J don’t know who included that
part. Or may be that the tender board did it. We gave marks to the parts in the form
because it was set by the finance ministry. | did not notice that nay parties were
eliminated as a result of this additional part...

[4] After we finished our technical evaluation, we handed it over to the Finance

Ministry. After that, the technical team was summoned to the tender board regarding
the technical evaluation. And they complained about how we gave marks to the

128

286.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 133 of 263

training aspect. ] think that the omitted part was capacity building. After evaluating
for a second time by an independent party, [the Claimant] still scored the most marks.

(iv) Ageel’s statement on the technical/price evaluations

Ageel made two statements to the ACC - on 22 March 2011 and on 27 October
2011 - on his role in the technical and price evaluation. In his second statement,
he made the following statement on the division of the price bid into four

categories of 10 marks each. At RBD 2599, 2™ line from the bottom, he states:

I do not know to say whether or not the parties submitting the proposal would not
know how to structurize their proposed accordingly, if it is not mentioned in the RFP
that the evaluation of the project fee, for example, will be divided into 3 sub-criteria.
However, I believe that every party who submits the proposal must know that the
most marks will be given to the party who proposed the lowest price in every
category. While the proposal fee is divided into 3 categories, if there is no submission
in one of these categories, it means that either the party who submitted the proposal
will provide the particular service free or they aren’t complying with the criteria.
Thus, if they have decided that they will provide the service for free (if they have not
proposed any fee for that service) then they wil] receive full marks. However, while
prorating marks for those parties who did not impose a fee for the service (the fee of
the service is 0), ] did not think before that by prorating full marks for those parties in
this way, there could be a situation where the other parties who took part in the bid
might not get any marks. This is because the rest of the parties will be prorated from
0. However, during the long period J have worked in in the Tender Evaluation Section
of [MOFT], I have not come across situation where a part or a service of the project
was not changed. Since the division of the criteria into sub-criteria are done by the
Evaluation committee, I do not know what principles the Board used in establishing
the sub-criteria. ] will only know to say anything about the division into sub-criteria
after looking into how it happened. Before the price, of the 4 parties that passed the
project technical evaluation asper the agenda number 14 of the minutes of the [TEB’s]
24” meeting, was opened, the members decided that the 40 marks that is to be
awarded to the prince proposal would be divided into 4 equal parts. There are 10
marks for passenger fee, 10 marks for work permit fee, 10 marks for visa card fee and
10 marks for royalty. | believe that if there are 4 fees, dividing the total marks into 4
equal parts is not a problem. This is because there is no way of knowing which among
the 4 fees will be most beneficial. I do not know which members decided to divide the
marks in the meeting previously mentioned’ I have to check the minutes of the
meeting to see which member proposed the division.
[line 8 from the bottom of 2599}...] do not believe that the way the marks for the
project were awarded by dividing it into sub-criteria, could put any one party that
submitted the bid at an “unfair advantage”. After taking part in a “competitive bid”

 

129

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 134 of 263

and if they propose not to impose any fees, then in my opinion, they deserve full
marks. According to the rules of the Tender Board, unless the member wants it, the
things that they say cannot be recorded in the minutes along with their names. I do not
believe that the reason for this is has any hidden secretive purposes. This is just
because the way minutes are written is different in different institutions.

“Therefore, 1 cannot say exactly which member proposed the structure for awarding
marks. I do not know to say if this was my proposal either. However, as the
secretariat of the Board, I was also part of and informed about the proposal. I think
that the division of fees was included in the [RFP]. If the fees were not included, how
would the bidders have known which fees to propose? Board decisions are always
made unanimously between the members that attended the meeting. Therefore the
decision to divide the fees were also made unanimously and this is evident from the
ininutes of the meeting. If they did not agree to it unanimously, it would have been
stated in the minutes of the meeting. .... The minutes can only be finalised after the
draft of the minutes have been presented to the members of the Board and after they
bring any changes necessary to it. My job is to submit it to the Board the way it is in
the [RFP] (total 40 marks). The board members will decided on how to divide the
marks and structure of it. If there are any suspicions about the issue, I believe the
bidders would have wanted to clarify that. However, no such clarifications have been
requested until now. I also do not believe that any party who took part in the bid
would have got any inside information. Any party who suspects that can bring
forward the issue to us. However, no such issue has been brought to our attention
even until today. An advantage to a specific party could have been given only if the
criteria for the fee were made after the bid was opened. However, since the criteria
for the fee has to be made before opening the bid documents, there is no way for us to
know how they have proposed their fees in those documents. The bidders would
submit both the financial bid and the technical bid at the same time. I do not believe
that it is possible to check the technical bid and encourage a specific party to change
their financial bid in order to give that party an advantage. The technical evaluation
was done for a second time by technical experts on request by the former Minister,
after there were some suspicions about the first evaluation that was done by a team of
the [DOIJE]. The second team was formed by the Minister, consisted of individuals
that held high positions in the Government and were independent experts who worked
in this field. ...The team did not finish the entire technical evaluation of the project
because they could not give enough time due to their busy schedules. However, they
did say that they would finish the most important parts or components of the work
they were assigned. I think they evaluated only the “BOT” solution’s component.
Therefore they only evaluated 40% out of the total of 60%. The rest of the 20% were
evaluated by the Tender Section. Therefore, I believe that I, as the head of the section,
should be responsible for the 20% that was evaluated by the [TEB]. This is because
the woks of the section are completed under my supervision according to my
instructions.”

(vy) Findings and recommendations of the ACC against Ilyas and Ageel
The ACC Report contains adverse findings against two officers, Ilyas and
Ageel, in relation to the evaluations of the technical bid and the price bid. The
ACC found: (a) that Ilyas was involved in the first TE that was cancelled for
irregularity, and (b) that Ageel was responsible for the TEB’s financial
evaluation which did not comply with the RFP guidelines, resulting in the

MIBCS Project being awarded to the Claimant.

The ACC Report made seven adverse findings against Ilyas and four adverse
findings against Ageel as detailed below. The description “particular party” in
the ACC’s recommendations to prosecute under the PPCA refers to the

Claimant since the Claimant was awarded the MIBCS Project.

i. Ilyas

(i) In submitting the RFP in a letter dated 7 March 2010 to the MOFT
which was not the proposal approved by the NPC for the MIBCS Project,
which “appears to be Ultra Vires, and as it appears to the investigation
that Ilyas abused his position at the department in order to provide an
unfair advantage to a particular party,” the ACC referred the matter to the
Prosecutor General’s Office (“PGO”) to prosecute Ilyas for an offence
under section 12(a) of the PPCA (see [8.1] of the ACC Report).

(ii) Ilyas evaluated the bid by including an additional criterion of
“Capacity Building” and gave marks to increase the marks of a particular
party [the Claimant] and also that the guidelines used to evaluate the
“Training” category in the TE were not evaluated on a uniform basis, the
TE was cancelled, and “{a]s it appears that Ilyas had abused his position
at the department in order to provide an unfair advantage to a particular
party,” the ACC referred the matter to the PGO to prosecute Ilyas for an
offence under section 12(a) of the PPCA (see [8.2] of the ACC Report).

(iii) In not including in the CA the 29 scholarships and 200,000 National
ID Cards mentioned in the Claimant’s technical proposal (at [RBD
1307)), “[i]t appears to the investigation that this act of Ilyas deprived the

131

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 136 of 263

government of a profit that it would otherwise get”. The ACC referred the
matter to the PGO to prosecute Ilyas under clause 13(a) of the PPCA (see
[8.3] of the ACC Report).

(iv) In signing the CA which provides that US$2 could be charged from
each foreign passenger arriving and departing the Maldives, when the
financial proposal from the Claimant mentioned charging US$2 from
each passenger, “[i]t appears to the investigation that this act of Ilyas
deprived the government of a profit that it would otherwise get.” The
ACC referred the matter to the PGO to prosecute Ilyas for an offence
under section 13(a) of the PPCA (see [8.4] of the ACC Report).

(v) In mentioning in the CA that the payments to the Claimant would be
exempt from tax, and if this was not permitted, to increase the charges
taken by the Claimant under the CA, when firstly, the exemption had no
legal effect as the Business Profits Tax Act 2010 (under which the
exemption was purported to be granted) came into force on 18 January
2011 before the date of the CA, and secondly, the Government had not
approved any duty exemption for the payments under clause 14 of the
Foreign Investments Carried out in the Maldives Act of 1979 (“Act
25/79”). With respect to the MIBCS project, (a) “[i]t appears to the
investigation that the power to give approvals for exemption of tax under
the [CA] is not given to Ilyas”, and (b) “[i]t appears to the investigation
that this act of Ilyas deprived the government of a profit that it would
otherwise get.” The ACC referred the matter to the PGO to prosecute
Ilyas for an offence under section 13(a) of the PPCA (see [8.5] of the
ACC Report).

(vi) As the Claimant, a foreign company, (a) had not obtained the
requisite approvals under the Company Law of the Maldives 1996, and
registered with the Ministry of Trade and Industry as a foreign
investment, (b) had not registered under Act 25/79 its investment at the
Ministry of Trade and Industries and Labor and signed an agreement,
with the exception of works relating to tourism, and “[a]s it appears to the
investigation that [the Claimant] has physically carried out put business
transactions in the Maldives under the [CA]”, and “[a]s it appears to the
investigation that Ilyas had abused his position at the department in order

132

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 137 of 263

to provide an unfair advantage to a particular party”, the ACC referred
the matter to the PGO to prosecute Ilyas for an offence under section
12(a) of the PPCA (see [8.6] of the ACC Report).

(vii) In signing the CA with the Claimant when the proposal for the
MIBCS project was made in the name of a consortium, and under section
5 of the Contract Law of 1994 that “a contract can be entered into when
an offer is made by one party to another and this offer is accepted by the
offeree”, hence the CA may not be valid without the approval of the
consortium, “[i]t appears to the investigation that Ilyas had abused his
Position at the department in order to provide an unfair advantage to a
particular party”. The ACC referred the matter to the PGO to prosecute
Ilyas for an offence under section 12(a) of the PPCA (see [8.7] of the
ACC Report).

Ageel

(viii) In evaluating the Claimant’s bid (which was valid for 90 days), and
awarding its proposal out of time on the 93" day, 20 marks out of 60 and
114 days later, “Price Bid” was opened [and] evaluated under the
supervision of [Ageel]. “As it appears to the investigation that ... Ageel
abused his position at the department to provide unfair advantage to a
particular party,” the ACC sent the case to the PGO to prosecute Ageel
under section 12(a) of the PPCA (see [8.8] of the ACC Report).

(ix) In accepting a power of attorney given by the Claimant to its Sales
and Business Development Director instead of a power of attorney given
by the consortium which had originally submitted the bid, “it appears to
the investigation that ... Ageel had abused his position at the department
in order to provide an unfair advantage to a particular party”. The ACC
sent the case to the PGO to prosecute Ageel under section 12(a) of the
PPCA (see [8.9] of the ACC Report).

(x) In accepting and evaluating a proposal (for 20 marks out of 60 marks)
which became invalid according to the project RFP, “.. it appears to the
investigation that ... Ageel had abused his position at the department in
order to provide an unfair advantage to a particular party”. The ACC sent

291.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 138 of 263

the case to the PGO to prosecute Ageel under section 12(a) of the PPCA
(see [8.10] of the ACC Report).

(xi) In changing the allocation of marks to evaluate the Price Proposal
from 30 marks for price category and 10 marks to royalty to 10 marks for
four equal categories, as a result of which the Claimant was awarded the
MBICS project, it “appears to the investigation that ... Ageel had abused
his position at the department in order to provide an unfair advantage to a
particular party”. The ACC sent the case to the PGO to prosecute Ageel
under section 12(a) of the PPCA (see [8.11] of the ACC Report).

(vi) The PGO’s criminal charges against Ilyas and Ageel
Although the ACC had, on 27 November 2011, referred to seven complaints
against Ilyas for contravention of section 12(a) and section 13(a) of the PPCA,
and four complaints against Ageel for contravention of section 12(a) of the
PPCA, the PGO did not initiate any criminal proceedings against either of them
until 10 March 2013, two months after the Claimant served the Notice of
Arbitration on the Respondent. Even then, both Ilyas and Ageel were charged

with only one offence each.

With respect to Ilyas, the PGO charged Ilyas for committing a section 12(a)
offence on 10 March 2013 for using the influence of his position to gain an
unlawful benefit in relation to the 29 scholarships and 200,000 free I/Cs that had
been offered by the Claimant in its bid proposal but which were not included in
the CA (see [40] of Suood’s Witness Statement of 5 October 2015 and Annex
HS-15). According to Suood, the case is ongoing.

With respect to Ageel, the PGO charged him for committing a section 12(a)
offence on 10 March 2013 for using the influence of his position to gain an
unlawful benefit in relation to the introduction of an additional category for

evaluation during the bid process which had not been included in the RFP (see

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 139 of 263

[41] of Suood’s Witness Statement of 5 October 2015). Suood states that he

does not have a copy of the charge form, and that the case is ongoing.

Up to the date of this Award, the Tribunal has not been informed of any further

developments in these two prosecutions.

(@) Proceedings in the Maldivian courts involving ACC, the DOIE, and the
Claimant in connection with the MIBCS Project

Given the suspicions of the ACC as detailed in the ACC Report, it was therefore
not surprising that the ACC attempted to stop the execution of the CA, and also
its implementation after its execution by the Parties. On 2 November 2011
(prior to the publication of the ACC Report on 27 November 2011), the ACC
filed CC 2158/2011 and obtained on 3 November 2011 an interim injunction
suspending work under the CA. Thereafter, there followed a series of court
proceedings by the ACC against the DOIE to stop the Respondent (represented
by the DOIE) from proceeding with the works under the CA which it had signed
with the Claimant. In CC 2158/2011, the Claimant successfully applied to the
court to be joined as a third party to the proceedings. These proceedings
generated other proceedings, some of which were appealed to the Supreme
Court of the Maldives.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that the ACC had only investigative powers
under the ACC Act, and that it had no power to direct the DOIE not to sign the
CA or to implement it. The case summaries of the decisions of the courts (in
English translation) are set out in the witness statement of Husnu Al Suood of

Suood & Anwar LLP dated 23 August 2015.

E. THEPARTIES’ PLEADED CASES ON CORRUPTION AND/OR/ ILLEGALITY
1. The Respondent’s defence: the CA was tainted with corruption

At [8] of its D/C Am2, the Respondent pleads that the CA is voidable as it was
tainted with corruption as a result of Ilyas and Ageel having conferred an undue
advantage on the Claimant on an irregular basis and without the requisite
approvals from the Respondent. Ilyas was then the Minister of State and
Controller of DOIE, from 13 Nov 2008 to 21 Feb 2011 and from 8 Feb 2012 to
23 May 2012. Ageel was the Director General in MOFT at the time the CA was

signed.

The particulars of this defence are set out at [10]-[24].“ The material

paragraphs are [11] and [18]-[24] as follows:

11 Samee Ageel, who was the then Director General of the Tender Evaluation Section of
the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (“MoFT”) and the then Controller, Mr Ilyas
Hussain Ibrahim (“Controller”), who signed the Concession Agreement for and on
behalf of the Department of Immigration and Emigration (“DOE”), had conferred an
undue advantage on the Claimant by awarding the MIBCS project to the Claimant
without following the proper procedure and obtaining the requisite approvals.

18 As to the technical evaluation:

18.1 The first evaluation of the technical evaluation was held on or around 31 May 2010
(‘First Evaluation”). The Controller was part of the Tender Evaluation Committee for
this First Evaluation.

18.2 At meetings held on 2 and 3 Jume 2010 in respect of the First Evaluation, the First
Evaluation was held to be invalid.

18.3 Subsequently, the Tender Evaluation Committee was changed. As a result of such
change, the Controller was no longer part of the Tender Evaluation Committee. A second
evaluation in respect of the technical evaluation was then held on 1 September 2010
(“Second Evaluation”).

18.4 However, according to the summary report of the new Tender Evaluation Committee
for the Second Evaluation, the new Tender Evaluation Committee had only awarded
marks for three (3) out of the six (6) components which had been stipulated at clause 3.1
of the RFP.

136

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 141 of 263

18.5 On a separate technical evaluation sheet, the bidders were evaluated for the
remaining components set out in clause 3.1. However, it is unclear who and / or which
team had carried out this evaluation for the remaining components.

19 As to the financial evaluation, this was carried out on or around 22 September 2010.
However, the team doing such financial evaluation had used a method of calculation
which did not comply with what was set out at clause 6.16 of the RFP. Subsequently, the
Anti-Corruption Commission (“ACC”) discovered that had the calculation method in
clause 6.16 of the RFP been used instead, it would have been less advantageous to the
Claimant’s final score under the financial evaluation, and more advantageous to other
parties. This in turn would have meant that the Claimant would not have been the highest
bidder when the total scores of the technical and financial evaluations were added
together.

20 On or around 29 September 2010, a project award letter was sent to the Claimant
informing them that they had won the bid. This letter was signed by Samee Ageel.

21 Samee Ageel and the Controller have since been charged on or around 26 February
2013 and 27 February 2013, respectively, under the PPCA 2000, in the Maldivian criminal
courts in relation to the tender process of the Concession Agreement. Their cases are still
before the Maldivian criminal courts.

22 For the reasons set out in this section above, the proper procedure for the bidding and
tender of the MIBCS project pursuant to the President’s Office Directive and as set out by
the RFP which had been approved by the NPC, were not followed, thus contravening the
PPCA 2000. Furthermore, the evaluation process was carried out in a manner that
contravened the PFR 2009 and PPCA 2000. Consequently, the Concession Agreement is
tainted by corruption under Maldivian Law and is thus voidable.

23 It is against public policy to uphold a concession agreement which is tainted by
corruption.

24 By way of a letter dated 5 August 2013, the Respondent notified the Claimant of
these circumstances and held the Concession Agreement to be void (“S August 2013
Letter”).

2. Claimant’s pleaded case on the facts

297. In its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (No 1), the Claimant denies the
Respondent’s averments (at [8]-[9]) that the CA was tainted with corruption as

particularised by the Respondent, for the reasons that:

(a) it was not privy to the internal processes of the Respondent, and
therefore had no personal knowledge of these matters, and that the
alleged non-compliance and/or irregularities with the Respondent’s own
internal regulatory and/or assessment processes by its own representatives

137

298.

299.

300.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 142 of 263

and/or agents (which are not admitted) do not affect the validity of the
CA;

(b) the Claimant as an external party should not be affected by any of
the alleged non-compliance/irregularities;

(c) even if Ilyas and/or Ageel were convicted of the charges against
them, the Respondent has to plead and prove the alleged acts of
corruption on the part of the Claimant, which it has not done; and

(d) the Maldivian Supreme Court has made a finding in Case No
2012/SC-A26 that the decision to “enforce” the CA with the Claimant
was taken by the Executive Cabinet of the Respondent. No case has been
brought in the Maldives to declare the legal status of the CA under
Maldivian law.

3. Position of Ilyas and Ageel in this arbitration

Ilyas and Ageel are not parties to this arbitration, and have not been called to
testify for either Party. The Respondent has also not called any witness to testify
against Ilyas and Ageel on the alleged criminal conduct in the ACC Report in
connection with their respective roles in the TE and price evaluation of the four

competing bids for the MIBCS Project.

However, the Respondent has relied on the ACC’s adverse findings and
recommendations to prosecute them as evidence that they have committed
offences under section 12 of the PPCA which the Respondent has characterized
as corruption, or a form of corruption because they are included as offences in
the PPCA. It is in this sense that the CA is alleged to have been tainted with

corruption.
4. The Respondent’s evidence that the CA was tainted with corruption

Even though the initial claim of the Claimant was for damages of
US$258,234,764, the Respondent did not call any witness to testify on the facts

138

301.

302.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 143 of 263

to lay the ground for the defence that the CA was tainted with corruption.
Instead, the Respondent called as its sole witness, Naseer the current Chief
Immigration Officer. Naseer has worked at the DOIE since 1982 and has held
the position of Assistant Controller since 2004, and during the time of the

bidding process and the signing of the CA.

Naseer signed and affirmed two witness statements. In his second statement,
Naseer admits that he was not primarily involved in the bidding process and that
his account of the bidding process is largely based on documents in the DOIE’s
possession and from information publicly available, such as press reports or
courts decisions, and the ACC Report. Naseer gave a statement to the ACC on 4
May 2011 (see RBD 2526-2528) which makes no adverse allegations against
either Ilyas or Ageel or the Claimant in relation to the bidding or evaluation
process of the competing bids. In other words, Naseer did not have any first-

hand knowledge of the facts.

5. The Claimant’s response to Naseer’s evidence

The Claimant’s response to Naseer’s evidence is set out at [201]-[232] of its

Closing Submissions.“ In summary, the Claimant’s submission is as follows:

(a) Although many members of the Maldivian government were
involved in the MIBCS project, the Respondent chose to put forward a
single witness, Nasser, who was not a “factual” witness as he was almost
completely uninvolved in the MIBCS project.

(b) Further, Nasser was not a credible or reliable witness. He claimed
that he drafted his witness statement himself, in the Maldivian language,
with inputs from a team of people and with help for its translation.
However, when questioned, he betrayed that he knew very little of the
contents of his own witness statements, or the exhibits to them. On the
stand, he also contradicted the evidence in his witness statement several
times,

139

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 144 of 263

(c) Nasser’s witness statement was based on the ACC Report which
could not be relied upon as (a) the makers of the ACC Report were not
called; and (b) the evidence suggests that the ACC Report is unreliable.

(d) In the circumstances, the Tribunal should draw an adverse
inference against the Respondent for failing to call any relevant witness
to prove its case.

6. Ilyas and the first technical evaluation

303. In the light of Nasser’s irrelevant testimony, the Respondent’s defence is based
entirely on the findings of the ACC against Ilyas and Ageel. In relation to Ilyas,
the ACC Report states at [8.2] (see [288] above):

llyas evaluated the bid by including an additional category entitled “Capacity
Building” and gave marks to increase the marks of a particular party and also that the
guidelines used to evaluate the “Training” category in the technical evaluation was
not evaluated in a uniform basis, the technical evaluation was cancelled, and “As it
appears that Ilyas had abused his position at the department in order to provide an
unfair advantage to a particular party, the ACC sent the case to the PGO to prosecute
Ilyas and the Minister of State for an offence under s 12(a) of the PPCA).

304. At [199]-[205] of its Closing Submissions,” the Respondent submits:
(a) Ilyas was a member of the team that included an extra component

in evaluating the first TE. This was improper and resulted in the
evaluation being rejected by the TEB who called for a second evaluation.

(b) Thereafter he went out of his way to ensure that the Claimant
would be awarded the CA by “removing from its path” officials who had
been involved in the MIBCS project but were not in favour of the

Claimant.

(c) _ Ilyas even went to the extent of claiming he had drafted the CA.

305.

306.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 145 of 263

7. Tribunal’s finding on Ilyas’ role in the first technical evaluation

The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not made out its allegations that
Ilyas’ role in the TE of the Claimant’s bid had tainted the CA for the following

reasons:

(a) _ Ilyas was not involved in the second TE after the cancellation of
the first TE in which Ilyas participated.

(b) The second TE was conducted by an independent team of experts
appointed by the MOFT. The second evaluation also gave the highest
marks to the Claimant’s technical proposals, and it was accepted by the
TEB at its 23% meeting on 10 September 2010 (see ACC Report at
[5.6.6.1] at RBD 142).

(c) There is no evidence of any nexus between Ilyas’ alleged removal
of obstacles and the outcome of the second evaluation. Any irregularity in
the first TE involving Ilyas was neutralized by the second TE. Although
the ACC found the second evaluation questionable because it evaluated
40 out of 60 marks, and the remaining 20 marks were evaluated by either
Ageel or the TES, no allegation has been made against Ilyas on this
aspect of the evaluation.

(d) The PGO has not charged Ilyas with any offence in connection
with the first TE, although the ACC had recommended a charge under
section 12(a) of the PPCA. Instead, the PGO has charged Ilyas for using
the influence of his position to gain an unlawful benefit in relation to the
29 scholarships and 200,000 free National I/Cs that had been offered by
the Claimant in its bid proposal but which were not included in the CA
(see [40] of Suood’s Witness Statement of 5 October 2015 and Annex
“HS-15). The Respondent’s allegation against Ilyas is not based on this
finding.

The Tribunal also finds that there is no evidence that the Claimant was in any
way privy to or had prior knowledge of the manner in which the first and
second TEs were conducted, and therefore, even if Ilyas had committed any

unlawful act, the Claimant would not have been privy to such acts.

141

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 146 of 263

8. Ageel’s role in the second technical evaluation

307. The Respondent argues (at [131]-[14] of its Closing Submissions™) that Ageel

played a questionable role in the second TE as follows:

(a) His duty was to organize the second TE but he merely “cobbled”
together the second team without apprising them of their work. Three
members of the new team, viz, Faaiq Umar (at 3RBD 2507); Mohamed
Naaiz (at 3RBD 2545); and Mohamed Faisal (3RBD 2541) have stated in
their ACC statements that they were not formally requested to conduct a
second TE, but to discuss a tender or give a technical opinion on a
technical bid. They were given short preparation time to analyze the bids
(3RBD 2545). Ageel was named by Faaiq Umar as the person who had
called him for this purpose (see 3RBD 2507).

(b) The evaluation sheet purporting to be scores for the second TE
presented to the TEB for approval was dubious (4CHB 2714). Only three
categories were evaluated by the second team. The remaining three
categories were stated by Ageel to have been evaluated by the TES.
Since, Ageel was the head of the TES, the likelihood was that Ageel
himself made the evaluation (see statements of Ahmed Jinah Ibrahim and
Ageel quoted at [133] of the Closing Submission).

(c)  Ageel’s statement is problematical. First, the second team did not
even consider that they were giving an evaluation but had merely given a
technical opinion. They did not fill up an evaluation sheet, but merely
rendered a report on the TE setting out some of their findings.

(d) Second, Ageel gave contradictory reasons for the second team
making a partial evaluation of the bids. He explained that (i) the
remaining categories could be evaluated by the TES; and (ii) the MOFT
had advised that only three categories would be sufficient to determine
the technical part of the entire bid. The second reason is not credible
because the RFP guidelines required a full evaluation, and Ageel stated
that as head of the TES, he was responsible for evaluating the remaining
three categories, for which marks out of 20 had been entered in the
evaluation sheet (at [141] of the Closing Submission and 3RBD 2600).

9. The financial evaluation

The RFP guidelines require the TEB to evaluate the price bid on the basis of 30
marks for passenger fee, work permit fee and visa card fee collectively, and 10
marks for royalty. The minutes of the 24" meeting of the TEB on 22 September
2010 record under “Agenda Item No 14: Determination of the Price Scores of
the Immigration Border Control’s Project” as follows:

“Prior to the opening of the price proposals of four (4) parties who passed the

Project’s Technical Evaluation, the members decided to allocate the 40 marks, which
is given to the price proposal, in four (4) equal parts which is as follows:

Passenger Fee: 10 marks
Work Permit Fee: 10 marks
Visa Card Fee: 10 marks
Royalty: 10 marks

The following were members of the TEB (see Dramatis Personae) representing

their respective agencies who attended the meeting.

There is no dispute that the division of the 30 marks into 10, 10, 10 marks for
each of the categories of passenger fee, work permit fee and visa card fee
(10/10/10 Calculation Method”) was not in accordance with the RFP

guidelines.

10. The Respondent’s submissions on the financial evaluation

At [146]-[198] of its Closing Submissions, the Respondent contends:

143

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 148 of 263

(a) Ageel presented to the TEB the 10/10/10 Calculation Method to
evaluate the price bids in violation of the RFP guidelines.

(b) The only reason Ageel did this was to confer upon the Claimant an
undue advantage of securing the CA when it otherwise would not have
won the bid.

(c) There was therefore no need for any further subdivision of the 30
marks as stated in the RFP. There was no difficulty in giving 30 marks
collectively to the three categories as provided in the RFP.

(d) The 10/10/10 Calculation Method was not permitted by the RFP.
Even if it were permissible, Ageel’s action falls within section 12(a) of
the PPCA as it was done with the specific intention to confer an undue
benefit to the Claimant (Ageel’s statement at RBD 2599).

“When we look at the proposed fees of the Immigration Border Control
Project, these fees have been divided into different parts. They are passenger
fee, work permit fee, and visa card fee. 1 do not believe that we have to award
the project to the party that proposed the lowest total fee when all these
different fees are added together. This is because, these fees are totally
different types of fees and it is not just to add all of them together. This is
because the work permit and visa card need not be made for all the passengers
that arrive and this amount would be different from other sub-criteria.
Therefore, although [the Claimant] did not propose the lowest total fee, when
we look at the types of proposed fees and their weights, they might be the
most eligible party...] believe that the structure the Evaluation Committee
designed to award marks is a fair and just structure. | would not know to say
tight now, whether or not this structure is the most beneficial to the state. The
bid evaluators will base their evaluation on the evaluation criteria. They will
not see if this would be a profit or a loss for the Government.” (Emphasis
added.),

(e) The financial evaluation team had been led, or misled, by Ageel to
use the 10/10/10 Calculation Method for the purpose of conferring an
undue advantage to the Claimant. This team was in fact that of the TES
(as confirmed by Ageel at RBD 2516).

(f) ~The 10/10/10 Calculation Method worked to provide the Claimant
with an advantage. By using the Claimant’s $0 proposal in the formula,

lad

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 149 of 263

all the other parties received 0 marks for the Work Permit category, as
follows:

Informatics 0 x 10 +5.90=0
Tris 0x 10+7.66=0
Dibena 0x10+15=0

Even if a party submitted a $0.01 bid, it would also receive 0 marks given
that 0 x 10+ 0.01 =0.

(g) Significantly, if the formula had been applied equally to the
Claimant, the Claimant would not have obtained 10 marks as there would
be a division by zero error [0 x 10 + 0 = 0]. Ageel would have known
about this error when he was awarding the marks for the Financial
Evaluation, as shown by the following two statements.

()  (AtRBD 2597-8):

“However, I believe that every party who submits the proposal must
know that the most marks will be given to the party who proposed the
lowest price in every category. While the proposal fee is divided into 3
categories, if there is no fee submission in one of these categories, it
means that either the party who submitted the proposal will provide
that particular service for free or they aren’t complying with those
criteria. Thus, if they have decided that they will provide the service
for free (if they have not proposed a fee for that service) then they will
receive full marks. However, while prorating marks for those parties
who did not impose a fee for the service (the fee of the service is 0), I
did not think before that by prorating full marks for those parties this
way, there could be a situation where the other parties who took part in
the bid might not get any marks. This is because the rest of the parties
wili be prorated from 0, However, during the long period | have
worked in the Tender Evaluation Section of the Ministry of Finance
and Treasury, | have not come across a situation where a part or a
service of the project was not charged.” (Emphasis added)

(ii) (At RBD 2599):

“After taking part in a “competitive bid” and if they propose to not
impose any fees, then in my opinion, they deserve full marks.”

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 150 of 263

“From the above extracts, it is therefore clear that although the formula
was applied to the other bidders, the same standard was not applied to
the Claimant’s submission of 0 marks for the Work Permit Fee and a
flat full marks was given notwithstanding that [Ageel] himself had
claimed that he had never seen a submission of a free component
before.” (see [192] of the Closing Submissions)

11. The Tribunal’s finding on the financial evaluation

The Tribunal finds on the evidence in the ACC Report that it was Ageel who
introduced, or was responsible for introducing, the 10/10/10 Calculation
Method to the TEB to evaluate the price bid. Ahmad Usham, Ismail Asif and
Zeeniya Ahmed stated in their ACC statements that, or to the effect that, it was
the Secretariat of the TEB, ie., Ageel, who submitted the proposal of
distributing the 40 marks equally into four parts at 10% each (at RBD 2584,
2589-90, 2602-6 respectively). They had merely made the evaluation on the
basis of the distribution of the marks. Anwar Ali named Ageel as the person
who originated the proposal to divide the 30% marks into three sub-criteria of
10% marks each. At RBD 2587 he states:
“The Secretariat of the Board Mr Samee Ageel submitted a way in which the marks
can be given to do the financial evaluation of the Maldives Border Control Project of
the [DOIE]. So, in giving marks to the price proposal, the committee passed to
distribute 40 marks equally to four parts that were allocated in the request for proposal
(RFP) for the financial evaluation, But | have not seen the REP of that project. Hence,
T do not know whether there is a specific standard categorized in giving marks to the
price proposal in RFP. I believe it was decided in the meeting that to distribute the
marks of the price proposal since the Secretariat appointed by the Ministry of Finance
to the Board decided to distribute the marks in that manner since the Tender

Evaluation Board believes that the documents submitted by the Secretariat were valid
document.”

In contrast, Ageel did not deny that he had proposed the 10/10/10 Calculation
Method by stating that he could not say who made it, and that he could only say
that the TEB decided unanimously to proceed with the price evaluation on that

basis. He tried to downplay the effect of using the formula by explaining that no

146

314.

315.

316.

317.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 151 of 263

bidder could have gained any unfair advantage unless it knew in advance what
the formula was, and that the TEB had no way of knowing the price bids of

bidders since it decided to use the formula before opening the bid documents.

The application of the 10/10/10 Calculation Method was also unfair or
erroneous because the Claimant was given the full 10 marks, and to the other
bidders 0 mark. Whatever price the other bids were, they must be entitled to

some marks out of 10 (see [311(f)] above).

The manner in which Agee] formed the second team, the amount of time given
to them to do the second evaluation, and the introduction of the 10/10/10
Calculation Method could give rise to the suspicion that Ageel had rigged the
bid process to ensure a successful outcome for the Claimant. There was an
interval of more than two months between the first evaluation and the second
evaluation which appeared to have been done in a day. He also did the
evaluation of the other three categories which the second team did not do.
However, even then, as against these negative aspects, the second team did give
the highest marks to the Claimant on the three (more significant) categories they

evaluated.

In the Tribunal’s view, such circumstantial evidence is not sufficient to prove
that Agee] had intentionally introduced the 10/10/10 Calculation Method in
order to confer an undue advantage on the Claimant. For the Claimant to obtain
an undue advantage in this respect, it would have to know that Ageel would be
introducing the 10/10/10 Calculation Method before the bids were submitted.

There is no such evidence.

(a) No evidence of intention to confer undue advantage
The outcome of the evaluations, in itself, does not justify the Tribunal to draw
an inference that there was an intention to benefit the Claimant. The
circumstances might be suspicious, but they are not sufficient for the Tribunal

147

318.

319.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 152 of 263

to infer that Ageel had rigged the financial evaluation in favour of the Claimant.
Circumstantial evidence has to inevitably and inexorably lead to the conclusion
of Ageel’s guilt. The circumstantial evidence must be compelling to eliminate
any other possibility. There is no evidence in the ACC Report to justify the
Tribunal to make such inferential fact against Agee!. The ACC did not appear to
have asked Ageel to explain why the second team did not have or was not given

enough time to do a full TE.

It is the Tribunal’s view that an offence under section 12 of the PPCA requires
mens rea, or guilty knowledge. It is not a strict liability offence. The acts must
be done intentionally or with knowledge of the probable outcome. The Tribunal
accepts the evidence of Munavvar, the Claimant’s Maldivian Law expert, that
mens rea could be based on inference, and that the threshold is that if the court
is of the view that the person “would have been aware of the consequences of
his actions” he then “possessed the knowledge or the intention of his unlawful

act” (see RCS [213]).

The Respondent’s case is that there was mens rea, and that it could be inferred
from the evidence against Ilyas and Ageel as recorded in the ACC Report. The
Tribunal is unable to accept this argument which is that Ageel has committed an
offence or offences under section 12 of the PPCA. The standard of proof under
Maldivian law is not on a balance of probabilities but that of beyond a
reasonable doubt. The criminal standard of proof cannot be discharged by
making inferences from the ACC findings against Ageel. Hearsay evidence is
admissible in arbitral proceedings, but its cogency depends on its reliability. A
high degree of reliability is required if the Tribunal is asked to find that a party
has committed an offence purely on hearsay evidence against him. Whichever
officer in the ACC who questioned Ageel should have testified on what kind of
questions he had asked Ageel. Furthermore, Ageel has a pending criminal

charge against him for an offence under section 12 of the PPCA. Unless there is

148

320.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 153 of 263

clear and cogent evidence that Ageel has committed an offence under section 12
of the PPCA, this Tribunal is not prepared to usurp the function of the

Maldivian courts in coming to such a conclusion.

12. Are offences under section 12 of the PPCA bribery and corruption
offences?

At [104]-[109] of its Closing Submissions, the Respondent argues that offences

under section 12 of the PPCA are bribery and corruption offences:

104. The [PPCA] is therefore the appropriate legislation put in place to combat
corruption at the national level in the Maldives. It is the Respondent’s case that
[Ilyas] and [Ageel], had acted in a manner which contravened the PPCA.
Specifically, both [of them] have been charged ...under [a] 12(a) of the PPCA.

105. In order to determine what constitutes corruption under Maldivian Law, the
[ACCA], as well as the PPCA, are instructive.

106. Section 23 of the ACCA provides that “corruption” refers to the offences set
out in the PPCA. This is not in dispute and has been agreed to by both the
Respondent and the Claimant, as can be seen in the Joint Statement of the Maldivian
Law Experts, at paragraph (i). The main purpose of the PPCA, as set out in its
preamble, is to (a) prevent and criminalize the offer and acceptance of bribery, and (b)
prevent and criminalize the attainment of undue benefit or the facilitation of
attainment of undue benefit through use of influence from position.

107. Section 12(a) of the PPCA states [text omitted]

108. It is clear that [s] 12(a) falls squarely within the definition of corruption. It
must therefore flow that if it is shown that the actions of Ageel and [Ilyas] fall within
[s] 12(a), then given that this is an act of corruption, public policy rules would apply
and the [CA] may not be upheld. To this end, Singapore law is not dissimilar.

109. Further, transnational public policies and mandatory laws should apply in
international arbitrations, notwithstanding the governing law of the contract.

110 While the definition of a mandatory law is not set in stone, the following two
explanations are illustrative of what a mandatory law should be. As considered by
Hwang, S.C. and Lim, mandatory laws are “imperative provisions of law which must
be applied to an international relationship irrespective of the law that governs that
relationship”.  Overriding mandatory provisions have also been defined to mean
norms “the respect for which is regarded as crucial by a country for safeguarding its

149

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 154 of 263

public interests, such as its political, social or economic organization, to such an
extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective
of the law otherwise applicable to the contract”. The law on corruption is such a law.
Corruption is an issue which would have the effect of pervading the society in a
country. National laws combating corruption therefore form the cornerstone in
providing for a stable society and economy.

111 As to the issue of transnational public policy, the Tribunal in World Duty Free
v Kenya commented, regarding the role of international arbitrators and allegations of
corruption in arbitration, that they (international arbitrators) may base their decisions
on transnational public policy, being the universal standards and accepted norms of
conduct that must be applied in all for a, and found that claims based on contracts of
corruption or contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld.

112 This has also been accepted with regards to investment treaty claims, which is
analogous to our present situation. Applying transnational public policies, Cosar
notes that “a claim arising from an investment tainted by illegality may be declared
inadmissible” and that “enforcing a contract obtained by wrongful means would be
contrary to the basic notion of international public policy”. Therefore, a tribunal
should not assist in upholding a contract which is tainted by corruption.

321. At [41], [42], [46]-[48] of its Skeletal Arguments, the Respondent contends:

4]. | The Claimant agrees that the real issue is illegality. It is illegal in the
Maldives to give an undue advantage. This false distinction by the Claimant that you
need to come within the “bribing” sections of the PPCA in order to succeed in
illegality has no basis.

42. Once an illegal act is shown to take place within the jurisdiction, one must
then turn to Singapore law on contract to determine the effect it has on the contract.
Under Singapore law, it can be avoided.

46. Where the contract is illegal or contrary to public policy by statute or common
law, state of mind is irrelevant [4RBA, Tab —4 at 13.119].

47. Even if intention is relevant (where there is no statutory or common law
illegality), Phang, citing Buckley, states that where only one party performs the
illegality, the innocent party is entitled to refuse to perform the contract and it does
not matter whether the “innocent” party learns of the contract and it does not matter
whether the “innocent” party learns of the scheme after the formation of the contract
[4RBA, Tab — 4 at 13.121].

150

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 155 of 263

48. Buckley contends however, that if this innocent party continues with the
performance, after acquisition of the relevant knowledge, he should forfeit any right
to contractual remuneration which might accrue [4RBA, Tab — 3].

13. The Claimant’s submissions on bribery and corruption

322. At[267]-[272] of its Closing Submissions, the Claimant contends:

267. In these proceedings, the Respondent particularised the so-called acts of
“corruption” which it says tainted the CA:-

a. The RFP deviated from the proposal that was initially approved by the
NPC: BP, Tab 10, [14];

b. When the EOI were evaluated, an additional category of “Capacity
building” was used as a criteria to evaluate the EOI, when it had not been
listed in the Invitation for EOI as a criteria for evaluation: BP, Tab 10, [14B];

c. When the technical bids were evaluated, it was not clear who had
carried out the evaluation for 3 out of 6 components: BP, Tab 10, [18]; and
da. When the financial bids were evaluated, instead of giving 30%

weightage for the visa fee and passenger fee as stated in the RFP, equal
weightage of 10% were given for each of the categories of passenger fee, visa
fee and work permit fee: BP, Tab 10, [19]; 2 IN [36].

268. According to the Claimant, these acts amounted to offences under sections 12
and 13 of the [PCCA]: Claimant’s Bundle of Authorities, Tab J.

269. Section 12 is the offence of gaining or conferring an undue advantage by a
government employee,

270. Section 13 is the offence of preventing the state from attaining an advantage.

271. Significantly, neither [s] 12 nor section 13 are bribery offences. Bribery
offences are set out at [ss] 2 to 9 of the PPCA.

272. The Respondent’s evidence was that “DOJE’s position is that the acts of

corruption which tainted the [CA] were committed by [Ilyas] and [Ageel]. DOIE is
not aware of any officials of [the Claimant] being directly involved in this.”

151

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 156 of 263

323. At {277}-[282], the Claimant contends:

277 The Respondent has not adduced any authority, Singaporean or Maldivian, for
the proposition that a contract can be set aside for being “tainted with corruption”
when that contract was not procured by bribery.

278 The Respondent’s Maldivian law expert, Mr Siraj, confirmed that there is no
Maldivian case where a contract was declared void solely on the ground that there
was a breach of [s]} 12, PPCA in connection with the making of the contract:
Transcripts, Day 6, p. 100-101. In other words, there is no Maldivian Law authority in
support of the Respondent’s assertion that the CA can be terminated for being “tainted
with corruption” in a case such as the present.

279 Mr Siraj also expressed the view that the government cannot terminate a
contract just because one of its government servants had committed an act of
corruption: Transcripts, Day 6, p. 109-110,

280 In fact, Mr Siraj agreed that “the government cannot terminate a contract just
because its own internal processes were not followed”: Transcripts, Day 6, p. 108,
line 18 to p.109, line 2. This is consistent with the AGO’s opinion given on 17 April
2011, where it stated that the lapses in the Respondent’s internal processes were not a
basis to terminate the CA, even though “it is in the government’s discretion to
sanction the person responsible for acting in contravention of the established
procedure”: 3 CHB 1691 at [21].

281 The Respondent, in its pleaded case, has not alleged that the Claimant was
involved in any of these lapses of the Respondent's internal processes. According to
it, [Ilyas] and [Ageel] were the only persons responsible for the lapses in the
Respondent’s internal processes. Effectively, the Respondent is attempting to
terminate the CA on the basis that its internal processes were not followed. However,
according to its own expert witness, it is not permissible for the Respondent to do
that.

282 Given that the Respondent has not provided a legal basis for the termination of
the CA on the ground that tit was “tainted with corruption”, it is unclear if the
Respondent is pursuing this line of its defence and counterclaim.

324. At[61]-[63] of the Claimant’s Reply Submissions, the Claimant contends:

61 At [277] to [282], CCS, the Claimant submitted that the Respondent had not
adduced any legal authority for the proposition that the Respondent could set aside the
CA for being “tainted with corruption” when that contract was not procured by
bribery, and where the Claimant was not involved in any corrupt act.

152

325.

326.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 157 of 263

62. Even in the RCS, the Respondent has failed to unpack what “tainted with
corruption” means, and has not elucidated any legal principle on which it can be said
that a contract can be set aside for being “tainted with corruption”.

63. In this section we:
a. Set out the law on when a contract can be avoided for corruption; and

b. Show that the authorities cited by the Respondent do not stand for the
proposition that the CA can be set aside even when it was not procured by bribery,
and where the Claimant did not commit any corrupt act.

At [64]-[97],*” the Claimant discussed the law on this issue.

14. The Tribunal’s discussion on bribery and corruption

The Tribunal has considered the arguments of the Parties and also the copious
citations of authority on this issue. The Tribunal agrees to the principles of law
set out at [76]-[79] of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions as follows:
76 In PT International Nickel Indonesia v General Trading Corp (M) Sdn Bhd
[1977 — 1978] SLR(R) 58 , the Singapore Court of Appeal, in the context of a
summary judgment application, considered what would be the contractual

implications if the defendant-appellant was able to prove its allegations that the
plaintiff-respondent had procured its 35 contracts with the appellant by bribery.

77 The Court of Appeal held at [13] and [23] that:-

“Every contract made or act done by an agent under the influence of bribery,
or, to the knowledge of the other contracting party, in violation of his duty to
his principal, is voidable by the principal”

“Tt is clear law that the contract between the briber and the recipient of the

bribe is an illegal contract and it cannot form the basis of a claim before the
courts.”

78 In other words, to avoid the CA vis-a-vis the Claimant, the Respondent must
show either:-
a. That the Claimant bribed its government officials, which were its agents; or

153

327.

328.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 158 of 263

b. The government officials were violating their duties to it, and this was
known to the Claimant.

719 There is no principle in Singapore law that a principal may avoid a contract
where an agent has, unknown to the third party, conferred an undue advantage on the
third party, by failing to follow its own internal procedures.

The Tribunal is of the view that offences under section 12 and section 13 of the
PPCA are not bribery offences, and are not “corruption” offences since these
specific offences have been provided for in other sections of the PPCA. A
section 12 offence does not involve and does not require the public officer to do
a favour to a third party in exchange for a gratification from the third party. A
true bribery or corruption offence involves a giver and a taker. Such acts when
committed on a large scale damage the economy of a country, injure efficiency
in government, and ultimately damage the welfare of the state and the people.
Hence, they are universally condemned and proscribed. The offences under
sections 12 and 13 of the PPCA are of a different nature. They are essentially
acts or omissions of public servants in failing to protect or advance the interest
of the state, to obtain a gain or prevent a loss to the state. No gratification is
required to commit a section12 offence. Any economic Joss or gain to the state
through a failure to discharge a public duty is sufficient. The PPCA clearly
makes a distinction between the two types of offences. However, an offence
under section 12 of the PPCA impacts on the legality of any contract entered
into with knowledge of the commission of such an offence. A contract tainted
with illegality is also unenforceable if the claimant obtained the contract with
knowledge that it is illegal for the other party to enter into the contract with it.
Hence, instead of pleading that the CA was tainted with corruption, the
Respondent should have pleaded that it was tainted with illegality, accordingly

it is voidable and liable to be set aside.

On this analysis, the issue is therefore, as submitted by the Respondent one of

illegality in connection with the commission of an offence under section 12 of

154

329.

330.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 159 of 263

the PPCA. The Respondent argues that yas and/or Agee! had committed
offences under section 12 of the PPCA, and that is enough to taint the CA with
“corruption” in the sense used by the Respondent. The Respondent has not
alleged, nor is there any evidence in the ACC Report to show, that either Ilyas
or Ageel had received any gratification for conferring or taking actions with a
view to conferring an undue advantage on the Claimant. The Respondent’s case
is based on Ilyas and/or Agee! having committed offences under section 12 of
the PPCA.

The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not produced sufficient evidence to
show that either Ilyas or Ageel has committed any section 12 PPCA offence.
Furthermore, the Tribunal also finds that there is no evidence in the ACC
Report to show or from which the Tribunal may infer that the Claimant was

privy to any unlawful act committed by Ilyas or Ageel.

(a) The mystery of the 290710 Draft
In this connection, the Tribunal would refer to the mystery of the 290710 Draft.
The Tribunal has earlier found as a fact that the Claimant had prepared this
draft, even though its factual witness had denied it when questioned." At
[164.1] of its Reply Submissions, the Respondent observes:
164.1. Firstly, the document is marked “Draft 290710” at the top, very likely 29 July
2010. This was a time when the price bids had not even been opened by the
Respondent and it would not have prepared a draft with the Claimant’s name. It is
slightly intriguing to see that the Claimant was so certain at that point of time that it
would be awarded the tender and had started drafting the agreement between the
Respondent, its potential subsidiary and itself.
Beyond observing that the time when the 290710 Draft was intriguing, the
Respondent has made no submission on its relevance or significance as a piece

of evidence to support its defence.

155

331.

332.

334.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 160 of 263

The Respondent has not gone beyond making this submission to argue that the
Claimant could not have been so certain unless it had been informed by Ilyas
and/or Ageel that the MIBCS Project would be rigged in favour of the Claimant.
The fact that the Claimant had drafted the 290710 Draft before the TE is a
matter that should have called for an explanation. There is nothing in the ACC
Report to suggest that the ACC saw any significance in the date of the 290710
Draft as neither Abdullah Waheed nor Afeef (who had discussed the 290710
Draft on “7/10”) is recorded by the ACC to have said anything on how, when or
why they were given the 290710 Draft. It would appear that the ACC did not
pay any particular attention to the anomaly of the Claimant having prepared the
290710 Draft, even before the MIBCS Project was awarded to it.

In the absence of any findings by the ACC, the Tribunal is not in a position to
investigate this issue solely on the basis of the ACC Report. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not produced any or
sufficient evidence to show that Ilyas and/or Ageel had committed offences
under section 12 of the PPCA. It follows that there is no evidence that the CA

was tainted with illegality or corruption in the sense used by the Respondent.

On the evidence of the ACC Report, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence
that the Claimant was privy to or had knowledge of their misconduct or
impropriety when it signed the CA on 17 October 2012. There is insufficient
evidence to show that the Claimant had prior knowledge that Ageel and/or had
committed any offence under Maldivian law in relation to the evaluation of the

technical and price bids for the MIBCS Project.

15. Are “administrative contracts” under Maldivian law different from
ordinary contracts?

At [21]-[30] of it Closing Submissions, the Respondent also contends that

Maldives has a distinctive and unique form of contract called an “administrative

contract” that is different from the normal civil contract. This form of contract
was referred to the Supreme Court of the Maldives in Case No. 2012/SC-A/26
(English translation at Vol E, Bundle of Maldivian law authorities at [556], and
that the Claimant’s Maldivian Law Expert, Munavvar, had also confirmed this
distinction between administrative contracts and civil contracts [Transcripts,
Day 8, 15 October 2015, page 163, lines 4 to 20]). The second part of this
assertion is not correct as Munavvar only conceded, when questioned on it, that
the Supreme Court had “tried to distinguish between administrative contracts

and civil contracts”.

In Case No. 2012/SC-A/26, three members of the court (the other two did not

join in this opinion) made the following statements at [561-562]:

(g) Seventh point: In an investigation conducted by the [ACC] regarding the [CA]
executed between [Respondent] and [Claimant] on 17 October 2010 to establish a
border control system in Maldives, the ACC, nothing that there were elements of
corruption involved, on 24 January 2011 ordered that if the work regarding the Border
Contro! System is to be continued further, it should be submitted to the [NPC] or
Cabinet of Ministers, and an RFP must be prepared in accordance with the [NPC] or
Cabinet of Ministers decisions and should be re-submitted to the bidding process.
However, after this, the Cabinet of Ministers at the meeting of 18 October 2011
decided to carry on the [CA] to establish the [MIBCS Project] and this decision was
published in the 31 October 2011 issue of the Government Gazette. It is thus clear that
the decision to carry on the [CA] was made after the order given by the ACC’s letter
[of 24 January 201 1] based on the decision of the Cabinet, and where one of the three
arms of the State, the Government had decided to carry on the [CA], it can only be
decided otherwise by a decision of the Cabinet or a Court. The validity of the [CA] in
question has not been challenged in a court of law claiming that it contravenes a
statute or regulation in force and the [CA] had not been declared void by any court of
law.

(h) Eighth point: Where a “public law” institution of the state, that is, the State or
a State institution or a body contracts with a private party or private company to
manage public utilities of the State or public services, such administrative contracts
for the benefit of the society or the public interest are entered into by the State and a
private party acting in its own personal interest. Such administrative contracts are not
between parties having the same interest, and therefore unlike a civil contract between
private parties acting in their own interest, in such administrative contracts the

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 162 of 263

principle of Pacta Sun Servanda, freedom of contract between parties, is not without
limitation and is not absolute. In administrative contracts, in matters such as when the
State or the relevant State’s institution chooses a contracting party, restrictions
imposed by public law such as administrative law and public finance laws must be

plied with. Such administrati include ion agi supply
contracts, and contracts for public works and in such a contract, the State which is
party to the contract or the State entity party to the contract has rights and privileges
in amending the terms of the contract, monitoring the implementation of the contract
and taking required measures in relation to contract implementation, and in such
contracts, the State which is party to the contract or the State entity party to the
contract also has rights and powers as the unilateral termination of the contract at its
own discretion. (Emphasis added)

 

It is not disputed that the CA is an administrative contract in the sense used by
the majority judges of the Supreme Court. However, the judges’ statement (in
bold) does not say that under Maldivian law, the State has an absolute right to
terminate such contract unilaterally free from any claim for damages for breach
of contract by the other party to the contract. It would be surprising if the three
judges had intended to lay down such a principle in the light of the Maldivian
Law of Contract Law No 4/91, section 20(a) and section 23(c) of which provide
as follows:

[20(a)] — A party to a contract must perform his obligations in accordance with the

terms of the contract

[23(a)] - A party who commits a breach of contract shall be liable in damages for the
loss arising from such breach.

In the Tribunal’s view, such is not the law of Singapore, the governing law of
the CA. At the highest, it might be argued that under Maldivian law, if the State
were to unilaterally terminate an administrative contract, the innocent party
would not be entitled to specific performance of the contract as that would be
contrary to the nature of an administrative contract as understood by the three

Supreme Court judges.

For these reasons, the Tribunal is unable to see how the statement of the
majority judgment of the Supreme Court in Case No. 2012/SC-A/26 that the
Respondent has the right to terminate unilaterally at its discretion an

158

339.

340.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 163 of 263

administrative contract has any bearing on the claim by the Claimant for
compensation or damages for wrongful termination of the CA by the

Respondent.

16. Finding of the Tribunal

For the reasons given above, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent was in

breach of contract in repudiating the CA on 5 August 2013.

F. SUMMARY OF THE TRIBUNAL’S FINDINGS ON THE DISPUTED ISSUES

The findings of the Tribunal on the disputed issues are restated below.

1 Frustration Issue

The CA was not frustrated by the Parliament approving the recommendations of
the Finance Committee and the Budget Review Committee to terminate the CA
as the approvals did not absolve the Respondent from having to, or make it
illegal for the Respondent, to perform its contractual obligations under the CA
(at [150]-[172] above).

2 Insolvency Issue under clause 11.1.1 of the CA

(a) The Respondent failed to prove that the Claimant was in breach of its
obligations under clause 11.1 of the CA before and after 5 August 2013 which
would have entitled the Respondent to terminate the CA under clause 11.1.1(ii)
thereof, and

(b) If the Respondent had been entitled to give, and had given, notice of
termination under clause 11.1.1(iv), the Claimant would have been able to

remedy the breach within the time specified therein (at [197]-[198] above).

159

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 164 of 263

3 Damages Issue

(a) Alternative A claim

The Claimant is not entitled to claim liquidated damages comprising of: (a) the
value of completed works; and (b) liquidated damages arising from the loss of
revenue under clause 12.3 of the CA as the clause is a penalty provision (see
[211] above). Reducing the amount of the claim by discounting the value to the
present date does not erase its character as a penalty. It is merely a discounted

penalty (see [213]-[214] above).

(6) Alternative B claim

The Claimant is entitled to claim common law damages against the Respondent
at the agreed sum of either US$15,200,000 (at US$2 per passenger) or
US$37,000,000 (at US$4 per passenger),.(at [298] above), as the case may be,

subject to the Tribunal’s finding on entitlement set out at (e) below.

(c) Claim for invoiced amounts

The Claimant is entitled to claim the amounts set out in the invoices and is
entitled to be paid the total sum of either (i) US$1,885,654 (at US$2 per
passenger) or (ii) US$3,771,308 (at US$4 per passenger) (at [223]-[224] above).

(d) The Claimant failed to prove agreement to revise financial bid

The Claimant has failed to prove an agreement to revise the financial bid. The
Claimant has failed to discharge the burden of proving that the Respondent
agreed to revise the Claimant’s financial bid of US$2 per passenger to US$4 per
passenger (see [340] above).

(e) The Claimant is entitled to charge a fee of only US$2 per passenger

The Claimant is entitled to charge a fee of only US$2 per passenger (in and out)
or arriving into and Jeaving the Maldives (at [341]-[342] above).

160

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 165 of 263

@Q = The Claimant’s claim for damages not limited to voluntary
administration

The damages payable to the Claimant are not limited to the date when it entered

into voluntary administration (see [347]-[350] above).

4 The Corruption Issue
(a) Conduct of Ilyas in technical evaluations

On the evidence of the ACC Report, Ilyas had not done any act to further the
cause of the Claimant at the second TE (at [305 above).

(b) The Claimant was not privy to technical evaluations
The Respondent has also not produced any evidence that the Claimant was in
any way privy to or had prior knowledge of the manner in which the first and

second TEs were done (at [306] above).

(c) Conduct of Ageel

The Respondent has not produced any or sufficient evidence of any improper
conduct on the part of Ageel in relation to the financial evaluation that could
have tainted the decision to award the MIBCS Project to the Claimant in this
respect (see [307]) above).

(4) CA not voidable as not tainted with illegality (“corruption”)

The CA was not tainted with illegality under the PPCA arising from the conduct
of either Ilyas or Ageel as the Respondent had not produced any or any
sufficient evidence to show that Ilyas or Ageel had intentionally conferred an
undue advantage to the Claimant under section 12 of the PPCC (see [329]

above).

161

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 166 of 263

(e) The Claimant was not privy to financial evaluation

The Respondent has not produced any sufficient evidence that the Claimant was
in any way privy to or had prior knowledge of the manner in which the financial
evaluation was to be done before it submitted its price bid, or that the Claimant

was privy to any unlawful act committed by Ilyas or Ageel (see [329] above).

G. COSTS OF AND IN THE ARBITRATION - PRINCIPLES
1. The Claimant’s submissions

341. The Claimant’s submissions are as follows.

(a) If it succeeds in any part of its claim against the Respondent, it is
entitled to its full legal costs, as well as the costs of the Tribunal and the
administration fees of the SIAC - consistent with the SIAC Rules as well
as the international trend in awarding costs in arbitrations.

(b) Under Rules 31 and 33 of the SIAC Rules, the Tribunal has wide
discretion to decide on the allocation of costs.

(c) In international arbitrations, the emerging trend is for the
arbitration tribunal to order the losing party to pay ail or the substantial
part of the costs of the arbitration: see Mistelis, Loukas A. Comparative
International Commercial Arbitration, at [24-82].

(d) Legal costs normally include the costs of legal representation in the
arbitration proceedings as well as the expenses of the legal teams for
preparing the case and advising the parties: see Mistelis, at [24-84]. Legal
costs incurred prior to the arbitration proceedings are not recoverable, but
legal costs incurred in the preparation of arbitration proceedings would be
recoverable,

2. The Respondent’s submissions

342. The Respondent’s submission are as follows.

(a) In Singapore, the incidence of costs in civil litigation is governed
by the “indemnity principle”, i.e., that an unsuccessful party would

162

343,

344.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 167 of 263

generally be ordered to pay the successful party’s reasonable litigation
costs. The indemnity principle is subject to the court’s overriding
discretion. Underlying the indemnity principle, costs are generally
imposed to compensate the successful party, rather than to punish the
losing party. The indemnity principle extends only to costs reasonably
incurred, rather than to all costs incurred.

(b) Applying the principle of proportionality, the Tribunal should have
regard to the issues that are in dispute and consider which party has
prevailed on which issue(s), in determining what costs the successful
party should be entitled to.

(c) The Claimant’s submission at [341(a)] is unreasonable. Even if the
Claimant succeeds completely in its claim, it does not follow that the
Claimant should be awarded all of its legal costs: see Trans Eurokars v
Koh Wee Meng [2015] SGHCR 6, and authorities cited therein.

3. The Tribunal’s views
Rules 31 and 33 of the SIAC Rules are expressed in general language. The two
rules provide as follows:

‘31 ...unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the Tribunal shall determine in the
award the apportionment of the costs of the arbitration among the parties.”

“33 The Tribunal shal] have the authority to order in its award that all or a part of
the legal or other costs of a party be paid by another party.”

Implicit in these two Rules is the Tribunal’s power to award costs in its
discretion. Neither Rule tells the Tribunal how to do it or what principles it
should apply to apportion the costs or to order one party to pay the costs of the
other party. Both Rules assume that there are already generally accepted or
established principles. In arbitrations under English law, English courts have
decided that arbitral tribunals should follow the principles for determining costs
in litigation, and that an arbitral tribunal cannot do what a judge cannot do in

awarding costs, subject to any express agreement of the parties or the

163

345.

346.

347.

348.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 168 of 263

institutional or national rules governing the arbitration. Singapore courts

generally follow the English practice.

On this basis, the Tribunal’s power to determine and award costs in the
arbitration is not absolute, and must be exercised judiciously, i.e., fairly and
reasonably, having regard to, inter alia, (a) the issues of fact and/or law raised
by the parties to the dispute; (b) their number and complexity; (c) the duration
of the hearing; (d) the size of the legal representation; and (d) the conduct of the
parties (or their counsel) in prolonging the hearing by making unnecessary

procedural applications and/or objections.

The underlying principle is costs follow the event, but in a complicated case
with many issues of law and/or fact, the Tribunal may allocate costs between
the parties that fairly represent their entitlement to reasonable costs based on the
outcome of the dispute, and also, if appropriate, the legal and factual issues on
which a party may have succeeded (as Rule 33 provides). As a general rule, the

Tribunal should only award legal fees that are not unreasonably incurred.

The general approach which tribunals in common law jurisdictions apply is that
“costs follow the event”. It means that the successful party is entitled to be paid
its costs by the other party on an indemnity basis. The application of this
principle is very much within the authority of the tribunal to apply under the

SIAC Rules, unless the Parties have expressly agreed not to apply it.

That is the starting position when there are few issues in dispute. However,
where the dispute involves numerous issues of law and fact, which may vary in
complexity, the tribunal may adopt a nuanced approach that takes into account
the complexity of the issues and their outcomes, and not solely on the outcome
of the claim or counterclaim, as the case may be. In this connection, it is
pertinent to note that section 19A(2) of the IAA also provides that the arbitral

tribunal may make an award relating to an issue affecting the whole claim or a

164

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 169 of 263

part only of the claim, counterclaim or cross-claim which is submitted for its

decision.

349. However, notwithstanding the generality of the SIAC Rules, they cannot be
read to authorize the Tribunal to award legal and related costs incurred by a
successful party prior to the commencement of the arbitration. Such costs
cannot be considered as costs in the arbitration, unless they are incurred directly
in connection with or for the purpose of the arbitration proceedings, i.e., its
commencement or response.

4, The Parties’ claims

350. The Claimant claims legal costs and disbursements incurred from 27 January
2015 onwards, totaling $$1,657,729.91 as follows -

(a) $$1,355,392.27 as the legal costs of Singapore counsel.
(b) $$105,070.48 for Maldivian legal counsel.

(c) §$156,031.82 for expert witnesses.

(d) S$41,235.34 for other miscellaneous expenses.
351. The Respondent claims legal costs and disbursements totaling S$1,252,340.18
as follows -
(a) $$500,000 + S$35,000 GST as legal costs on a time basis for
Singapore counsel, which is less than 40% the Claimant’s claims for its

Singapore counsel.

(b) $$353,870.90 as arbitration costs (advanced deposits, hearing room
and transcription fees.

(c) $306,706.51 for expert witnesses (legal and financial).

(d) | $$56,762.77 for other miscellaneous expenses

5. Discussion

As a starting point, the Claimant has succeeded in its claim against the
Respondent (which means that the Respondent’s counterclaim has also failed as
it was based on the same issues of fact and law), the Claimant is therefore
entitled to the costs of and in the arbitration. The Claimant’s claim was a simple
claim for breach of contract. The Respondent mounted a complicated defence
under many different heads, all of which the Claimant contested. As the
Respondent has succeeded in some of these issues, it had contested certain
heads of cost-claims of the Claimant as well as their quantum. These objections

will now be discussed.

(a) Pre-arbitration costs and disbursements
The Claimant commenced arbitration on 9 January 2014, and has claimed pre-
arbitration legal costs of S$$298,160.22 (Annex B) incurred from September
2011 to August 2013 for M/s Suood & Anwar (“S&A”), its Maldivian legal
counsel, in intervening in various court proceedings commenced by the ACC to
prevent the CA from being unlawfully terminated. The Respondent argues that
as these costs are not related to the arbitration proceedings, they cannot be

claimed as arbitration costs.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s submission. Pre-arbitration costs
may not be claimed in the arbitration. However, preparatory legal work may be
claimed. But, if such costs involved getting up on the law or the facts for such
work are claimed, then in principle, they cannot be claimed all over again, but
only partially on a refresher basis, as the arbitration progresses. Furthermore,

there cannot be too many refresher claims for costs.

The same analysis applies to the pre-arbitration costs of the Claimant’s legal
counsel, R&D, incurred between May 2011 and Dec 2013 amounting to
$$100,000 and $$1,575.81. These two items form part of the bill of costs

166

356.

357.

358.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 171 of 263

$$3 19,868.68 rendered by R&D for work done from May 2011 and 27 January
2015 when they ceased acting for the Claimant.

(b) Legal costs of Rodyk & Davidson

The Claimant has claimed post-arbitration legal fees of S$216,000 paid to R&D
up to 27 January 2015. The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s costs have
been unnecessarily incurred by changing lawyers in mid-stream on 27 January
2015. In principle, the Tribunal accepts that there is merit in this argument. If
R&D had continued to act in this arbitration, the new lawyers, PLA, would not
have had to do the same work all over again. R&D has charged legal fees of
$$150,000 for work done up to 27 January 2015. What is the value of the work
duplicated by PLA that should be disallowed? The Respondent has not assisted
the Tribunal to assess the avoidable added costs. In the circumstances, the
Tribunal considers a deduction of S$100,000 reasonable as avoidable costs. The
sum of S$100,000 should be deducted from the costs of PLA.

(©) Legal costs of Suood & Anwar
The Respondent objects to the Claimant’s claim for $$105,070.48 paid for the
services of its Maldivian lawyers, S&A, on the ground that it is excessive as it is
only 10 pages long and that the annexes were merely write-ups of the cases in
which represented the Claimant in the Maldivian court proceedings. Moreover,
S&A’s fees are disproportionate when compared with Munavvar’s fees of

$$18,803.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s submission. Suood’s witness
statement is merely an account in English of the 13 proceedings before the
Maldivian courts. This evidence, although useful as background, had marginal
relevance to the disputed issues before the Tribunal. Suood was essentially a
factual witness. In the Tribunal’s view, the claim for Suood’s fee is manifestly

excessive. The Tribunal considers a reasonable fee to be $$10,000.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 172 of 263

(d) Costs of the Claimant’s Singapore legal counsel

The bulk of the costs claimed in the arbitration by the Claimant is for legal fees
and expenses paid and/or payable to its Singapore legal counsel: (a) S$216,000
for R&D up to 27 January 2015, and (b) S$1,043,392.20 for PLA from 27
January 2015 until the date of the oral hearing on 5 October 2015, the filing of
the Claimant’s Cost Submissions on 24 March 2016, and the oral hearing on 30
March 2016.

The total time spent by PLA on the case from 27 January 2015 up to the oral
hearing on 30 March 2016 is approximately 1,662.1 hours made up as follows:

(a) | Until 27 March 2015 - 151 hours, 3 lawyers

(b) Until 30 April 2015 - 45.2 hours, 3 lawyers (excluding legal
support)

(c) Until 31 May 2015 - 59.9 hours, 3 lawyers (excluding legal
support)

(d) Until 30 June 2015 - 75.7 hours, 3 counsel (excluding legal
support)

(e) Until 31 August 2015 - 397.2 hours, 2 counsel (excluding legal
support)

(f) Until 16 October 2015 - 639.4 hours, 3 counsel (excluding legal
support), including attendance at hearing on 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14,
15 October 2015

(g) Until 30 December 2015 - 116.9 hours, 2 counsel (excluding legal
support)

(h) Until 4 Feb 2016 - 129.8 hours, 2 counsel (excluding legal support)

(i) — Until 30 March 2016 - 40 hours prep work + full day hearing of 7
hours (estimated)

The average charging rate of PLA per lawyer/counsel is S$628 per hour. PLA’s
Jegal work was done by a group of 3 lawyers and 3 counsel whose hourly rates
of charge have not been disclosed. It is reasonable to assume that the precedent

counsel or partner wil] charge more than the others on a descending scale. At

168

362.

363.

364.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 173 of 263

the hearing itself, the Claimant was represented by one precedent counsel and

two junior counsel/lawyers.

In contrast, the Respondent has only claimed time costs totaling S$500,000 for
one precedent counsel and two counsel/lawyers. The Tribunal does not know
how many hours they have spent on the case. At a comparable hourly charge of
$$628 per hour, the Respondent’s counsel would have spent about 796 hours on
the case as compared with the Claimant’s counsel of 1,662.1 hours, slightly

more than 40% of the time spent by the latter.

As pleaded, the Claimant’s claim against the Respondent is a standard claim for
damages for breach of contract: (a) damages for delaying the implementation of
the CA, (b) payment of the invoiced amounts for work done, and (c) future loss
for repudiating the CA. Claim (a) was withdrawn after the closure of the

proceedings.

As pleaded, the Respondent’s defence and counterclaim raised more complex

issues of:
() lack of jurisdiction,
(2) corrupt agreement and/or illegality under Maldivian law,
(3) recognition of illegality under Singapore law,

(4) ultra vires due to Ilyas’ lack of authority in signing the CA,
(5) national security and public interest considerations,
(6) insolvency of the Claimant, and

(7) frustration of the CA arising from the Maldivian Parliament
passing the annual budget recommendations of the Budget Review
Committee.

366.

367.

368.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 174 of 263

The Respondent abandoned or withdrew defences (1), (3), (4) and (5) at various
stages of the proceedings. As a result, the final contested issues were narrowed
down to (2), (6), (7) and the quantum of damages. What is significant about the
abandoned/withdrawn issues, and the contested issues is that all of them were
issues of law, except for (6) which involved issues of financial facts. As can be
seen from the Tribunal’s findings, the Tribunal has decided all these issues on
the documents disclosed by the Parties in the proceedings, especially the ACC

Report and the statement of accounts of the Claimant.

Although both Parties called witnesses to testify on the basis of their witness
statements, their oral evidence had no material impact on the Tribunal’s
findings on the legal issues. Similarly, although the Parties filed expert evidence
on the quantum of damages claimed or entitled to claim, ultimately the Parties’
financial experts were able to agree on the quantum of damages, depending on
whether the Claimant was entitled to a US$2 or US$4 fee for each foreign
visitor to the Maldives under the CA.

Against this background, there is some merit in the Respondent’s argument that
the Claimant’s claim for legal fees is disproportionate, unreasonable and
unnecessary for the disposal of the issues raised by the Respondent, including
those issues that were abandoned/withdrawn. The Respondent had a much more
difficult case to disprove the Claimant’s case by way of defence. The laws on
frustration, illegality, the nature of bribery or corruption, the standard of proof
of criminal conduct, liquidated damages and penal damages and insolvency
under Singapore law are well established. In so far as Maldivian law is based on

English case Jaw, the legal principles are also well established.

The Claimant is entitled to claim costs on the four abandoned/withdrawn
defences. Some were withdrawn earlier than others. The issues of law raised by

these defences were predicated on facts on which there was no evidence. Hence,

170

369.

370.

372.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 175 of 263

they were withdrawn. The Tribunal assesses the total costs payable to the
Claimant on these abandoned these defences to be $$200,000.

The Claimant is entitled to claim costs on the failed defences (2), (6), (7). The
Tribunal assesses the Claimant’s counsel’s costs as $$600,000, i.e., S$200,000

for each defence.

However, the Claimant did not succeed in all the legal issues arising from the
abandoned and failed defences. The Claimant was not successful on the

following issues where it:

(a) _ withdrew its claim for damages alleged to have been caused by the
Respondent’s delay or failure to expedite the implementation of the
MIBCS Project;

(b) failed in its Alternative A claim;

(c) _ failed in its claim for damages based on US$4 per foreign visitor to
the Maldives.
The Respondent is entitled to claim a deductions of the costs it has incurred
with respect to these issues by way of set-off against the Claimant’s costs as set
out at [368] above. The Tribunal estimates the total costs to be $$200,000.

On the basis of [356]-[357], [368]-[369], the Claimant is entitled to claim the

following legal costs:

(a) $$150,000 — R&D’s legal fees (at [356] above)
(b) $$10,000 being Suood’s fees (at [357] above)
(c) $$200,000 (at [368] above)
(d) —$$600,000 (at [369] above)

383. The Respondent's Financial Expert had observed at [9.61] of [Volume D of the
Bundle of Respondent’s Expert Reports (Vol 1 of 2), Tab LQS-3, Pages 58 to 60]
(“{LQS1WS)’) that:

“A. Financial and Solvency Position

I note from the balance sheet as at 30 June 2013 that:

175

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 180 of 263

 

a. Nexbis had net assets amounting to A$61.3m (total assets of A$61.9m less total
liabilities of A$0.59m);

b, Nexbis’ had neither intangible asset, property, plant & equipment, trade receivable
nor trade payable. Instead, the main assets of Nexbis comprised a sum of A$2.9m due from
ASN and a sum of A$59m due from NSA only.”

384. Additionally, the Respondent’s Financial Expert observed that :

384.1. The Claimant was dormant: - There was no revenue generated ([9.64(a)], and the
Claimant was not trading as there were no trade receivables or payables ([9.64(c)].

384.2. The Claimant had no assets: - There was no investments or intangible assets recorded
in its balance sheet. ([9.64(b) & (d)].

384.3. The Claimant was making a loss: - Operating expenses of A$0.9m were incurred
despite Nexbis being dormant, with directors’ fees of A$0.5m and business entertainment of
A$0.11m being the major operating expenses ([9.64(e)].

385. The Respondent's Financial Expert was of the view that:

385.1. The debt owed by ASN should be set off: - ASN Solutions Sdn Bhd (“ASN”) had
already incurred expenses of A$3.9m on 30 June 2013, on behalf of the Claimant, and this
sum should have been set off against the sum of A$2.9m that ASN owed the Claimant. This
would result in the Claimant owing ASN A$lm. The Respondent's Financial Expert stated
that it appeared that the Claimant “would not be able to settle the aforesaid sum. In 2014, the
sum due to ASN increased to A$1.7m before Nexbis went into voluntary administration.”

385.2. The debt owed by NSA should be written off: - The sum of A$59m that NSA
Solutions Sdn Bhd (“NSA”) owed the Claimant should have been written off as at 30 June
2013 as the prospect of recovering the amount due could already be doubtful on that date due
to NSA’s poor financial position. The Respondent's Financial Expert stated that:

“[b]ased on NSA’s Audited Financial Statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2013, |
note that NSA was in a net current liability position of RM149.1m (A$51.6m), ie. its current
liabilities of RM156m (A$54m) were more than its current assets of RM6.9m (A$2.39m) Its
main asset (non-current) was an investment in an associate with net book value of RM174m
(A$60.2im) as at 30 June 2013. In this regard, J note that the receivable of A$59m due from
NSA was written off entirely as at 30 June 2014, In view of the foregoing, it appears that the
prospect of recovering the amount due from NSA could already be doubtful as at 30 June
2013.”. ([9.64(h)].

386. Therefore, the Respondent’s Financial Expert had concluded (at [9.64] of [Volume D

of the Bundle of Respondent’s Expert Reports (Vol 1 of 2), Tab LQS-3, Pages 58 to 60]) that
the Claimant was insolvent by A$1.58m as at 30 June 2013:

387. At [9.65] of [LQSIWS], the Respondent's Financial Expert stated “[bJased on the
above adjusted Nexbis’ balance sheet, there is a sum of A$1m “due to ASN” after the “set-
off? of A$2.9m. It appears that Nexbis would not be able to settle the aforesaid sum. In 2014,
the sum due to ASN increased to A$1.7m before Nexbis went into voluntary administration.”

388. Furthermore, after reviewing the Claimant’s Factual Witness’ 3rd Witness Statement
that was filed in response to the Respondent’s Financial Expert’s report, the Respondent’s
Financial Expert has since (in his second witness statement dated 10 October 2015 [Vol D,
Bundle of Respondent’s Expert Reports (Vol. 2)] further opined at Page,21, [11.16] that the
A$59m NSA debt would have been written off on 5 July 2013. This is because by utilising
the “prudence” accounting principle that the Claimant’s Factual Witness advocated in his 3rd
Witness Statement, the amount due of A$59m due from NSA would have been written off on
5 July 2013 when all the Claimant’s restructuring efforts were complete, thereby causing the
Claimant to become insolvent on that date.

389. It is submitted that the above write-off / set-off is justified the Claimant was never
going to recover these sums of money. As set out earlier, in Joanne Marie Bucci v Russell

John Carman, Lord Justice Lewison stated at [27]:

“In my judgment the following points emerge from the decision of the Supreme Court
in Eurosail (and in particular the judgment of Lord Walker):

177

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 182 of 263

 

iii) The cash-flow test and the balance sheet test stand side by side: para [35]. The
balance sheet test, especially when applied to contingent and prospective liabilities is
not a mechanical test: para [30]. The express reference to assets and liabilities is a
practical recognition that once the court has to move beyond the reasonably near
future any attempt to apply a cash-flow test will become completely speculative and a
comparison of present assets with present and future liabilities (discounted for
contingencies and deferment) becomes the only sensible test: para [37].

iv) But it is very far from an exact test: para [37]. Whether the balance sheet test
is satisfied depends on the available evid as to the ci of the particul
case: para [38]. It requires the court to make a judgment whether it has been
established that, looking at the company’s assets and making proper allowance for its
prospective and contingent liabilities, it cannot reasonably be expected to meet those
liabilities. If so, it will be deemed insolvent even though it is currently able to pay its
debts as they fall due: para [42].”

{Emphasis added]

(i) Analysis of the amount due from NSA

390. An examination of NSA Solutions Sdn Bhd’s 2013 accounts provides further insight
into the terms of this A$59in that was due to the Claimant, At [6CHB 3843], [12], NSA’s
Note to the Financial Statements explains that the amount due to the Claimant “mainly
comprised payment made on behalf of the company and were unsecured, interest free and
repayment term was to be made based on presentation of at [east one year’s notice”. Apart
from NSA’s poor financial health (net current liability of A$51.6m) (see [9.64h] of [Volume
D of the Bundle of Respondent’s Expert Reports (Vol 1 of 2), Tab LQS-3, Page 59]), the
notice requirement makes it is clear that Claimant could never have called for repayment of
this A$59m on or around 5 August 2013.

 

(ii) Financial Status of ASN / S5

391. The same repayment terms also applied for ASN / S5. At [6CHB 3757], it can be
seen that the repayment term for the amount owed to the ultimate holding company was
based on the presentation of at least one year’s notice. This amount was ultimately set off.
Further, at [6CHB 3759], under the heading “Liquidity risk”, it is stated that “{S5 Solutions]
depends on operating cash flow and financial suppost from holding, ultimate holding and
related companies to meet the liabilities when they fall due”. It is clear that despite the
Claimant’s Factual Witness claims, S5 / ASN was never going to “save” the Claimant.
During cross-examination [Transcripts, Day 2, Page 90], the Claimant’s Factual Witness
agreed that there was only approximately USD255,000 in available cash/bank deposits for SS
Systems to use.

(iii) Outstanding Directors’ Fees

392. Apart from the outstanding amount which would be due to ASN / S5, the Claimant
was facing claims in the form of directors’ fees. This is reflected in the Accruals of A$588k
recorded under the Claimant’s liabilities in the 2013 management accounts (see also [6CHB
3911] where KordaMentha reflected that the Claimant’s liabilities comprised of directors’
fees of A$572k). It is perhaps apt to note that the Claimant had paid large directors’ fees of
A$2.41 in 2011, A$3.305m in 2012, and A$544k in 2013.

178

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 183 of 263

393, The Claimant's Factual Witness elaborated on the directors’ fees during the
Arbitration hearing [Transcripts, Day 2, Pages 151 ~ 153]. He stated that when the Claimant
entered into voluntary administration, the creditors of the company were ASN Solutions and
three other directors who were owed director fees (Johann Young, Peter Dykes and Chua Yu
Yue (himself). The Claimant’s Factual Witness explained that while Johann Young and he
were still part of the Claimant, “Peter Dykes was the CFO in Nexbis Limited prior to this
when the company was listed”. It can be seen (from [5CHB 3197]) that Peter Dykes resigned
on 5 July 2012 and thus his director’s fees would clearly be outstanding on 30 June 2013.

394. During re-examination, the Claimant’s Factual Witness further elaborated on the
payment of Johann Young’s and Peter Dykes’ fees (Transcripts, Day 2, Page 162]:

ARBITRATOR; Now, earlier on, you said there were, what, three creditors, was it?
MR VERGIS: Four.
ARBITRATOR: Four creditors.
MR VERGIS: Three directors who were seeking their fees, including him, and the company.
ARBITRATOR: So as a result of that administration, all of you were paid out?
A. No, a scheme has been arranged. Frankly, my fees and Dato Sri Johann Young's fees are
small in comparison, and it's more for priority to deal with Peter Dykes' fees because he has
since left the company already.
ARBITRATOR: Peter Dykes?
A. Yes.
ARBITRATOR: Was he the former controlling shareholder?
A. No, he was the former CFO of the company.
ARBITRATOR: All right.
MR VERGIS: Was he a shareholder of the company.
A. He was a shareholder when it was listed.
ARBITRATOR: That's what I meant. Because he was paying himself Jots and lots of
money.
MR VERGIS: It was 800,000.
ARBITRATOR: So he was.
(Emphasis added)

395. In fact, till this day, it appears that the Directors’ claims still exist. They merely have,
pursuant to a binding Deed of Company Arrangement (“DOCA”) [6CHB 3927], been moved
to a Creditor’s Trust. See in particular, [6CHB 3933] where Johann Young has an admitted
claim of A$500,000 and Peter Dykes has an admitted claim of A$475,000, which has only
been partially paid. According to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission
website :

“A deed of company arrangement (DOCA) is a binding arrangement between a company and
its creditors governing how the company’s affairs will be dealt with, which may be agreed to
as a result of the company entering voluntary administration. It aims to maximise the chances
of the company, or as much as possible of its business, continuing, or to provide a better
return for creditors than an immediate winding up of the company, or both.

The DOCA binds all unsecured creditors, even if they voted against the proposal.

A creditors’ trust is a separate legal arrangement used to accelerate a company's exit from
external administration. Creditors' claims are generally transferred to a newly created
creditors’ trust and any return is received from the trustee of the trust, not the deed

179

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 184 of 263

 

administrator. The DOCA generally terminates after the creditors’ claims against the
company are moved to the trust.”
(Emphasis added)

396. According to paragraph 3.3 of the DOCA (see [6CHB 3936]), the Claimant had
agreed to pay a further sum of A$237,500 with interest to Peter Dykes if the arbitration case
between the Claimant and the Respondent is either successfully prosecuted by the Claimant
or settled with adequate funds. Likewise, according to paragraph 3.6 of the DOCA, Johann
Young would receive his full claim of A$500,000 if arbitration against the Respondent is
successful or settled.

397. Therefore it is clear that the Claimant had merely shifted its debt to the creditors’
trust.

398. The Claimant's continued reliance on the fact that they came out of voluntary
administration within 4 months is merely a misdirection. The debts owed by the Claimant
have been outstanding since 2013 and have simply been transferred to the creditor’s trust.
Ironically, any payment depends on the Claimant's success in this arbitration.

* (235]-[261] read:

235 In this section, it will be shown that even if the broad interpretation advocated by the
Respondent is applied, the Claimant was not insolvent.

i, The Applicable Legal Principles

236 Under Singapore company law, there is no single test for insolvency: Kon Yin Tong,
at [30]". The Singapore courts have held that it is not helpful or necessary to lean in favour of
one test or another when determining the insolvency of a company: see Chip Thye
Enterprises at (20]".

239 — To determine the solvency of a company, one must scrutinise all the relevant evidence
available and regard must be had to all the evidence that appears relevant to the question of
insolvency: Kon Tin Yong, at [31]. The court (or Tribunal in this instance) may apply a
combination of tests to determine whether company unable to pay its debts: Chip Thye
Enterprises, [19]

238 The determination of whether a company is insolvent is a question of fact. “A
company is insolvent or unable to pay its debts when it is unable to meet current demands...
insolvency in this commercial sense is principally a question of fact." Chip Thye Enterprises,
[34]. In this regard, the courts have held that:

a. Proof that a creditor's debt not paid per se does not establish inability to pay debt:
Kon Yin Tong, [34]

Temporary lack of liquidity is not tantamount to insolvency: Kon Yin Tong, [34]
A surplus or deficiency of net assets is indicative but not necessarily determinative
in establishing whether or not an entity is able to pay all its debts as and when
they become due and payable: Chip Thye Enterprises, [19]

af

180

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 185 of 263

 

239 The essential question is whether the company’s financial position is such that it
can continue in business and still pay its way: Kon Yin Tong, [38}.

 

240 Although there is no single test for insolvency, two primary ind
inability to pay debts are: (a) the balance sheet test; and (b) the cash flow test.

 

of a company’s

The Balance Sheet Test

241 Under the balance sheet test, a company is deemed insolvent if its assets are
insufficient to meet its liabilities, including prospective and contingent liabilities: Kon Yin
Tong, [39].

242 In the United Kingdom, the balance sheet test is encapsulated in section 123(2) of its
Insolvency Act: BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd, at [40-42]"';

243 In interpreting section 123(2), the English court has held that:-

d. “In practical terms, it would extraordinary if section 123(2) was satisfied every
time a company’s liabilities exceeded the value of its assets. Many companies
which are solvent and successful, and many companies early on in their lives,
would be deemed unable to pay their debts if this was the meaning of section
123(2)": BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd, at [40]";

e. A company should not be at risk of being wound up simply because the aggregate
value (however calculated) of its liabilities exceeds that of its assets. Many
companies in that position are successful and creditworthy. and cannot in any way
be characterised as “unable to pay their debts”. Section 123(2) does not give such
a mechanistic and artificial reason for permitting a creditor to present a petition to
wind up a company: BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd, at [41]";

f Section 123(2) requires the court to make a judgment whether it has been
established that, looking at the company’s assets and making proper allowance for
its prospective and contingent liabilities, it cannot reasonably be expected to meet
those lial . If so, it will be deemed insolvent although it is currently able to
pay its debts as they fall due. The more distant the liabilities, the harder this will
be for the creditor to establish that the company is unable to meet them: BNY
Corporate Trustee Services Ltd, at [42];

 

g. Where the company’s liabilities can be deferred for over many years and where
the company is (without any permanent increase in borrowin aying its debts
as they fall due. the court should proceed with the greatest caution in deciding that
the company is in a state of balance-sheet insolvency under section 123(2): BNY
Corporate Trustee Services Ltd, at [42].

The Cash Flow Test

244 — Under the cash flow test, a company is deemed to be insolvent when it cannot meet its
obligations as and when the fall due: Kon Yin Tong", (36).

181

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 186 of 263

 

245 In determining whether a company is cash flow insolvent, the courts look at the
company’s financial position taken as a whole: Kon Tin Yong, [37]. Factors that the courts
look at include the following:-

h. All of the company’s debts at the material time in order to determine when those
debts were due and payable: Kon Tin Yong, at [37]

i All of the assets of the company as at that time in order to determine the extent to
which those assets were liquid or were realisable within a timeframe that would
allow each of the debts to be paid as and when it became due and payable: Kon
Tin Yong, at [37]

j. Company’s business as at that time in order to determine its expected net cash
flow from the business by deducting from projected future sales the cash
expenses which would be necessary to generate those sales: Kon Tin Yong, at

[37]

k. Arrangements between the company and prospective lenders, such as its
bankers and shareholders, in order to determine whether any shortfall in
liquid and realisable assets and cash flow could be made up by borrowings
which would be repayable at a time later than the debts: Kon Tin Yong, at
[37]

1 Whether any liquidity problem is purely temporary and can be cured in the
reasonably near future: Kon Tin Yong, at [38]

ii, Balance Sheet Test: The Claimant was in net asset position as at 5
August 2013

246___ Factually, the Claimant’s management accounts show that as at 30 June 2013, the

Claimant was in a net asset position of A$61.3M. It also had a net current asset position
of A$2.4M: 5 CHB 3236. Under the balance sheet test, it was solvent.

247 The Respondent, using creative and unsustainable accounting arguments, alleges that
by 30 June 2013, the Claimant was balance sheet insolvent with net liability of A$1.58M.
Using 30 June 2013 as a proxy for the Respondent’s financial position as at 5 August 2013,
the Respondent concludes that the Claimant was insolvent and unable to pay its debts as at 5
August 2013, such that the Respondent was entitled to terminate the CA under Clause
11.1.1(ii). The Respondent's assertion is baseless.

248 In order to advance their position that the Claimant was in a net liability position, the
Respondent had to rely on several unsustainable premises:

a. The Respondent takes the unreasonable position that the costs of the MIBCS
project as at 30 June 2013 should be included the Claimant’s balance sheet, but
that the revenues generated by MIBCS project up till 30 June 2013 should be
exeluded from the balance sheet;

182

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 187 of 263

 

b. Based on this unreasonable position, the Respondent asserts that the sum of
A$2,970,090.75 due to the Claimant from ASN Solutions Sdn Bhd (“ASN”)
should be set-off against the A$3.9M that ASN had incurred for the MIBCS
project by 30 June 2013 and which had later been invoiced to the Claimant.
However the Claimant does not similarly add to the Claimant’s balance sheet the
revenues for the MIBCS project; and

c. The Respondent also asserts that the sum of A$59,004,501.78 due to the Claimant
from NSA Solutions Sdn Bhd should have been written-off as at 30 June 2013.

249 The Respondent's premises are meritless.

250___ First, it is unreasonable for the Respondent to take the position that the costs of the
MIBCS project should be have been included in the Claimant’s balance sheet, but not the
revenues from that project.

251 This Tribunal should either (a) include both the costs and revenues of the MIBCS
project as at 30 June 2013 in the Claimant’s balance sheet; or (b) exclude them both. On
either basis, the Claimant will be in a net asset position, even if the A$59M due from NSA is
written off from the Claimant’s balance sheet, and regardless of whether the revenues are
calculated on the basis of US$4 or US$2 per passenger. We illustrate in the table below.

252 Mr Leow himself admitted that it even if the revenues had been booked with ASN /
S5 Solutions, it would be necessary to factor in that income when examining the Claimant’s
ability to do its work: Transcripts, Day 5, p. 51-52.

253 Further the A$3.9M costs of the MIBCS project as at 30 June 2013 included
$237,000" of legal fees which the Claimant incurred for engaging lawyers to correspond
with the Respondent as a result of their delay in implementing the CA, and defend the
injunctions and Jaw suits brought by the ACC to suspect / terminate the performance of the
CA. If these costs are excluded from the Claimant’s balance sheet on the basis that the

183

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 188 of 263

 

Respondent cannot take advantage of its own wrong, the Claimant’s net assets would be even
higher.

254 — On this basis alone, the Respondent’s assertion that the Claimant was in a net liability
position as at 5 August 2013 should be rejected.

255 _ Second. the Respondent’s assertion that the amount due from NSA to the Claimant
should have been written off by 5 August 2013 is also baseless.

256 The Respondent asserts that the A$59M due from NSA to the Claimant should have
been written off in the Claimant’s 2013 management accounts for the following reasons:-

d. The A$59M was written off in the Claimant’s 2014 management accounts which
suggests that NSA’s ability to make payment was doubtful even in 2013; and
e. NSA was in a net current liability position of A$51.6M in its 2013 accounts.

257 The Respondent’s assertion falls away in light of the evidence and the Respondent’s
own financial expert’s concessions at the hearing.

258 The evidence shows that the Claimant had undergone a restructuring exercise which
involved disposing of its shares in its subsidiaries. On cross-examination, the Respondent’s
financial expert Mr Leow accepted that (a) in a restructuring scenario, debts are often written-
off for reasons other than that the debtor was unable to pay its debts; (b) the Claimant’s
writing off of NSA’s debt of A$59M could have been part of a larger group restructuring
exercise; and (c) the fact that debts were written off in 2014 as part of a larger restructuring
exercise cannot be the basis for suggesting that in 2013, provision for doubtful debt of the full
amount ought to have been made: Transcripts, Day 5, p. 21-23.

Further, Mr Leow also admitted that if the Claimant and NSA had been ultimately owned by
259 the same owners (as the evidence suggests that they were), it would be a matter of
accounting treatment how debts from the related companies are dealt with: Transcripts, Day
5,p. 85.

260 Finally, NSA’s 2013 accounts shows that it was in a net asset position of RM
25,998,157 (see 6 CHB 3818) and its assets included NSA’s investment in its associate
company, ASN / S5 Systems which continued to be a profitable. There is therefore no basis
fo say that the NSA’s debt owing to the Claimant was doubtful / would not have been
recoverable in the normal course, if not for the restructuring exercise.

261 Applying the balance sheet test, the Claimant was clearly solvent as at 5 August 2013.
"BE. TERMINATION OF THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT BY THE CLAIMANT AS
RESULT OF THE RESPONDENT’S REPUDIATORY BREACHES

39. On 20 December 2013, the Claimant issued a notice of termination of the Concession
Agreement to the Respondent pursuant to Clause 12.2 of the Concession Agreement. Further
or alternatively, by the satne notice, the Claimant accepted the Respondent's repudiatory

breaches of the Concession Agreement.

184

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 189 of 263

 

40. Asa result of the Respondent’s breaches as set out in paragraphs [11] to [34] above,
the Claimant has suffered loss and damage, including but not limited to, actual costs and
expenses and loss of investment incurred by the Claimant, non-payment of outstanding
invoices and loss of revenue and/or Joss of profit for the remainder of the 20-year Concession
Period until 20 September 2032.

Particulars of Actual Losses
a. The Claimant has suffered actual losses of comprising the following:

i, the actual costs and expense and loss of investment that the Claimant incurred to
design, install, implement and maintain the MIBCS (including al] the costs and expenses
incurred in acquiring the information technology system, hardware, software, equipment,
database, technical support, manpower, transport, duties and taxes);

it. the actual costs and expense the Claimant incurred in management, consultation costs
and fees for professional services incurred by the Claimant, and all research and development
costs relating to the MIBCS; and

iii. the actual costs and expense the Claimant has incurred in capitalising interest and
financing costs;

b. The Claimant has suffered loss and damage from the premature termination of the
Concession Agreement in the form of loss of revenue and/or loss of profits that the Claimant
would have otherwise earned for the remainder of the 20-year Concession Period until 20
September 2032; and

c. Further and/or in the alternative to 40(b) above, pursuant to clause 12.3, the quantum
of the Claimant’s loss of revenue as assessed by the Claimant for the duration of the
Concession Period for now comes up to around US$258,234,764.00, A copy of the certificate
issued by the independent firm or auditors pursuant to clause 16.3 of the Concession
Agreement is exhibited herein and marked “Annex A*.

40. Pursuant to clause 12.3, the quantum of losses as assessed by the Claimant for the
duration of the Concession Period for now comes up to around US$258,234,764.00. A copy
of the certificate issued by the independent firm or auditors pursuant to clause 16.3 of the
Concession Agreement is exhibited herein and marked “Annex A”.

41. As a result of the Claimant’s wrongful conduct, in breach of its contractual
obligations, the Respondent has incurred loss, damage, cost and expense.

42. By reason of the above, the Claimant claims:

a. Damages for delays in implementation of the Concession Agreement to be
assessed (pursuant to paragraph 27 above);

b. The sum of US$3,771,308.10 being the total outstanding invoiced amounts, as
per paragraph 31(f) above;

185

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 190 of 263

 

c Damages in the form of actual costs and expenses and loss of investment
incurred by the Claimant to be assessed (pursuant to paragraph 40(a) above);

d. Damages in the form of loss of revenue and/or loss of profit for termination of
the Concession Agreement to be assessed pursuant to paragraph 40(b) above and/or
for the sum of US$258,234,764.00 pursuant to paragraph 40(c) above;

e Costs; and

f. Such further and other relief as the Tribunal may see fit to award.

* 132]-[42] state as follows:
Cc. Damages Issue

32. To quantify its claim for compensation for the repudiatory breaches and/or
termination of the Concession Agreement, the Claimant will be relying on Mr Tam Chee
Chong (“TCC”)’s valuation report.

33. To be clear, the Claimant is putting forward two alternative premises for the
quantification of its damages claim.

34. Alternative A: The Claimant is seeking contractual damages pursuant to Clause 12.3
of the Concession Agreement which entitled the Claimant to claim the following:

(a) “Value of the Completed Works” which in essence is the costs incurred by the
Claimant to implement the MIBCS Project (e.g. design, installation and financing
costs);

(b) Loss of gross revenue of US$2 per entry and US$2 per exit (i.e. US$4 in
aggregate) for each foreign traveller (the “Foreign Traveller Charges”) projected for
the remainder of the Concession Period and discounted for present value;

(c) Loss of gross revenue of US$15 per work visa (the “Foreign Worker
Charges”) projected to be been issued / renewed / extended for the remainder of the
Concession Period and discounted for present value.

35. | The quantum of damages the Claimant is seeking on this basis using the discounted
cash flow (“DCF”) method is between US$64,938,053 and US$74,074,855, as explained at
paragraphs 5.1 — 5.24 of TCC’s valuation report.

36. Alternative B: The Claimant is seeking common law damages, being loss of net
profits it would have earned through the gross revenues generated through the Foreign
Traveller Charges and Foreign Worker Charges referred to above. TCC estimates that the
present value of loss of profits for the remainder of the 20-year Concession Period is between
US$29,571,944 and US$34,381,332 (see paragraphs 6.1 — 6.18 of TCC’s valuation report).

37. In addition to either of the two Alternatives above, the Claimant further claims an
aggregate sun of US$3,771,308.10, being the actual Foreign Traveller Charges payable

186

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 191 of 263

 

based on 12 invoices issued to the Respondent for operating the MIBCS between 1
September 2012 and 19 August 2013.

38. The Respondent relies on Mr Leow Quek Siong (“LQS”)’s valuation report to assess
the Claimant’s claim for damages.

39.  LQS’s Report has not assessed the value of the Claimant’s claim for contractual
damages (i.e, “Alternative A”). Neither has he opined on the Claimant’s claim based on
unpaid invoices. LQS’s Report mainly seeks to assess the Claimant’s claim for common law
damages based on the net present value of the Claimant’s loss of profits (i.e. “Alternative
B”). In this regard, LQS’s methodology and assumptions quite closely resemble TCC’s
approach.

40. Like TCC, LQS estimated the present value of the Claimant’s loss of profits based on
the DCF method. He has estimated the quantum of the Claimant’s loss of profits to be
US$23,208,089 (see page 102 of LQS’s valuation report).

41. The main difference is that LQS has calculated the Foreign Traveller Charges based
on US$2 per foreign traveller entering and departing the Maldives, whereas TCC’s
calculations proceeded on the basis of US$2 per entry and US$2 per exit for every foreign
traveller visiting the Maldives.

42. Therefore, a key issue for the Tribunal’s determination is the proper interpretation of
Clause 5.2.1 of the Concession Agreement, having regard to all the surrounding facts and
circumstances to determine whether the Foreign Traveller Charges ought to be calculated on
a US$2 or US$4 basis.

[145]-[149] read as follows:

145, Clause 12.3 of the CA provides that in the event of termination by the Claimant
pursuant to Clause 12.2, the Respondent is to pay the Claimant:-

a. The “Value of Completed Works” which is defined at Clause 14;

b. A compensation sum equivalent to the total charges multiplied by the projected
number of passengers entering into or departing from Maldives using non-Maldivian
passports and foreign worker or visa cards that would have been issued / renewed / extended
by the Respondent for the remainder of the Concession Period. In short, this amounts to the
Claimant's loss of revenue over the Concession Period.

146. This is the equivalent of a liquidated damages clause, by which the parties have
agreed on the formula to be used in calculating the Claimant’s compensation in the event of
the Respondent’s default. Insofar as this provision for contractual damages represents the
bargain freely entered into by a private corporate entity and a sovereign nation, we submit
that the Tribunal is entitled to award contractual damages for termination pursuant to Clause
12.3,

187

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 192 of 263

 

147. In the alternative, the Claimant is entitled to damages in common law. As stated by
the Court of Appeal in Gunac Enterprises (Pte) Ltd v Utraco Pte Ltd [1994] 3 SLR(R) 889 at
(11], where a contract has been breached, “As far as possible, the innocent party is to be put
in as good a position as if the contract had been performed.”

148. _ In the present case, had the CA been fully performed, the Claimant would have been
paid for the invoices it rendered between September 2012 and September 2013, and would
have also expected to earn the profits from operating the MIBCS project over the remainder
of the 20-year concession period.

149, As the financial experts of both parties have admirably reached a consensus on best
estimates of loss of profits suffered by the Claimant on the alternative scenarios of charging
$2 or $4 per non-Maldivian passenger, only 2 questions remain for this Tribunal’s
determination on the assessment of damages:-

a. First, whether under the CA, the Claimant was entitled to charge every non-Maldivian
passenger (i) only $2 per passenger; or (ii) $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure (i.e., $4 per
passenger); and

b. Second, whether the Claimant should be awarded damages under Clause 12.3 of the
CA, or common law damages.

wi [150]-[200] of the Claimant’s Closing Statements read:

A. Under the [CA] it was agreed that every non-Maldivian passenger would
be charged a fee of $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure

150 The first issue on assessment of damages turns on how Clause 5.2.1 of the CA is to be
interpreted.

151 Clause 5.2.1 of the CA states:

“The Company is authorised by the Government to impose upon and collect levy or
Jee from:
Each and every p using ivian passport_arriving into and
departing from the Republic of Maldives, a fee of USD2.00 (UNITED STATES
DOLLAR TWO ONLY) per passenger via a levy or fee imposed or to be
imposed by the Government to be charged on such a passenger.”

152 The Claimant has consistently taken the position that on the correct interpretation of
this Clause, the Claimant was entitled to impose a fee of $2 on every arriving non-Maldivian
passenger, and $2 on every departing non-Maldivian passenger.

153 In contrast, the Respondent began to contend for the first time and only very recently
since 7 September 2015 (almost 4 years after the CA was entered into) that this Clause only
entitled the Claimant to impose a fee of only $2 on every non-Maldivian passenger arriving
into the Maldives.

188

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 193 of 263

 

154°

In interpreting Clause 5.2.1, the Tribunal should have regard to the following 3

matters:~

f

a

155

First, Singapore law, the applicable law of the CA, has adopted a contextual approach
to contractual interpretation. Under it, interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning
which expressions in a document would convey to a reasonable person having all the
background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties
at the time of the contract: see Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings & Anor {2013}
SGCA 43 at [33].

Second, the rules of evidence which govern admissibility of extrinsic evidence are
separate and distinct from the rules of contractual interpretation: see Sembcorp Marine
at [40]. The Singapore Evidence Act does not apply in this Tribunal, and this Tribunal
can determine relevance, materiality and admissibility of all evidence, including
evidence not admissible in law: see Section 2(1), Evidence Act; Rule 16.2, SIAC Rules.
Therefore, this Tribunal may adopt a robust approach to contractual interpretation,
and consider both pre-contractual negotiations and the parties’_subsequent
conduct in order to aid the contractual interpretation. This approach has been
adopted in New Zealand, several civil law jurisdictions, and in transnational
conventions dealing with contractual interpretation: see Sembcorp Marine Ltd at [36] to
137}.

Third, the CA contains an entire agreement clause (Clause 32) which clearly states
that the CA “constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties”, “supersedes any
previous agreement or understanding between the Parties” and that the Claimant and
the Respondent had not “relied on any representation or warranty save as expressly set
out herein or in any document expressly referred to herein.” \n other words, regardless
of what was in the bid documents, the entire agreement of the parties is encapsulated in
the CA. However, the entire agreement clause does not prevent this Tribunal from
looking at extrinsic evidence to ascertain the meaning of what was stated in the CA:
Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor & Anor [2007] SGCA 22.

In this case, the evidence of the parties’ pre-contractual negotiations, the terms of the

contract themselves, and the parties’ subsequent conduct are all consistent with only one
interpretation of Clause 5.2.1: the Claimant was entitled to charge $2 for every arriving non-

Maldivi

156

  

n passenger, and $2 for every departing non-Maldivian passenger.
In this section, we show that:-

a The parties may have originally contemplated that the Claimant would charge
every passenger, regardless of nationality, a $2 fee. However, the bargain struck in the
CA was that the Claimant would charge only non-Maldivian passengers, but that they
would be charged $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure. This becomes clear, when
the relevant context of a previous draft of the CA is examined side-by-side with the
CA that was eventually signed.

b The evidence shows that the Respondent’s AGO, MOFT, DOIE as well as the

ACC all understood the CA to mean that the Claimant was entitled to charge every
non-Maldivian passenger $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure. They shared this

189

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 194 of 263

 

understanding — consistently and universally - even before the Claimant rendered its
first invoice.

c The parties’ subsequent conduct also evidences their common understanding
that the Claimant was entitled to charge every non-Maldivian passenger $2 upon
arrival and $2 upon departure. In particular, the Respondent’s failure to challenge the
Claimant’s invoices, which calculated the amount due to the Claimant on the basis
that $2 was to be collected from every arriving and every departing passenger, is very
revealing and instructive.

d The Respondent’s sole factual witness, Mr Naseer, admitted at the hearing that
it was the Respondent’s financial expert, Mr Leow, who had raised the issue of
whether the Claimant was entitled to charge $2 or $4 per passenger, and that
following that, the Respondent decided to make an argument of it in these
proceedings.

i. The bargain struck in the CA was that the Claimant would be entitled to
charge non-Maldivian $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure

i.e., @ total of $4 per non-Maldivian passenger)

157 It is clear on the evidence that between 29 September 2010, when the Claimant was
awarded the MIBCS project, and 17 October 2010, when the CA was signed, there were
extensive negotiations between the Claimant and the Respondent, and that the DOIE, MOFT
and AGO participated in these negotiations on behalf of the Respondent.

158 Abdullah Muiz, the Solicitor General of Maldives at that time (who was second only
to Attorney General), said in his statement to the ACC that he attended and gave legal
opinions at 2 meetings which were held to review the draft agreement: 3 RBD 2567.

159 Ibrahim Afeef, the Deputy Director General of the Legal Affairs Department of the
DOIE at that time, recalled in his statement to the ACC that the MOFT had sent a draft
agreement to DOIE. Thereafter he and Abdullah Waheed went to see Abdullah Muiz with the
draft. One of the comments made by Abdullah Muiz on the draft was that the arbitration
should be held in Singapore, rather than in Malaysia or the Maldives: 3 RBD 2592 at 2593 to
2594.

160 A copy of the draft with which Ibrahim Afeef went to see Abdullah Muiz can be seen
at 4 CHB 2360. On the first page there is a handwritten annotation which indicated that
Ibrahim Afeef and Abdullah Waheed had visited someone with this draft and discussed it. In
this draft, it had been proposed that any dispute be resolved by arbitration in Malaysia: 4
CHB 2391. As we know, the eventual CA that was signed provided that any dispute be
resolved by arbitration in Singapore. This indicates that the document at 4 CHB 2360 was an
early draft of the CA which was amended after the AGO’s opinion on it has been sought, and
parties had negotiated its terms further.

161 A comparison of the language used in the draft compared with the language used
eventually in the CA puts it beyond doubt that the parties, in the CA, intended that the
Claimant would be entitled to charge every non-Maldivian passenger $2 upon arrival and $2
upon departure.

First, Clause 5.1.1 of the
final CA, without
comparison to the draft CA,
shows that the parties
intentions, objectively
ascertained, was for the
Claimant to be paid for both
ariving and departing
passengers. There would be
no need for the GoM to
provide statistics of
departing passengers as part
of the payment procedure,
unless the Claimant was to
be paid for departing
passengers as well as
arriving passengers.

Second, Clause 5.1.1 in the

Clause 5.1.1. in the draft CA
shows that the payment
procedure proposed in each
of the draft CA and the final
CA were each consistent
with the understanding of
what the Charges were to
mean, under each of them.

In the draft CA, the GoM
was only obliged to state the
total number of passenger
arrivals in its report, as the
Claimant was to be paid for
passenger arrivals only.

In the final CA, the GoM
was obliged to state the total
number of passenger arrivals
and departures, as the
Claimant was to be paid for
both arrivals and departures.

was a use of the MIBCS
which entitled it to charge a
fee.

These clauses are identical

(All emphases ours)
16 The Claimant’s argument is two-fold:-

a. First, that when Clause 5.2.1 of the final CA is considered in the context of the
architecture of the final CA, it is clear that the Respondent was to pay the Claimant $2 for
upon every non-Maldivian passenger’s arrival and $2 upon every non-Maldivian
passenger’s departure. In this regard, there is remarkable consistency in the contractual
language espousing the twin concepts of non-Maldivian passengers who are arriving in
and departing from the Maldives even in the differing contexts in which such language is
employed. It would have been unnecessary for the Respondent to provide the Claimant
with statistics of both arriving and departing passengers as part of the payment procedure,
unless the Claimant was to be paid for both arriving and departing passengers. Clause
12.3 also makes it clear that when calculating damages payable to the Claimant, the
charges were to be multiplied by the number of passengers arriving, or departing, as the
case may be.

b. Second, when the final CA is compared with the draft CA, it is clear that the basis and
mechanism for imposing charges in the final CA was conceptually different from what
was originally envisaged. Under the draft CA, all passengers, regardless of nationality,
were to be charged once — upon arrival, Under the final CA, only non-Maldivian
passengers would be charged, and they would have to pay both ways - upon arrival and
departure.

ii_The AGO, MOFT, DOIE, ACC and Parliament understood the CA to mean that the
Claimant was entitled to charge every non-Maldivian $2 upon arrival and $2
upon departure

194

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 199 of 263

 

164 The evidence shows that the various functionaries of the Maldivian government, the
ACC, and the Parliament, at all points independently and collectively understood the CA to
mean that the Claimant was entitled to charge every non-Maldivian passenger $2 upon arrival
and $2 upon departure.

165 On 25 April 2011, some 6 months after the entry into the CA, the DOJE submitted a
cabinet paper to the MHA to submit to the Cabinet so that the Cabinet could decide whether
to terminate the CA. The Respondent’s translation of the cabinet paper can be found at 3
RBD 227]. As some portions were not translated, the Claimant had its own translation done,
which can be found at CBD 116.

166 In the cabinet paper, DOJE set out the Claimant’s estimated income over a 20-year
period using tables. In each table, the DOIE set out :

a the estimated number of foreigners entering the Maldives, and multiplied that
by 2 to arrive at the total fees earned from arriving passengers;

 

b the esti d number of foreigners departing the Maldives, and multiplied that
by 2 to arrive at the total fees earned from departing passengers; and
c the estimated number of foreign workers applying for work visa registration

and multiplied that by 15 to arrive at the total fees earned from work visas.

167 Based on this, DOIE calculated that over 20 years, the Respondent would receive
USD 8,775,000.00 as royalty and that the Claimant would receive USD 166,725,000.00 as
income.

168 The cabinet paper shows that the DOJE internally understood that the Claimant was
entitled to charge foreign passengers $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure.

169 It is clear that even Abdullah Shahid, who assumed the role of Controller of the DOJE
after the CA was signed and was intent on terminating the CA, after carrying out a careful
study of the CA and the circumstances surrounding its signing, understood the CA to mean
that the Claimant was entitled to charge every non-Maldivian passenger $2 upon arrival and
$2 upon departure.

170 In his statement to the ACC, he accepted that “every foreigner has to pay $2 upon
arrival and $2 upon departure.” Based on this, he calculated that “if J million foreigners
enter the Maldives and they are charged $2 on arrival and $2 on departure (a total of $4)
then the cost would be $4 million... it is estimated that 5 million passengers will enter the
Maldives by 2025. If we calculate the S4 per head fee for those 5 million passengers, $20
million would be spent as passenger fees every year.”: 3 RBD 2555

17] He took the same position in his letter to the MHA dated 24 May 2011 where he
stated “By looking at the way which was decided to charge in order to cover the investment
of the project, a return of more than 4 million dollars is anticipated for the first year itself.”:
3 CHB 1707 at 1708. Mr Naseer admitted that in this letter, Shahid was working on the

195

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 200 of 263

 

premise that the foreigners will be charged both upon arrival and upon departure: Transcripts,
Day 4, p. 36 lines 9-23; p. 38, lines 9-16.

172, When Dr Mohamed Ali subsequently took over as Controller of the DOIE, the same
view persisted within the DOIE. In the 7" PSC Meeting on 13 February 2013, chaired by Dr
Mohamed Ali and attended by other members of the DOIE, the DOJE agreed to “facilitate
the arrangements with IATA for payment processing direct from all foreign passenger per
arrival into and per departure from Maldives...” (Emphasis ours)

173. The overwhelming evidence is that the DOIE, as the department that conceived,
consummated and carried out the MIBCS Project, had invariably internalized the revenue
model of every foreigner paying $2 upon arrival and upon departure, which directly impacted
the DoIE’s royalty collection as well. To that extent, it is worth noting had the CA been fully
performed by the Respondent, the Claimant’s interpretation of the charging mechanism
would have directly benefitted the Respondent as well by literally doubling their royalty
revenues. Thus, it should come as no surprise that the Respondent has only now conjured up
an awkward interpretation of the CA charging mechanism, virtually at the doorstep of the
hearing — it is a desperate, last-ditch stab at damage control.

174 — Evidence of the AGO’s understanding is also critical, as it was involved in the early
stages, when the CA was still being negotiated. It is clear that the AGO and the other parties
autonomously understood, even at the negotiations stage, that foreigners will be charged $2
upon arrival and upon departure.

175 Abdullah Muiz, the Solicitor General from the AGO at that time, was present at a
meeting between MOFT, the Claimant and Owhere the CA was discussed. His recollection
was that at the meeting, the parties “discussed article 5.2.1 of the agreement which states that
every foreigner that arrives in Maldives will be charged $2 (two_U.S. dollars), every
foreigner that departs Maldives will be charged $2 (two U.S. dollars) and every visa card
issues will be charged $15 (fifteen U.S. dollars)...” : see 3 RBD 2567 at 2568. (Emphasis
ours)

176 Abdullah Muiz’s unallied evidence is illuminating on two fronts: it reveals that Clause
5.2.1 was actively discussed, and that parties clearly understood it to mean that foreigners
would be charged twice for both arrivals and departures.

177. We would invite the Tribunal to ascribe special weight to Abdullah Muiz’s
unvarnished and non-aligned evidence for the following reasons:

a He was an official of the Respondent, who is totally independent of the Claimant.
b He was the second highest legal officer of the Respondent who was specifically
brought in to give legal advice to the Respondent during the contract negotiations with the

Claimant.

c His evidence was recorded by the ACC for its own investigations at a time when this
particular issue had not yet surfaced.

196

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 201 of 263

 

178 — Abdullah Muiz’s evidence is corroborated by the recommendations made by the AGO
recorded in the meeting minutes dated 13 October 2010. No recommendation was made in
relation to Clause 5.2.1: see 3 RBD 2116.

179 The MOFT also autonomously understood Clause 5.2.1 to mean that the Claimant
was entitled to charge every non-Maldivian passenger $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure.

180 This is clear from the Samee Ageel’s statement to the ACC recorded on 22 March
2011, some 5 months after the CA was signed. Samee Agee] was the Director General of the
MOFT. In his recollection, “The agreement states that every foreigner coming to or leaving
Maldives must pay a fee of 2 US dollars and every visa card issued will be charged 15 US
dollars.” (Emphasis ours): see 3 RBD 2514 at 2517.

181 This is consistent with the understanding put forward by the Claimant, which was
clearly also the understanding of the DOJE and the AGO. Again, we would emphasize the
probative value of Samee Ageel’s evidence, which was recorded by the ACC in the course of
their investigations. Given that the true construction of Clause 5.2.1 was a non-issue at that
juncture, one can safely conclude that Samee Ageel’s evidence on this matter was impartial
and unadulterated.

182 When the various strands of evidence independently gathered by the ACC from high-
level officials of the DOIE, AGO, and the MOFT are threaded together, they form a cord of
proof of remarkable consistency: every significant person in those pre-contractual
negotiations individually understood Clause 5.2.1 to mean that the Claimant will be entitled
to charge foreigners $2 upon departure and $2 upon arrival.

183 It is therefore not surprising that following the conclusion of its investigations, the
ACC similarly concluded that the Claimant was entitled under the CA to charge $2 from
every foreigner upon arrival and upon departure. Indeed, this finding was the pivotal premise
for the ACC’s recommendation to the Prosecutor-General that Illyas Hussain be prosecuted
for purportedly agreeing to allow the Claimant to charge a higher rate in the final CA even
though the Claimant had initially proposed in their bid document to charge a fee of $2 for
every arriving passenger: see | RBD 150 at 5.9.4.2, 1 RBD 184 at 6.69, and 1 RBD 191 at
8.4.

184 Not surprisingly, the Prosecutor-General declined to charge Ilyas Hussain for this:
Volume E, Respondent’s Bundle of Maldivian Law Authorities, p. 281. The Prosecutor-
General’s rejection of the ACC recommendation to prosecute Illyas is quite clearly justified
given the fact that the final terms of the CA had multi-department approval such that Illyas
could not be said on the evidence to have single-handedly controlled this outcome. Nothing
more needs to be said about the ACC’s rejected recommendation.

185 What remains significant, however, is that following its comprehensive investigations,
the ACC had conclusively found that the Claimant was entitled under the CA to charge
foreigners $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure. The irony is that the Respondent, despite
placing great store on the various “findings” contained in the ACC Report, has now placed
itself firmly on a collision course with the ACC’s finding of fact on the proper interpretation
of Clause 5.2.1.

197

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 202 of 263

 

186 There is yet more evidence undermining the Respondent’s position. The Finance
Committee (a standing committee of the Parliament) in its Parliamentary report dated 20
December 2012 (4 CHB 2412), noted that both the ACC and the DOIE had taken the view
that every foreigner was to be charged $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure:-

“4.1 Summary of submissions made by the Anti-Corruption Commission... The
agreement states that Nexbis would claim a fee of $2 as tax and $15 for every visa
card issued from every tourist entering and leaving the Maldives. although the bid
proposed by Nexbis stated that they would claim a fee of $2 from every tourist
passenger. Therefore it is noted that Nexbis doubled the amount in contravention to
what they proposed in the bid document.”

“4.2 Summary of information received from DOIE: It_was the tender evaluation

board who decided to take $2 tax from foreign passengers arriving into and departing

from Maldives, and $15 for visa card based on the proposal submitted by Nexbis...””
(Emphasis ours)

 

 

 

itt The parties’ sub. conduct is is with the unde ding that the
Claimant was entitled to charge non-Maldivian 52 upon arrival and $2
upon departure

187 We turn now to deal with the contractual parties’ conduct in the performance of the
CA. From September 2012 to September 2013, the Claimant rendered invoices setting out the
amounts payable to it for the processing of foreigners upon arrival and upon departure: 4
CHB 2719 to 2747.

188 The invoices complied with Annex B of the CA as required under Clause 5.3.1 of the
CA.

The invoices set out:
a the total number of non-Maldivian passengers arriving into the Republic of
Maldives for the preceding month, and multiplied that by 2 to arrive at the amount of
fees to be charged of arriving foreigners;
b the total number of non-Maldivian passengers departing from the Republic of
Maldives for the preceding month, and multiplied that by 2 to arrive at the amount of
fees to be charged of departing foreigners;

c the amount of royalty payable to the Respondent; and

d the amount payable to the Claimant after setting off the royalties payable to
the Respondent from the total fees.

190 For a year, month after month, the Respondent received the invoices and
acknowledged them without any protest.

198

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 203 of 263

 

191 The invoices were also presented at the 6", 7” and 8" PSC Meetings between 19
December 2012 and 23 April 2013. As Mr Naseer admitted, the invoices were not challenged
at the PSC Meeting: transcripts, Day 4, p. 36 line 13 to p. 97 line 19. On the contrary, at the
7” PSC Meeting, the DOIE unequivocally confirmed that it would work with the [ATA to
collect the fees from arriving and departing foreigners (see [0] above).

192 Some of the invoices were also sent to the Respondent’s then solicitors Advocatus
Law LLP: 4 CHB 2641. Neither the Respondent nor its solicitors took any issue with the
invoices at that stage.

iv The Re dent's current ion that the Claimant was only entitled to charge
52 for every foreign passenger is disingenuous

193 The first time the Respondent took the position that the invoices were wrongly
calculated on the pretext that the Claimant was only entitled to charge $2 per foreign
passenger was-on 7 September 2015, less than a month before the arbitral hearing. For
context, this was 5 years after the CA was entered into, and some 3 years from the date of the
Jirst of the invoices.

 

194 — It was only on 30 September 2015, mere days before the arbitration hearing, that the
Respondent amended its pleaded case to assert that “it did not acknowledge and accept the
invoiced sums”: BP, Tab 10, [68.5].

195 By Mr Naseer’s 3° witness statement (which was supposed to set out the
Respondent’s rebuttal evidence) filed on 7 Septeinber 2015, the Respondent claimed for the
first time that “the sums which are the invoices set out at paragraph 214 of the Witness
Statement of Chua Yu Ye are incorrect as Nexbis had invoiced DOIE for the sum of USD for
each passenger arriving and another USDS2 for each passenger departing, i.e., a total of
USD$4 per passenger... Nexbis’ bid had been submitted on the basis that the charge of
USD§2 was meant to cover both the arrival and departure of each passenger... DOIE is of
the view that Nexbis had double charged in the invoices” (at [20], [21], [28])

196 For reasons which we will explain, it is significant that Mr Naseer’s witness statement
was filed on the same day as Mr Leow’s, the Respondent’s financial expert. In his expert
report at [6.19], Mr Leow reproduced Clause 5.2.1 and stated “it appears that the passenger
Jee should be US$2 per passenger instead of US$2 upon arrival and a further US$2 upon
departure, which will amount to a US$4 per passenger.”

197 As it turns out, it was Mr Leow, a Singapore accountant who was supposed to be
giving expert opinion principally on the quantum of damages, who had introduced the idea
that the CA should be read as a $2 fee per foreign passenger instcad of a $4 fee per foreign
passenger. Notably, Mr Leow had absolutely no personal knowledge of what had ip

in the pre-contractual negotiations, execution and performance of the CA and was seeking
merely to offer a desktop interpretation of the CA that could potentially minimize his client’s
liability. To the extent that Mr Leow’s opinion was an incursion into the realm of contractual
interpretation, it is wholly irrelevant.

198 Nevertheless, the Respondent disingenuously seized upon that idea and proceeded to
contrive “evidence” on this issue through Mr Nasser’s witness statement. The fact that the

199

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 204 of 263

 

Respondent only raised this argument and led evidence on it for the very first time in Mr
Naseer’s rebuttal evidence betrays the lie in the Respondent’s case and exposes the fact that
this is and was nothing more than a “lawyer’s argument” (albeit raised by an accountant).
Given the colossal consequences for the parties that this argument implicates, one would have
expected this point to be a comerstone of the Respondent’ s case from the very beginning - -if
it were true. The fact that the R dent only ded their pleadings on 30 Sep

2015 to reflect this position amply demonstrates that this argument is nothing but an
afterthought to exploit any arguable ambiguity (which is denied) in the language of the CA.

199 Most damningly, Mr Naseer admitted under cross-examination that the only reason
the Respondent had raised this argument is because the financial expert had raised this

as a potential issue and the Respondent decided to make an argument of it: Transcripts,
Day 4, p. 134-136.

200 ‘The evidence is conclusive. Under Clause 5.2.], the Claimant was entitled to charge
every foreigner $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure. This was the consistent understanding
of the parties, the parties acted upon this understanding, and it is the only interpretation that
makes sense against the relevant background. The Respondent's last-minute attempt to claim
otherwise is disingenuous, and makes no sense in light of all the evidence.

vl (i) Preliminary Issue (2) — Double claiming

453. Clause 12.3 of the Concession Agreement (as set out above) allows the Claimant to
claim not only its wasted expenditure (the Value of Completed Works), but also loss of
revenue. This is a prime example of claiming double compensation.

454. Chitty on Contract 32nd Ed states (at (page 1816, [26-029]): “Claims for both profit
and reliance loss. Both expectation and (subject to the claimant’s expectation) reliance
interests are thus protected by the Jaw on damages. May the claimant recover both, so long as
he is not compensated twice for the same loss and is not put into a better position than if the
contract had been performed? In principle, the claimant should be entitled to claim damages
both for his wasted expenditure incurred up to the date of his terminating the contract and
also for the net loss of profit which he would have made but for the breach. There can be no
valid objection to this, provided the calculations show that there is no overlapping in the
claimant's recovery, viz his net loss of profits is calculated by deducting from his expected
gross return both the cost of his performance and reliance expenditure to the date of
termination and the cost of the further expenditure which he would have incurred after that
date if he had completed his performance.”

455. Therefore, quite clearly, under Common Law, the Claimant is obviously not entitled
to claim his reliance expenditure (Value of Completed Works) and loss of revenue according
to clause 12.3. This ties in with the issue on penalty clauses and whether the amount payable
is a genuine pre-estimate of loss.

Main Issue for Alternative A: Penalty Clause

200

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 205 of 263

 

456. Chitty on Contract 32nd Ed states (at page. 1798, [26-001]) “subject to a number of
controls, (e.g. the law on penalties) the parties to a contract may themselves specify in their
contract the remedy available to the innocent party following the other’s breach”.

457 For damages fixed by parties, Chitty on Contract 32nd Ed states (at pg 1912, [26-178]):

“Where the parties to a contract agree that, in the event of a breach, the contract-
breaker shall pay to the other a specified sum of money, the sum fixed may be
classified by the courts either as a penalty (which is irrecoverable) or as liquidated
damages (which are recoverable).” The test is whether the clause is a “genuine pre-
estimate of loss” as opposed to being in the nature of a threat fixed “in terrorem”
against the other party.

458. It is trite that damages are normally awarded to place the innocent party, as far as
money can, in the position it would have been if the contract had been performed. In cases
where a contract is wrongfully terminated, the normal measure of damages is loss of profit.

459. Clearly, under Clause 12.3, the Claimant would be obtaining way more than its net
loss of profit.

vi [106]-[188] of the Respondent’s Reply Submissions state:

A. The issue of whether the Claimant was entitled to charge $2 or $4 in total for a
foreign passenger was not something that was introduced by the Respondent’s Financial
Expert

106 This sub-point pertains to a minor issue, but since the Claimant has claimed that the
Respondent was ignorant of the $2 / $4 issue and that the idea originated from the
Respondent’s Financial Expert, it is convenient to address it first.

107 The grounds for the Claimant’s assertion is based on the coincidence that the
Respondent’s Financial Expert’s witness statement was filed on the same date as the
Respondent’s Factual Witness’ 3rd witness statement which allegedly raised the issue for the
first time. This is a rather incredulous conclusion to make based on the most tenuous of
links. How does the same filing date indicate that the idea originated from the Respondent’s
Financial Expert?

108 To back up their theory, the Claimant’s solicitors then forced the hapless Mr Naseer,
who had never met the Respondent’s Financial Expert, let alone was aware of or privy to any
discussion with the said expert, to admit to their theory.

109 Once again, the Claimant’s wild theory is incorrect. The Respondent’s Financial
Expert had stated at [2.1] of his 1“ Witness Statement that his “scope of work is to provide my
opinions to the questions posed by Aldgate Chambers LLC. A list of the questions is
appended as LQS-2.”

201

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 206 of 263

 

110 As can be seen from the list of questions at “LQS-2”, [page 9 of the Claimant’s
Financial Expert’s 1st Witness Statement], the Respondent’s solicitors had set out at [3.4]
of the ‘List of Questions for the Financial Expert Witness’:

“The total fee per foreign passenger who arrives and departs Maldives is US $2.

Please calculate the Claimant's loss for the [following] period[s]...”

(Emphasis in bold added)

111 The Respondents Financial Expert did not come up with the idea that the total fee per
foreign passenger was US $2.

112 It is also incorrect to suggest that the Respondent had not raised the issue before. The
amount of damages that the Claimant is seeking in this arbitration has ong been disputed. In
its first Statement of Defence and Counterclaim filed on 16 July 2014, the Respondent has
pleaded that:

112.1 “ft]he Respondent disputes the invoices produced by the Claimant and puts
the Claimant to strict proof regarding such sums” [39.1] RD&C.

112.2 “Further and/or in the alternative, the certificate issued by the “independent
firm of auditors appointed out [sic] by the Company” should be set aside for the
Jollowing reasons... [39.2.2] The certificate is erroneous...” [39.2] RD&C.

113 It must be highlighted that at that point of time, the Claimant had not sought common
Jaw damages, but was merely relying on the independent auditor’s certificate to claim its
purported loss of revenue (the certificate was abandoned at the hearing). The Claimant only
amended its Statement of Claim to include an alternative plea for common law damages on
20 August 2015.

B. The Law on Contractual Interpretation

114 In the recent Singapore Court of Appeal case concerning contractual interpretation
(VES. F&B Group Pte Lid vy Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as
Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd [2015] 5 SLR 1195 (“¥.B.S. F&B”) [3RBA -
TAB 1)), the Court restated the applicable principles:

114.1 When faced with rival meanings of certain words and phrases, a nuanced
consideration of both the text as well as the context of the contract in question is
crucial - [30].

114.2 “the context cannot be utilised as an excuse by the court concerned to rewrite
the terms of the contract according to its (subjective) view of what it thinks the result
ought to be in the case at hand. To this end, the court must always base its decision
on objective evidence... Put simply, the court must ascertain, based on all the relevant
objective evidence, the intention of the parties at the time they entered into the
contract” - [32].

114.3 “In this regard, the court should ordinarily start from the working position
that the parties did not intend that the term(s) concerned were to produce an absurd
result. However, this is only a starting point — and no more” - [32]

202

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 207 of 263

 

Cc

11S

114.4 “although the relevant context is also important, the text ought always to be
the first port of call for the court” - [32] However, “on the opposite end of the
spectrum, the text concerned might itself be ambiguous (ie, without even considering
the relevant context). In such a situation, it is clear that the relevant context will
generally be of the first importance”.

114.5 “the court is always to pay close attention to both the text and context in every
case ~ noting that both interact with each other”. - [35]

114.6 “the role of context ... relates only to the need to place the court in the position
of the party which drafted the instrument and not the drafter’s subjective intention as
such”.

114.7 The guidance in Zurich Insurance (3RBA — Tab2] on what extrinsic

id is admissible in aid of | interp ion as well as the way in which
the task of interpretation is to be carried out is both comprehensive and nuanced -
[39]. The Court quoted, inter alia, the following paragraph from Zurich Insurance:
“The extrinsic evidence in question is admissible so long as it is relevant, reasonably
available to all the contracting parties and relates to a clear or obvious context...
However, the principle of objectively ascertaining contractual intention(s) remains
paramount. Thus, the extrinsic evidence must always go towards proof of what the
parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon ...there should be no
absolute or rigid prohibition against evidence of previous negotiations or subsequent
conduct, although, in the normal case, such evidence is likely to be inadmissible for
non-compliance with the requirements... the relevance of subsequent conduct remains
a controversial and evolving topic that will require more extensive scrutiny by this
court at @ more appropriate juncture. Declarations of subjective intent remain
inadmissible except for the purpose of giving meaning to terms which have been
determined lo be latently ambiguous.”

114.8 Finally, at [48] & [49], the Court cited with approval Lord Clarke’s statement
in Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank [2011] 1 WLR 2900 that “fiff there are two possible
constructions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent
with business common sense and to reject the other”.

(Emphasis added.)

The Relevant Text

To recap, the main clause at the centre of this issue is clause 5.2.1:

“The Company is authorised by the Government to impose upon and collect levy or fee from:
i. Each and every passenger using non-Maldivian passport arriving into and departing from
the Republic of Maldives, a fee of USD2.00 (UNITED STATES DOLLAR TWO ONLY) per
passenger via a levy or fee imposed or to be imposed by the Government to be charged on
such passenger.”

116

The key phrase is “arriving into and departing from”. It is the Respondent’s position

that the phrase should be read conjunctively, i.e. every foreign passenger arriving into and
departing from Maldives would pay a total of US $2. The addition of the phrase “departing

203

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 208 of 263

 

from” would prevent the Claimant from claiming in future that it was entitled to claim an
additional $2 upon departure.

117. The Claimant’s argument is that it should be read disjunctively. However, if it was
meant to be read disjunctively, shouldn’t the term “or” be used instead? I.e. each and every
foreign passenger “arriving into or departing from”.

118 In relation to paragraph 162 of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions, if the phrase
“entering into and departing from” is to be taken as imposing a fee on both arriving and
departing passengers, then logically, Clause 12.3 of the Concession Agreement (the
liquidated damages/penalty clause) would state that the Respondent would pay the Claimant,
upon termination, a compensation sum equivalent to the total Charges multiplied by the
projected number of passengers entering into and departing from Maldives.

119 Instead, Clause 12.3 states that the compensation payable is the total Charges
multiplied by the projected number of passengers entering into or departing from the
Maldives. This clearly signifies that only one charge is payable.

119.1 The structure used in Clause 12.3 for the arriving or departing passengers is
similar to the next line regarding foreign workers or visa cards - the charges would be
multiplied by the number of foreign workers or visa cards. According to Clause
5.2.1(iii) of the Concession Agreement, if the Government did not implement visa
cards, it would have to pay based on the number of foreign workers in the country,
Hence, the use of the term ‘or’ in Clause 12.3.

119.2 Therefore, Clause 12.3 supports the Respondent’s position that Charges are

only payable once, either upon arrival or departure.
120 Since the Claimant and the Respondent have taken different interpretations of the
meaning of Clause 5.2.1 of the Concession Agreement, we proceed to consider the context in
which the Concession Agreement was entered into. The Claimant has relied on what it billed
as “extensive negotiations” between the Claimant and the Respondent before the Concession
Agreement was signed (see paragraph 157 of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions). While
the Concession Agreement has an entire agreement clause, the extrinsic evidence relating to
the context in which the agreement came about and how it was entered into is highly relevant
to assist with contractual interpretation. The starting point would be the bidding process
which led to the award of the MIBCS project to the Claimant. This is where we will turn our
attention to.

D. The Bidding Process

121 The first document we consider for this segment would be the RFP. The RFP stated
that the purpose of the MIBCS system was to enhance the border contro], maximise services
and monitor human trafficking and illegal movement of migrant workers [1CHB 100]. The
RFP also identified the issues and challenges in the Maldives that required “immediate
attention” to overcome. They were primarily related to the crime and problems caused by
illegal workers/immigrants who were involved in debt bondage, human trafficking, illegal
sex trade and wrongful detention, etc. [1CHB 104].

122 In the RFP, the basis for which the bidders should price their bids is clearly set out:

204

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 209 of 263

 

“Bidders will indicate in their price bid the total amount of fees to be paid during the
period of the BOT, i.e. 20 years. These fees will include all costs related to the BOT
project, namely the costs of:

a. Purchase of the equipment as specified in section 7

b. Operation of the Facility

d. Maintenance

e. Costs to cover all aspects of section 6 Employers Requirements”

[1CHB 127]

123 The intention of allowing the winning bidder to impose charges / taxes was to cover
all costs of the project, including operation and maintenance.

124 Furthermore, in the RFP, it is clear that the party with the lowest bid would be
awarded the contract.
“2.31 Comparison of Bids.
The MoFT shall compare all substantially responsive Bids to determine the lowest
evaluated bid, in accordance with ITB2.29.” {1CHB 124]

“2.32 Award Criteria

2.32.1 The MoFT shall award the Contract to the Bidder whose offer has been
determined to be the lowest evaluated bid and is substantially responsive to the
Bidding Document...”

(Emphasis added.) [1CHB 125]

125 All bidders had submitted their bids based on a ‘per passenger’ basis. There was no
concept of charging upon arrival and then again on departure. [See Dibena’s bid - IRBD
650, OSD’s/Iris’ bid - 1RBD 743, Informatics’ bid - 3RBD 1915 and their revised bid at
3RHB 1913]

 

 

126 As late as 21 September 2010, Informatics had revised its price bid downwards from
US$1 to “US $0.65 per - On Arrival I Only” (Emphasis in bold
original) [See 3RHB 1913].

 

127 The context of how the bid was awarded makes it clear that the Respondent’s
intention was for incoming tourists to be charged as low a price as possible. This was based
on legitimate concerns about the impact of the imposition of taxes on foreign passengers.
The Republic of Maldives is dependent on tourist arrivals for its economy and there were
concerns that the increase in taxes would cause tourist arrivals to decline.

128 The concern that imposing additional fees on tourists could cause tourist arrivals to
decline is well known, and coincidentally, is stated in a news article disclosed in this
arbitration [see Volume G - Bundle of GMR News Artictes, Page 3]. This article was written
on 27 June 2010 after the bidders had submitted their bids, but before the Respondent had
been awarded the contract. In a report on the Malé International Airport privatisation deal:

128.1 The opposition parties were quoted as stating that “a Majlis amendment is
necessary to raise the airport service charge from US$18 to USS25, which the
government has promised to GMR”.

205

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 210 of 263

 

128,2 Further, the president of People’s Alliance, Abdulla Yameen (the current
President of the Republic of Maldives) was quoted in the report as having stated that
“GMR’s fuel charges, airport tax and charges for flights landing at the airport

could cause tourist arrivals to decline”

 

128.3 The consideration how an increase in charges could lead to a decrease in
tourist arrivals is important when we subsequently deal with the Claimant’s absurd
postulation that the Respondent would benefit from the doubling of the charges
collected simply because it was entitled to a 5% of the charges that the Claimant
collected.

E. The Claimant’s draft unsigned financial bid shows that the parties did not
contemplate payment of a fee per arrival and per departure.

129 The Claimant has sought to use a “draft” concession agreement in its attempt to
explain how its $2 bid morphed into a $4 in total.

130 However, we can use the unsigned financial bid that the Claimant produced in this
arbitration to further examine this issue.

131 It is clear what was not in the Parties’ contemplation during the bidding process. The
Parties did not intend to charge passengers per arrival and per departure.

132 Furthermore, what is clear is that if the Claimant had intended to charge per arrival
and per departure in the actual Concession Agreement, it would have used the same phrase
found in its “draft” financial bid — ‘per passenger per arrival and per departure’. That phrase
is very clear, instead of ‘every passenger arriving into and departing from’.

133 It is clear that it was the parties’ intentions that the terms of the financial bid would be
incorporated in the Concession Agreement. The RFP specified that when submitting their

206

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 211 of 263

 

financial bids, parties had to agree to “(f) We understand that this bid, together with your
written acceptance thereof included in your notification of award, shall constitute a binding
contract between us, until a formal contract is prepared and executed”. (See the RFP [LCHB
155], and the incorporation of the term in the Claimant’s Financial Bid [2.2CHB 979]).

KE The Contract drafting process / “Extensive Negotiations”

@ There were no “Extensive Negotiations” between the Claimant and the
Respondent.

134. The Claimant has claimed, for the very first time, in its Closing Submissions that after
“extensive negotiations”, a bargain was struck that the Claimant would charge only non-
Maldivian passengers, but that they would be charged $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure.
Frankly, this amounts to evidence from the Claimant’s solicitors as it was never brought up in
evidence before.

135 For the following reasons, it is clear that the Claimant’s story in its Closing
Submissions about the alleged “extensive negotiations” and how such negotiations led to the
Claimant being able to charge foreign passengers a total of $4 is clearly an afterthought:

135.1 When confronted with the disparities between the draft financial bid [3CHB
1233] that the Claimant Factual Witness introduced as evidence (which stated that the
Respondent would charge $2 per passenger per arrival and per departure), and the
actual financial bid [2.2 CHB 257] (which did not have this phrase), the Claimant’s
Factual Witness was cornered and could only admit that the bid was for $2 per
passenger.

135.2 The Claimant’s Factual Witness did not address the white elephant in the room
- how the $2 bid then morphed into the $4 that the Claimant relied upon. He did not
mention the “extensive negotiations” and neither did his Counsel re-examine him on
this.

135.3. Furthermore, the Claimant’s Factual Witness had claimed to have filed his 3rd
Witness Statement in response to the “new factual allegations” in the Respondent's
Factual Witness’ 3rd Witness statement, which included the $2 / $4 issue. It is very
telling that despite the Respondent’s Factual Witness stating in the witness statement
that the Claimant’s bid “had been submitted on the basis that the charge of USD$2
was meant to cover both the arrival and departure of each passenger”, the Claimant’s
Factual Witness never alluded to the alleged subsequent “extensive negotiations” in
his 3rd Witness Statement (see paragraphs [55} to [59]).

136 This story is about the extensive negotiations is clearly made up:
136.1 The letter of award accepting the Claimant’s bid of $2 per arriving passenger
was sent on 29 September 2010 [See 3RBD 2104]. The Concession Agreement was

signed on 17 October 2010. It is illogical that the Claimant’s revenue for foreign
passengers would be allowed to double within a short period of less than three weeks.

207

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 212 of 263

 

136.2 The “extensive negotiations” were not recorded by either the Claimant or the
Respondent's officers.

136.3 This critical increase in charges for foreign passengers is not mentioned by
any of the individuals that ACC interviewed. (We note that the Claimant has relied
heavily upon certain statements, but ironically chose to criticise the interviewers as a
whole.)

(ii) Objectively, there is no justification for the Claimant’s claim to be able to charge
foreign y 's double after ivi: were excluded.

137 It is clear from the evidence that the Respondent’s officers was concerned that the
charges would be considered a tax and would be prohibited under Article 97 of the
Constitution (see for example Abdullah Muiz’s statement at [3RBD 2568]). A common law
principle exists — the High Court of Australia has held that where local citizens (who have the
right to enter their own country) are charged for immigration clearance without the provision
of additional services, this constitutes a tax - Air Caledonie International vy The
Commonwealth (1988) 165 CLR 462 [3RBA - Tab 3]. It is clearly understandable that
subsequent to the award of the MIBCS project, the parties then agreed to exclude local
Maldivians from the Charges. The purpose of the MIBCS system was, after all, to target
illegal workers and human traffickers. Many countries exempt their local citizens from
paying such fees / taxes.

138 There is no logical explanation why the Respondent would allow the Claimant to
effectively double its revenue after excluding Maldivian citizens from being charged. As we
show below (using 2009 figures), the parties knew that the Claimant had submitted a bid to
collect from US$2 from arriving passengers, which amounted to 844,300 passengers in 2009.
After subtracting the local Maldivians’”, there would still be 729,087 foreign passenger

  

arrivals. Why would the Respondent agree to let the Claimant claim US$2 from 729,087
foreign passengers both ways, effectively allowing them to collect 1.727 times the amount in
their financial bid?

139 In fact, the effect of charging foreign passengers twice would be even more apparent,
given that it was well within the parties’ contemplation that tourist arrivals were projected to
increase. As the parties’ financial experts have calculated, the total projected revenue
(charges) that could be collected by the Claimant over the remainder of the 20 years (taking
into account the growth in tourism arrivals) would be either US$37,740,652 ($2) or
US$58,790,178 ($4). This is a US $21 million difference in charges collected and obviously
of great importance - something which that the Claimant states was a result of extensive
negotiations in less than 3 weeks (but ironically, given its significance, was not recorded
anywhere).

140 As we have set out earlier, the charging of fees was intended to allow the successful
bidder to cover its costs of the project. The Claimant has not been able to explain the
additional value or services it would provide for an extra US$ 21 million.

141 When applying contextual interpretation, it is submitted that the Tribunal must find
that it does not make business common sense to conduct a tender, choose the lowest bidder

and then allow the successful bidder to revise his price upwards to receive an additional US

208

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 213 of 263

 

$21 million. The Claimant’s entire costs to undertake this project had to be specified under
the financial bid and accounted for in the form of the charges on each passenger arrival and
visa card issued. Objectively, there is simply no reason to subsequently grant the Claimant
the right to earn approximately US$1 million or more each year over a 20 year period without
any benefit to the Country.

142 It would have made business sense for the Charges to be based on foreign passenger
arrivals only. As we know, the Claimant has been extolling the profitability of the
Concession Agreement during the hearing. As the Financial Experts have calculated, the
Claimant's profit for the remainder of the concession period based on a total of US$ 2 per
foreign passenger is US$ 15.2 million. The projected profit makes it clear that restricting the
$2 charge to each foreign passenger would not have caused the Respondent to suffer any
losses.

143 At paragraph 173 of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions, the Claimant offered a
rather enticing argument of why the Respondent would have agreed to allow the Claimant to
double the charge imposed on foreign passengers. It claims that the Respondent would have
directly benefitted from the Claimant’s interpretation of the charging mechanism applying for
both arrivals and departures. As mentioned in earlier, this is absurd and far from the truth.

143.1 The Government wanted to minimise the tax/charges collected in order not to
cause tourist numbers to decline.

143.2. If the Respondent was concerned about tax revenue, it could have selected the
bidder whose relatively high bid combined with the relatively high royalty rate would
result in the largest amount of royalty, i.e. Dibena (which bid $10 per passenger and
offered a royalty of 3%, amounting to $0.30 of royalty per passenger (one way)) as
coinpared to the Respondent’s ($2 x alleged two way x 0.05% royalty, amounting to a
total royalty of $0.20 for both ways).

143.3 It is sad that the Claimant’s desire to benefit itself has made it assume that the
Respondent would also have functioned in the same way.

144 Insofar as the Claimant is trying to rely on what has been stated in Abdullah Muiz’s
statement to ACC to draw the conclusion that the amount of $2 was to be charged at the point
of arriving and a further $2 was to be charged at the point of departing, it must be borne in
mind that Mr Muiz was not involved at the bid process stage and therefore, he would not
have known that bid submitted by the Claimant was meant to be $2 in total for both arriving
and departing.

144.1 Mr Muiz mentioned in his statement that “in giving legal opinions, the
Attorney General’s Office would mainly look for Constitutional issues” [see 3RBD
2567]. Mr Muiz was mainly concerned about legal issues. For example, he did not
discuss an article allowing the revision of the charges that was, in his opinion, a
business decision as opposed to a legal issue. [See 2568 3RBD line 5}

144.2 When discussing Clause 5.2.1, his sole consideration for the charges was
whether they constituted a tax that would be in conflict with Article 97 of the
Constitution. [See 2568 3RBD lines 8 - 17]

209

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 214 of 263

 

145 Many people who took part in the contract discussions and in particular the 13
October 2010 meeting with the Claimant [3RBD 2116] were not even aware of the factual
matrix of how the tender had been awarded to the Claimant. A prime example would be
Ibrahim Afeef who admitted to ACC that he had “not even seen the Tender document”
[3RBD 2595].

146 Tying in with the later section on the dangers of using subsequent conduct to interpret
a contract, Mr Muiz’s statement was given on 24 October 2011 (more than a year after the
Concession Agreement was signed on 17 October 2010). Most significantly, the statement
was given when the $2 / $4 was a live issue and was being investigated by the ACC (contrary
to the Claimant’s suggestion at paragraph 177(c) of its Closing Submissions that the issue had
not surfaced):

146.1 The DOIE had submitted a cabinet paper to the Ministry of Home Affairs on
25 April 2011 {[3CHB 2262], seeking an opinion on whether the Concession
Agreement should be terminated [see 3RBD 2271]. In the paper, the DOJE created a
table which indicated that $2 would be collected from the foreigners who entered
Maldives and also $2 would be collected from foreigners who would leave Maldives
[see CBD 116 (English) and 3RBD 2265 (Dhivehi)].

146.2 Clearly, there was a chance that Mr Muiz had been influenced by the DOIE’s
opinion that the foreign passenger charge was $2 both ways when he gave his
statement to ACC.

146.3. This was a live issue was being investigated by the ACC, which issued its
report on 27 November 2011 {one month after interviewing Mr Muiz) stating that:
“Even though parts (i) and (ii) under clause 5.2.1 of the agreement states that Nexbis
would claim a fee of $2 as tax and $15 for every visa card issued from every tourist
entering and leaving the Maldives, the bid proposed by Nexbis stated that they would
claim a fee of $2 from every tourist passenger. Therefore it is noted that Nexbis
doubled the amount in contravention to what they proposed in the bid document.”
{(ARBD 150, paragraph 5.9.4.2].

146.4 Mr Muiz would have been aware that the ACC was investigating this issue.

146.5 Furthermore, two other individuals interviewed by ACC were not aware of
any discussion of the departure fee in the meetings. Amhed Waheed’s statement on
23 October 2011 [3RBD 2562] and Ibrahim Waheed’s statement on 25 October 2011
[3RBD 2579], given a day before and after Mr Muiz’s statement on 24 October 2011,
indicated that only the arrival fee was discussed in the meetings.

146.6 Clearly there are some problems with Mr Muiz’s evidence that was given a
year after the Concession Agreement was signed.

147 _— Even if Mr Muiz was really under the impression at the 13 October 2010 meeting that
$2 was meant to be charged per arrival and per departure, the Claimant has not provided any
evidence of how the $2 bid doubled and became $4. There is no evidence of this any
extensive negotiation relating to the doubling of the charge on foreign passengers.

(iii) The comparison between the ‘draft’ concession agreement and the Actual
Concession Agreement is unreliable and inconclusive

148 In light of the parties’ clear intentions for the bid terms to be transferred to the
Concession Agreement, it is submitted that the comparison done on the ‘draft’ and the actual
Concession Agreement by the Claimant at paragraph 162 of its Closing Submissions is
unhelpful.

149 ‘Firstly, the Respondent is unable to ascertain the status of the ‘draft’ concession
agreement [at 4CHB 2364].

150 It is reiterated that no evidence has ever been led by the Claimant on this ‘draft’ or
any other drafts for that matter.

151 The Claimant attributes the ‘draft’ as the copy that was given to Mr Abdullah Muiz to
review based on various statements in the ACC Report (which it has greatly criticised), It
comes to the conclusion based on the following points:

151.1 Ibrahim Afeef and Abdullah Waheed went to see Mr Muiz with a draft.

151.2 There is a slightly illegible handwritten note “07/10 Afeef and Abd [illegible]
Waheed visits [illegible]” on the ‘draft’ at [4CHB 2360].

151.3 Abdullah Muiz stated that arbitration shouJd be in Singapore, not Malaysia.

151.4 The ‘draft’ provided for arbitration in Malaysia and the actual Concession
Agreement provided for arbitration in Singapore.

151.5 Therefore the ‘draft? was an early draft which was amended after AGO’s
opinion on it has been sought, and parties negotiated its terms further (see paragraph
160 of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions).

152 This conclusion is based on very tenuous conjectures. How can the presence of a
Malaysian arbitration clause indicate that the AG’s Office had reviewed that specific
document? Furthermore, whether Mr Muiz had actually met with Ibrahim Afeef and Ahmed
Waheed is unclear:

152.1 Firstly, Mr Muiz said that it was the Controller Ilyas who came to the AG’s
office with the draft agreement. [3RBD 2567] He did not state that he met Ibrahim
Afeef and Abdullah Waheed.

152.2 Ibrahim Afeef stated that he was functioning in the capacity of DOIE’s lawyer
[3RBD 2593]. This was confirmed by the Controller Ilyas who stated that “Jn
drafting the main parts of the agreement, advice was sought from immigrations legal
counsel, Ibrahim Afeef.” {3CBD 2552] Mr Muiz did not appear to know of Ibrahim
Afeef?s existence. Mr Muiz stated that “J was informed that the draft was prepared
and sent by the successful bidder of the Border Control project, Nexbis Lid. Since
there was no lawyer working in the Imunigration at that time and since there was no

211

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 216 of 263

 

such agreement among the bidding documents prepared by Immigration, I do not
believe that the agreement was drafted by Immigration.”

153 Further, it was not recorded in Mr Muiz’s statement that he recommended arbitration
in Singapore. Instead, this was attributed to Mr Muiz by Ibrahim Afeef in his statement
[BRBD 2594}.

154 A more disturbing reason exists as to why the Tribunal should disregard Ibrahim
Afeef’s evidence. As set out above, the Claimant has relied on Ibrahim Afeef’s statement to
the ACC dated 27 October 2011 [3RBD 2595}. But in the cabinet paper submitted by DOIE
on 25 April 2011 [CBD 116], it was noted that “The lawyer who represented the Immigration
department the Deputy Director General, Mr. Ibrahim Afeef (Gulbahaaruge, B.
Thulhaadhoo) during the inception of this project is now representing Nexbis. This was
confirmed when Mr. Ibrahim Afeef attended as the lawyer of Nexbis for a meeting held
between this department and Nexbis on March 28th, 2011.” Ibrahim Afeef had come from
advising DOIE to representing the Claimant on the same matter within 5 months after the
signing of the Concession Agreement. When he gave his evidence to ACC, he was Nexbis’
lawyer (something which he failed to declare). Clearly his evidence cannot be relied on.

155 In light of these doubtful circumstances and the Claimant’s dubious conclusions, it is
submitted that the ‘draft’ concession agreement cannot be relied upon.

156 Secondly, even if the ‘draft’ could be relied upon, the Claimant’s submission that the
bargain struck in the Concession Agreement was for it to only charge foreign passengers
twice, is merely its subjective intention/interpretation. It is not disputed that Maldivian
passengers will not be charged. What is disputed is whether the Claimant is entitled to
charge foreign passengers twice.

157. Without considering the Claimant’s subjective intention/interpretation, the
comparison performed by the Claimant does not objectively elucidate the matter. The
Respondent has already pointed out earlier that Clause 12.3 of the Concession Agreement
allows the Claimant to only claim charges multiplied by passengers entering into or departing
from the Maldives.

158 The question then goes back to what was discussed in the earlier section: is the phrase
“entering into and departing from” to be read conjunctively or disjunctively.

159 A possible argument might be that addition of the phrase “departing from” should
mean something. Jt is unclear how and why this phrase was introduced, but the Respondent’s
submission is that it is meant to be conclusive that the Claimant was only allowed to charge
$2 for each passenger.

  

160 Therefore, such comparison does not provide any helpful insight into the parties’
objective intentions.

{iv) The Claimant drafted the Concession Agreement but repeatedly denied doing so
161 ‘It has thus far been unclear which party drafted the Concession Agreement. The

Respondent’s position has always been that the Claimant drafted the Concession Agreement.

212

162

The Claimant’s Factual Witness’ testimony was that the Claimant did not draft the

Concession Agreement.

163

Transcripts, Day 1, Page 83, lines 22 to 23

Q. Did the draft come from Nexbis, "yes" or "no"?
A. No.

Transcripts, Day 1, Pages 84 to 85, starting from line 12

Q ... Just to help you, volume 3, you start at page 2567. You will see that the person
who gave the statement to ACC is Abdullah Muiz. To be fair to you, I will inform you,
and you can take it from me that Abdullah Muiz was the Solicitor-General at that
time. Okay? This is a statement he gave. If you turn to the next two pages, page
2569, at the right at the top, Solicitor-General said: "The Attorney-General's Office
was not asked to assist in a drafting of the agreement signed between the Government
of Maldives and Nexbis to establish the Maldives Border Control System. I was
informed that a draft was prepared and sent by the successful bidder of the border
control project, Nexbis Limited." Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. So we have a statement from the Solicitor-General, so I have a basis to ask: it
was Nexbis who prepared the draft and had forwarded it to Mr Ilyas. Is that correct
or is that wrong?

A. No, that's not correct.

Q. Okay.

The Claimant’s Opening S also ioned that the C jon Agi

 

was “drafted by the DoIE” [Transcripts Day 1, Page 20, Lines 16 to 19].

164

As the Claimant has stated in its Closing Submissions that the document at [at 4CHB

2364] is the draft concession agreement, this has shed new light into who drafted the
Concession Agreement. Following the Claimant’s comparison of the ‘draft’ concession
agreement against the actual Concession Agreement, the Respondent has also performed the
same comparison and have uncovered certain clues in both documents which objectively
indicate that it was drafted by the Claimant:

164.1 Firstly, the document is marked “Draft 290710” at the top, very likely 29 July
2010. This was a time when the price bids had not even been opened by the
Respondent and it would not have prepared a draft with the Claimant’s name. It is
slightly intriguing to see that the Claimant was so certain at that point of time that it
would be awarded the tender and had started drafting the agreement between the
Respondent, its potential subsidiary and itself.

164.2 Secondly, in the draft document, the definition of ‘Working Day’ is “a day
other than - (a) Saturdays, Sundays...” [4CHB 2370}. However, Sundays are
working days in the Maldives and this definition could only have been drafted by
someone who was unfamiliar with the Maldivian work week. In the actual
Concession Agreement, this has been changed to reflect that the Maldivian weekends
are on Fridays and Saturdays [1CHB 32].

213

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 218 of 263

 

164.3 Thirdly, it was stated in the draft that the governing law of the contract would
be the laws of Malaysia and that parties submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Malaysian Courts [4CHB 2393]. Furthermore, it was also stated that any arbitration
was to be held in Malaysia [4CHB 2391]. As any person who is familiar with
drafting contracts would know, these are positions normally taken by the party that
drafted the contract, which would then be subject to negotiations. It is not plausible
that the Respondent’s officers would have chosen Malaysian courts / laws over their
own legal system.

164.4 Fourthly, at [4CHB 2392] the ‘Notice to the Company’ was filled in with the
Claimant’s details, while the Notice to the Respondent was left blank. Again, a party
that drafted the contract would normally fill in these details.

164.5 Finally, the most surprising portion in the ‘draft’ is the Clause on royalty
payments to the Respondent. At [4CHB 2380], it is specified that:

“8.4 Royalty

The company agree to pay to the Government a royalty fee amounting to 5% on
project net profits declared by the Company annually for the duration of the
Concession Period or until such time the Government implements a corporate profit
tax or GST.” (Emphasis added.)

164.6 The position on the royalty is clearly wrong. The RFP contained a template
‘Letter of Price Bid’ which stated that royalty of a certain percentage was to be paid
on the income [1CHB 154]. The Claimant’s financial bid proposed that the royalty to
be paid to the Respondent was 5% of the Claimant’s income_on a monthly basis
[2.2CHB 979]. The Respondent’s Ministry of Finance and Treasury had also
recorded a similar position “Royalties of 5% of the gross revenue per year for 20
years.” in its letter to the DOIE, informing them that the Claimant had been awarded
the MIBCS project. [3RBD 2104]. The Respondent’s officers would never have
reduced the 5% royalty on income to 5% royalty on the Claimant's project net profits.

165 Therefore, based on the five clues above, it is clear that the Claimant had drafted the
contract but mysteriously chose to deny it. Two of the Respondent’s ex-officers Controller
Ilyas and Samee Ageel (who have been charged with corruption) claimed to have drafted the
Concession Agreement and their motives for lying must be questioned. We will discuss these
two individuals further below in the section on corruption.

166 Since the Claimant has raised the issue of the drafts, a question arises: did the
Respondent amend any further portion of the Concession Agreement? The only
documentation/record of any amendments to the Concession Agreement was for a meeting on
13 October 2010 [3RBD 2116(Eng.) and 2106 (Dhivehi)] where there was a discussion of
amendments to the draft Concession Agreement. The record was made in both English and
Dhivehi (this is because even though many of the Respondent’s officers are fluent in English,
it is stil] their second language and they are more comfortable in Dhivehi).

167 The evidence is that the Respondent did not suggest any further amendment in

relation to the charges. If the Respondent had made further amendments to the Concession
Agreement, it would have been recorded in both English and Dhivehi minutes.

(v) The unexplained ‘draft’ financial bid [CHB 1233]

168 According to the Claimant, the parties had only come to a conclusion that the
Claimant would be allowed to charge foreign passengers $2 both ways after the extensive
negotiations that took place after the award of the tender to the Claimant.

169 Most intriguingly, when and why did the Claimant modify the Respondent’s RFP
template ‘Letter of Price Bid’ [1CHB 154] from “per passenger” to the phrase in its ‘draft’
financial bid — “per passenger per arrival and per departure” [3CHB 1233]?

170 ‘It was stated in the RFP at paragraph 2.1.6 that “any condition, qualification or other
stipulation contained in the bid shall make it liable to rejection”. Paragraph 2.11.1 of the RFP
stated that the “MoFT will evaluate only those Bids that are received in the required formats
and complete in all respects”.

171 If Claimant wanted to bid for $2 per passenger per arrival and per departure, would it
not be simpler to just bid $4 per passenger as per the RFP template?

172 Why was this document disclosed by the Claimant’s Factual Witness in this
arbitration and why was it passed off as “Claimant’s Financial Bid Document” dated 25 May
2010? [See the Index to the CHB, s/n 4]. One must wonder whether this document was
simply created to support its claim that it was entitled to charge $2 both ways.

G. Subsequent conduct

173 Much have been said by the Claimant about the lack of protest from the DOIE
officers with regard to the invoiced amounts which charged foreign passengers a total of $4.

174 It is important during the consideration of the subsequent conduct of the parties to
note a very simple point - no charges were ever collected by the Claimant or the Respondent
from any passenger. None of the parties had actually collected money and checked their
tights against the Concession Agreement.

175 It is clear that the DOIE officials thought that the terms of the Concession Agreement
were in accordance with the Claimant's financial bid.

175.1 This position was conveyed by Mohamed Ali, the Controller of Immigration,
in his letter dated 1 November 2012 to the Speaker of Parliament [3RBD 2619]. The
new Controller stated: “The decision to take $2 as tax from every foreigner entering
and leaving the Maldives and to levy a charge of $15 for every Visa Card issued was
done _so after the proposal made by Nexbis was studied by the Tender Evaluation
Board.”

175.2 The DOIE officers were not part of the financial evaluation. Ibrahim Afeef
stated in his statement to the ACC that “Although it was a project of Immigration,
everything regarding the Project was done by Finance, as the President had asked to
do all work regarding the project by a third party since it might facilitate an act of
corruption if it was done by Immigration. No other work was assigned to Immigration

215

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 220 of 263

 

apart from signing the agreement.” [3RBD 2595]. He had also never seen the tender
documents.

176 It is rei d that the individual that signed the C ion A on behalf of
the Respondent, Ilyas had been quoted shortly after the Concession Agreement was signed as
saying that “a USS2 fee is to be charged from every foreigner entering the country” [6CHB
4255 & 4257].

 

177 _ As for other individuals, it is submitted that it is dangerous to rely on the subsequent
conduct of individuals that (i) were not involved in the tender process and the drafting of the
Concession Agreement, or (ii) only came on board at a later stage.

177.1 Individuals who were not involved in the tender process and the drafting of the
Concession Agreement would not be aware of the live issues.

177.2 Individual who were not involved in the award and signing of the MIBCS
project could be influenced by the ‘conventional wisdom’ (which may be right or
wrong) that was passed down. If their subsequent conduct is relied upon, there may
be the risk that the individual may have internalised any falsehood" and merely
stated the currently acceptable position at that point of time.

 

178 The Claimant makes a good point about the dangers of using subsequent conduct to
interpret a contract. At [173] of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions, the Claimant stated that
“t]he overwhelming evidence is that the DOIE, as the department that conceived,
consummated and carried out the MIBCS Project, had invariably internalised the revenue
model of every foreigner paying $2 upon arrival and upon departure...”

179 Any right minded individual who was actually part of the tender process would
definitely question why the Claimant was collecting twice the amount that it bid.

180 There is an even more important reason why subsequent conduct should not be used
and this was explained in Y.E.S. F&B by the Singapore Court of Appeal. It did not give
subsequent conduct much weight because:

[74] “As we pointed out to counsel during the hearing, there was not much assistance to be
derived from the parties’ subsequent conduct when the object of the interpretive exercise was
to discern the parties' intentions at the time of entering into the contract. Indeed, there are
dangers in placing too much weight on such evidence because it can, with the benefit of
hindsight, be shaped to suit each party's position.”

(Emphasis added.)

181 In other words, a party would be at liberty to pick and choose the conduct that suits
him. This appears to be exactly what the Claimant has done, choosing what suits its case
theory and ignoring others which go against it.

182. An example would be when the Claimant claimed that the Tribunal should pay
attention to ACC’s interpretation as it had taken the view that the Concession Agreement had
specified $4 (and recommended Controller Ilyas to be charged for conferring an undue
advantage). This is one of the rare occasions where the Claimant has agreed with ACC
(when it suits its case).

216

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 221 of 263

 

182.1 In any event, ACC had, in its 24 January 2011 letter [see [7.1(ii)] of 3 RBD
2232] stated that under Clause 12.3 the Government has to pay charges for passenger
arrivals, without any mention of charges for departures. In relation to Clause 5.2.1,
ACC merely repeated the wording of the clause “every foreigner arriving and
departing from Maldives a fee of 2 USD will be taken”.

182.2 The ACC report was published on 27 November 2011. By then, it had been
widely propagated that the fee was $4. As mentioned above, DOJE had submitted a
cabinet paper to MHA on 25 April 2011 with calculations indicating payment of a
total of $4 [CBD 116].

182.3 As for the reason why the PG did not charge Ilyas for conferring an advantage
on the Claimant, there are a myriad of reasons why Ilyas was not charged. The
Claimant postulates that the Ilyas could not have been responsive for conferring the
advantage because there were many individuals involve. Another possible
explanation could be that the PG was of the view that the Concession Agreement had
specified $2 and Ilyas had not conferred an advantage on the Claimant. These are all
mere conjectures.

H. Conclusion on the $2 / $4 issue

183 The Tribunal should not place any weight on the Claimant’s story about extensive
negotiations for the following reasons.

184 As the Claimant had been awarded the highest score for the Price Bids because it had
submitted the lowest bid {including submitting a price of $0 for work permits and thereby
receiving the full score of 10 marks for that section while the rest of the bidders received
zero), it is a bit rich for the Claimant to now suggest that it was allowed to double its revenue
for one of the two segments that it actually submitted a price for.

185 The Claimant has not provided any credible evidence about such extensive
negotiations. None of the individuals interviewed by ACC mentioned anything about the
change in the bid price of $2 to the Claimant’s version of $4 in the Concession Agreement.
The comparison between the draft agreement and the actual Concession Agreement is
unreliable due to the weak conjunctures and inconclusive in its results.

186 Furthermore, the Claimant’s story is incredible. The context of the signing of the
Concession Agreement was that the Respondent had called for a RFP which specified that the
lowest bidder would be selected, and had selected the Claimant based on its lowest financial
bid. The potential that any imposition of charges may result in a decline in tourist arrivals
was prevalent in the Respondent’s mind. Clearly, allowing the Claimant to double an aspect
of its price bid would be very unfair to the other bidders and against the very purpose and
spirit of the tender - which was to obtain, for the Republic of Maldives, the best value for the
project.

187. The Claimant has picked and chose the subsequent conduct (statements to ACC made

by various individuals or submissions to cabinet, etc.) to bolster its case. Very little weight
should be ascribed to these as the conduct involves individuals which (i) had a fleeting part to

217

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 222 of 263

 

play, (ii) was involved at a later stage, (iii) or was charged for corruption. Furthermore,
statements were given about 5 to 12 months after the event.

188 In light of the above, we have shown how the Claimant’s explanation for the
unwarranted increase in fees is an afterthought, cannot be believed and is contrary to business
common sense. The Claimant had submitted a bid for $2 for passenger arrivals and after
excluding a small amount of Maldivians passengers, could not objectively have been allowed
to double its charges for all foreign arrivals, entitling it to an extra US $21 million in profit.

®* [498]-[517] provide as follows:
Damages should be limited to the time the Claimant went into Administration.

498. As set out earlier, the Claimant had entered into Voluntary Administration in 30 June
2014.

499. In the event that the Tribunal finds that the Respondent had wrongfully terminated the
Concession Agreement or had committed a repudiatory breach of the Concession Agreement,
then it is submitted that damages should be limited to the time that the Claimant went into
administration or that such a fact should be taken into account to reduce the amount of
damages payable to the Claimant.

500. The basis for the submission is simple. The general principle that applies to the
question of the appropriate measure of compensatory damages is found in Livingstone v
Rawyards Coal Co. where Lord Blackburn defined the measure of damages as:

“that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured, or who has suffered, in
the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is
now getting his compensation or reparation.”

501. In the context of damages arising out of contract, there is an alternative way of
framing the general rule. It was stated by Parke B. in Robinson v Harman as follows:

“The rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a
breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation,
with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.”

502. After the landmark case of Golden Strait Corporation v Nippon Yusen Kubishika
Kaisha (“The Golden Victory"), an additional gloss has been added to the traditional
compensatory principle typically espoused by the Courts. Presently, the Courts caution
against an assessment of damages that provide a windfall to the claimant. Thus, the Court
held in Flame SA v Glory Wealth Shipping Pte Lid

“Thus, the object of damages is to put the innocent party in the same position, and in
no better position than, that he would have been in had the contract been performed.”
(Emphasis ours)
503. When quantifying the damages, a line of authority starting from The Mihalis Angelos
(‘The Mihalis Angelos”) and The Golden Victory have established the following principles:

218

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 223 of 263

 

 

503.1. Damages may be reduced if an event had occurred such that a contracting party would
have had the option of terminating the contract

503.2. Damages may be reduced if an event would inevitably occur, and
503.3. Damages may be reduced if an event may occur.
(i) Limitation of damages if an event had occurred or would inevitably occur

504. In The Golden Victory, the Court dealt with a war clause that entitled the defendant-
charterer to terminate the contract. As a matter of fact, the war in question did break out,
entitling the defendant-charterer to terminate the contract. The majority judgement held that,
events occurring post-breach would be considered in the assessment of damages. In
particular, Lord Carswell cited (at [393]) Lord Macnaghten in Bwlifa and Merthyr Dare
Steam Collieries (1891) Ltd v Pontypridd Waterworks Co [1903] AC 426, 43] as follows:

“Why should he listen to conjecture on a matter which has become an accomplished
fact? Why should he guess when he can calculate? With the light before him, why
should he shut his eyes and grope in the dark?”

505. On the issue of whether the defendant-charterer should pay damages for the whole
period from 17 December 2001 to 6 December 2005 (the earliest date for the contractual
redelivery of the vessel) or to 20 March 2003 (the date which the defendant-charterer would
have been entitled to terminate the contract), the Court held that the defendant-charterer
should only pay damages up until 20 March 2003.

506. Thus, if at the date of breach there had been a real possibility that an event would
happen terminating the contract or otherwise reducing those contractual benefits, and such
event did happen, the quantum of damages will be reduced proportionately to take into
account what had actually occurred.

507. Similarly, in cases where an event had not occurred, but would have inevitably
occurred to terminate the contract, such events may also be taken into account in the
assessment of damages. In The Mihalis Angelos, the defendant-charterer had the option of
cancelling the contract if the vessel was not ready to load by July 20, 1965. The ship was at
Hong Kong on July 17, 1965, and could not possibly have reached Haiphong (the loading
port) by July 20, 1965. Only nominal damages were awarded to the plaintiff-owners in The
Mihalis Angelos since the defendant-charterer in question would have been entitled to cancel
the charterparty on the basis that the ship would have, inevitably, failed to arrive at the
loading port by July 20.

508. As set out earlier, the Claimant had been stripped of its assets, had no revenue or trade
receivables, owed directors’ fees and expenses incurred on ils behalf. As the Claimant’s
Factual Witness confirmed during cross examination [Transcripts, Day 1, Page 109, Line 18]:

Q. So you're saying again that if I showed you earlier a letter from your counsel, if

you need the reference again, 4CHB 2692.
A. Yes.

219

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 224 of 263

 

Q. At paragraph 6, the claimant had said to its counsel that the respondent's conduct
significantly contributed to the claimant's financial impecuniosity, and the first reason
given was the delay in implementing the MIBCS. Now you're saying that's not really
true, that's not the reason, correct? It was more the issue of corruption floating up in
the open market out there, correct?

A. Yeah, on the basis of specific -- specifics, yes.

509. As we have blished, the Respondent was not ‘ible for the allegations of
corruption against the Claimant. These allegations were investigated by the ACC, which is
an independent entity.

510. The Claimant’s Factual Witness had stated that the Claimant had to go into voluntary
administration to enable its parent company to settle the debts [see Transcripts, Day 2, page
160]:

MR VERGIS: Yeah, I'll just ask a few questions. How long was the company in
administration.
A. About four months.
Q. And what was the outcome of the administration?
A. A scheme of arrangement was established with the creditors to deal with
remaining outstanding amounts owed to them.
. And was that approved?
Yes.
. And subsequent to that, what has become of the claimant?
. The claimant is, I believe, back into solvency, yes.
Okay. That is as much as we know on this issue.
. May I elaborate a bit more?
Yes.
The other element of going into this voluntary administration is to enable the
parent company, Aseana One, to be able to settle the debts of the company to its
creditors. That was part of the reason why we had to go into that voluntary
administration.
ARBITRATOR: All right.
(Emphasis added)

POPOPOPO

511. The Claimant had to do so because it had no assets or revenue to settle its liabilities.
Further, the Claimant had entered into a scheme of arrangement with its creditors (see the
Deed of Company Arrangement dated 23 October 2014, [6CHB 3927]}), as we highlighted
earlier, the parent company could not settle all debts but merely paid some and transferred the
rest to a creditor’s trust).

512. As the Claimant (i) had stopped paying its former Chief Financial Officer (Peter
Dykes) who resigned when the Claimant was delisted on or around July 2012, (ii) became
insolvent and entered into voluntary administration on 30 June 2014, and (iii) entered into an
arrangement with its creditors on 23 October 2014, if the Concession Agreement was still
afoot, the Respondent would have been able to terminate based on Clause 11.1.1(ii) which
states:

“11.1 Default Events by Company

220

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 225 of 263

 

11.1.1 Events of Default
If at any time:

(ii) the Company goes into liquidation or a receiver is appointed over the assets of the
Company or the Company makes an assignment for the benefit of or enters into an
arrangement or composition with its creditors or stops payment or is unable to pay its
debt;

then the Government shall, have the right to terminate this Concession Agreement
forthwith by giving notice to that effect.

513. Therefore, based on the above principles, the Respondent submits that if it is found to
have breached the Concession Agreement, any damages awarded to the Claimant should be
limited to 10% because the Claimant (i) had stopped payments since July 2012 and/or been
declared insolvent on 30 June 2014, and (ii) had entered into an assignment with its creditors
in October 2014, and would only have performed the contract for 2 years out of the 20 year
term.

(ii) Limitation of damages if an event may occur

514. Further and in the alternative, it is submitted that there remained a real possibility that
the Claimant would have gone into administration regardless of whether the Respondent had
terminated the Concession Agreement on 5 August 2013.

515. The Court in The Golden Victory stated, in obiter, that damages would be reduced in
the following scenario:

(1) Contingencies at the date of assessment of damages, which might have reduced or
extinguished the loss, may be taken into account when assessing damages, provided it was a
real possibility (including one less than 50%)

(2) Damages would be reduced proportionately with respect to the possibility of the event
occurring

515.1. Lord Carswell accepted that a real possibility of an event occurring could reduce the
value of a contract, and in turn, the damages recoverable. He stated as follows:

“The damages can be assessed at the date of repudiation by valuing the chance that
the contingency would occur and that the charter would be cancelled, an approach
accepted by Lord Mance at para 23 of his judgment at p 543. That value might lie
anywhere on the scale between extreme unlikelihood, which would give the deduction
a minimal value, to virtual certainty, which would mean that it would be assessed at a
figure very close to that which would be reached if one made the definite assumption
that the contingency would occur.”

515.2. In support of his proposition, Lord Carswell drew strength from tort authorities in loss
of a chance cases:

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 226 of 263

 

“This approach is well known and recognised in other areas of the law. It is
commonplace in the assessment of damages for personal injuries to award a sum
which reflects the chance that a condition such as osteoarthritis may set in.”

515.3. Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood accepted that a real possibility of an event
occurring (even if it were below 50%), could properly be taken into account to reduce the
value of a contract, and in turn, the damages recoverable. He stated as follows:

“As Lord Denning MR said in the Mihalis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164,196: “You must
take into account all contingencies which might have reduced or extinguished the
loss.” It was hardly a novel proposition.”

“T understand both Lord Bingham and my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of
Gestingthorpe, to accept that account should properly be taken of a contingency
which would reduce the value of the contract lost even were the chance of it
happening less than 50% (provided always that it was of some real and not just
minimal significance)”

515.4. Lord Bingham accepted that a likely albeit not certain event, could reduce the value of
a contract, and in turn, the damages recoverable. He stated as follows:

“T can readily accept that the value of a contract in the market may be reduced if
terminable on an event which the market judges to be likely but not certain, but that is
not what the arbitrator found to be the fact in this case.”

515.5. However, Lord Bingham declined to reduce the damages however, accepting the
arbitrator’s finding of fact that war was “merely a possibility” at the date of assessment of
damages. He stated as follows:

“By describing the prospect of war in December 2001 as “merely a possibility”, the
expression twice used by the arbitrator in para 59 of his reasons, the arbitrator can
only have meant that it was seen as an outside chance, not affecting the marketable
value of the charter at that time.”

515.6. In The Golden Victory, Lord Walker accepted that contingencies as at the date of
breach could be taken into account when assessing the damages recoverable

“In my opinion the arbitrator erred only in not following his own instinct at para 56
towards the owners’ “more orthodox” approach. He concluded, wrongly in my view,
that The Seaflower [2000] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 37 required him to look at later events as a
guide to what was inevitable, rather than looking at the position (and weighing
contingencies in an appropriate case) as at the date of breach.”

515.7. Together with Lord Bingham, Lord Walker declined to reduce the damages however,
accepting that war was a “mere possibility” at the date of assessment of damages. He stated
as follows:

“In this case an objective and well-informed observer, Jooking at the matter in
December 2001, would have thought, not only that the prospect of the war clause

222

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 227 of 263

 

option becoming exercisable was not inevitable (in the sense of being predicable with
confidence equal, or closely approximating, to 100%) but that it was a mere
possibility carrying little or no weight in commercial terms.”

515.8. Lord Scott accepted that a real possibility of an event occurring, could reduce the
value of a contract, and in turn, the damages recoverable. He stated as follows:

“If a contract for performance over a period has come to an end by reason of a
repudiatory breach but might, if it had remained on foot, have terminated early on the
occurrence of a particular event, the chance of that event happening must, it is agreed,
be taken into account in an assessment of the damages payable for the breach.”

“If there were a real possibility that an event would happen terminated the contract, or
in some way reducing the contractual benefit to which the damages claimant would, if
the contract had remained on foot, have become entitled, then the quantum of
damages might need, in order to reflect the extent of the chance that the possibility
might materialise, to be reduced proportionately.”

516. In effect, if the Tribunal finds that there was a real possibility that an event of
termination was likely to occur, the damages will be reduced to the extent that the event of
termination was likely to occur.

517. Therefore, based on the above principles, the Respondent submits that, further and/or
in the alternative, if it is found to have breached the Concession Agreement, any damages
awarded to the Claimant should be limited to 35% because of the real possibility that the
Claimant may have (i) gone into administration / became insolvent, (ii) entered into an
assignment with its creditors, or (iii) stopped payments soon after 5 August 2013.

* The Respondent’s submissions are set out at [465]-[]490] of the Closing Submissions:
Alternative B

465 For ‘Alternative B’, the Claimant seeks “common law damages, being loss of net
profits it would have earned through the gross revenues generated through the Foreign
Traveller Charges and Foreign Worker Charges”.

466 —_Inrelation to this, we explore the issue of whether the Claimant was entitled to charge
a total of $2 or $4 per foreign passenger.

The Claimant had admitted that it submitted a bid for $2 per foreign

467 It is uncontroversial that the Claimant had submitted a bid for $2 per foreign
passenger in total for the MIBCS tender. During cross-examination, the Claimant’s Factual
Witness was asked :

[Transcripts, Day I, Page 137,Line 12]

“when Nexbis did the bid, their final bid, it was very clear that they were only going

to charge $2 per passenger, not $4 for two ways, correct?”

223

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 228 of 263

 

468

469

The Claimant Factual Witness admitted:
“it appears so”.

The parties’ intentions were clearly to charge each foreign passenger a total of $2.

Was it $2 or $4 per foreign passenger?

470

The Claimant admits submitting $2 in its tender bid, and yet it claims that the charge

is $4 in the Concession Agreement. The Claimant might feign ignorance on other facts
surrounding the terms of the Concession Agreement but surely not this. How did the $2 in
the tender bid become the $4 that the Claimant asserts? The Claimant has failed to provide
any explanation whatsoever. This must be kept in mind when examining the relevant clauses
of the Concession Agreement.

47)

471.1

4712

AN.

4A

The relevant portions of the Concession Agreement are:
“1.1 Definitions

Charges USD 2,00 (UNITED STATES DOLLAR TWO ONLY) for every
passenger using a non-Maldivian passport arriving into and departing from the
Republic of Maldives”

“5.2.1 The Company is authorised by the Government to impose upon and collect levy
or fee from:
i. Each and every passenger using non-Maldivian passport arriving into and
departing from the Republic of Maldives, a fee of USD2.00 (UNITED STATES
DOLLAR TWO ONLY) per passenger via a levy or fee imposed or to be imposed by
the Government to be charged on such passenger.”

“5.2.7 All invoices for the Charges shall be calculated in accordance with the price
mechanisms set out in Appendix B.”

Appendix B states:

“Payment of Charges collected by the Government on behalf of the Company
throughout the Concession Period shall be as follows:

1.1 The Government shall pay the Company on the following schedule:-

1.1.1 For each and every non-Maldivian passport holder passenger arriving into and
departing from the Republic of Maldives, the Government agrees to charge and
collect a levy or fee for onward payment to the Company of USD2.00 (UNITED
STATES DOLLAR TWO ONLY) per passenger.”

The Claimant’s Factual Witness has admitted that there is ambiguity with the term
[Transcripts, Day 1, Page 132, Line 2]:

ARBITRATOR: You admit there's an ambiguity, is it?

A. The language could be better, certainly.

224

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 229 of 263

 

473 It is submitted that the statement “/eJach and every passenger using non-Maldivian
passport arriving into and departing from the Republic of Maldives” simply was for $2 to be
collected from a foreign passenger arriving into and subsequently departing from the
Republic of Maldives.

The Evidence, including the surrounding circumstances

474 The original Request for Proposal issued to the bidders contained a sample Letter of
Price Bid (1CHB 154) which indicated that the propose fee should be submitted based on the
following: (i) per passenger, (ii) per work permit, and (iii) per visa card.

475 The Claimant submitted its Financial Bid on or around 30 May 2012. To the
Proposed Fee per unit, the Claimant stated that “The proposed Fee seeks to recuperate the
costs by charging a fee on each incoming passenger and the work visa for foreign workers.”
[2.2CHB 971] The proposed fee was stated would be USD2 per passenger (see [2.2CHB
972, 975, and 978)).

476 However, the Claimant’s Factual Witness disclosed another version which indicated
that the fee would be “USD2 (UNITED STATES DOLLAR TWO) per passenger (per arrival
and departurey” (see [3CHB 1215, 1230, 1233]) (see also [3CHB 1230] where another
addition was made — “Nexbis proposes the USD2 charge for each passenger (per arrival and
departure)”. This version was not signed. Notably, the words “The proposed Fee seeks to
recuperate the costs by charging a fee on each incoming passenger...” was still included in
the Claimant’s unsigned version [CHB 1229].

476.1 During cross-examination, the Claimant’s Factual Witness was confronted with the
discrepancy between the executed version and the unsigned version that he converted into
PDF on 25 July 2015 [see Transcripts, Day 1, Pages 130-137]. He provided a weak answer,
claiming that he “only managed to secure whatever draft” [see Transcripts, Day 1, Page
136}.

476.2. He was then asked “when Nexbis did the bid, their final bid, it was very clear that
they were only going to charge $2 per passenger, not $4 for two ways, correct?” and
admitted that “it appears so”. [see Transcripts, Day 1, Page 137, Line 12]

477 _ Contemporaneous evidence show that the intention of the parties was for the charges
to be $2 per passenger

477.1 At the 25"" Meeting of the Tender Evaluation Board 2010, [RBD 2009], it was
recorded that Nexbis had “issued pricing” of “Passenger Fee: USD 2”.

477.2 In the letter from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury dated 29 September 2010 to
the DOJE [RBD 2014], it was stated that the Claimant had submitted the best proposal and
their proposal was US $2 for the passenger fee. The Claimant’s price proposal (which the
Claimant’s Factual Witness admitted was only $2 per passenger instead of $4) was attached
with the Ministry’s letter.

478 — As the Claimant had submitted a bid for $2, it is very strange for it to claim that the
Concession Agreement provided for $4 to be collected. That has not been explained.

479 The Recitals of the Concession Agreement state:

“WHEREAS

A. The Company has submitted a proposal via the competitive Technical and
Price Bid submitted for the Maldives Immigration Border Control System Under
BOT Mechanism Tender (Project No.: TEB/2010/01) to the Government to design,
supply, install, deploy, support and maintain the MIBCS (as defined herein).

B. The Government has evaluated and accepted the proposal submitted by the
Company and its group being, among others, the competitive solution with the highest
final scoring on technical and price bid in the said Tender, and has by a letter of
award Ref: 13-K/PRV/2010/2], dated 29 September 2010 awarded the Concession
(as defined herein) on a Build, Operate, Transfer (BOT) basis exclusively to the
Company on the terms and conditions appearing in this Agreement.”

480 Chitty on Contracts, 32 Ed states at (page 1053, [13-068)) that “Where words in
the operative part of an instrument are ambiguous, the recitals and other parts of the
instrument may be used to fix the appropriate meaning of those words.” The price (and
technical) bids were clearly the basis of the Concession Agreement. It is submitted that
extrinsic evidence of the price submitted by the Claimant must be considered in the
interpretation of the Clause.

481 The Claimant has relied on the then Solicitor General Abdulla Muiz’s statement (at
{RBD 2568]): “We also discussed article 5.2.1 of the agreement which states that every
Soreigner that arrives in Maldives will be charged $2 (two U.S. dollars), every foreigner that
departs Maldives will be charged $2 (two U.S. dollars) and every visa card issued will be
charged $15 (fifteen U.S. dollars).”

482 However, it is noted that some of the witnesses interviewed by ACC had a different
recollection:

482.1 Ahmed Waheed (Chief Immigration Officer) stated (at [3RBD 2562]) “In the
ineetings, revisions to the agreement were discussed. For instance it was discussed that, the
USD $2 charge on every foreign arrival as stipulated under 5.2.1 of the agreement can be
taken after getting the approval from the parliament. But since Abdullah _Muiz in the
meeting opined that the aforementioned amount may be taken as a fee and therefore it can be
charged without obtaining the approval from parliament, it was agreed to be passed”.

 

482.2 Ibrahim Waheed (Assistant Controller of the DOIE) stated (at [3RBD 2579]): “When
Abdullah Muiz questioned about the $2 levied from passengers, the officials from finance
ministry said that it is a fee and because it would be taken indirectly as part of the current
airport tax, that they did not believe that it needed to be passed by parliament... Even though
the agreement stated that $2 would be charged from every foreigner entering and leavin,

the Maldives as the cost of the project, I noticed that the $2 charged upon arrival was the
only charge that was discussed during the meetings. The $2 departure charge was not

discussed.

 

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 231 of 263

483 Press reports on 24 October 2010 and 4 November 2010 from the local Maldivian
news agency Haveeru Daily (see [6CHB 4255 & 4257]) reported that the then Controller of
Immigration, Ilyas Hussein Ibrahim:

 

“noted that the government should repay the initial investment of the system which

would cost about US$39 million (Rf501 million). He said a US$2 fee is to be charged

from every foreigner entering the country and US$15 has to be paid for work visa”.
484 It should also be remembered that Ilyas Hussein Ibrahim was the individual who
signed the Concession Agreement on behalf of the Respondent.

485 It is also acknowledged that certain individuals have made statements to the ACC or
the Maldivian Parliament / Cabinet that Nexbis was entitled to charge $4. For instance,
Abdulla Shahid stated [3RBD 2555]:

“That is the clause in the agreement between Nexbis and Maldives that states that
Nexbis could charge $2 from every passenger arriving and departing from the
Maldives, as the cost of the project. Therefore, after the project is established, every
Soreigner has to pay $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure from the Maldives to pay
a total of $4.” However, Abdullah Shahid was not part of the contract discussions. He
had stated: “J’m not well aware of how the border control system project of the
Department of Immigration and Emigration started. At the time I was not working at
Immigration. I was assigned as the Controller of Immigration on 21" February
2011.”

486 However, it is submitted that little, if no weight should be given to these statements as
they were made by individuals who did not participate or did not have knowledge of the
contractual discussions. As stated in Chitty on Contracts, 32™ Ed*, at page 1089. [13-129],
“it is not legitimate to use as an aid in the construction of the contract anything which parties
said or did after it was made”.

487 Based on the above, it is submitted that the contract discussions was only focused on
the Claimant’s financial proposal of $2 per foreign passenger arrival. Clause 5.2.1 of the
Concession Agreement was intentionally drafted by the Claimant ambiguously and so that the
Claimant could then, after execution of the Concession Agreement, convince the
Respondent’s officers that it was $2 for arrival and $2 for departure.

488 The Claimant has argued that Clause 5.1.1 of the Concession Agreement, which
requires the Respondent to provide a statement / report to the Claimant “specifying the total
number of passenger arriving into and departing the Republic of Maldives” indicates that
passenger numbers for arrivals and departures would be provided to enable the Claimant to
charge for both arrivals and departures. While this is an attractive argument, Clause 5.1.1
simply reuses the phrase “arriving into and departing’.

489 The Claimant even submitted a draft version of its financial bid that was created on 27
July 2015 with the phrase “per passenger (per arrival and departure)”. These modifications,

if undetected by the Respondent, would have devastating consequences on its case.

490 — In conclusion, an exercise in the interpretation of Clause 5.2.1 and the evidence before
the Tribunal, including the fact that the Claimant had submitted a bid for $2 would invariably

227

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 232 of 263

 

lead to the conclusion that a foreign passenger who arrived and departed from the Republic of
Maldives would only be charged $2,

*' [106]-[188] of the Respondent’s Reply Submissions state:

A. The issue of whether the Claimant was entitled to charge $2 or $4 in total for a
foreign passenger was not something that was introduced by the Respondent’s Financial
Expert

106 This sub-point pertains to a minor issue, but since the Claimant has claimed that the
Respondent was ignorant of the $2 / $4 issue and that the idea originated from the
Respondent’s Financial Expert, it is convenient to address it first.

107 The grounds for the Claimant’s assertion is based on the coincidence that the
Respondent’s Financial Expert’s witness statement was filed on the same date as the
Respondent’s Factual Witness’ 3rd witness statement which allegedly raised the issue for the
first time. This is a rather incredulous conclusion to make based on the most tenuous of
links. How does the same filing date indicate that the idea originated from the Respondent's
Financia! Expert?

108 To back up their theory, the Claimant’s solicitors then forced the hapless Mr Naseer,
who had never met the Respondent’s Financial Expert, let alone was aware of or privy to any
discussion with the said expert, to admit to their theory.

109 Once again, the Claimant’s wild theory is incorrect. The Respondent’s Financial
Expert had stated at [2.1] of his 1" Witness Statement that his “scope of work is fo provide my
opinions to the questions posed by Aldgate Chambers LLC. A list of the questions is
appended as LOS-2.”

110 As can be seen from the list of questions at “LQS-2”, [page 9 of the Claimant’s
Financia] Expert’s Ist Witness Statement], the Respondent’s solicitors had set out at [3.4]
of the ‘List of Questions for the Financial Expert Witness’:

“The total fee per foreign passenger who arrives and departs Maldives is US $2...

Please calculate the Claimant's loss for the [following] period[s]...”

(Emphasis in bold added)

111 The Respondent’s Financial Expert did not come up with the idea that the total fee per
foreign passenger was US $2.

112 __Itis also incorrect to suggest that the Respondent had not raised the issue before. The
amount of damages that the Claimant is seeking in this arbitration has long been disputed. In
its first Statement of Defence and Counterclaim filed on 16 July 2014, the Respondent has
pleaded that:

112.1 “ft/he Respondent disputes the invoices produced by the Claimant and puts
the Claimant to strict proof regarding such sums” [39.1] RD&C.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 233 of 263

 

112.2 “Further and / or in the alternative, the certificate issued by the “independent
Firm of auditors appointed out [sic] by the Company” should be set aside for the
following reasons... [39.2.2] The certificate is erroneous...” [39.2] RD&C.

113 It must be highlighted that at that point of time, the Claimant had not sought common
law damages, but was merely relying on the independent auditor’s certificate to claim its
purported loss of revenue (the certificate was abandoned at the hearing). The Claimant only
amended its Statement of Claim to include an alternative plea for common law damages on
20 August 2015,

B. The Law on Contractual Interpretation

114 In the recent Singapore Court of Appeal case concerning contractual interpretation
(V.E.S. F&B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as
Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd {2015] 5 SLR 1195 (“¥.E.S. F&B”) [3RBA -
TAB 1)), the Court restated the applicable principles:

114.1. When faced with rival meanings of certain words and phrases, a nuanced
consideration of both the text as well as the context of the contract in question is
crucial - [30].

114.2 “the context cannot be utilised as an excuse by the court concerned to rewrite
the terms of the contract according to its (subjective) view of what it thinks the result
ought to be in the case at hand. To this end, the court must always base its decision
on objective evidence... Put simply, the court must ascertain, based on all the relevant
objective evidence, the intention of the parties at the time they entered into the
contract” - [32].

114.3. “In this regard, the court should ordinarily start from the working position
that the parties did not intend that the term(s) concerned were to produce an absurd
result. However, this is only a starting point — and no more” - [32].

114.4 “although the relevant context is also important, the text ought always to be
the first port of call for the court” - [32] However, “on the opposite end of the
spectrum, the text concerned might itself be ambiguous (ie, without even considering
the relevant context). In such a situation, it is clear that the relevant context will
generally be of the first importance”.

114.5 “the court is always to pay close attention to both the text and context in every
case — noting that both interact with each other”. - [35]

114.6 “the role of context ... relates only to the need to place the court in the position
of the party which drafted the instrument and not the drafter’s subjective intention as
such”.

114.7 The guidance in Zurich Insurance [3RBA — Tab2] on what extrinsic
evidence is admissible in aid of contractual interpretation as well as the way in which
the task of interpretation is to be carried out is both comprehensive and nuanced -
[39]. The Court quoted, infer alia, the following paragraph from Zurich Insurance:

229

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 234 of 263

 

“The extrinsic evidence in question is admissible so long as it is relevant, reasonably
available to all the contracting parties and relates to a clear or obvious context...
However, the principle of objectively ascertaining contractual intention(s) remains
paramount. Thus, the extrinsic evidence must always go towards proof of what the
parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon ...there should be no
absolute or rigid prohibition against evidence of previous negotiations or subsequent
conduct, although, in the normal case, such evidence is likely to be inadmissible for
non-compliance with the requirements... the relevance of subsequent conduct remains
a controversial and evolving topic that will require more extensive scrutiny by this
court at a more appropriate juncture. Declarations of subjective intent remain
inadmissible except for the purpose of giving meaning to terms which have been
determined to be latently ambiguous.”

114.8 Finally, at [48] & [49], the Court cited with approval Lord Clarke’s statement
in Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank [2011] 1 WLR 2900 that “/ijf there are two possible
constructions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent
with business common sense and to reject the other”.

(Emphasis added.)

Cc. The Relevant Text

115 To recap, the main clause at the centre of this issue is clause 5.2.1:

“The Company is authorised by the Government to impose upon and collect levy or fee from:
i, Each and every passenger using non-Maldivian passport arriving into and departing from
the Republic of Maldives, a fee of USD2.00 (UNITED STATES DOLLAR TWO ONLY) per
passenger via a levy or fee imposed or to be imposed by the Government to be charged on
such passenger.”

116 The key phrase is “arriving into and departing from”. Jt is the Respondent’s position
that the phrase should be read conjunctively, i.e. every foreign passenger arriving into and
departing from Maldives would pay a total of US $2. The addition of the phrase “departing
from” would prevent the Claimant from claiming in future that it was entitled to claim an
additional $2 upon departure.

117. The Claimant’s argument is that it should be read disjunctively. However, if it was
meant to be read disjunctively, shouldn’t the term “or” be used instead? I-e. each and every
foreign passenger “arriving into or departing from”.

118 In relation to paragraph 162 of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions, if the phrase
“entering into and departing from” is to be taken as imposing a fee on both arriving and
departing passengers, then logically, Clause 12.3 of the Concession Agreement (the
liquidated damages/penalty clause) would state that the Respondent would pay the Claimant,
upon termination, a compensation sum equivalent to the total Charges multiplied by the
projected number of passengers entering into and departing from Maldives.

119 Instead, Clause 12.3 states that the compensation payable is the total Charges

multiplied by the projected number of passengers entering into or departing from the
Maldives. This clearly signifies that only one charge is payable.

230

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 235 of 263

 

119.1 The structure used in Clause 12.3 for the arriving or departing passengers is
similar to the next line regarding foreign workers or visa cards - the charges would be
multiplied by the number of foreign workers or visa cards. According to Clause
5.2.1(iii) of the Concession Agreement, if the Government did not implement visa
cards, it would have to pay based on the number of foreign workers in the country.
Hence, the use of the term ‘or’ in Clause 12.3.

119.2 Therefore, Clause 12.3 supports the Respondent's position that Charges are

only payable once, either upon arrival or departure.
120 Since the Claimant and the Respondent have taken different interpretations of the
meaning of Clause 5.2.1 of the Concession Agreement, we proceed to consider the context in
which the Concession Agreement was entered into. The Claimant has relied on what it billed
as “extensive negotiations” between the Claimant and the Respondent before the Concession
Agreement was signed (see paragraph 157 of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions). While
the Concession Agreement has an entire agreement clause, the extrinsic evidence relating to
the context in which the agreement came about and how it was entered into is highly relevant
to assist with contractual interpretation. The starting point would be the bidding process
which led to the award of the MIBCS project to the Claimant. This is where we will turn our
attention to.

D. The Bidding Process

121 The first document we consider for this segment would be the RFP. The RFP stated
that the purpose of the MIBCS system was to enhance the border control, maximise services
and monitor human trafficking and illegal movement of migrant workers [1CHB 100]. The
RFP also identified the issues and challenges in the Maldives that required “immediate
attention” to overcome. They were primarily related to the crime and problems caused by
illegal workers/immigrants who were involved in debt bondage, human trafficking, illegal
sex trade and wrongful detention, etc. [1CHB 101].

122 In the RFP, the basis for which the bidders should price their bids is clearly set out:

“Bidders will indicate in their price bid the total amount of fees to be paid during the
period of the BOT, i.e. 20 years. These fees will include all costs related to the BOT
project, namely the costs of:

a. Purchase of the equipment as specified in section 7

b. Operation of the Facility

d. Maintenance

e. Costs to cover all aspects of section 6 Employers Requirements”

(1CHB 127]

123 The intention of allowing the winning bidder to impose charges / taxes was to cover
all costs of the project, including operation and maintenance.

124 Furthermore, in the RFP, it is clear that the party with the lowest bid would be
awarded the contract.
“2.31 Comparison of Bids.
The MoFT shall compare all substantially responsive Bids to determine the lowest
evaluated bid, in accordance with ITB2.29.” |\CHB 124]

231

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 236 of 263

 

“2.32 Award Criteria

2.32.1 The MoFT shall award the Contract to the Bidder whose offer has been
determined to be the lowest evaluated bid and is substantially responsive to the
Bidding Document...”

(Emphasis added.) [1CHB 125]

125 All bidders had submitted their bids based on a ‘per passenger’ basis. There was no
concept of charging upon arrival and then again on departure. [See Dibena’s bid - 1RBD

650, OSD’s/Iris’ bid - 1RBD 743, Informatics’ bid - 3RBD 1915 and their revised bid at
3RHB 1913]

 

 

126 As late as 21 September 2010, Informatics had revised its price bid downwards from
US$1 to “US $0.65 per passenger - On Arrival Passengers Only” (Emphasis in bold
original) [See 3RHB 1913].

127. The context of how the bid was awarded makes it clear that the Respondent’s
intention was for incoming tourists to be charged as low a price as possible. This was based
on legitimate concerns about the impact of the imposition of taxes on foreign passengers.
The Republic of Maldives is dependent on tourist arrivals for its economy and there were
concerns that the increase in taxes would cause tourist arrivals to decline.

128 The concern that imposing additional fees on tourists could cause tourist arrivals to
decline is well known, and coincidentally, is stated in a news article disclosed in this
arbitration [see Volume G - Bundle of GMR News Articles, Page 3]. This article was written
on 27 June 2010 after the bidders had submitted their bids, but before the Respondent had
been awarded the contract. In a report on the Malé International Airport privatisation deal:

128.1 The opposition parties were quoted as stating that “a Majlis amendment is
necessary to raise the airport service charge from US$18 to USS25, which the
government has promised to GMR”.

128,2 Further, the president of People’s Alliance, Abdulla Yameen (the current
President of the Republic of Maldives) was quoted in the report as having stated that
“GMR’s fuel charges, airport tax and charges for flights landing at the airport
could cause tourist arrivals to decline”

128.3. The consideration how an increase in charges could lead to a decrease in
tourist arrivals is important when we subsequently deal with the Claimant's absurd
postulation that the Respondent would benefit from the doubling of the charges
collected simply because it was entitled to a 5% of the charges that the Claimant
collected.

E. The Claimant’s draft unsigned financial bid shows that the parties did not
contemplate payment of a fee per arrival and per departure.

129 The Claimant has sought to use a “draft” concession agreement in its attempt to
explain how its $2 bid morphed into a $4 in total.

232

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 237 of 263

 

130 However, we can use the unsigned financial bid that the Claimant produced in this
arbitration to further examine this issue.

13 — It is clear what was not in the Parties’ contemplation during the bidding process. The
parties did not intend to charge passengers per arrival and per departure.

132 Furthermore, what is clear is that if the Claimant had intended to charge per arrival
and per departure in the actual Concession Agreement, it would have used the same phrase
found in its “draft” financial bid — ‘per passenger per arrival and per departure’. That phrase
is very clear, instead of ‘every passenger arriving into and departing from’.

133 It is clear that it was the parties’ intentions that the terms of the financial bid would be
incorporated in the Concession Agreement. The RFP specified that when submitting their
financial bids, parties had to agree to “({) We understand that this bid, together with your
written acceptance thereof included in your notification of award, shall constitute a binding
contract between us, until a formal contract is prepared and executed”. (See the RFP [1CHB
155], and the incorporation of the term in the Claimant’s Financial Bid [2.2CHB 979]).

KF. The Contract drafting process / “Extensive Negotiations”
ji) There were no “Extensive Negotiations” between the Claimant and the
Respondent.

134. The Claimant has claimed, for the very first time, in its Closing Submissions that after
“extensive negotiations”, a bargain was struck that the Claimant would charge only non-
Maldivian passengers, but that they would be charged $2 upon arrival and $2 upon departure.
Frankly, this amounts to evidence from the Claimant's solicitors as it was never brought up in
evidence before.

233

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 238 of 263

 

135 For the following reasons, it is clear that the Claimant’s story in its Closing
Submissions about the alleged “extensive negotiations” and how such negotiations led to the
Claimant being able to charge foreign passengers a total of $4 is clearly an afterthought:

135.1 When confronted with the disparities between the draft financial bid {3CHB
1233] that the Claimant Factual Witness introduced as evidence (which stated that the
Respondent would charge $2 per passenger per arrival and per departure), and the
actual financial bid [2.2 CHB 257] (which did not have this phrase), the Claimant's
Factual Witness was cornered and could only admit that the bid was for $2 per
passenger.

135.2 The Claimant’s Factual Witness did not address the white elephant in the room
- how the $2 bid then morphed into the $4 that the Claimant relied upon. He did not
mention the “extensive negotiations” and neither did his Counsel re-examine him on
this.

135.3 Furthermore, the Claimant’s Factual Witness had claimed to have filed his 3rd
Witness Statement in response to the “new factual allegations” in the Respondent’s
Factual Witness’ 3rd Witness statement, which included the $2 / $4 issue. It is very
telling that despite the Respondent’s Factual Witness stating in the witness statement
that the Claimant’s bid “had been submitted on the basis that the charge of USD$2
was meant to cover both the arrival and departure of each passenger”, the Claimant's
Factual Witness never alluded to the alleged subsequent “extensive negotiations” in
his 3rd Witness Statement (see paragraphs [55] to [59]).

136 This story is about the extensive negotiations is clearly made up:

136.1 The letter of award accepting the Claimant’s bid of $2 per arriving passenger
was sent on 29 September 2010 [See 3RBD 2104]. The Concession Agreement was
signed on 17 October 2010. It is illogical that the Claimant’s revenue for foreign
passengers would be allowed to double within a short period of less than three weeks.

136.2 The “extensive negotiations” were not recorded by either the Claimant or the
Respondent’s officers,

136.3 This critical increase in charges for foreign passengers is not mentioned by
any of the individuals that ACC interviewed. (We note that the Claimant has relied
heavily upon certain statements, but ironically chose to criticise the interviewers as a
whole.)

(ii) Objectively, there is no justification for the Claimants claim to be able to charge
foreign p double after ivi were excluded.

8 P

137 It is clear from the evidence that the Respondent’s officers was concerned that the
charges would be considered a tax and would be prohibited under Article 97 of the
Constitution (see for example Abdullah Muiz’s statement at [3RBD 2568]). A common law
principle exists — the High Court of Australia has held that where local citizens (who have the
right to enter their own country) are charged for immigration clearance without the provision
of additional services, this constitutes a tax - Air Caledonie International v The

234

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 239 of 263

 

Commonwealth (1988) 165 CLR 462 [3RBA —- Tab 3]. It is clearly understandable that
subsequent to the award of the MIBCS project, the parties then agreed to exclude local
Maldivians from the Charges. The purpose of the MIBCS system was, after all, to target
illegal workers and human traffickers. Many countries exempt their local citizens from
paying such fees / taxes.

138 There is no logical explanation why the Respondent would allow the Claimant to
effectively double its revenue after excluding Maldivian citizens from being charged. As we
show below (using 2009 figures), the parties knew that the Claimant had submitted a bid to
collect from US$2 from arriving passengers, which amounted to 844,300 passengers in 2009.
After subtracting the local Maldivians“, there would still be 729,087 foreign passenger
arrivals. Why would the Respondent agree to let the Claimant claim US$2 from 729,087
foreign passengers both ways, effectively allowing them to collect 1.727 times the amount in
their financial bid?

139 In fact, the effect of charging foreign passengers twice would be even more apparent,
given that it was well within the parties’ contemplation that tourist arrivals were projected to
increase. As the parties’ financial experts have calculated, the total projected revenue
(charges) that could be collected by the Claimant over the remainder of the 20 years (taking
into account the growth in tourism arrivals) would be either US$37,740,652 ($2) or
US$58,790,178 ($4). This is a US $21 million difference in charges collected and obviously
of great importance - something which that the Claimant states was a result of extensive
negotiations in less than 3 weeks (but ironically, given its significance, was not recorded
anywhere).

140 As we have set out earlier, the charging of fees was intended to allow the successful
bidder to cover its costs of the project. The Claimant has not been able to explain the
additional value or services it would provide for an extra US$ 21 million.

141 When applying contextual interpretation, it is submitted that the Tribunal must find
that it does not make business common sense to conduct a tender, choose the lowest bidder
and then allow the successful bidder to revise his price upwards to receive an additional US
$21 million. The Claimant’s entire costs to undertake this project had to be specified under
the financial bid and accounted for in the form of the charges on each passenger arrival and
visa card issued. Objectively, there is simply no reason to subsequently grant the Claimant
the right to earn approximately US$1 million or more each year over a 20 year period without
any benefit to the Country.

142 It would have made business sense for the Charges to be based on foreign passenger
arrivals only. As we know, the Claimant has been extolling the profitability of the
Concession Agreement during the hearing. As the Financial Experts have calculated, the
Claimant’s profit for the remainder of the concession period based on a total of US$ 2 per
foreign passenger is US$ 15.2 million. The projected profit makes it clear that restricting the
$2 charge to each foreign passenger would not have caused the Respondent to suffer any
losses.

143 At paragraph 173 of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions, the Claimant offered a
rather enticing argument of why the Respondent would have agreed to allow the Claimant to
double the charge imposed on foreign passengers. It claims that the Respondent would have

235

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 240 of 263

 

directly benefitted from the Claimant’s interpretation of the charging mechanism applying for
both arrivals and departures. As mentioned in earlier, this is absurd and far from the truth.

143.1 The Government wanted to minimise the tax/charges collected in order not to
cause tourist numbers to decline.

143.2 If the Respondent was concerned about tax revenue, it could have selected the
bidder whose relatively high bid combined with the relatively high royalty rate would
result in the largest amount of royalty, ie. Dibena (which bid $10 per passenger and
offered a royalty of 3%, amounting to $0.30 of royalty per passenger (one way)) as
compared to the Respondent's ($2 x alleged two way x 0.05% royalty, amounting to a
total royalty of $0.20 for both ways).

143.3 It is sad that the Claimant’s desire to benefit itself has made it assume that the
Respondent would also have functioned in the same way.

144 Insofar as the Claimant is trying to rely on what has been stated in Abdullah Muiz’s
statement to ACC to draw the conclusion that the amount of $2 was to be charged at the point
of arriving and a further $2 was 1o be charged at the point of departing, it must be borne in
mind that Mr Muiz was not involved at the bid process stage and therefore, he would not
have known that bid submitted by the Claimant was meant to be $2 in total for both arriving
and departing.

144.1 Mr Muiz mentioned in his statement that “in giving legal opinions, the
Attorney General's Office would mainly look for Constitutional issues” [see 3RBD
2567]. Mr Muiz was mainly concerned about legal issues. For example, he did not
discuss an article allowing the revision of the charges that was, in his opinion, a
business decision as opposed to a legal issue. [See 2568 3RBD line 5}

144.2 When discussing Clause 5.2.1, his sole consideration for the charges was
whether they constituted a tax that would be in conflict with Article 97 of the
Constitution. [See 2568 3RBD lines 8 - 17]

145 Many people who took part in the contract discussions and in particular the 13
October 2010 meeting with the Claimant [3RBD 2116] were not even aware of the factual
matrix of how the tender had been awarded to the Claimant. A prime example would be
Ibrahim Afeef who admitted to ACC that he had “not even seen the Tender document”
[RBD 2595].

146 Tying in with the Jater section on the dangers of using subsequent conduct to interpret
a contract, Mr Muiz’s statement was given on 24 October 2011 (more than a year after the
Concession Agreement was signed on 17 October 2010). Most significantly, the statement
was given when the $2 / $4 was a live issue and was being investigated by the ACC (contrary
to the Claimant’s suggestion at paragraph 177(c) of its Closing Submissions that the issue had
not surfaced):

146.1 The DOIE had submitted a cabinet paper to the Ministry of Home Affairs on
25 April 201} [3CHB 2262], seeking an opinion on whether the Concession
Agreement should be terminated [see 3RBD 2271]. In the paper, the DOJE created a

236

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 241 of 263

 

table which indicated that $2 would be collected from the foreigners who entered
Maldives and also $2 would be collected from foreigners who would leave Maldives
[see CBD 116 (English) and 3RBD 2265 (Dhivehi)].

146.2 Clearly, there was a chance that Mr Muiz had been influenced by the DOJE’s
opinion that the foreign passenger charge was $2 both ways when he gave his
statement to ACC.

146.3. This was a live issue was being investigated by the ACC, which issued its
report on 27 November 2011 (one month after interviewing Mr Muiz) stating that:
“Even though parts (i) and (ii) under clause 5.2.1 of the agreement states that Nexbis
would claim a fee of $2 as tax and $15 for every visa card issued from every tourist
entering and leaving the Maldives, the bid proposed by Nexbis stated that they would
claim a fee of $2 from every tourist passenger, Therefore it is noted that Nexbis
doubled the amount in contravention to what they proposed in the bid document.”
{ARBD 150, paragraph 5.9.4.2].

146.4 Mr Muiz would have been aware that the ACC was investigating this issue.

146.5 Furthermore, two other individuals interviewed by ACC were not aware of
any discussion of the departure fee in the meetings. Amhed Waheed’s statement on
23 October 2011 [3RBD 2562] and Ibrahim Waheed’s statement on 25 October 2011
[3RBD 2579], given a day before and after Mr Muiz’s statement on 24 October 2011,
indicated that only the arrival fee was discussed in the meetings.

146.6 Clearly there are some problems with Mr Muiz’s evidence that was given a
year after the Concession Agreement was signed.

147 Even if Mr Muiz was really under the impression at the 13 October 2010 meeting that
$2 was meant to be charged per arrival and per departure, the Claimant has not provided any
evidence of how the $2 bid doubled and became $4. There is no evidence of this any
extensive negotiation relating to the doubling of the charge on foreign passengers.

(iii) The comparison between the ‘draft’ concession agreement and the Actual
Concession Agreement is unreliable and inconclusive

148 In light of the parties’ clear intentions for the bid terms to be transferred to the
Concession Agreement, it is submitted that the comparison done on the ‘draft’ and the actual
Concession Agreement by the Claimant at paragraph 162 of its Closing Submissions is
unhelpful.

149 Firstly, the Respondent is unable to ascertain the status of the ‘draft? concession
agreement [at 41CHB 2364].

150 It is reiterated that no evidence has ever been Jed by the Claimant on this ‘draft’ or
any other drafts for that matter.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 242 of 263

 

151 The Claimant attributes the ‘draft’ as the copy that was given to Mr Abdullah Muiz to
review based on various statements in the ACC Report (which it has greatly criticised). It
comes to the conclusion based on the following points:

151.1 Ibrahim Afeef and Abdullah Waheed went to see Mr Muiz with a draft.

151.2 There is a slightly illegible handwritten note “07/10 Afeef and Abd [illegible]
Waheed visits [illegible]” on the ‘draft’ at [4CHB 2360].

151.3 Abdullah Muiz stated that arbitration should be in Singapore, not Malaysia.

151.4 The ‘draft’? provided for arbitration in Malaysia and the actual Concession
Agreement provided for arbitration in Singapore.

151.5 Therefore the ‘draft? was an early draft which was amended after AGO’s
opinion on it has been sought, and parties negotiated its terms further (see paragraph
160 of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions).

152 This conclusion is based on very tenuous conjectures. How can the presence of a
Malaysian arbitration clause indicate that the AG’s Office had reviewed that specific
document? Furthermore, whether Mr Muiz had actually met with Ibrahim Afeef and Ahmed
Waheed is unclear:

152.1 Firstly, Mr Muiz said that it was the Controller Ilyas who came to the AG’s
office with the draft agreement. [3RBD 2567] He did not state that he met Ibrahim
Afeef and Abdullah Waheed.

152.2 Ibrahim Afeef stated that he was functioning in the capacity of DOIE’s lawyer
[3RBD 2593]. This was confirmed by the Controller Ilyas who stated that “Jn
drafting the main parts of the agreement, advice was sought from immigrations legal
counsel, Ibrahim Afeef.” [3CBD 2552} Mr Muiz did not appear to know of Ibrahim
Afeef’s existence. Mr Muiz stated that “J was informed that the draft was prepared
and sent by the successful bidder of the Border Control project, Nexbis Ltd. Since
there was no lawyer working in the Immigration at that time and since there was no
such agreement among the bidding documents prepared by Immigration, I do not
believe that the agreement was drafted by Immigration.”

153. Further, it was not recorded in Mr Muiz’s statement that he recommended arbitration
in Singapore. Instead, this was attributed to Mr Muiz by Ibrahim Afeef in his statement
[BRBD 2594].

154 A more disturbing reason exists as to why the Tribunal should disregard Ibrahim
Afeef’s evidence. As set out above, the Claimant has relied on Ibrahim Afeef’s statement to
the ACC dated 27 October 2011 [3RBD 2595]. But in the cabinet paper submitted by DOIE.
on 25 April 2011 [CBD 116], it was noted that “Zhe lawyer who represented the Immigration
department the Deputy Director General, Mr. Ibrahim Afeef (Gulbahaaruge, B.
Thulhaadhoo) during the inception of this project is now representing Nexbis. This was
confirmed when Mr. Ibrahim Afeef attended as the lawyer of Nexbis for a meeting held
between this department and Nexbis on March 28th, 20112" Ibrahim Afeef had come from

238

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 243 of 263

 

advising DOJE to representing the Claimant on the same matter within 5 months after the
signing of the Concession Agreement. When he gave his evidence to ACC, he was Nexbis’
lawyer (something which he failed to declare). Clearly his evidence cannot be relied on.

155 In light of these doubtful circumstances and the Claimant’s dubious conclusions, it is
submitted that the ‘draft’ concession agreement cannot be relied upon.

156 Secondly, even if the ‘draft’ could be relied upon, the Claimant’s submission that the
bargain struck in the Concession Agreement was for it to only charge foreign passengers
twice, is merely its subjective intention/interpretation. It is not disputed that Maldivian
passengers will not be charged. What is disputed is whether the Claimant is entitled to
charge foreign passengers twice.

157 Without considering the Claimant’s subjective intention/interpretation, the
comparison performed by the Claimant does not objectively elucidate the matter. The
Respondent has already pointed out earlier that Clause 12.3 of the Concession Agreement
allows the Claimant to only ctaim charges multiplied by passengers entering into or departing
from the Maldives.

158 The question then goes back to what was discussed in the earlier section: is the phrase
“entering into and departing from” to be read conjunctively or disjunctively.

159 A possible argument might be that addition of the phrase “departing from” should
mean something. It is unclear how and why this phrase was introduced, but the Respondent’s
submission is that it is meant to be conclusive that the Claimant was only allowed to charge
$2 for each passenger.

160 Therefore, such comparison does not provide any helpful insight into the parties’
objective intentions.

(iv) The Claimant drafted the Concession Agreement but repeatedly denied doing so

161 It has thus far been unclear which party drafted the Concession Agreement. The
Respondent’s position has always been that the Claimant drafted the Concession Agreement.

162 The Claimant’s Factual Witness’ testimony was that the Claimant did not draft the
Concession Agreement.

Transcripts, Day 1, Page 83. lines 22 to 23

OQ. Did the draft come from Nexbis, "yes" or "no"?
No.

Transcripts, Day 1, Pages 84 to 85, starting from line 12

Q ... Just to help you, volume 3, you start at page 2567. You will see that the person
who gave the statement to ACC is Abdullah Muiz. To be fair to you, J will inform you,
and you can take it from me that Abdullah Muiz was the Solicitor-General at that
time. Okay? This is a statement he gave. If you turn to the next two pages, page
2569, at the right at the top, Solicitor-General said: "The Attorney-General's Office

239

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 244 of 263

 

was not asked to assist in a drafting of the agreement signed between the Government
of Maldives and Nexbis to establish the Maldives Border Control System. I was
informed that a draft was prepared and sent by the successful bidder of the border
control project, Nexbis Limited." Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. So we have a statement from the Solicitor-General, so I have a basis to ask: it
was Nexbis who prepared the draft and had forwarded it to Mr Ilyas. Is that correct
or is that wrong?

A. No, that's not correct.

Q. Okay.

163 The Claimant’s Opening Statement also mentioned that the Concession Agreement
was “drafted by the DolE” [Transcripts Day 1, Page 20, Lines 16 to 19].

164 As the Claimant has stated in its Closing Submissions that the document at [at 4CHB
2364] is the draft concession agreement, this has shed new light into who drafted the
Concession Agreement. Following the Claimant’s comparison of the ‘draft’ concession
agreement against the actual Concession Agreement, the Respondent has also performed the
same comparison and have uncovered certain clues in both documents which objectively
indicate that it was drafted by the Claimant:

164.1 Firstly, the document is marked “Draft 290710” at the top, very likely 29 July
2010. This was a time when the price bids had not even been opened by the
Respondent and it would not have prepared a draft with the Claimant’s name. It is
slightly intriguing to see that the Claimant was so certain at that point of time that it
would be awarded the tender and had started drafting the agreement between the
Respondent, its potential subsidiary and itself.

164.2 Secondly, in the draft document, the definition of ‘Working Day’ is “a day
other than - (a) Saturdays, Sundays...” [4CHB 2370]. However, Sundays are
working days in the Maldives and this definition could only have been drafted by
someone who was unfamiliar with the Maldivian work week. In the actual
Concession Agreement, this has been changed to reflect that the Maldivian weekends
are on Fridays and Saturdays [1 CHB 32].

164.3 Thirdly, it was stated in the draft that the governing law of the contract would
be the laws of Malaysia and that parties submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Malaysian Courts [4CHB 2393]. Furthermore, it was also stated that any arbitration
was to be held in Malaysia [4CHB 2391]. As any person who is familiar with
drafting contracts would know, these are positions normally taken by the party that
drafted the contract, which would then be subject to negotiations. It is not plausible
that the Respondent’s officers would have chosen Malaysian courts / laws over their
own legal system.

164.4 Fourthly, at {4CHB 2392] the ‘Notice to the Company’ was filled in with the
Claimant's details, while the Notice to the Respondent was left blank. Again, a party
that drafted the contract would normally fill in these details.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 245 of 263

 

164.5 Finally, the most surprising portion in the ‘draft’ is the Clause on royalty
payments to the Respondent. At [4CHB 2380], it is specified that:

“8.4 Royalty

The company agree to pay to the Government a royalty fee amounting to 5% on
project net profits declared by the Company annually for the duration of the
Concession Period or until such time the Government implements a corporate profit
tax or GST.” (Emphasis added.)

164.6 The position on the royalty is clearly wrong. The RFP contained a template
‘Letter of Price Bid’ which stated that royalty of a certain percentage was to be paid
on the income [1CHB 154]. The Claimant’s financial bid proposed that the royalty to
be paid to the Respondent was 5% of the Claimant’s income _on a monthly basis
[2.2CHB 979]. The Respondent’s Ministry of Finance and Treasury had also
recorded a similar position “Royalties of 5% of the gross revenue per year for 20
years.” in its letter to the DOIE, informing them that the Claimant had been awarded
the MIBCS project. [3RBD 2104]. The Respondent’s officers would never have
reduced the 5% royalty on income to 5% royalty on the Claimant’s project net profits.

 

165 Therefore, based on the five clues above, it is clear that the Claimant had drafted the
contract but mysteriously chose to deny it. Two of the Respondent’s ex-officers Controller
Jlyas and Samee Ageel (who have been charged with corruption) claimed to have drafted the
Concession Agreement and their motives for lying must be questioned. We will discuss these
two individuals further below in the section on corruption.

166 Since the Claimant has raised the issue of the drafts, a question arises: did the
Respondent amend any further portion of the Concession Agreement? The only
d ion/record of any fi to the C ion A was for a meeting on
13 October 2010 [3RBD 2116(Eng.) and 2106 (Dhivehi)] where there was a discussion of
amendments to the draft Concession Agreement. The record was made in both English and
Dhivehi (this is because even though many of the Respondent’s officers are fluent in English,
it is still their second language and they are more comfortable in Dhivehi).

 

167 The evidence is that the Respondent did not suggest any further amendment in
relation to the charges. If the Respondent had made further amendments to the Concession
Agreement, it would have been recorded in both English and Dhivehi minutes.

(v) The unexplained ‘draft’ financial bid [3CHB 1233]

168 According to the Claimant, the parties had only come to a conclusion that the
Claimant would be allowed to charge foreign passengers $2 both ways after the extensive
negotiations that took place after the award of the tender to the Claimant.

169 Most intriguingly, when and why did the Claimant modify the Respondent’s RFP
template ‘Letter of Price Bid’ [1CHB 154] from “per passenger” to the phrase in its ‘draft’
financial bid — “per passenger per arrival and per departure” [3CHB 1233}?

170 It was stated in the RFP at paragraph 2.1.6 that “any condition, qualification or other
stipulation contained in the bid shall make it liable to rejection”. Paragraph 2.11.1 of the RFP
stated that the “MoFT will evaluate only those Bids that are received in the required formats
and complete in all respects”.

241

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 246 of 263

 

171 If Claimant wanted to bid for $2 per passenger per arrival and per departure, would it
not be simpler to just bid $4 per passenger as per the RFP template?

172 Why was this document disclosed by the Claimant’s Factual Witness in this
arbitration and why was it passed off as “Claimant’s Financial Bid Document” dated 25 May
2010? [See the Index to the CHB, s/n 4]. One must wonder whether this document was
simply created to support its claim that it was entitled to charge $2 both ways.

G. Subsequent conduct

173 Much have been said by the Claimant about the lack of protest from the DOIE
officers with regard to the invoiced amounts which charged foreign passengers a total of $4.

174 It is important during the consideration of the subsequent conduct of the parties to
note a very simple point - no charges were ever collected by the Claimant or the Respondent
from any passenger. None of the parties had actually collected money and checked their
rights against the Concession Agreement.

175 It is clear that the DOIE officials thought that the terms of the Concession Agreement
were in accordance with the Claimant’s financial bid.

175.1 This position was conveyed by Mohamed Ali, the Controller of Immigration,
in his letter dated 1 November 2012 to the Speaker of Parliament [3RBD 2619}. The
new Controller stated: “The decision to take $2 as tax from every foreigner entering
and leaving the Maldives and to levy a charge of $15 for every Visa Card issued was
after the proposal made_by Nexbis was studied by the Tender Evaluation

 

175.2 The DOIE officers were not part of the financial evaluation. Ibrahim Afeef
stated in his statement to the ACC that “Although it was a project of Immigration,
everything regarding the Project was done by Finance, as the President had asked to
do all work regarding the project by a third party since it might facilitate an act of
corruption if it was done by Immigration. No other work was assigned to Immigration
apart from signing the agreement.” [3RBD 2595]. He had also never seen the tender
documents.

176 It is reiterated that the individual that signed the Concession Agreement on behalf of
the Respondent, Ilyas had been quoted shortly after the Concession Agreement was signed as
saying that “a USS2 fee is to be charged from every foreigner entering the country” [(6CHB
4255 & 4257].

177 As for other individuals, it is submitted that it is dangerous to rely on the subsequent
conduct of individuals that (i) were not involved in the tender process and the drafting of the
Concession Agreement, or (ii) only came on board at a later stage.

177.1 Individuals who were not involved in the tender process and the drafting of the

Concession Agreement would not be aware of the live issues,

242

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 247 of 263

 

177.2 Individual who were not involved in the award and signing of the MIBCS
project could be influenced by the ‘conventional wisdom’ (which may be right or
wrong) that was passed down. If their subsequent conduct is relied upon, there may
be the risk that the individual may have internalised any falsehood” and merely stated
the currently acceptable position at that point of time.

178 The Claimant makes a good point about the dangers of using subsequent conduct to
interpret a contract. At [173] of the Claimant’s Closing Submissions, the Claimant stated that
“t]he overwhelming evidence is that the DOIE, as the department that conceived,
consumnmated and carried out the MIBCS Project, had invariably internalised the revenue
model of every foreigner paying $2 upon arrival and upon departure...”

179 Any right minded individual who was actually part of the tender process would
definitely question why the Claimant was collecting twice the amount that it bid.

180 There is an even more important reason why subsequent conduct should not be used
and this was explained in V.E.S. F&B by the Singapore Court of Appeal. It did not give
subsequent conduct much weight because:

[74] “As we pointed out to counsel during the hearing, there was not much assistance to be
derived from the parties’ subsequent conduct when the object of the interpretive exercise was
to discern the parties' intentions at the time of entering into the contract. Indeed, there are
dangers in placing too much weight on such evidence because it can, with the benefit of
hindsight, be shaped to suit each party's position.”

(Emphasis added.)

181 In other words, a party would be at liberty to pick and choose the conduct that suits
him. This appears to be exactly what the Claimant has done, choosing what suits its case
theory and ignoring others which go against it.

182 An example would be when the Claimant claimed that the Tribunal should pay
attention to ACC’s interpretation as jt had taken the view that the Concession Agreement had
specified $4 (and recommended Controller Ilyas to be charged for conferring an undue
advantage). This is one of the rare occasions where the Claimant has agreed with ACC
(when it suits its case).

182.1 In any event, ACC had, in its 24 January 2011 letter [see [7.1(ii)] of 3 RBD
2232] stated that under Clause 12.3 the Government has to pay charges for passenger
arrivals, without any mention of charges for departures. In relation to Clause 5.2.1,
ACC merely repeated the wording of the clause “every foreigner arriving and
departing from Maldives a fee of 2 USD will be taken”.

182.2 The ACC report was published on 27 November 2011. By then, it had been
widely propagated that the fee was $4. As mentioned above, DOIE had submitted a
cabinet paper to MHA on 25 April 2011 with calculations indicating payment of a
total of $4 [CBD 116].

182.3 As for the reason why the PG did not charge Ilyas for conferring an advantage
on the Claimant, there are a myriad of reasons why Ilyas was not charged. The
Claimant postulates that the Ilyas could not have been responsive for conferring the
advantage because there were many individuals involve. Another possible

243

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 248 of 263

 

explanation could be that the PG was of the view that the Concession Agreement had
specified $2 and Ilyas had not conferred an advantage on the Claimant. These are all
mere conjectures.

H. Conclusion on the $2 / $4 issue

183 The Tribunal should not place any weight on the Claimant’s story about extensive
negotiations for the following reasons.

184 As the Claimant had been awarded the highest score for the Price Bids because it had
submitted the lowest bid (including submitting a price of $0 for work permits and thereby
receiving the full score of 10 marks for that section while the rest of the bidders received
zero), it is a bit rich for the Claimant to now suggest that it was allowed to double its revenue
for one of the two segments that it actually submitted a price for.

185 The Claimant has not provided any credible evidence about such extensive
negotiations. None of the individuals interviewed by ACC mentioned anything about the
change in the bid price of $2 to the Claimant’s version of $4 in the Concession Agreement.
The comparison between the draft agreement and the actual Concession Agreement is
unreliable due to the weak conjunctures and inconclusive in its results.

186 Furthermore, the Claimant’s story is incredible. The context of the signing of the
Concession Agreement was that the Respondent had called for a RFP which specified that the
lowest bidder would be selected, and had selected the Claimant based on its lowest financial
bid. The potential that any imposition of charges may result in a decline in tourist arrivals
was prevalent in the Respondent’s mind. Clearly, allowing the Claimant to double an aspect
of its price bid would be very unfair to the other bidders and against the very purpose and
spirit of the tender - which was to obtain, for the Republic of Maldives, the best value for the
project.

187. The Claimant has picked and chose the subsequent conduct (statements to ACC made
by various individuals or submissions to cabinet, etc.) to bolster its case. Very little weight
should be ascribed to these as the conduct involves individuals which (i) had a fleeting part to
play, (ii) was involved at a later stage, (iii) or was charged for corruption. Furthermore,
statements were given about 5 to 12 months after the event.

188 In light of the above, we have shown how the Claimant’s explanation for the
unwarranted increase in fees is an afterthought, cannot be believed and is contrary to business
common sense. The Claimant had submitted a bid for $2 for passenger arrivals and after
excluding a small amount of Maldivians passengers, could not objectively have been allowed
to double its charges for all foreign arrivals, entitling it to an extra US $21 million in profit.

si 1) The Court said at [2007] 3 SLR(R) 357, [2007] SGCA 22.

The effect of an entire agreement clause was essentially a matter of contractual interpretation
and necessarily depended upon ils precise wording and context. Generally, such clauses were
conducive to certainty as they defined and confined the parties’ rights and obligations within

the four corners of the written document, thereby precluding any attempt to qualify or

244

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 249 of 263

 

the d by refe to pre- I rep i However, in so far
as contracts were not interpreted in a vacuum, objective facts could potentially assist in the
interpretation of ambiguous terms. Entire agreement clauses would usually not prevent a
court from justifiably adopting a contextual approach jn contract interpretation. Such clauses
had little bearing on textual or interpretative controversies as to the meaning of particular
words or terms in contracts: at [25] and [41].

“i ‘The Concession Agreement is tainted by corruption

10 The Concession Agreement is voidable as it is tainted with corruption. Under
Maldivian Law, it is deemed to be corruption if a government employee gives an undue
advantage to a third party and there need not be any benefit that flows to the person who
confers such undue advantage.

I [See text reproduced in the Award]

12 The President’s Office Directive No. 2009/49 (“President’s Office Directive”) sets
out the guidelines to be followed in development projects (such as that of the border control
system). The proper procedure as set out by the President’s Office Directive was not adhered
to in the bidding process.

13 Jn particular, pursuant to the President’s Office Directive, approval would have to be
obtained from either the National Planning Council (“NPC”) or the Cabinet before
proceeding with the project.

14 In the absence of the approval for such changes, the Request For Proposal (“RFP”)
could not deviate from what had been initially approved by the NPC. However, although
approval was obtained for the initial proposal from the NPC, changes were made to the initial
proposal that did not obtain the clearance from the NPC or the Cabinet, therefore,
contravening section 12 and section 13 of the Prevention and Prohibition of Corruption Act
2000 (“PPCA 2000”).

14A. MoFT released an invitation for Expressions of Interest (“E.O.I”) on or around 13
January 2010, with four (4) categories which potential bidders would be assessed on. The
Claimant was one of these interested parties and submitted its E.O.] for the MIBCS on or
around 10 February 2010.

|4B. However, during the evaluations of the E.O.Is, an additional category of “Capacity
building”, which was not previously listed in the invitation was included as a criteria for
evaluation. The Claimant obtained the highest marks in this category, which enabled it to
obtain higher marks and secure a higher position in the evaluation of the E.O.Is.

15 Bidding for the MIBCS opened on or around 30 May 2010. Based on the bids
submitted, a technical evaluation and financial evaluation were catried out. Marks were
given on the basis that the overall highest scorer would win the bid for the MIBCS project.
The technical and financial evaluations were to be calculated and evaluated using the
methodologies set out in the RFP. In particular, clauses 3.1 and 6.16 of the RFP set out the

245

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 250 of 263

percentage of each component in which the technical and financial evaluations were to be
considered, respectively.

16 However, the technical and financial evaluations were carried out in a manner which
contravened Maldivian Law, in particular section 8 of the Public Finance Regulations 2009
(“PFR 2009”) and section 12 and section 13(a) of the PPCA 2000. Section 8.01 of the PFR
2009 sets out the principles that must be followed when procuring goods and services for the
State. These include the requirements for transparency and public knowledge at section
8.01(b) of the PFR 2009 and the requirement that equal opportunity must be given to
competent bidders in order to ensure a competitive bidding process at section 8.01(c) of the
PFR 2009.

17 The relevant sections of the PPCA 2000 are set out below:

“PPCA 2000
The offence of obtaining undue advantage by government employees

12(a) It is an offence for an employee of Government or a Government venture to use

position or influence from position, to gain or confer an undue advantage pertaining to a

task or d to a task being carried out by the agency or place of his

12(b) A person who commits an offence stated in subsection (a) above shall be punishable

13(a) It is an offence for any government employee to act in a manner that precludes the

wife or husband.

(Emphasis added)

*” 12 0]-[232] read:

232. The Claimant's case is airtight. There is no escaping the fact that the CA was a valid,
enforceable contract, the Claimant performed its obligations under the CA, and that it was the
Respondent that repudiated the CA because it wanted to resile from what it later considered a
bad bargain. The Respondent has no real defence to the Claimant’s case.

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 251 of 263

 

211. That however has not stopped the Respondent from concocting disingenuous defences
and counterclaims.

212. As we show below, the Respondent's witnesses’ admissions are fatal to a number of
the Respondent’s pleaded defences and counterclaims.

213. Another factor which speaks to the falsity of the Respondent’s pleaded case is the
evidence which it chose to put forward to prove its case, or rather, the lack thereof.

214. Although many members of the Maldivian government were involved in the MIBCS
project in one way or another, the Respondent chose to put forward a single factual witness,
Mr Naseer, who was almost completely uninvolved in the MIBCS project. He was not a
“witness” in any sense of the word, given that he did not in fact witness any material event
first-hand. It was almost as if the Respondent wanted to hide behind Mr Naseer’s curtain of
ignorance, afraid of the concessions that the Claimant may gain from true witnesses to the
facts of the case.

215. Further, Mr Naseer was not a credible or reliable witness. He claimed that he drafted
his witness statement himself, in the Maldivian language, with inputs from a team of people
and with help for the translation of the witness statement. However, when questioned, he
betrayed that he knew very little of the contents of his own witness statements, or the exhibits
to them. On the stand, he also contradicted the evidence in his witness statement several
times.

216. It appears that Mr Naseer was put forward as a witness to defend a testimony that was
not his own. The true makers of the witness statement were not called, and their veracity
remained untested. Given this, all of Mr Naseer’s witness statements should be treated
circumspectly.

217. Finally, the majority of the Respondent’s case was supported by evidence gleaned by
the ACC and assertions made in the ACC Report. Mr Naseer stated that he had prepared the
witness statement based on the ACC Report.

218. First, it is unclear why the DolJE is basing its evidence in this case on the ACC Report.
After all, the ACC is a separate and independent institution from the executive arm of the
Respondent’s Government. Further, the DoJE and the ACC were opposing parties in the
Maldivian civil cases where the ACC attempted to seek orders preventing the performance of
the CA. The about-turn in the DoIE’s position is puzzling.

219. Second, it is submitted that little reliance should be placed on the ACC Report given
that (a) the makers of the ACC Report were not called; and (b) the evidence suggests that the
ACC Report is unreliable.

A. The Respondent failed to call relevant witnesses to prove its case
220. The Respondent could have called any number of witnesses to prove its case in these
arbitral proceedings. A list of the Respondent’s dramatis personae involved the MIBCS

project in some way can be found at Annex 2. As can be seen from the list, at least 38 people
from various bodies of the government of Maldives were involved in some significant way in

247

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 252 of 263

 

the MIBCS project. The Respondent could have called some of them to testify in these
proceedings.

221. Instead, the Respondent chose to call Mr Naseer who admittedly was not involved in
any part of the MIBCS project and who could not give any first-hand evidence.

222, Mr Naseer admitted during the hearing that he was not involved in any step of the
MIBCS project, including the following:-

The proposal submitted by the DOIE to the NPC;

The Respond publication of the Invitation for Expressions of Interest;

The preparation of the RFP, or its submission to the four shortlisted bidders;

The tender evaluation of the bids;

The decision to award the MIBCS project to Nexbis

The preparation of the Concession Agreement;

The implementation of the MIBCS project;

The project steering committee that oversaw the implementation of the MIBCS; and
The repudiation of the Concession Agreement on 5 August 2013.

See Transcripts, Day 3, p. 71-73.

‘rp meae ge

223. Yet he was put forward as the Respondent’s sole factual witness to testify on these
issues.

224. The Respondent’s choice of witness is suspect, given the number of people who
would have been compellable, and far better placed to give evidence.

225. Mr Naseer could offer no explanation on behalf of the Respondent as to why people
who were far better informed than he were not called to give evidence.

226. A former Attorney General of the Respondent, one Aishath Azima Shakoor, had
stated to the press that she would play a role in the “Nexbis and GMR cases” and “will lead
the international arbitration”: 6 CHB 4288. She may have been able to shed light on a variety
of issues, including the AGO’s opinion on the enforceability of the CA. However, she did not
come forward as a witness.

227. Mohamed Nazim, the Minister of Defence and National Security at that time who
signed the Termination Letter would also have been able to give first-hand evidence on the
reasons for the termination of the CA. He too was not put forward as a witness.

228. Mr Naseer admitted that the was not aware why Aishath Azima Shakoor or Mohamed
Nazim were not put forward as witnesses when they would have been far more involved in
the termination of the CA that Mr Naseer: Transcripts, Day 4, p. 108-110.

229. The DolE officials who were part of the PSC would have been able to give relevant
evidence on the Claimant’s performance of the CA, and verify whether the dala centre which
contained the passenger information was sitting in DoIE’s offices in the Maldives. However
they were not called as witnesses, and Mr Naseer admitted that he does not know why this
was the case: Transcripts, Day 4, p. 62 to p. 65, line 9.

248

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 253 of 263

 

230. The inference is that the Respondent did not want its evidence to be tested. If persons
with actual knowledge of the circumstances of the case were tendered as witnesses, on cross-
examination, the Respondent’s assertions in this case would have tumbled like a house of
cards, Therefore, the Respondent chose to put up a witness who did not have any personal
knowledge of the facts, so that when questioned, the witness could simply state that he is
repeating facts which he understood from his colleagues and cannot say anything more.

231. The Respondent’s hesitance to have its evidence tested speaks volumes on its
confidence in its own case.

232. It is submitted that this Tribunal should, in the circumstances, draw an adverse
inference against the Respondent for failing to call relevant witnesses to prove its case.

*” [199]-{205] read:
The evidence against the Controller

199. It is the Respondent's case that the Controller’s actions similarly constituted
corruption under Section 12(a) of the PPCA.

200. The Controller was part of the team that had evaluated the First Technical Evaluation.
As a result of accepting the twenty nine scholarships which the Claimant had proposed that it
would provide, it was found that the team had considered a component which it should not
have. Therefore, the First Technical Evaluation, which had awarded the Claimant the highest
marks, was considered to be invalid.

201. Thereafter, the Controller continued to show preference to the Claimant and went out
of his way to ensure that the Claimant would be awarded the Concession Agreement, by
removing from its path officials who had been involved in the MIBCS project but were not in
favour of the Claimant. This can be seen in the two following occasions:

[Statement of Adam Naseer, 3RBD, Tab 3, Page 2573, Annex 61 of the ACC Report]

“T shared all the information with the government entities because the government
will have to pay a large sum of money for this project, I believe that the citizen of
Maldives must gain a profit from this and there must be a solution to the problems of
foreign workers which is a crisis in Maldives. As I kept informing the government,
Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim who was the Controller at that moment openly disapproved
about that matter. Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim openly and repeatedly asked me not to say
things (criticize) about the project and that the project was not of any concern to me.
After few days thereafter, I found out that this project was awarded to a Malaysian
company called Nexbis Limited. Nexbis Company did not state an exact price for the
project.”

(Emphasis added.)

[Statement of Ibrahim Waheed, 3RBD, Tab 3, Page 2580-1, Annex 61 of the ACC Report]

249

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 254 of 263

 

“In the meeting, I discussed about bringing some changes to the proposal made by
Nexbis and to add some components to the agreement, As such, asked them to request
Nexbis to include the technical specifications of the hardware and software. While 1
was giving information at the meeting, Ilyas Hussein contacted me by phone and
asked me to come back to the office. After I returned to work, he removed all IT
related responsibilities from me and told me not to criticize any IT related issues and
to just come to work after that. As I remember, it was a Thursday. The border control
systems agreement was signed on 17th September 2010 after the previous allocated
signing date was pushed forward. When the agreement was signed, the amendments
discussed with the AG’s Office and Finance was not incorporated into the agreement.
After I was sidelined from IT related work, Chief Immigration Officer Ahmed
Waheed was assigned as the project’s officer.

In summary, I can say that, by making an RFP that’s different from the proposal
submitted to NPC, and because things such as the scholarships which were in the bid
were not included in the agreement, and while no amendments were made to the
agreement as per the AG’s advice, and as I was stripped of my title when I advocated
to change some aspects of the project, and also as the agreement was signed way
before it was previously set to be signed, I am lead to believe that these were things so
in fear of tosing some unfair advantages or improper benefits that some people stood
to gain.”

(Emphasis added.)

202. The Controller had even gone so far as to claim that he had drafted the Concession
Agreement (3RBD, Tab 3, Page 2552]. He stated that “{t]he draft agreement was not one
presented by Nexbis. I created the original of the draft by making reference to previous
agreements”. This is plainly untrue, given that even the official who had been on the same
team as him for the First Technical Evaluation had stated that it was the Claimant that had
drafted the Concession Agreement and the Controller then handed a copy of this to him:

[Statement of Abdullah Waheed, 3RBD, Tab 3, page 2538, Annex 61 of the ACC Report]
“Draft of the agreement was prepared and submitted by Nexbis. Nexbis even
contacted finance ministry regarding the draft of the agreement. I was given a copy of

the draft agreement by Ilyas Hussein Ibrahim.”

203. This is further backed up by the following statement by Ilyas’ successor, speaking of
the capabilities of the DOJE at that point in time:

[Statement of Abdullah Shahid, 3RBD, Tab 3, page 2558, Annex 61 of the ACC Report]
“I believe that the agreement between the Maldivian Government and Nexbis, to hand
over the project to Nexbis, was also drafted by Nexbis. At that time, there would not
have been anyone at immigration capable of drafting an agreement in English to that
standard.”

204. Lastly, Ilyas had led a team of DOIE officials, consisting of Ibrahim Ashraf and
Ahmed Naseem, to have a meeting with the Claimant while the bidding process was

250

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 255 of 263

 

underway and sometime around February 2010. This was confirmed by Mr Ibrahim Naseer
during cross examination, who stated that Mr Ahmed Naseem himself had told him that he
had met with the Claimant in Malaysia.

Transcripts, Day 3, 7 October 2015, page 120, lines 1 to 15

Q. You said, "I heard from my colleagues", Can you tell the tribunal, please, who are these
colleagues that told you this?

A. I would say this --

Q. Yes?

A. Ahmed Nazim (sic), one of the colleague who was there at the meeting.
Q. Yes?

A. Who went to the -- who went to Malaysia and he told me.

Q. What did he tell you?

A. He said he heard -- he met with them.

Q. With who?

A. With the Nexbis.

Q. With the Nexbis?

A. Yes.

205. For the reasons set out above, the Respondent humbly submits that the Controller had
shown a preference to the Claimant and conferred upon it an undue advantage by ensuring
that the Claimant would win the bidding process. He had also used his position to remove
officials from their posts where he felt that they might jeopardize the signing of the
Concession Agreement.

“" [131]-[145] read:

The Second technical evaluation
131. The circumstances of Saamee Ageel’s involvement in the Second Technical
Evaluation are dubious.

132. In the wake of the First Technical Evaluation being cancelled, Saamee Agee! cobbled
together a second team which would purportedly evaluate the technical bids for a second
time. Although it was within his duty and job scope to make such arrangements, what is
striking is that the team was put together informally without even telling them that their work
would be used as part of the Second Technical Evaluation.

133. This is reflected in Faaiq Umar’s statement to the ACC, dated 14 March 2011 [3RBD,
Tab 3, Page 2507]; Mohamed Naaiz’s statement to the ACC, dated 18 May 2011 [3RBD, Tab
3, Page 2545]; and Mohamed Faisal’s statement to the ACC, dated 18 May 2011 [3RBD, Tab
3, Page 2541], all of which say that no formal request was given to them to conduct the
Second Technical Evaluation. Instead, they had received a phone call merely asking them to
discuss a tender or give a technical opinion on a technical bid. Faaiq Umar had identified the
person who called him to be Saamee Ageel [3RBD,Tab 3, page 2507].

134. Not only is it clear from the statements that they were given short preparation time to
analyze the bids, it is also puzzling that Mohamed Naaiz himself stated [at 3RBD, Tab 3,
Page 2545] that “our technical opinion was not a technical evaluation”.

251

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 256 of 263

 

135. Despite the above, a dubious evaluation sheet purporting to be scores for the Second
Technical Evaluation was then presented [4CHB, Tab 134 at page 2714], in which the scores
set out in the report for the “Second Technical Evaluation” were adopted and furthermore, the
remaining sections were evaluated. This Second Technical Evaluation reflected the Claimant
as being the overall winner of the technical evaluation.

136. It is the Respondent’s case that one of the suspicious circumstances surrounding this
Second Technical Evaluation was that it was unclear exactly who had carried out the
evaluation of the remaining portions of the Second Technical Evaluation.

137, The evaluation sheet itself attributes the additional marks being scored by the Tender
Evaluation Section. The authenticity of this evaluation sheet has not been disputed by the
Claimant. Given that the section was one which Saamee Ageel was heading, it is therefore
likely that these scores were in fact given by him, or at least, that he had been involved in the
awarding of the scores.

138. This is in fact backed up by Ahmed Jinah Ibrahim and Saamee Ageel himself, both of
whom were from the Tender Evaluation Section:

[Statement of Ahmed Jinah Ibrahim, 3RBD, Tab 3, Page 2512, Annex 61 of the ACC Report]

“Therefore, this Bid, for a second time, was evaluated by a team established by the
Ministry of Finance and Treasury. The said team, in carrying out the evaluation
Jooked into three (3) aspects out of the six (6) main aspects; which include “Service
Response” or the “B.O.T. solution”; “Installation” and “Implementation Details and
Training”. I believe that the said Team looked into only the aforementioned 3 (three)
aspects and chose to forgo the remaining three (3), because the former three (3) is
associated with the technicalities, and the remaining three (3) involved (Bidders*
Profile, Reference and Experience and Supplement Information); whereby the latter
aspects are areas which, even the Tender Evaluation Section could assess. As such,
the latter aspects had been assessed by the Tender Evaluation Section.”

(Emphasis added.)
[Statement of Saamee Ageel, 3RBD, Tab 3, page 2516, Annex 61 of the ACC Report]

“Therefore, a second evaluation was conducted by a team that was formed by the
Minister of Finance and Treasury. The second team formed to conduct the technical
evaluation evaluated only 3 parts out of the main 6 mentioned in the R.F.P. as parts to
be evaluated. They were Service Response or B.O.T Solution, Installation and
Implementation Details and Training. | believe that the reason why the team evaluated
only 3 parts is because they did not have enough time and those 3 parts were the
technically important elements. Also the rest of the 3 (bidder’s profile, reference and
experience, supplemental information) could be evaluated by the tender. They were in
fact, evaluated by the Tender Evaluation Section. The Minister of Finance and
Treasury had also advised that the evaluation and the awarding of marks for the above
mentioned 3 parts, would be sufficient to determine the technical part of the entire bid
and therefore, the second team completed their evaluation.”

252

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 257 of 263

 

(Emphasis added.)

139. There are two problems with Saamee Ageel’s statement here. First, it is clear that the
second team did not even consider that they were giving an evaluation but had merely given a
technical opinion. This can be seen in how what they had done was render a report on the
technical evaluation setting out some of their findings, as opposed to filling up an evaluation
sheet and signing off on it like the E.O.I evaluations and the First Technical Evaluation.

140. Next Saamee Ageel says that only three parts of the bids were “evaluated” by the
second team and goes on to give two contradictory reasons for this: (i) the rest of the three
could be evaluated by the Tender Evaluation Section; and (ii) the Minister of Finance and
Treasury had advised that only three categories would be sufficient to determine the technical
part of the entire bid.

141. It is clear that the second reason was without merit given that the remaining three
components had to be evaluated anyway and was eventually done so by the Tender
Evaluation Section, headed by Saamee Ageel:

“The technical evaluation was done for a second time by technical experts on request
by the former Minister, after there were some suspicions about the first evaluation that
was done by a team of the Department of Immigration and Emigration. This second
team formed by the Minister, consisted of individuals that held high positions in the
Government and were independent experts who worked in this field. | do not think
that the documents will say that the team was formed by the Minister. The team did
not finish the entire technical evaluation of the project because they could not give
enough time due to their busy schedules. However, they did say that they would finish
the most important parts or components of the work they were assigned. | think that
they evaluated only the “BOT” solution’s component. Therefore they only evaluated
40% out of the total 60%. The rest of the 20% were evaluated by the Tender Section.
Therefore I believe that J, as the head of the section, should be responsible for the
20% that was evaluated by the Tender Evaluation Section.” [See 3RBD, Tab 3, Page
2600}

142, It is no wonder that the documents do not reflect that the Minister had formed the
team (as stated by Saamee Ageel in the extract above) since, as Faaiq Umar had stated, it was
Saamee Ageel who was the one. Saamee Ageel’s statement is therefore contradictory and
shows that he has much to hide.

143. Thereafter, as noted by a member of the Tender Evaluation Board, Zeeniya Ahmed
Haamid, “the second technical evaluation made was presented to the Board by the secretariat
of the Board Mr Saamee Ageel” [3RBD, Tab 3, page 2583]. The tender evaluation board
then approved the marks awarded for this evaluation.

144. Could Saamee Ageel and/or the Tender Evaluation Section have done this evaluation?
The answer must be no, looking at the clear demarcation of the job scope as stated by Saamee
Ageel, when in reference to the E.0.I evaluations, where he states [3RBD, Tab 3, Page
2515):

253

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 258 of 263

 

“It is in the hands of the technical evaluators to see if the parties are technically
eligible for the project, during technical evaluation.”

145. It is submitted that the same should apply for the technical evaluations and even more
so, given that this involved an in depth security of the bid documents that had been submitted
by the interested parties which would have many technical specifics. Furthermore, paragraph
1.6.3.5 of the ACC Report [IRBD, Tab 3, page 300] had stated that one of the reasons for the
need to conduct the Second Technical Evaluation was that the team which conducted the First
Technical Evaluation did not have experience from the area of Information Technology. The
Tender Evaluation Section similarly, did not possess such experience. While it may be
argued that the more technical aspects were covered by the team comprising of Faaiq Umar,
Mohamed Naaiz and Mohamed Faisal, the other components evaluated by the Tender
Evaluation Section were that of the bidder’s profile and experience. These too, had to be
considered with the appropriate Information Technology background.

i 164]-[97] read
i. Singapore law

64. Under Singapore law, the law applicable to the CA, there is no general doctrine that
the contract can be set aside for being “tainted with corruption”. Under Singapore law:-

a. A contract can be avoided for “illegality” (whether at common law or statutory) or for
being in contravention of public policy; and

b. A principal can avoid a contract where it was procured through the bribery of its
agent.

65. | The common thread in these doctrines is that the person against whom the contract is
sought to be avoided must have been culpable in some way, such that the Court will not lend
its assistance to such a party.

66. The Singapore law position on the defence of illegality and public policy was recently
ehicidated in the Court of Appeal case Ting Siew May v Boon Lay Choo & Anor [2014]
SGCA 28.

67. The starting point of this defence is that “it is founded in general principles of
policy... The principle of public policy is this: ex dolo malo non oritur actio. No Court will
lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. If...
the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgression of a positive law of
this country, there the Court says that he has no right to be assisted... because they will not
lend their aid to such a plaintiff”: Ting Siew May at [23] , quoting with approval Holman v
Johnson (1775) | Cowp 341. (Emphasis ours)

   

68. The law of illegality and public policy has traditionally been divided into two broad
areas: (i) statutory illegality; and (ii) illegality at common law. The former raises issues of
whether a contract is prohibited by a particular statutory provision, and involves ascertaining
the legislative intent of that provision. The latter raises issues of whether or not the existing

254

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 259 of 263

 

heads of public policy can be extended, and if so, in what manner: Ting Siew May at [27] to
[28].

a) Common law illegality and public policy

69. There are several heads of public policy which are well established in common law.
The general view is that these heads of public policy will not be extended: Phang, The Law of
Contract in Singapore, [13.060] to [13.064. The established heads of public policy have been
set out in Phang, The Law of Contract in Singapore at [13.065] to [13.113]. One such
established head pertains to contracts that are liable to corrupt public life (see [13.110]). This
head related to instances pertaining to the buying, selling or procuring of public offices and
titles. Contracts falling under this category must pertain to public administration and involve
national funds. Another established head pertain to contracts to commit a crime, tort or fraud
(see [13.092].

70. Contracts that are entered into with the object of committing an illegal act will also be
unenforceable at common law. “The application of this principle depends upon proof of the
intent, at the time the contract was made, to break the law; if the intent is mutual the contract
is not enforceable at all, and, if unilateral, it is unenforceable at the suit of the party who is
proved to have it”: Ting Siew May at [42] to [43]. (Emphasis ours)

b) Express statutory illegality

71. Where contracts of a specific type are expressly declared to be illegal by a particular
statute, the contract is rendered void and unenforceable from its very inception or formation:
Halsbury Laws of Singapore, Contract Law, at [80.260].

72. There do not appear to be any statutes in Singapore which expressly state that
contracts entered into by government employees which confers an undue advantage on a third
party are illegal.

c) Implied statutory illegality

73. As stated by the learned editors of Halsbury Laws of Singapore, Contract Law at
[80.264, “most contraventions of statutory provisions or regulations carry an accompanying
criminal penalty, but that a criminal penalty per se does not settle the issue with regard to the
(civil) status of the contract in question. In this regard, the further (and crucial) question has
to be asked: is the object of the statute or provision thereof merely to prohibit the conduct (in
which case the criminal penalty would be deemed to constitute a sufficient sanction) or is the
object of the statute to additionally prohibit the very contract itself? If it is in fact the latter,
then the contract itself is impliedly prohibited...”

74. There do not appear to be any statutes in Singapore which have as its object the

prohibition of contracts entered into by government employees which confer undue
advantage on a third party.

d) Contracts procured by bribery

75. Under Singapore agency law, where a contract is entered into by an agent under the
influence of bribery, or, to the knowledge of the other contracting party, in violation of his
duties to his principle, the contract will be voidable by the principal.

76. In PT International Nickel Indonesia v General Trading Corp (M) Sdn Bhd [1977 —
1978] SLR(R) 58 , the Singapore Court of Appeal, in the context of a summary judgment
application, considered what would be the contractual implications if the defendant-appeliant
was able to prove its allegations that the plaintiff-respondent had procured its 35 contracts
with the appellant by bribery.

77. The Court of Appeal held at [13] and [23] that:-

“Every contract made or act done by an agent under the influence of bribery, or, to the
knowledge of the other contracting party, in violation of his duty to his principal, is
voidable by the principal”

“St is clear law that the contract between the briber and the recipient of the bribe is an
illegal contract and it cannot form the basis of a claim before the courts.”
(Emphasis added)
728. In other words, to avoid the CA vis-a-vis the Claimant, the Respondent must show
either:-

a That the Claimant bribed its government officials, which were its agents; or
b. The government officials were violating their duties to it, and this was known to the
Claimant.

79. There is no principle in Singapore !aw that a principal may avoid a contract where an
agent has, unknown to the third party, conferred an undue advantage on the third party, by
failing to follow its own internal procedures.

ii. Maldivian Law

80. As stated at [277] to [282] CCS:-

a. The Respondent’s Maldivian Law expert confirmed that there is no Maldivian case
where a contract was declared void solely on the ground that there was a breach of section 12
of the PPCA;

b. The Respondent’s Maldivian law expert was also of the view that the government
cannot terminate a contract just because one of its government servant had committed an act
of corruption;

c. He also accepted that the government cannot terminate a contract just because its own
internal processes were not followed; and
d. The Respondent’s AGO had opined that lapses in internal procedure would result in

the sanction of the government official responsible for that lapse, but is not sufficient basis to
terminate a contract.

256

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 261 of 263

 

81. It therefore appears that under Maldivian contract law, a contract entered into by a
government official in breach of section 12 of the PPCA is not per se voidable on that basis.

82. In the RCS, the Respondent has not addressed its own expert’s fatal admissions that
under Maldivian contract law, a contract will not be avoided on the basis that a government
official breached section 12 of the PPCA in awarding the contract to a third party.

83. What is significant, however, is that the PPCA itself makes a distinction between the
offences of “bribery” and that of conferring an “undue advantage”. The offence of conferring
an undue advantage means something other than bribery. The offences from sections 2 to 1!
pertained to bribery, and the offences under section 12 and 13 pertained to the conferment of
an undue advantage, which did not amount to bribery. There propositions were accepted by
Mr Siraj: Transcripts, Day 6, p. 34-40. It is therefore clear that under Maldivian law at least,
the term “corruption” was used as a convenient shorthand to encompass both the offences of
bribery and the conferment of undue advantage (which is something other than bribery):
Transcripts, Day 6, p. 30, 40-42.

ili. Transnational Public Policy

84. The Respondent has made the following broad sweeping statement at [99] to [112]
RCS:-

a. Corruption is internationally abhorred and vigorously denounced. Corruption is an
international evil that is contrary to good morals and to an international public policy
common to the community of nations.

b. Corruption does not only encompass bribery, but “encompasses all situations where
“agents and public officers break the confidence entrusted in them.”: Hwang, M and Lim, K.,
Corruption in Arbitration ~ Law and Reality ;

c Transnational public policies and mandatory laws should apply in international
arbitrations, notwithstanding the governing law of the contract. These mandatory laws
include law, the respect for which is regarded as crucial for safeguarding public interest.

d. Applying transnational public policy, the Tribunal in World Duty Free v Kenya found
that claims based on contracts or contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld.

85. In making its submission, the Respondent completely failed to address the critical
issue of what exactly “corruption”, or the “break of confidence entrusted in agents and public
officers” or “laws crucial for safeguarding public interests” mean under transnational public
policy. Specifically, the Respondent completely failed to address whether under transnational
public policy, one contracting party can avoid an agreement vis-a-vis the other contracting
party, based on its own lapses in internal procedure which may amount to a breach of law by
its own government official, but in which the other contracting party was not involved in any
manner whatsoever.

86. As we show below (based on the authorities cited by the Respondent), even under
transnational public policy, a contract that was not procured by bribery and which did not
involve wrongdoing on the part of the Claimant, cannot be set aside by the Respondent.

87. The starting point is that an arbitral tribunal would normally rely upon the substantive

law of the contract chosen by the parties based upon the principle of party autonomy, except

257

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 262 of 263

 

to the extent that it violates “generally accepted international norms.”: Raouf, How Should
International Arbitrators Tackle Corruption Issues? at [22] .

88. In unpacking what these “generally accepted international norms” are, Hwang, M. and
Lim, K. refer to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (““UNCAC”) and state
that “international consensus on a broad definition of both public and private sector
corruption can nevertheless be found in Arts 15, 16 and 21 of the [UNCAC]... Article 15(a)
of the UNCAC (which applies to the bribery of both national and foreign public officials by
virtue of Art 16(1) of the UNCAC) defines corruption in the public sector by the payer of a
bribe as the act of (1) ‘intentionally’, (2) ‘promis[ing], offering or giving’, (3) ‘to... a
[national or foreign] public official’, (4) ‘directly or indirectly’, (5) ‘of an undue advantage’,
(6) ‘for the official himself or herself or another entity’, (7) ‘in order that the official act or
refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her official duties’. Corruption by the recipient of
a public sector bribe is similarly defined under Art 15(b) as the mirror image of the bribe
payer’s corrupt act... Corruption on the private sector by the payer and recipient of a bribe in
Art 21 closely tracks the same linguistic formulae used in Article 15(a) and 15(b)...”: 2 RBA,
Vol 1, Tab 3, p. 55

89. The learned authors went on to state that “outright bribery aimed at subverting state
official’s proper discharge of their duties is clearly a violation of transnational public
policy... However, laws prohibiting intermediary agreements which contemplate the exercise
of influence over government officials do not reflect transnational public policy, given the
significant differences between jurisdictions regarding the propriety of such agreements...”:
[2RBA, Vol 1, Tab 3, p. 75]

90. Bribery is clearly against transnational public policy. The same cannot be said of the
unilateral conferment of undue advantage on a third party by a government official, in the
absence of the giving of a bribe or any corrupt act by the said third party.

91. As shown above, laws on which jurisdictions differ significantly cannot amount to
transnational public policy. Even if the conferment of an undue advantage on a third party is
defined as ‘corruption’ in Maldivian law, it does not amount to corruption in transnational
public policy, given the lack of international consensus that such conduct amounts to
corruption. In any event, as stated above, the term “corruption” is used in Maldivian law only
as a convenient shorthand to encompass all the offiences under the PPCA, in
contradistinction to the specific offence of bribery.

92. Finally, the Respondent cannot rely upon World Duty Free v Kenya to assert that
corruption, howsoever it may choose to define it, will have the effect of avoiding a contract.
World Duty Free concerned a case where the claimant investor had paid the President of
Kenya a bribe of US$2 million to obtain a contract. (Under Maldivian law, this would have
amounted to “The offence of offering and accepting bribery in relation to a task undertaken
by the government” under section 2 of the PPCA.)

93, The tribunal avoided the contract on the basis that the contract was obtained by

bribery, which it held was contrary to international public policy. This is apparent from the
decision of the tribunal, where it stated:-

258

Case 1:19-cv-00255-BAH Document 1-2 Filed 01/30/19 Page 263 of 263

 

“... this Tribunal is convinced that bribery is contrary to the international public
policy of most, if not all, States, or, to use another formula, to transnational public
policy. Thus, claims based on contracts of corruption or contracts obtained by
corruption cannot be upheld by this Arbitral Tribunal.” (at [157]) (Emphasis ours)

94. By the term “corruption”, the tribunal was evidently referring to bribery.

95. The second reason given by the tribunal therein for avoiding the contract was that
under the public policy of both England (governing law of the contract) and Kenya (place
where contract was to be performed), the claimant would not have been permitted to maintain
any of its pleaded claims on the ground of ex turpi causa non oritur actio, which rests on a
principle of public policy that the courts will not assist a plaintiff who has been guilty of
illegal or immoral conduct: at [158] to [165].

96. A survey of the authorities cited by the Respondent on transnational public policy
therefore shows that:~

 

a. A contract will only be avoided vis-a-vis the Claimant if the Claimant obtained the
contract by bribery; and
b. The Tribunal would not assist the Claimant to enforce the contract only when it was

guilty of an illegal or immoral act.

97. There is no authority for the proposition that under transnational public policy,
contracts tainted with anything short of an active act of corruption by the claimant, will be
avoided.

Q. Did the draft come from Nexbis, "yes" or "no"?
A.No.

Transcripts, Day 1, Pages 84 to 85, starting from line 12

Q ... Just to help you, volume 3, you start at page 2567. You will see that the person who gave the statement
to ACC is Abdullah Muiz. To be fair to you, I will inform you, and you can take it from me that Abdullah Muiz
was the Solicitor-General at that time. Okay? This isa statement he gave. If you turn to the next two pages,
page 2569, at the right at the top, Solicitor-General said: "The Attorney-General’ Office was not asked to assist
in a drafting of the agreement signed between the Government of Maldives and Nexbis to establish the Maldives
Border Control System. I was informed that a draft was prepared and sent by the successful bidder of the border
control project, Nexbis Limited." Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. So we have a statement from the Solicitor-General, so I have a basis to ask: it was Nexbis who prepared the
draft and had forwarded it to Mr Ilyas. Is that correct or is that wrong?

A. No, that's not correct.

Q. Okay.
