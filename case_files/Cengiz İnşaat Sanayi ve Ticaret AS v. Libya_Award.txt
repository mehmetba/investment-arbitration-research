I. INTRODUCTION

GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE CASE

 

This is an investment arbitration dispute subject to the Rules of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce, in force as from January 1, 2012 [“ICC Rules”).
The proceeding involves various alleged breaches by the State of Libya under the
Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Great Socialist People’s Libyan
Arab Jamahiriya — the State of Libya’s legal predecessor — concerning the Reciprocal
Promotion and Protection of Investments dated November 25, 2009, which entered into
force on April 22, 2011 [the “Treaty” or the “BIT”].

Claimant, a Turkish construction company, through its Libyan subsidiary, entered into
two contracts with the Libyan Housing and Infrastructure Board [“HIB”], which
required Claimant to master plan, design and build integrated infrastructure in an area of
more than 3,000 hectares in the Southern region of Libya.

Claimant alleges that it held an investment in Libya, protected under the Treaty, and
that due to Libya’s breach of its obligations to provide full protection and security
[“FPS”] and fair and equitable treatment [“FET”], and due to the State of Libya’s
discriminatory measures regarding compensation of losses in times of war [War
Clause”], Claimant’s investment was completely destroyed and rendered worthless.
Claimant is unable to enjoy its investment and reap profits therefrom, and requests USD
302.6 million [“M”] in compensation for the losses and damages arising from such
breaches.

The State of Libya submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the present
dispute and that Claimant's claims should be dismissed in their entirety.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

Il. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

 

1. THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ‘

 

16. Article 8 of the BIT reads as follows:

“1. Disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an. investor of the
other Contracting Party, in connection with his investment, shall be notified
in writing, including detailed information, by the investor to the recipient
Contracting Party of the investment. As far as possible, the investor and the
concerned Contracting Party shall endeavor to settle these disputes by
consultations and negotiations in good faith.

2. If these disputes, cannot be settled in this way within ninety (90) days
following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the
dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to the competent court
of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made or
to international arbitration under:

(a) the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
set up by the ‘Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between
States and Nationals of other States’, in case both Contracting Parties become
signatories of this Convention,

(b) an ad hoc court of arbitration laid down under the Arbitration Rules of
Procedure of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL).

(c) the Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce.

3. Once the investor has submitted the dispute to the [sic] one of the dispute
settlement procedures mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article, the choice of
one of these procedures is final.

4, Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article;

(a) only the disputes arising directly out of investment activities which have
obtained necessary permission, if any, in conformity with the relevant
legislation of both Contracting Parties on foreign capital, and that effectively
started shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the International Center for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in case both Contracting Parties
become signatories of this Convention, or any other international dispute
settlement mechanism as agreed upon by the Contracting Parties;

 

(b) the disputes, related to the property and real rights upon the real estates
are totally under the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory
the investment is made, therefore shall not be submitted to jurisdiction of the
Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or any other
international dispute settlement mechanism; and

(c) with regard to the Article 64 of the ‘Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States”:

22.

23.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

The Republic of Turkey shall not accept the referral of any disputes arising
between the Republic of Turkey and any other Contracting State concerning
the interpretation or application of ‘Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States’, which is
not settled by negotiation, to the International Court of Justice.

5. The arbitration awards shall be final and binding for all parties in dispute.
Each Contracting Party commits itself to execute the award according to its
national law”.

Article 8 of the Treaty formalizes Respondent’s offer to arbitrate “[disputes between
one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other Contracting Party, in
connection with his investment” (inter alia) under the ICC Rules. Claimant accepted
such offer by filing its request for arbitration in accordance with article 8.2(c) of the
Treaty. These two acts jointly constitute the Parties’ written consent and agreement to
arbitrate the dispute under the ICC Rules.

The BIT entered into force on March 22, 2011. This fact is not disputed by the Parties.
Although Respondent did originally contest the entry into force of the BIT, it later

dropped that argument’.

 

SEAT OF ARBITRATIO’ APPLICABLE LAW

 

On March 31, 2016, the Court fixed the place of the arbitration as Paris, France.

Considering that the Parties had not agreed on the language of the arbitration, the
Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.1 dated September 30, 2016, deciding that
the language of the proceedings be English.

The proceedings are governed by the ICC Rules. The dispute arises under the Turkey-
Libya BIT, an international treaty signed between two sovereign countries, which is.
silent on the issue of applicable law. Both parties have analyzed the issue and have
agreed that the dispute should be adjudicated in accordance with the provisions of the
BIT, as supplemented by international law’. The Tribunal has confirmed such
agreement in section VII.1 infra.

COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION
Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration [the “RfA”] pursuant to the BIT? with the
ICC Secretariat on December 18, 2015. The arbitration began on that date, pursuant to

Article 4(2) of the ICC Rules.

Respondent received Claimant's Request at its address in London on January 28, 2016,
and at its address in Tripoli on February 4, 20164. The 30-day time limit for Respondent

' Yn its Draft Statement of Defence dated June 1, 2017, Respondent disputed the date of the entry into
force of the Treaty, alleging that the exchange of notifications required for the entry into force of the
Treaty never occurred (Witness Statement of Mr. Nifat, paragraph 14). Subsequently, in para, 165 of its
Statement of Defence of 21 August 2017, Respondent dropped this argument as it was. based on erroneous
research.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

to submit an Answer to the Request [the “Answer”], pursuant to Art. 5(1) of the ICC
Rules, expired on March 7, 2016.

On February 16 and 23, 2016, the Ambassador's office of the Libyan Embassy in
London informed the ICC Secretariat by email that any correspondence should be sent
directly to the relevant office in Libya and provided the email address.

However, Respondent did not file an Answer on or before March 7, 2016, nor did it
apply for an extension. Hence Claimant requested that the Court proceed in accordance
with Article 5(2) of the ICC Rules.

In accordance with Article 6(3) of the ICC Rules, if any party against which a claim has
been made does not submit an Answer, the arbitration will proceed and the arbitral
tribunal will decide any question of jurisdiction or of whether the claims can be
determined together, unless the Secretary General refers the matter to the Court for its
decision.

Furthermore, as per Article 6(8) of the ICC Rules, if any party refuses or fails to take
part in the arbitration or any stage thereof, the arbitration shall proceed notwithstanding
such refusal or failure.

By correspondence of March 14, 2016, the ICC Secretariat informed the parties that this
arbitration had not been referred to the Court and that the Arbitral Tribunal would
decide any question of jurisdiction or of whether the claims may be determined
together, after providing the Parties with an opportunity to comment.

On May 16, 2016, Mr. Mohamed B. Shaban informed the ICC Secretariat that he had
received written authority from Respondent to represent it in this dispute, Given the
situation in Libya, Mr. Shaban requested that no further action be taken in these
proceedings until September 2016.

By letter dated May 27, 2016, Claimant objected to Respondent's request that the
arbitration be held in abeyance until September 2016.

The ICC Secretariat informed the Parties on May 30, 2016 that, because the Parties had
reached no agreement with regard to the suspension of the proceedings, the case should
proceed.

On June 2, 2016, the Court confirmed Prof. Mayer as co-arbitrator upon nomination by
Claimant, pursuant to Art. 13(2) of the ICC Rules.

On June 2, 2016, the Court directly appointed Mr. Khairallah as co-arbitrator on behalf
of Respondent, who failed to nominate a co-arbitrator, pursuant to Art. 13(4) a) of the
ICC Rules.

The Tribunal was constituted on July 15, 2016, when the Court directly appointed
Mr. Fernandez-Armesto as President of the Arbitral Tribunal, pursuant to Article 13(4)
a) of the ICC Rules.

On August 2, 2016, Respondent’s counsel sent the following communication by email:
“Dear Honourable Tribunal,
It was with regret that this office has been unable so far to assist substantively
in these proceedings. The main reason for our inactivity is the difficulty in
securing adequate funding and instructions from our client, which we are
actively seeking. As the Honourable Tribunal is aware, our clients are
experiencing extreme difficulties in both the security and logistics sphere and
this has hampered their ability to be more proactive in these proceedings.
We shall revert to you as soon as we can in the circumstances.
Kind regards.
M. B. Shaban (Principal Partner)”

On August 17, 2016, the Tribunal issued its second communication® by which it:

~ granted Respondent an additional period of time, until September 15, 2016, to file a
short summary of its claims and relief sought;

- convened an in persona Case Management Conference to be held in Paris on
October 11, 2016, starting at 14.00 hours, with an agenda and at a location to be
established in due course;

comment on it by September 15, 2016; and

proposed Mrs. Krystle M. Baptista as Administrative Secretary to the Arbitral
Tribunal and invited the Parties to confirm their agreement with her appointment by
September 15, 2016.

On September 15, 2016, Claimant sent its comments to the draft Terms of Reference,
confirmed its availability for the Case Management Conference and confirmed its
agreement with the appointment of Mrs. Baptista as Secretary to the Arbitral Tribunal.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

IV. OVERVIEW

In 2003, the UN sanctions against Libya, which had kept the country insulated from the
rest of the world, were lifted*’. Shortly thereafter, Libya initiated a large infrastructure
and housing development program throughout the country to address past
underinvestment”®. The overall budget for this countrywide program was reported to be
between USD 40 billion and USD 100 billion”.

Such development program was placed under the authority of the Libyan Housing and
Infrastructure Board (HIB), which appointed Aecom, a global and prominent
construction management company, as the lead program manager for urban
developments throughout the country",

In 2008, seeking new commercial opportunities in Libya, Claimant incorporated Cengiz
Libya Construction and Investment Joint-Stock Company [“Cengiz Libya”], a Libyan
corporation, to participate in these infrastructure and housing developments”,

At the end of 2008, Cengiz Libya entered into a first contract with HIB [the “WAH
Contract”], for the construction of infrastructure on an area of approximately 1,850
hectares in the district of Wadi-al-Hayat [“WAH”] in Southwestern Libya [the “WAH
Project”}"°. The project covered the installation and construction of wastewater and
rainwater networks, fresh water supply network, pump stations, water tanks, urban
roads, street lighting, electric distribution networks and telecommunication networks"!.

Approximately a year thereafter, in November 2009, Cengiz Libya entered into a similar
contract with HIB [the “Sebha Contract”] for the development of infrastructure within
an area of approximately 1,200 hectares in Sebha City [the “Sebha Project”.

Wadi-Al-Hayat and Sebha are two southern neighboring districts of Libya with
populations of approximately 100,000 inhabitants each*. Both districts, circled in the
map below, are situated in the Libyan desert, near the Algerian border.

Source: Exhibit FTI-16: Governance of Libya, fanack-

Following the signature of the WAH and Sebha Contracts, Cengiz mobilised resources,
importing construction machines and erecting facilities and camp installations on the
construction sites.

For budgeting purposes, HIB produced indicative estimates of the value of the projects
on a per hectare basis. HIB estimated price per hectare was constant across Libya (save
for allowances") at LYD 225,000 per hectare“*. On the basis of this preliminary
estimate, the construction value of the WAH Project was estimated at LYD 488.7 M
(approximately USD 384.8 M) and the value of the Sebha Project at LYD 310.5 M
(approximately USD 244.5 M)"”.

In March 2009, the design of the WAH Project started, with construction following by
the end of the year. The design of the Sebha Project started in November 2009 and
construction started six months later.

 

* Mr. Cetin’s WS, paras. xi to xiv.

45 Ai contracts awarded by HIB at the time, including the WAH and Sebha Contracts, provided for the
unit prices. These prices were constant across Libya, save for certain geographical allowances of between
2.2% and 22.5% above the base prices, depending on where in Libya the project was situated. The
allowances for the WAH and Sebha Projects were respectively 17.4% and 15.0% (meaning that the WAH
and Sebha project attracted a price premium of 17.4% and 15.0% respectively over and above HIB’s base
prices) (see Doc. C-8a), p. 3 and Doc. C-9, p. 3). Allowances were essentially aimed at incentivising
contractors to apply for projects outside of Libya's main cities (Osborne I, para. 2.18).

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

On February 15, 2011, inspired by revolts in other Arab countries, anti-government
protests were held in the streets of Libya’s second largest city. In the following days, the
protests spread to other towns and dozens of protesters were killed by the Government,
which used lethal force against demonstrators‘’. Soon, demonstrations spread to the
capital where protestors clashed with forces loyal to the Government. The uprising
ended with Col. Gadaffi’s forty-year dictatorship after months of violence and civil war.

The design and construction works for both Projects were still ongoing in February
2011, when Cengiz started to evacuate its staff from Libya because of security
concerns”. A full evacuation occurred in August 2011, shortly after an armed attack on
the Projects™.

Cengiz subsequently established that the property and equipment left on site had been
either destroyed or stolen’'. Cengiz tried to return to Libya and, in 2013, signed
additional contracts with HIB in order to restart the works. Despite all efforts, Claimant
was unable to resume construction and was not paid outstanding sums by the
government.

Thus, Claimant initiated this Treaty claim alleging a violation of the FPS, FET and War
Clause standards, and requesting compensation for the losses and damages arising
therefrom.

shareholding was purely nominal. Pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement signed in
2008, ICDI accepted to become a passive partner, without any participation or liability
in the construction projects, and also waived the right to any “financial benefit” deriving

rekindled interest in Libya: Claimant started to monitor and visit the country looking for
business opportunities”.

In 2008, after an attempted contract with the Libyan Investment Authority, Cengiz. was
introduced to HIB, who had an urgent problem with one of their projects: Wadi Al
Hayat. HIB had awarded the WAH project to a Korean contractor, who was unable to
provide the guarantees required by the contract. Thus, HIB offered Cengiz the
possibility to substitute the Koreans, if they were ready to bid on short notice”.

 

By this time, Colonel Gadaffi had been in power for 40 years and the situation in Libya
was relatively stable’. Libya was attracting international companies from around the
world, in an effort to improve its housing, roads, utilities, hotels, universities, ports,
railways and desalination plants”.

The Libyan economy was supported by windfall profits from the sale of oil, leading to
strong economic performance”. To ensure growth and consolidate social gains, Libya
launched a Public Investment Plan with an initial estimated allocation of about USD
225B for the period 2008-2012, (which was then reduced at the end of 2008)", designed
to:

“address the most pressing needs in terms of improvement of the provision of
public services, and to deal with a backlog of infrastructure rehabilitation, plus
major modernization and expansion needs”*.

According to the World Bank Main Report, by 2009 the size and performance of public
investment in Libya had been steadily improving, and Libya’s efforts to fill the
infrastructure gap had been remarkable™. In particular, the big winners of the increased
budget allocations were housing, urban development and infrastructure, which together
represented about half of total investment for 200784.

In this context, Cengiz found that the WAH project was financially attractive and in
order to comply with the Libyan law requirement that the tenderer ought to be a Libyan
company with a Libyan minority shareholder, it partnered with ICDI® and incorporated
Cengiz Libya’”.

THE CONTRACTS
Cengiz Libya and HIB entered into two separate contracts:
- On December 30, 2008, Cengiz Libya signed the WAH Contract to design and build

the infrastructure of an area of 1,850 hectares at 12 sites in the Wadi Al Hayat
Shabia south region. The contract area included the following localities, located in

Almost a year later, on November 8, 2009, Cengiz Libya entered into the Sebha
Contract to master plan, design and build infrastructure in an area of 1,200 hectares
in the Sebha south region.

The WAH and Sebha Contracts and Projects will be jointly referred to as the
“Contracts” and the “Projects”.

MAIN CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS

WAH Contract

 

Scope of Contract

According to the WAH Contract, Cengiz Libya would review and complete the design
and then construct the “integrated facilities” (i.e. roads, water supply, street lighting,
electric distribution networks and telecommunication networks) of 12 localities in the
WAH District, covering an area of 1,850 hectares**.

When Cengiz Libya and HIB signed the WAH Contract, master planning was not
included in the scope of Cengiz Libya’s work®’. However, on May 11, 2009 an
Addendum to the WAH Contract was signed and Cengiz Libya was entrusted with
master planning” and was awarded additional fees’!

Price

The initial value of the WAH Contract was calculated at LYD 488,677,50092. Such
initial value was based on an estimate calculated by HIB, on the basis of the areas to be
constructed, multiplied by a unit price per hectare’*. The final cost of the Contract
would result from multiplying the price categories by the amount of work actually

performed (for measurable work)".

The WAH Contract specified that the studies and designs would constitute 1% of the
total contract cost, which HIB would pay upon approval.

Duration

The duration of the WAH Project was fixed at 44 months’.

Guarantees

For the WAH Contract to become binding, Cengiz Libya had to deposit a performance
bond with HIB for 2% of total cost of the contract. The bond was to guarantee full
execution of Cengiz Libya’s duties”. In addition, to receive an advance payment of
15% of the contract cost, Cengiz Libya had to submit a second letter of guarantee equal
to amounts advanced, to remain in place until completion of the Contract’.

Cengiz in fact obtained and delivered two guarantees in favor of HIB”:

- A performance bond of EUR 5,65 M”; and

- Anadvance payment bond of EUR 42 M™.

Payment terms

The WAH Contract established the possibility of advance payments. In particular, an
initial advance payment amounting to 15% of the contract cost could be requested by
Cengiz Libya after delivery of the work site, submission of the letter of guarantee and

registration of the contract with the tax authority'*'.

HIB made, an advance payment to Cengiz Libya of LYD 72,559,200 for the WAH
Contract”.

Discretionary powers of HIB

HIB had a wide discretion under the Contract, including a unilateral right to increase or
decrease the contract value by 20%!" and to cancel the contract in the public interest’.

Insurance

Cengiz Libya acquired the duty to obtain insurance to cover “the completed work,
materials, instruments and equipment located at the work site against theft, fire and
destruction”. The insurance ought to also protect against “all contractor risks” until

initial acceptance".

Jurisdiction

The WAH Contract attributes Libyan courts the jurisdiction to hear any dispute arising
from the contract'*®,

Sebha Contract

 

Scope of the Project

The Sebha Project included master planning, design and build of “fully integrated
infrastructure” for the city of Sebha, including design and build of drinking water
systems, sewage systems and networks, roads, sidewalks, lighting network, traffic signs
and signals, civil works for telephone system and electrical networks!”’.

Price

 

The estimated value of the Sebha Contract was calculated at LYD 310,500,000108. As in
the WAH Contract, such initial value was based on an estimate calculated by HIB, on
the basis of the areas to be designed, multiplied by a unit price per hectare". The final
cost of the Contract would be the amount that resulted from multiplying the price
categories by the amount of work actually performed (for measurable work)!,

The Sebha Contract specified that the master planning would constitute 0.5% of the
estimated value of the Contract and that the studies and designs would constitute 1% of
the total contract cost, which HIB would pay upon approval!"

Duration

The duration of the Sebha Project was fixed at 30 months!2,

Guarantees

 

Similarly to the WAH Contract, for the Sebha Contract to become binding, Cengiz
Libya had to deposit a performance bond with HIB for 2% of total cost of the contract.
The bond was to remain under HIB’s control as a guarantee of full execution and to
ensure any duties due from Cengiz Libya'"*. In addition, in order to receive an advance
payment of 15% of the contract cost, Cengiz Libya had to submit a letter of guarantee
for the value of the advance that ought to remain in place until completion of the
Contract!"*,

Thus, for the Sebha Project, Cengiz obtained and delivered two guarantees in favor of
HIB':

- A letter of performance bond valued at EUR 4 M!"® and

- An advance payment bond valued at EUR 26.3 M"”,

The provisions regarding payment terms, powers of HIB, insurance and jurisdiction are
similar to those established in the WAH Contract. HIB made an advance payment of
LYD 43,631,700, representing 15% of the estimated value of the Contract!"®
EXPANSION OF THE PROJECTS'"”

After the signature of the Contracts the scope of both Projects was expanded”, On May
11, 2009, master planning was added to the WAH Contract’! and in July 2010 the
initial scope of works for both sites was extended in two ways’:

- The urban networks to be developed were densifled; and

- The area encompassing the Projects was increased.

This led to two consequences: HIB and Cengiz Libya agreed to increase:

- the duration'?*; and

- the price of the Contracts.

The revised value of the WAH project was estimated at LYD 1.5 B and the revised
value of the Sebha project was estimated at LYD 1.4 B™.

After this initial expansion of the projects, in March 2010 HIB was confronted with
budget constraints'” and, while it attempted to arrange additional funds, it decided to
retain the detail design for projects and to remove certain works from the scope of the
Contracts’”*.

As aresult, the situation of the Project at the date of stoppage, was as follows'””

- The revised contract prices amounted to LYD 496,007,662 for the WAH Project and
LYD 318,274,313 for the Sebha project'*

- The Parties reached a provisional arrangement: the electrical and
telecommunications works of the WAH Project would be executed later and, at the
Sebha Project, the most densely populated areas would be accorded priority 2?

4, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION (2009-2011)

AY WAH Project

147. Cengiz Libya started the design process for the WAH Project in March 2009, once the
notice to proceed had been signed",

148. — Given the remoteness of the location, as a first step Cengiz Libya decided to construct
and set up a main camp [the “WAH Main Camp” ] outside of Germah and close to the
Al Grayfah village. This was accomplished by December 2009131. The camp was
extensive (6,245 sqm.) and included a number of facilities: main office, dining hall,
dormitories for engineers, staff, foreman and workers, recreation area, mosque,
laboratories, infirmary, VIP guest house, warehouse, workshop, baths and WCs,
laundry, engineer office!”

- aconcrete batching plant,

- an asphalt plant,

a mixing plant,

a precast plant for manholes, and a

crushing and screening plant'**.

150.  Cengiz Libya commenced installation of these plants in October 2010134, and they were
fully operational by December 2010135.

151.  Cengiz Libya also deployed an important fleet of self-owned machinery and equipment
(including asphalt pavers, graders, soil compactors, drilling machines, concrete
transmixers, loaders, bitumen sprayer, excavators, bulldozers, forklifts, tankers, cranes,
trucks and generators)!*°.

The value of the site mobilization, as estimated by Claimant’s experts, was USD 35.3
M”.

On December 8, 2009, the WAH Project construction works started in the village of Al
Grayfah (near the main camp), and in the cities of Awbari and Germah"™: site cleaning,
earth works of levelling, trenches, installation of wastewater lines, sewage treatment
plant and other underground utilities”.

Cengiz Libya was able to perform 9% of the construction work, before the project was
suspended due to the security situation in March 2011140. Work progress was
documented in Payment Certificates, which were approved by HIB up to PC No.5 dated
February 2011141. The last PC, PC No.6 dated April 2011, was never signed by HIB,
because its consultants had left the site in February 2011142.

In 2009, HIB made an advance payment to Cengiz Libya of LYD 72.5 M, representing
15% of the estimated value of the WAH Contract'*. HIB then made two additional
payments, in June and October 2010, which partially covered PC 1 and PC 2. No
additional payments were performed",

Similar i and equi were and mobilized for the Sebha
Project’. A main camp was set up close to Sebha [the “Sebha Main Camp” ], which
covered 7,897 sqm. and which contained similar facilities to those of the WAH Main
Camp.

Close to the Sebha Main Camp Cengiz Libya erected and put into operation five
industrial plants which would produce the material required in the construction process:

- aconcrete batching plant,

- an asphalt plant,

- amixing plant,

- a precast plant (manholes) plant and a
- crushing and screening plant!*,

Cengiz Libya also commissioned a fleet of construction machinery for the Sebha

5. THE 2011 UPRISING IN LIBYA (FEBRUARY-OCTOBER 2011)

 

162. On February 15, 2011, inspired by revolts in other Arab countries, thousands of people
took to the streets of Benghazi, Libya’s second largest city, to hold anti-government
protests. In the following days, the protests spread to other towns and the Government,
using lethal force against demonstrators, killed dozens of protesters'*.

163. On February 18-19, 2011, demonstrations spread to the capital, Tripoli, where
protestors clashed with forces loyal to the Government. Gaddafi’s son, Saif, appeared
on television stating that his father would fight until the “last bullet”, However,
several leaders resigned and refused to represent the Libyan government’.

164. On February 21, 2011, while rebels claimed control of eastern Libya, the UN Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon held talks with Gaddafi and demanded that the conflict end
immediately!

165. The following day, February 22, 2011, Gaddafi appeared on television to refute rumors
that he had fled the country and vowed to stay in Libya, and “die as a martyr at the
end*'**, On the same day, the UN Security Council issued a statement condemning the
violence and use of force against civilians and expressing deep concern about the safety
of foreign nationals in Libya”.

166. A couple of days later, on February 25, 2011, the United States completed the
evacuation of US citizens in Libya and closed its embassy. US President Obama signed
an executive order freezing Gaddafi’s assets and the entire Libyan delegation to the
Arab League resigned"**,

Foreign intervention

167. Approximately ten days into the protests, on February 26, 2011, the UN Security
Council passed a resolution imposing sanctions against Libya, including an arms
embargo and asset freeze. It also referred Libya to the International Criminal Court

STUDI, HIB’s representative on-site and technical consultant engineer for the WAH
Project, had left the country on February 20;

Government authorities and banks remained closed;

‘There was fuel shortage and risk of food shortage; and
- A general lack of safety.

183.  Cengiz Libya added that it was delayed in the construction work, but willing to continue
works if suitable conditions were reinstated'™.

184. On the following day, Mr. Cetin, Cengiz” Project Manager, wrote an email to Cengiz’
headquarters, informing that the situation at the work sites was calm and under control,
and that operations at the WAH construction site had been resumed and would continue
while the necessary resources were available and the situation allowed.

185. On March 17, 2011, while the UN Security Council voted to impose a no-fly zone over
Libya and take “all necessary measures” to protect civilians'®’, HIB sent two letters to
Cengiz Libya, asking the contractor to resume works at the WAH'S’ and Sebha'®*
Projects, alleging that the circumstances that had caused stoppage of the works had been
solved. HIB guaranteed that they would provide all possible support for the works to be
resumed",

Sebha Project

By the end of April, Cengiz Libya sent two letters to HIB! noting that it remained
committed to executing the Sebha Contract, but that several difficulties prevented a
normal work progress, including:

Lack of bank transactions;

Blockage of materials at Musrata harbor;

Delays in project approvals;

- Money rationing and lack of oil;

Armed robbery attacks on company staff.

Cengiz Libya requested HIB to provide safety for the staff at the camps and at worksites
to be able to continue the works.

Evacuation of Sebha Main Camp

 

Such safety was not forthcoming, and on April 30, 2011, Cengiz Libya decided to also
evacuate the Sebha Main Camp, leaving only a small team behind!,

At the time of stoppage of the works, the development was similar to that of the WAH
Project, with the Main Camp, the industrial plants and the equipment operational. The
percentage of progress of the works was however higher: design works had been
completed by 70.5% and construction works by 12%!°7.

Attacks on the Main Camps

On August 23, 2011, a group of armed individuals of the Tarik Bin Ziyad Battalion,
under the command of Battalion Commander Brigadier General Adbiilselam Ismail,
violently restrained the site personnel at the WAH Main Camp and forcibly took
equipment, motors and vehicles belonging to Cengiz Libya’,

A few days later, on August 25, 2011, the Deputy Chief of the Tank Battalion of the
army, Suleyman Alwah, seized further equipment from the WAH Main Camp: three
electric motors, three water pumping motors, television, and receiver apparatus”.

On August 26, 2011, a group of citizens, supported by police vehicles and the Tank
Battalion, again entered the WAH Main Camp and stole everything at hand: small
vehicles, trucks, construction machinery, equipment and bedroom, dining hall and
administrative office equipment™.

195. On the same day, the Sebha Main Camp was taken over by armed men and the
personnel on site were physically restrained and threatened”.

196. In the next few days, the remaining Cengiz employees had to flee: +16 Turkish
employees from the Sebha Main Camp and five from the WAH Main Camp escaped
over the Algerian border”. There is evidence that Cengiz recruited some local
personnel to secure the WAH Main Camp during the absence of the Turkish employees
— but without success, since the Camp was looted and totally destroyed”.

7. CENGIZ S$ ATTEMPTS TO RESUME CONSTRUCTION (OCTOBER 2011- DECEMBER
2013)

 

197. A few months after the attacks, on October 26, 2011, members of Cengiz staff were
able to return to Libya to assess the extent of the damages and evaluate the possibility of
resuming works”, Such possibility was centered on the Sebha Project; in which the
Main Camp had suffered less loss, and represented less security risks that then WAH
Project.

198. A month after arrival, on November 20, 2011, Cengiz Libya sent HIB a letter
identifying the loss and theft suffered at the Sebha Main Camp, and expressing the hope
that the authorities could ensure protection of the Sebha sites and return the missing
machinery and equipment”.

199. A few days thereafter, on December 4, 2011, HIB reacted, requesting that Cengiz Libya
prepare a report of the damages suffered and a new working schedule and that work at
the Sebha Project be resumed. Simultaneously, HIB affirmed that the events which had
happened qualified as force majeure”.

200. In February 2012, Cengiz Libya submitted to HIB an inventory of losses suffered in
relation to both Projects”” as a consequence of the August 2011 events”’’. In March, the
inventory of losses submitted to HIB was completed with information on the monetary
value of the losses suffered in each Project”. For the WAH Project the value of the loss
suffered was calculated as LYD 44,882,068 (on assets worth LYD 61,059,447) *"° and
for the Sebha Project at LYD 36,368,234 (on assets worth LYD 69,214,742)""!

201. The losses suffered in the WAH Project were confirmed by Studi, HIB’s on-site
representative, who in a report issued in May 2012 confirmed that all mobile and
stationary construction machines had been stolen and the Main Camp had been
destroyed and looted. Studi concluded “we can confirm the contents of the damage
report issued by the company”, Studi also averred that works could only be resumed
if the following requirements were met:

- after the signature of the Protocols HIB had followed the financial procedures to pay
Cengiz the outstanding amounts, but payment was delayed due to Cengiz’s failure to
extend the contractual guarantees; and

- requested that Cengiz assign a manager to the WAH Project, instead of having a
shared management for both Projects.

SECURITY SITUATION IN SEBHA (MARCH 2012- DECEMBER 2014)

While these negotiations were developing, the security situation throughout Libya was
deteriorating. In the South — near the Projects — the situation was also fraught. On
March 27, 2012, militia clashes — which had been ongoing for some days — reached the
centre of Sebha™”, with an aftermath of at least 50 people killed.

In the following months two militias associated to the Government were deployed in
Sebha 4, in order to improve security in the area:

The Supreme Security Committee [“SSC”], a security institution established by
decree of the Ministry of Interior™*; and

The “Libya Shield Force”, established by resolution of the NTC, a militia which
reported to the Libyan army and was composed of revolutionaries who had
participated in the uprising”.

In autumn 2012, there were clashes between the SSC deployed in Sebha and pro-
Gaddafi remnants operating out of Birak (70 km north of Sebha)”® and by the end of
the year 2012, the Libyan Government had to place the administration of the South in
the hands of the Army””.

Clashes continued in Sebha in 2013. In particular, in October 2013, an attack against the
air base or Birak (north of Sebha) by a group of pro-Gaddafi fighters was confronted
and defeated by the southern division of the Libya Shield Force”.

In May 2012, Cengiz Libya had signed an agreement with a certain Muhammet Omer
Zeydan Ali, representing a so-called “Security Group”, which (against payment)
undertook to establish three teams with four individuals each, to guard the Sebha Main
Camp’. The agreement, which was endorsed by HIB, was extended till the end of
2013.

Main Camp raided
The incorporation of this private security detachment proved insufficient: On November
230

5, 2013, the Sebha campsite was raided by an armed mob™”, As a result two camp
guards were injured, an attacker was killed and five excavators were taken from the

camp™*. A few days later, Cengiz informed HIB of the incident and requested to put the
campsite under HIB’s protection and responsibility until works could be resumed”,

And then, on December 20, 2013, four road rollers were stolen from the camp site”.

The result was that on January 1, 2014, Cengiz Libya reiterated its request that HIB take
control of the security of the Sebha Main Camp™*.

In January the situation became even worse: at the end of January Cengiz Libya wrote
to HIB, stating that

“as you are informed, severe conflicts have been going on since January 8,
2014, and security risks have become highly critical in the district”,

Libya Shield takes control of Sebha Main Camp,

To improve the situation, in February 2014 the Government sent the 3" Force of the
Libya Shield (a group of militias offically affiliated with the state security apparatus as
provided for in Resolution Num. 47/2012236, under the command of the Ministry of
Defence), and composed of Misrati soldiers, to Sebha, with the task of ensuring
protection and safety”””. At the end of 2013, the Government had reversed its earlier
decision to disband the Libyan Shield, and had provided additional funding to this
unit”.

Three heavily armed groups belonging to these militia took over the Sebha Main Camp
in March”. Cengiz employees secretly took photos of these armed groups, and
Claimant's expert Mr. Legrand, has been able to confirm that these troops belonged to
the 3" Force of the Libyan Shield™°.

The Libyan Civil War erupts

By mid-2014, the situation escalated, and was labelled as the “Libyan Civil War’;
violence became wide-spread, with rival militias fighting each other"*". Eventually three
separate Governments coexisted: in Tobruk under Gen. Haftar, the General National
Congress of Mr. Abusahmain and the National Salvation Government. In December
2015, a Government of National Accord was finally set up under UN guidance, with

Fayaz Al-Sarraj as Prime Minister“.

There is little information in the file regarding the fate of the Sebha Main Camp once
the Civil War started’, What seems to have happened is that Cengiz repatriated the
totality of its personnel at Sebha, and that the Sebha Main Camp remained in the hands
of Libyan security forces and was eventually dismantled.

There is also no information in the file regarding the WAH Main Camp. This
installation had been completely destroyed and plundered, and Cengiz Libya made no
effort to restart the WAH Project, which had to be constructed in a remote area and over
12 separated construction sites.

What is undisputed is that Libya did not make any payments under the Protocols, that
Cengiz Libya did not resume work on any of the Projects, and that the WAH and Sebha
Main Camps are either totally destroyed and looted or outside the control of Cengiz
Libya™,

VI. niRIsfifCTTONAL AND ADIYTISSIRILITY ORsECTTONS

In its Statement of claim, Claimant sought to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione materiae, ratione personae and ratione temporis™*. Respondent contested the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae and ratione personae and submitted that, in any
case, the claims are inadmissible.

According to Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction because:

Claimant has not proven that it made an investment under Article 1(2) of the BIT
(VLLD;

Libya did not have sole jurisdiction over its territory when the BIT entered into force
(VL1.2);

Claimant is not an investor under the Treaty (VI.1.3);

The alleged investment was not made in accordance with Libyan law (VI.1.4).
Respondent further submits that the claims are inadmissible because:
= Claimant’s claim is estopped (VI.2.1); and

- Claimant did not respect the 90-day cool of period provided in Article 8(2) of the
Treaty (VI.2.2).

In the following section the Tribunal will summarize the Parties’ positions before
adjudicating each of the objections raised by Respondent.

VI.1. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS

FIRST OBJECTION: CLAIMANTS INVES:
IBYA BIT

 

IS NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE

 

 

RESPONDENT S POSITION

Respondent submits that Claimant has failed to prove that it held an investment under
the scope of Article 1(2) of the Treaty, which reads as follows:

“2. The term “investment”, in conformity with the hosting Contracting
Party’s laws and regulations, shall include every kind of asset in particular,
but not exclusively:

(a) shares, stocks or any other form of participation in companies,

(b) returns reinvested, claims to money or any other rights having financial
value related to an investment,

(c) movable and immovable property. as well as any other rights as mortgages,
liens, pledges and any other similar rights related to investments as defined in
conformity with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose
territory the property is situated [...]”

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

Respondent makes two main arguments to support this jurisdictional objection:

First, Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to establish that it made an investment
under Article 1(2) of the BIT because:

Claimant has not proven the value paid for the shares in Cengiz Libya™*,

  

- Claimant admits that there was no resolution to distribute dividends and that Cengiz
Libya did not operate long enough to distribute dividends”"”; and

- Claimant has not proven that it owned the equipment in the Projects, because it
purportedly sold the equipment to Cengiz Libya“.

Alternatively”, Respondent denies that Claimant has established the criteria developed
by ICSID case law”:

 

Any contril n made by Claimant by subscribing the shares of Cengiz Libya was
minimal and it is not accepted that Claimant had title to the material used for the
Projects”*';

 

The duration of the projects was also minimal, since the works started at the WAH
Project only a little over a year before the uprising, and even later at the Sebha
3)

Project”;
- Respondent denies that Cengiz or Cengiz Libya took any risk since the later was
required to take out insurance policies and it received large advance payments

designed to minimize or eliminate such risk?*;

However, Respondent does not contest that the Projects contributed to the economic
development of Libya”,

CLAIMANT S$ POSITION

Claimant submits that the Tribunal’s ratione materiae jurisdiction is derived from
Article 1(2) of the BIT. Claimant makes two main arguments:

First, that its investment in Libya is composed of:

 

99255

~ “shares, stocks or any other form of participation in companies", because Claimant
held 65% of Cengiz Libya’s shares” when the proceeding was instituted’>’;

- “claims to money or any other rights having financial value”***, because Claimant
was entitled to 100% of Cengiz Libya’s dividends”; and

99260

“movable [...] property”, since Claimant held all the equipment in the Projects
directly or through Cengiz LibyaZb'.

Alternatively, Claimant submits that its investment fulfils the criteria developed under

ICSID case law, although such criteria ought not be established in the present
arbitration”:

- There is no threshold value for a contribution to qualify as an investment under the

ICSID Convention”;

Cengiz has had an investment in Libya for several years, because Cengiz’ investment
materialized with the incorporation of Cengiz Libya in 2008264; the Contracts were
signed in December 2008 (WAH) and November 2009 (Sebha) with a duration of 44
and 30 months, respectively”; finally, Cengiz’s advances to Cengiz Libya were
made soon after the Contracts were signed and Cengiz has remained a shareholder to
this day”; thus, the ICSID duration criteria is met.

- Not all risks were covered by insurance or advance payments”*’; in fact, Claimant
faced several risks, some linked to the nature of the Project — a long-term
construction contract subject to the whims of the market — and others linked to the
structure of the Contracts",

TRIBUNAL S DECISION

Article 1(2) of the Treaty contains the following definition of “investment”:
“2. The term “investment”, in conformity with the hosting Contracting Party’s
laws and regulations, shall include every kind of asset in particular, but not
exclusively:

(a) shares, stocks or any other form of participation in companies,

(b) returns reinvested, claims to money or any other rights having financial
value related to an investment,

(c) movable and immovable property. as well as any other rights as mortgages,
liens, pledges and any other similar rights related to investments as defined in

234. In accordance with Article 1(2) of the BIT “shares” or “any other form of participation

in companies”, “claims to money” and “movable and immovable property” all qualify
as protected investments.

235. Claimant alleges that when this proceeding commenced — the critical date to assess an
investment, in its view — it was the owner of 65% of Cengiz Libya’s shares?”,
Claimant further avers that it holds claims to money because it is entitled to Cengiz
Libya's dividends”, and that it holds movable property in Libya since it owned all the

equipment in the Projects directly or through Cengiz Libya’,

236. Respondent submits that Claimant has failed to provide evidence supporting these
averments.

237. As shown below, upon review of the available evidence, the Tribunal comes to the
conclusion that Cengiz has proven that it owned an investment under the BIT.

Cengiz* investment in Libya

238. Claimant alleges that when it initiated this proceeding”” it directly owned a 65% stake
in Cengiz Libya”™, as well as a right to 100% of its dividends””,

239.  Cengiz has explained that on June 3, 2008, Cengiz, together with ICDI, incorporated
Cengiz Libya in accordance with Libyan laws as a Libyan joint-stock company owned
by Cengiz with a 49% capital share, and by ICDI with a 51% share”. The company
was registered in the Libyan General Commercial Registry on June 10, 2008, and, a day
later, in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Tripoli?”.

240.  Cengiz’ account is supported by the following documents?”:

- Cengiz Libya’s original memorandum of association,

Cengiz Libya’s minutes of the first shareholder's meeting,

Cengiz Libya’s articles of association,

- The registration certificate of the General Commercial Registry and the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry of Tripoli, as well as the payment receipts for the
registration fees.

241. On December 25, 2008, Cengiz and ICDI agreed as follows: Cengiz would hold 65% of
the shares and ICDI would hold 35%°”. Thus, Cengiz became a majority shareholder.
This is proven by the following documents”*”:

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

- Minutes of the extraordinary general meeting of Cengiz Libya of December 25,
2008;

Amendment to the Memorandum of Association dated January 4, 2009;

Transfer of shares certificate of January 5, 2009;

Amended Articles of Association of April 1, 2009.

Furthermore, on that same date, December 25, 2008, Cengiz and ICDI entered into a
shareholders agreement whereby ICDI was awarded 2% of the net contract price of the
WAH Project, together with the right to additional payments for assistance and services
provided, in exchange for waiving its rights to any dividends”.

 

Thus, as of December 25, 2008, ICDFs 35% shareholding in Cengiz Libya is purely
nominal and it is a passive partner, without any participation or liability in the
construction projects. Consequently, in economic terms Cengiz is entitled to 100% of
the revenue stream and of the net worth arising from Cengiz Libya — subject only to the
payment of a 2% fee on the net contract price of the WAH Project payable to its Libyan
partner, ICDI.

Turkey and Libya have defined investments in Article 1(2) of the BIT in an extremely
broad manner as “every kind of asset”, and then have agreed upon a non-exhaustive list,
which includes five categories of examples, one of which are shares or participations in
companies.

The asset held by Cengiz consists in a 100% “effective” shareholding in a Libyan
company, which at the relevant time carried out an entrepreneurial activity in Libya: the
design and construction of infrastructure of an area exceeding 3,000 hectares in the
WAH and Sebha South regions.

Cengiz made a direct investment in Libya, created a local enterprise under its direct
control, and produced services for the Libyan market. Incorporation of a local enterprise
by the foreign investor is the most efficient tool for furthering economic development in
the host State. The foreign investor brings in funds, assets and know-how, creates an
enterprise which employs a workforce, pays taxes, offers goods and services — all
activities which create wealth. Whatever definition of investment is applied, there can
be no doubt that foreign direct investment, where the foreign investor directly owns and
manages an enterprise situated in the host country, qualifies as such”.

Salini Criteria

Alternatively, the Parties have referred to a frequently used list of characteristic features
of investment, the so-called | Salini Criteria (contribution/ duration/ risk/ economic
development of the host state)".

In the present case, where the investor holds a tangible investment in an enterprise,
which carried out business activity in the host country, an investment exists under
Article | of the BIT. The Salini Criteria are inapposite and the question of whether such
Criteria are met does not need to be addressed.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ
Kee

The Tribunal concludes that Claimant has convincingly proven that it was a 65%
majority shareholder (entitled to 100% of the revenue stream and of the net worth) of a
Libyan company called Cengiz Libya. This qualifies as an investment for the purposes
of Article 1(2) of the BIT.

SECOND OBJECTION: INVESTMENTS NOT MADE IN LIBYAN TERRITORY
RESPONDENT S POSITION

Libya contends that the BIT applies only in respect of investments made in the territory
of Libya and that Claimant’s investments do not satisfy this condition’, Libya makes

two main arguments:

First Libya explains that according to Article 1(5)(b) of the Treaty the “territory” of
Libya is defined as:

 

-] all the lands which the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
has sole jurisdiction thereon, that includes the mere economic area, which
includes seabed submarine and the overlying airspace which are all subject to
practice of sovereignty rights according to international law”.

Based on such provision, Respondent avers that Claimant’s investment was not made on
“Libyan territory” because UNSC Resolution No. 1973 (2011) imposed a no-fly zone
over Libya”, depriving the State “of sole jurisdiction and the practice of sovereignty
rights’*°,

Second, Libya sustains that the no-fly zone in its case was particularly robust and
amounted to a de facto occupation led by NATO that “derogates” from territorial
sovereignty”,

 

CLAIMANT S POSITION
Claimant argues that Libya's objection must fail for two main reasons**:

First Claimant submits that under international law, a no-fly zone does not deprive the
State of its sovereignty over its territory, Conversely, it does not give the States
enforcing the no-fly zone, jurisdiction or temporary sovereignty over the territory they
fly over™,

Second, and as for the argument on de facto occupation, Claimant reiterates that the no-
fly zone imposed on Libya did not constitute an occupation under international law”.
As such, jurisdiction over its territory remained at all times with the Libyan State. The
uprising resulted in a change in regime, but the State of Libya did not at any time lose

jurisdiction over its territory.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ,

TRIBUNAL S DECISION

Article 1(5)(b) of the Treaty defines the “territory” of Libya as all the lands, mere
economic area, seabed submarine and overlying airspace subject to the sole jurisdiction
of Libya:

“L...] all the lands which the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
has sole jurisdiction thereon, that includes the mere economic area, which
includes seabed submarine and the overlying airspace which are all subject to
practice of sovereignty rights according to international law”.

Respondent contends that Claimant did not hold an investment in Libya because the no-
fly zone, imposed by the UN deprived Respondent of its sole jurisdiction over its
airspace’

The Tribunal disagrees.

The enactment and enforcement of a no-fly zone does not, under international law,
deprive the State of title to its territory”. Neither does it give the States enforcing the
measure, jurisdiction over the territory over which the no-fly zone is imposed.

In the words of Judge Crawford”**:

“Restrictions on use of territory, accepted by treaty, do not affect
territorial sovereignty as a title, even when the restriction concerns matters
of national security and preparation for defence. The same applies where
demilitarized zones have been imposed by the Security Council or even (in
the context of provisi measures) by the is Court.” [ i
added]

 

Prof. Crawford expressly cites Security Council Resolution 1973, which approved the
no fly zone in Libya:

- while “reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence,
territorial integrity and national unity of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya’”™* and

- expressly “excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan
‘tory
territory”.

Thus, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection because the
jurisdiction over the Libyan territory remained with the Libyan State at all times, even
during the enforcement of Resolution 1973.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

264, There is a final argument: Claimant’s investment consists in the ownership of shares in
Cengiz Libya, a Libyan company. The imposition of the no-fly zone — a physical
measure - did not affect in any way the consideration of Cengiz Libya as a Libyan
corporation, nor Claimant’s ownership of a majority shareholding in such company.

 

3. THIRD OBJECTI

 

CLAIMANT Is NOT AN INVESTOR UNDER THE TREATY

 

3.1 RESPONDENT Ss POSITION

265. Libya alleges that Claimant does not qualify as an investor, because Claimant has not
demonstrated that it was an investor under the BIT”, In particular, Respondent submits
that Article 1 of the BIT narrowly defines investors as:

“Corporations or firms incorporated or constituted under the law in force of
either of the Contracting Parties and having their headquarters in the territory
of that Contracting Party; who have made an investment in the territory of the
other Contracting Party”.

266. Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to prove that it was Cengiz who actually
made the investment rather than HIB or Cengiz Libya’.

3.2 CLAIMANT S POSITION

267. Claimant submits that Respondent’s objection must be dismissed for the following
reasons:

268. — First Claimant avers that Respondent misapplies the law when it ties the Treaty notion
of “investor” to the terms of the Libyan law”, Cengiz argues that the notion of
“investor” is solely defined according to the Treaty. Thus, the definition of investor
under domestic law is irrelevant to the present claim”.

269. Second, it is not disputed that Cengiz is a company incorporated in the Republic of
Turkey™.

270. Finally, Claimant has demonstrated that it made an investment, because Cengiz *”!:

  

- held shares in Cengiz Libya”””;

- held the right to the dividends generated by Cengiz Libya’;

infused cash in Cengiz Libya”; and

purchased, installed and Provided the material and equipment necessary for the
completion of the Projects”.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

In sum, Cengiz was a Turkish investor, protected under the BIT.
TRIBUNAL S DECISION

The notion of investor is defined according to the terms of Article 1(1) (b) of the Treaty
as:

“Corporations, firms or business associations incorporated or constituted
under the law in force of either of the Contracting Parties and having their
headquarters in the territory of that Contracting Party; who have made an
investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party”. [Emphasis added]

In accordance with Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT an investor in Libya would be:

- aTurkish corporation — incorporated or constituted under the law in force in Turkey-

- who has made an investment in Libya.

Respondent submits that Claimant has failed to provide evidence supporting these
facts.

The Tribunal cannot agree.
Claimant has provided sufficient evidence that it is company incorporated in Turkey,
with its principal place of business in Istanbul”*’, Respondent itself has admitted this
much*:
“Libya accepts the points made at §§232-237" which state:
“232. Article 8 of the Turkey-Libya BIT provides that, ratione personae, the
dispute must arise between a Contracting Party and an investor of another
Contracting Party for an arbitral tribunal to be able to adjudicate this dispute.
233. According to the Preamble of the BIT, “the Contracting Parties” refers to
the Republic of Turkey and the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya.

234. The Respondent is therefore a “Contracting Party” under Article 8 and
the Tribunal undoubtedly has jurisdiction against it.

235. The same is true concerning Cengiz, a national of the other Contracting
Party under the meaning of Article 8 above.

236. According to Article 1.1 of the BIT,
The term ‘investor’ means:

(a) natural persons deriving their status as nationals of either Contracting Party
according to its applicable law,

(b) corporations, firms or business associations incorporated or constituted
under the law in force of either of the Contracting Parties and having their
headquarters in the territory of that Contracting Party;

who have made an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

237. Cengiz is and has always been a company incorporated in the Republic of
Turkey, having its principal place of business in Istanbul, Turkey”.

277. Furthermore, in section 1.3 supra, the Tribunal reviewed the available evidence and
came to the conclusion that Cengiz had an investment in Libya.

278. In summary, Claimant is a Turkish corporation, with an investment in Libya and, thus,
the Tribunal must reject Respondent’s third Jurisdictional Objection (rationepersonae).

4. FOURTH OBJECTION: INVESTMENTS NOT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH LIBYAN LAW.
41 RESPONDENT S$ POSITION

279. Libya submits that Claimant’s activities in Libya do not fall under the scope of
protected investments under the BIT and therefore the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to
determine the dispute™.

280. — Libya’s objection is based on a joint reading of Articles 1, 10 and 8(4)(a) of the Treaty,
which impose an additional requirement’ for investments to be “in conformity with the
relevant legislation of both Contracting Parties on foreign capital".

281. Libya argues that in order to seek protection under the BIT, Claimant’s investment had
to be registered in accordance with Libyan Law No. 9 of 2010 regardless of whether
Claimant wanted to enjoy the tax and other benefits provided by the Law". Law No. 9
of 2010 is aimed at the promotion of national and foreign capital investment, with the
purpose of setting up investment projects, within the seope of the State’s general policy
and the objectives of economic and social development!

282. Respondent submits that neither Claimant nor the Projects were registered under wt
Lawj'", And although Respondent does not contend that Claimant acted illegally"
submits that Claimant made no investment in conformity with the Libyan laws ‘nd
regulations, and therefore the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the dispute*"®.

42 CLAIMANT S POSITION

283. Claimant argues that Respondent’s objection is untenable for the following reasons:

284, — First a host State cannot welcome investments and recognize their legality, while at the
same time it conditions protection under an investment treaty on an added layer of

authorization, which does not derive from the Treaty itself, but from other unrelated
domestic legislation’'’, Claimant alleges that arbitral case law shows that the
requirement of compliance with host State laws affects the ly of the investment,
not its existence or qualification as investment under the BIT?"

285. Second, the only reference in the BIT to a permission can be found in Article 8(4) of the
i:

“4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article;

 

(a) only the disputes arising directly out of investment activities which
have obtained necessary permission, if any, in conformity with the relevant
legislation of both Contracting Parties on foreign capital, and that effectively
started shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in case both Contracting Parties
become signatories of this Convention, or any other interactional dispute
settlement mechanism as agreed upon by the Contracting Parties...”
[Emphasis added]
286. However, Respondent does not argue that any such permission was necessary under
i i ital that Claimant used on its
. Claimant submits that there is no doubt that Cengiz’ investment was made
levally ‘and no permission was required*”’

 
 
 

 

287. Finally, Claimant alleges that Law No. 9 of 2010 applies irrespective of the nationality
of the investor because it applies to both Libyan and soreign companies and, in any
case, construction contracts are not subject to such Law™™,

43 TRIBUNAL S$ DECISION

288. — Article 1(1)(b) defines investors as corporations constituted under the law in force in
either Contracting Party:

“(b) Corporations, firms or business associations incorporated or constituted
under the law in force of either of the Contracting Parties and having their
headquarters in the territory of that Contracting Party; who have made an
investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party”. [Emphasis added]

289. Then, Article 1(2) defines investment as every kind of asset in conformity with the law
of the host State:

517 CHIL, para. 39.
318 CII, para. 40; CII, hi. 92.

“2. The term “investment”, in conformity with the hosting Contracting
Party’s laws and regulations, shall include every kind of asset ...”
[Emphasis added]

Article 10 provides the scope of application of the BIT, saying that it shall apply to
investments in the territory of a Contracting Party made in accordance with its laws and
regulations:

“The present Agreement shall apply to investments in the territory of a
Contracting Party made in accordance with its laws and regulations by
investors of the other Contracting Party before or after the entry into force of
this Agreement. However, this Agreement shall not apply to disputes that have
arisen before its entry into force”. [Emphasis added]

Finally, Article 8(4) of the BIT provides that disputes arising directly out of investment
activities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of international tribunals, provided that the
investment has received the “necessary permission”, if such permission is required:

 

“4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article;

(a) only the disputes arising directly out of investment activities which have
obtained necessary permission, if any, in conformity with the relevant
legislation of both Contracting Parties on foreign capital, and that effectively
started shall be subject to the jurisdiction of...(ICSID), ... or any other
international dispute settlement mechanism as agreed upon by the Contracting
Parties...” [Emphasis added]

Respondent contends that a joint reading of the above-mentioned Articles of the Treaty
imposes an additional requirement” for investments to be “in conformity with the
relevant legislation of both Contracting Parties on foreign capital”. In particular,
Article 8(4) imposes — according to Respondent — that investments obtain an ex ante
administrative authorization®”.

The issue before the Tribunal is not one of legality of the investment (Respondent does
not contend that the investment was illegal), but rather, whether pursuant to Article 8(4)
of the BIT, Claimant’s investment required a

“necessary permission, if any, in conformity with the relevant legislation of
both Contracting Parties on foreign capital”™”*. [Emphasis added]

Upon review of the parties’ positions, the Tribunal first establishes that under Libyan
law Claimant's investment did not require any administrative authorization (A). Having
come to this conclusion, the Tribunal will decide that Article 8(4) of the BIT is
inapposite (B).

The requirement of a permission under Libyan Law on Foreign Capital

Libya insists that in order to seek protection under the BIT, Claimant’s investment had
to be registered in accordance with Libyan Law No. 9 of 2010327.

It may be possible, in accordance with a decision from the General People’s
Committee, under a proposal from the Secretary, to offer for the investment
projects, tax privileges and exemptions for a period, not exceeding 3 years, or
other additional privileges, if those projects prove that:

(1) They contribute to the achievement of food security.

(2) Utilise measures that are capable of achieving abundance in energy or
water or contribute to environment protection.

(3) Contribute to the development of the area.

The Executive Regulation shall specify the classification of the rules and
provisions taking into account that the project is one that fulfils these
aforementioned considerations”.

Scope_of Law No. 9

The Law applies to national, foreign and joint venture capital invested in the areas
which fall within the scope of the Law*!, which is defined as “all production and
service areas”*”. In these areas administrative permission under Article 9 is required for
any investor (whether foreign or national) to carry out an investment.

Law No. 9 of 2010 is not applicable to investments in the construction sector — only to
investments in the “production and service areas”.

This interpretation was confirmed by Respondent's witness, Mr. Alzoui, who admitted
at the Hearing that construction contracts are not subject to Law No. 9 of 201

“because they are ruled by other administrative regulations and other terms of
reference that are not within the scope of the investment law”.

Thus, the set-up, development or operation of Claimant’s projects did not require any
permission under Law No. 9 of 2010, the Libyan Law on Investment Promotion.

Other arguments.
There is an additional argument which disproves the argument that Claimant’s

investment failed to receive all authorizations required by Libyan law. Cengiz” partner
in the joint venture was ICDI, a State-owned entity, and the counter-party in the

331 Article 2 of Law No. 9 of 2010: “This law applies to national, foreign, or joint venture capital jointly
invested in the areas targeted by this Law”.

5% Article 8 of Law No. 9 of 2010: “Areas of Investment shall be in all production and service areas, The
Executive Regulation shall determine the areas of production and services, which are not covered by this

Law...”

construction Contracts was HIB, a Government agency. There is no evidence that at any
stage of this legal a breach of Libyan (administrative or other) law occurred or
istrative authorization was not obtained.

  
 

Finally, there is also a temporal argument, Law No. 9 of 2010 was approved on January
28, 2010. Claimant’s was materialized in 2008335, well before the Law was enacted —
and Respondent is not claiming that the Law had retroactive effects with regard to
existing investments.

 
  

 

Thus, Respondent has failed to prove that Libyan Law requires that Claimant obtain any
administrative permission or authorization in order to make its investment in 2008.

 

The wording of Article 8(4) of the Treaty

Article 8 of the BIT regulates dispute settlement between an investor and a contracting
party in relation to an investment. And Article 8(4) defines the disputes which a
protected investor can submit to international arbitration:

“4, Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article;

(a) only the disputes arising directly out of investment activities which have
obtained necessary permission, if any, in conformity with the relevant
legislation of both Contracting Parties on foreign capital, and that effectively
started shall be subject to the jurisdiction of...(ICSID), ... or any other
international dispute settlement mechanism as agreed upon by the Contracting
Parties...” [Emphasis added]

 

 

Article 8(4) of the BIT requires that investment obtain necessary permissions if (and
only if) such permission is required “in conformity with the relevant legislation” of
either of the Contracting States. Contrary to Respondent’s contention, a plain reading of
Article 8(4) of the Treaty makes it clear that the Treaty does not establish a re; ation
or approval requirement for investments to access the jurisdiction of international
tribunals. The use of the words “if any” leaves no doubt that Article 8(4) only becomes
applicable, if municipal law either of Turkey or of Libya creates a requirement that
foreign investments obtain a specific permission or authorization.

 

  

The Tribunal has already found that, contrary to Respondent’s submission, Claimant’s
investment in Libya does not fall within the scope of Law No. 9 of 2010. Respondent
has not argued that Claimant’s investment required any authorization under any other
Libyan law. Consequently, Article 8(4) is inapposite.

wee
In summary, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s fourth Jurisdictional Objection, because

Respondent has failed to prove that Claimant’s investments were not made in
conformity with Libyan Law.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

VL2. ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTIONS
FIRST OBJECTION: ESTOPPEL
RESPONDENT S$ POSITION
Respondent submits that Claimant is estopped from arguing that Libya is liable for the

matters under the terms of the Protocols. Respondent makes two supporting
arguments**:

First that the preamble of the Protocols, by which Cengiz Libya represented that it
considered that the “circumstances in the country were of a general nature,
unexpected and outside the intention of the Parties”, prevents Cengiz from alleging
that Libya is at fault;

- Second, and alternatively, that the Protocols settled any previous dispute.

 

CLAIMANT Ss POSITION.

Claimant submits that the evidence does not support Respondent’s objection*”” and
remarks the following’:

First events underlying Claimant’s claims do pertain, in part, to the events of 2011
but also, in significant part, to Libya’s acts and omissions after 2011. There is no
basis in law, therefore, for Libya to argue that by virtue of the 2013 Protocols,
Cengiz somehow renounced its rights to bring claims that had not even arisen at the
time.

Second, the reason the 2013 Protocols were not implemented was that HIB did not
fulfil its obligations towards Cengiz Libya*”.

- Third, the fact that the 2013 Protocols acknowledged that the “circumstances in the
country were of a general nature, unexpected and outside the intention of the parties”
may well have had an effect on the parties’ rights and obligations under the

Contracts, However, this does not in any manner, exonerate the Libyan State of its
obligations towards a Turkish investor, Cengiz, under the BIT.

 

 

Claimant further alleges that the Parties’ conduct does not fall within the parameters of
340
estoppel™”.

Finally, Claimant avers that the 2013 Protocols did not — and were not intended to —
conclude or preclude negotiations, which were delayed in the interest of restarting
works as soon as possible™.

- resume the Contracts and carry on the performance of the works**; and

- extend all bank guarantees and bonds required by the Contracts within one month
from the signature of the Protocol.

At the same time, HIB agreed to:
- enable Cengiz to work on the sites“; and

- pay Cengiz 50% of the approved and pay: ble notices for contract works, to allow it
- to prepare and pay outstanding obligations™®.

 

 

Respondent alleges that when Claimant signed the Protocols it recognized that the
events of 2011 were “of a general nature, unexpected and outside the intentions of the
parties”, and thus is prevented from arguing that Libya is liable for breaches under the
BIT. Alternatively, Libya submits that the Protocols settled any previous dispute.
Discussion

The Tribunal does not agree.

In the Preamble to the Protocols Cengiz Libya declares that construction was halted
“because of events that coincided with the Glorious Revolution of 17 February 2011”
and adds “that the circumstances in the country were of a general nature, unexpected

and outside the intention of the parties”

Respondent says that this statement made by Cengiz Libya in the preamble of the
Protocols

- settles any previous dispute and

- prevents Claimant from alleging that Libya is at fault.

Respondent’s position is a clear non sequitur.

Cengiz Libya simply stated that the Libyan Revolution was an event

- of a general nature,

- unexpected, and

- outside the intention of HIB and Cengiz Libya.

Respondent says that this statement amounts to a settlement of a previous dispute.

It is difficult to follow Respondent’s line of argument. The literal wording of the
statement does not leave room for doubt: Cengiz Libya is not settling any previous

dispute, either between itself and HIB, nor between its parent Cengiz and the Libyan
State.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

Respondent submits a second argument: this statement prevents Claimant from alleging
that Libya is at fault.

The argument is without any merit.

The first requirement for estoppel is a clear and unambiguous statement by the person
estopped”"’,

Claimant has not made any statement at all — the Protocol was signed by Cengiz Libya.
But even if it is accepted that the statement by Cengiz Libya binds Claimant, the text of
the preamble does not include any promise to refrain from claiming against Libya in an
investment arbitration procedure, for breaches under the BIT.

In. sum, the Tribunal finds that Respondent’s argument is totally without merit, and that
Claimant is not estopped from bringing the present claims against Respondent.
Respondent's first admissibility objection is dismissed.

SECOND OBJECTION: COOLING -OFF PERIOD
RESPONDENT S POSITION

Respondent submits that Claimant did not engage in amicable negotiations for 90 days
as prescribed by Article 8(2) Treaty and thereby failed to respect the cooling-off period.
Respondent makes two supporting arguments:

First Respondent argues that while it endeavoured to engage in negotiations by
answering Claimant’s dispute notification letter within the 90-day period, Claimant
disregarded Respondent's offer to meet until after the RfA had been filed“.

Second, Respondent explains that in its letter dated December 18, 2015, Claimant
insisted on various preconditions in order to meet Respondent’s representatives™”,
which Libya submits is hardly in accordance with Article 8(1) of the BIT’.

CLAIMANT S$ POSITION

Claimant submits that Respondent has failed to put forth any evidence to support its
allegation and ignores that Claimant attempted to secure an amicable settlement®'.
Claimant’s main arguments are as follows:

First, Claimant filed its RfA more than 100 days after notifying the dispute to

Respondent. HIB’s letter of October 26, 2015, did not interrupt the interim cooling-off
352

period®”,

Second, any good faith attempt by Libya to negotiate is dubious in light of its letter of
December 2, 2015, by which the State required Cengiz to complete the works “within

the shortest time”***.

Third, Claimant continued to make efforts to negotiate after the cooling off period.
Claimant alleges that the offers to negotiate sent to Respondent in December 2015 and
March 2016 were fruitless *

TRIBUNAL S DECISION

Respondent alleges that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimant failed to fulfil
the 90-day cooling-off requirement of Article 8 of the BIT. In particular, Libya alleges
that Cengiz failed to negotiate in Spo faith by disregarding for almost two months an
offer to meet before filing its RfA®

The notice provision can be found in Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT, which provides in
the pertinent part*™

“|. Disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the
other Contracting Party, in connection with his investment, shall be notified
in writing, including detailed information, by the investor to the recipient
Contracting Party of the investment. As far as possible, the investor and the
concerned Contracting Party shall endeavor to settle these disputes by
consultations and negotiations in good faith.

2. If these disputes, cannot be settled in this way within ninety (90) days
following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the
dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to the competent court
of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made or to
international arbitration[...]”*[Emphasis added]

On its face, Article 8(1) of the BIT establishes a formal notice requirement: in writing
and including detailed information of the investment. It further requires that, as far as
possible, the investor and the host country try to settle the dispute by consultations and
negotiations in good faith. Hence, Cengiz had to expressly notify Libya of an
investment dispute under Article 8 of the BIT and try to engage in consultations and
negotiations in good faith.

However, if the dispute cannot be settled by consultations and negotiations in good faith
within ninety (90) days following the date of the written notification made by the
investor, it may initiate arbitration proceedings.

Claimant has strictly followed the requirements of Article 8(1) and (2) of the BIT:
- On August 20, 2015, Claimant sent Respondent a notification letter referring to
Article 8(1) of the Treaty, detailing its investment and the dispute, and offering to

conduct negotiations®

- Respondent answered Claimant’s notice on October 26, 2015, that is, 67 days
following the date of Claimant’s written notification. In its letter, Respondent

informed Cengiz that they were ready to hold a meeting in Tripoli to find a
satisfactory solution for both Parties**;

- Claimant filed its RfA on December 18, 2015, more than 100 days following the
notification letter;

- On the same day, December 18, 2015, Claimant answered Respondent’s October
letter, expressing its willingness to meet with representatives of the State of Libya to
discuss a settlement under certain terms.

The fact that Claimant did not immediately respond to Libya’s invitation to hold a
meeting in Tripoli®? cannot be interpreted as a refusal to engage in good faith
negotiations, especially when it took Respondent more than 65 days (out of the 90
established in the BIT) to answer Claimant’s notice. Claimant filed its RFA 100 days
after giving notice to Libya.

Furthermore, Claimant’s interest in engaging in good faith negotiations was maintained
after it filed its RfA. Indeed, the same day it filed its RfA, Claimant responded to the
Public Projects Agency’s letters expressing its willingness to meet with representatives
of the State of Libya to dis settlement™.

 
 

 

In summary, given that no agreement was reached between the Parties during the 90-
day period, Cengiz was entitled to exercise its right to commence arbitration
proceedings under Article 8 of the BIT.

VII. MERITS

Claimant argues that Libya is in breach of three substantive obligations assumed under
the Treaty:

- The full protection (and security) standard (FPS);

- Compensation for losses in case of war, insurrection, civil disturbance or other
similar events (War Clause); and

The fair and equitable treatment standard (FET).

Respondent submits that such claims have no merit, because Claimant has failed to
establish any breach of the Treaty or the causation of any damage*.

In the following section the Tribunal will address each claim. In each of them it will
briefly summarize the Parties’ positions and then it will render its decision. But before
doing so, it is necessary that the Tribunal devote some thought to the issue of applicable
law (VILL) and to the interplay between Article 2 and Article 5 of the BIT (VII.2).

In its relief sought Claimant alleged that Libya breached Articles 2.2, 3.3, 4 and 5 of the
BIT. The Claimant, however, never elaborated on the alleged breach of Art. 4
(expropriation), nor did Libya address it in its defense. The Tribunal concludes that a
claim regarding a potential breach of Art. 4 has been abandoned and need not be
addressed.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

VII.1.APPLICABLE LAW

347. These proceedings are governed by the ICC Rules. And Article 21 of such Rules
provides the following guidance as regards applicable law:

“Article 21 - Applicable Rules of Law

1. The parties shall be free to agree upon the rules of law to be applied by the
arbitral tribunal to the merits of the dispute. In the absence of any such
agreement, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules of law which it
determines to be appropriate.

2. The arbitral tribunal shall take account of the provisions of the contract, if
any, between the parties and of any relevant trade usages.

3. The arbitral tribunal shall assume the powers of an amiable compositeur or
decide ex aequo et bono only if the parties have agreed to give it such
powers”,

348. The dispute arises under the Turkey-Libya BIT, an international treaty signed between
two sovereign countries, which is silent on the issue of applicable law. Both parties
have analyzed the issue and have agreed that the dispute should be adjudicated in
accordance with the provisions of the BIT, as supplemented by international law*.
This agreement, with which the Tribunal concurs, reinforces the purpose of investment
treaty protection: to grant foreign investors protection grounded on international law
and enforced through international arbitration”.

349. The application of the BIT supplemented by international law does not imply that the
domestic law of Libya is irrelevant for the Tribunal’s adjudication. As Respondent
correctly states, Libyan law is relevant for gauging whether the investment was made in
conformity with domestic law; furthermore, the Contracts entered into between Cengiz
Libya and HIB are subject to Libyan law, and Cengiz Libya, a corporation
incorporated in Libya, is also subject to Libyan corporate law™’.

VII.2.THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARTICLES 2 AND S OF THE BIT

Article 2(2), Article 3(1),(2) and (3) and Article 5 of the BIT read as follows:
Article 2 Promotion and Protection of Investments
[-.]

2. Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection in the
territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any
way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, or disposal of such investments.

Article 3 Treatment of Investments

1. Each Contracting Party shall admit in its territory investments, and
activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favourable than that accorded
in similar situations to investments of investors of any third country, within
the framework of its laws and regulations.

2. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns
of investors of other Contracting Party to treatment less favorable than that
which it accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to
investments or returns of investors of any third State, whichever is the most
favorable.

3. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investors of the other
Contracting Party, as regards management, use, enjoyment or disposal of their
investments to treatment less favorable than that which it accords to its own
investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is the most favorable.

[..]
Article 5 Compensation for Losses

Investors of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the
territory of the other Contracting State owing to war, insurrection, civil
disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded by such Contracting
Party treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investors of any third
country, whichever is the most favourable treatment, as regards any measures
it adopts in relation to such losses.

The Parties’ positions,

Respondent says that Claimant is precluded from invoking Article 2 in respect of losses
allegedly caused by war, insurrection or other similar events. If it were otherwise,
Article 5 would be unnecessary. Article 5 contains specific rules governing the
particular case of investment losses sustained in war or similar events and prevails over
the general condition in Article 2. This conclusion is reinforced by the general rule that

71

 

352.

354.

355.

ICC Case 21537/ZFIAYZ

a state is not liable for losses sustained by a foreigner due to war, armed conflict,
insurrection or other civil disturbances.

Claimant disagrees. In its opinion, the obligation under Article 5 is self-standing and
does not displace Libya’s obligations towards Cengiz under Article 2 of the BIT.
Claimant says that the /ex specialis principle cannot apply to provisions that differ in
scope and cannot result in an exemption of liability. Article 5 establishes the floor
treatment that must be afforded to an investor for losses suffered during a period of war
or civil strife”.

Tribunal’s decision
The Tribunal agrees with Claimant.

Article 2(2), Article 3(2) and (3) an Article 5 must be read cumulatively, for they are
different in scope and consequently the application of the /ex specialis principle
(generalia specialibus non derogant) is not warranted.

The principle goes back to a well-known opinion developed by Grotius in his “De iure
belli et pacis”*™.

“Among agreements which are equal in respect to the qualities mentioned, that
should be given preference which is most specific and approaches most nearly
to the subject in hand; for special provisions are ordinarily more effective than
those that are general.”

The principle starts from the logical assumption that if the parties to a treaty inserted a
specific provision to govern a certain subject matter, then they intended to settle the
question definitively in this way, without taking into consideration provisions of a wider
or more general character. The central element of the principle is that the two
conflicting rules — the special and the general one — must relate to the same subject
matter. This is confirmed in the definition of the principle provided by a Study Group of
the International Law Commission:

“Tt suggests that whenever two or more norms deal with the same subject
matter, priority should be given to the norm that is more specific”

In the Tribunal’s opinion, in the present case, the conflicting provisions deal with
different subject matters:

- Article 2(2) sets out the standard of FPS, the host State’s obligation to provide
protected investments with full protection in its territory;

Articles 3(2) and (3) require that the home State accords to protected investments,
returns and investors national treatment and most-favoured-nation [“MFN”]
treatment as regards management, use, enjoyment or disposal;

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

- Article 5 extends the national and MEN treatment to losses suffered due to war,
insurrection or civil disturbances, as regards any measures adopted by the host State
in relation to such losses.

Consequently, the /ex specialis principle should find no application. Articles 3(2) and
3(3) do not derogate Article 2(2), because their subject matter is distinct — the
provisions must be read cumulatively. The same principle applies in the relationship
between Article 5 and Article 2(2). Article 5 does not cover the same subject matter as
Article 2(2), and both provisions create independent obligations for the host State.

Respondent's counter-argument

Respondent submits a second argument: it says that if Claimant’s construction was
correct, namely that Libya guaranteed FPS in the event of war, then Article 5 would be
unnecessary”,

The Tribunal remains unconvinced.

The FPS standard only provides limited protection to a foreign investor; the protection
is only triggered if the host State directly causes harm to the investment or fails to meet
a standard of due diligence. The State may provide an increased level of protection to its
own investors, or to investors of a third country; in such case Article 5 comes into
operation, and such heightened standard must also be applied to Turkish (or Libyan)
investors.

Scholarly opinion_and case law

The Tribunal's opinion is supported by scholarly opinion and by the predominant
arbitration case law.

  

Schrijer/Prislan have interpreted the war clause in the Dutch Model Treaty, which is in
all material aspects analogous to Article 5 of the BIT, and have concluded that it is

“obvious that the provision is not intended to derogate from other treaty rights
and shall not be interpreted as a general exception clause”*”!,

The same opinion is defended by Newcombe/Paradell>”:
“This type of provision, therefore, does not create a ground for exemption
from liability; rather, it ensures that when liability does not arise for another
reason (for example, due to a successful plea of military necessity) the
measures still give rise to a duty to compensate losses if compensation is
provided to nationals or other foreign investors”.

In previous decisions, arbitral tribunals have predominantly defended the same
interpretation.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

366. In CMS the Tribunal considered a war clause with a drafting very similar to Art. 5 of the
BIT, and came to the following conclusion*”:

“The plain meaning of the Article is to provide a floor treatment for the
investor in the context of the measures adopted in respect of the losses
suffered in the emergency, not different from that applied to nationals or other
foreign investors. The Article does not derogate from the Treaty rights but
rather ensures that any measures directed at offsetting or minimizing losses
will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner”.

367. The tribunal in Suez, confronted with the same line of defense adopted in this procedure
by Respondent, decided

“270. The Tribunal cannot agree with Argentina’s interpretation of the above-
quoted BIT provisions. The clear meaning of those provisions is to impose on
Contracting Parties an obligation of equality of treatment of investments for
losses resulting from war, civil disturbance, and national emergencies. The
provision contains no reference whatsoever to other obligations imposed by
the BITs on Contracting Parties, let alone to provide for an exemption from
such obligations. Had the Contracting Parties, after carefully negotiating a
complex set of legal obligations to protect and promote investments, intended
that such obligations would not apply in times of war, civil disturbance, or
national emergency, they certainly would have so stated specifically. Indeed,
in many other BITs, contracting parties have included exception provisions to
provide for limited exemptions from BIT obligations in particular situations.
The Contracting Parties of the BITs in question in these cases could also have
done so if they had wished, but they did not.

271. The Tribunal considers that the above-quoted BIT provisions mean what
they say: they impose on Argentina an obligation of equality of treatment with
respect to investment losses sustained as a result of war, civil disturbance, and
national emergency. They do not exempt Argentina from its other treaty
obligations under the BITs. The Tribunal therefore rejects Argentina’s
interpretation of the applicable BIT provisions and its claimed defense to its
liability for violating such other provisions”.

Summing up, the Tribunal concludes that Article 5 of the BIT does not cover the same
subject matter as Article 2(2), and that both provisions are independent, and create
separate obligations for the host State: under Article 2(2) the State is obliged to provide

accords measures to protect its own investors or investors of a third party to compensate
losses from war or civil disturbances, such treatment must be extended to the investor
protected by the BIT.

VII.3.FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY

CLAIMANT S$ POSITION

 

Claimant alleges that under Article 2(2) of the BIT, Respondent undertook to provide

full protection to the investments of Turkish investors in its territory"”’. This obligation

is two-fold entailing”:
- anegative obligation to refrain from harming the investments and

- a positive obligation to exercise due diligence or take necessary measures of
vigilance to prevent damage.

Claimant submits that Respondent violated both**”:

First as regards the positive obligation, entities whose acts were attributable to the
State (such as the Libyan army) directly interfered with the investment, looting the
campsite, threatening Claimant’s personnel and attacking the premises since 2011**';
and,

- Second, as regards the negative obligation, the State failed to protect the campsites
during the 2011-2014 period, despite the fact that it could reasonably have done so

and that it did, in fact, offer reasonable protection to other foreign investors”.

RESPONDENT $ POSITION

 

Respondent’s main submission is that Article 2 of the BIT is not applicable to the
dispute, because Article 5 holds a specific provision for war and civil unrest and solely
imposes a duty not to discriminate in terms of measures adopted regarding losses**.
However, subsidiarily, if Article 2 is applicable, Respondent submits the following™:

First as regards Claimant’s contention that Libya directly attacked the camps,
Respondent avers that the allegation is not supported by evidence and thus is meritless.
Respondent makes two supporting arguments”:

Acts attributable to the State cannot be examined from the angle of FPS.

- If FPS is applicable to acts for which the State is responsible, quod non, then
Claimant has failed to establish the following™”:

- That those armed groups in fact were related to the new government;

- That the relevant acts were not in contravention to specific orders given by the
militia or armed group; and :

That the relevant acts are “the individual acts of members of the movement, acting in
their own capacity”.

Second, as regards the alleged failure to protect, Respondent makes three arguments:

that Libya was under no duty to protect Cengiz’ investment in time of war":
alternatively, if there was a duty, it is common ground that Libya was not under an
absolute duty to protect the investment but only to take reasonable action;

Claimant’s contention that Libya could have protected the Projects is unreal given
the incapacity of the State at the relevant times and the widespread security issues”,
because”:

the projects were in a difficult area;

the distances involved were considerable;

- the works were to be carried out across large open areas;

a substantial number of workers was involved;

works were not undertaken in isolation; and

the Projects would have taken considerable time to complete.

It is likely that after the evacuation in 2011, Claimant had no intention to return to
Libya to complete the projects (and would not have been able to do so successfully

in any event)”,

TRIBUNAL 'S DECISION

 

Article 2.2 of the Treaty provides the following:

“Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection in the
territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any
way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension or disposal of such investments”.

Claimant's case is that Libya failed to provide FPS to the WAH Main Camp and to the
Sebha Main Camp, while Respondent avers that acts performed by unidentified armed
groups cannot be attributed to the State and that Libya could not have adopted any
reasonable measures to protect the Projects. The Tribunal will first establish the proven
facts (3.1), will then devote a section to the definition and scope of the FPS standard

PROVEN FACTS

Pro memoria:

The Libyan Revolution started in February 2011;

the NTC established a new government towards the end of March 2011 and the new
regime was promptly recognized by a number of significant foreign countries;

on 23 August 2011 the new government took control of Tripoli;

in September 2011 British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy traveled to Libya to pledge support to the NTC; and

in October 2011 former President Gaddafi was killed and the revolution finalized.

The NATO mission, which had started in March and had imposed a no-fly zone, was
cancelled in October 2011.

WAH Main Camp

In the aftermath of the Libyan Revolution, which erupted in February 2011, the general
security situation in Libya started to deteriorate. The Southern region, a thinly populated
territory larger than Spain with the capital in Sebha, was especially affected.

Claimant was developing two construction Projects in the Southern Region, for the
urbanization of 12 villages in the WAH area (WAH Project) and certain quarters of
Sebha (Sebha Project). These Projects involved two extensive Main Camps (with
industrial facilities) and several scattered construction sites. Progress of the work was
very dependent on an appropriate security situation. Notwithstanding the fact that after
the February 2011 events law and order started to suffer, HIB insisted that Cengiz Libya
should not suspend its activities: on March 17, 2011, HIB instructed Cengiz Libya in
writing, to continue working both on the WAH and the Sebha Projects”.

 

Notwithstanding these instructions, the situation in the remote and tribal WAH region,
more than three hours by car from the capital, Sebha, had deteriorated to such an extent,
that on that same day Cengiz Libya took the decision to evacuate the WAH Main Camp,
leaving only a small team to secure the site”.

The decision proved reasonable, because a few months thereafter, on August 23, 2011, a
group of armed soldiers from the Tarik Bin Ziyad Battalion, under the command of
Battalion Commander Brigadier General AdbUlselam Ismail, entered the WAH Main
Camp and forcibly took equipment, motors and vehicles belonging to Cengiz Libya’.

Two days later, on August 25, 2011, the Deputy Chief of the Tank Battalion of the
army, Suleyman Alwah, seized further equipment from the WAH Main Camp: three

384.  Ayhan Sozer, one of the Turkish employees at the WAH Main Camp wroté in an email
to headquarters sent on 25 August, that he had been in meetings with authorities all day,
trying to obtain protection, but

“military and police state they cannot protect the site and even they loot and
plunder the site themselves”*””,

385. On August 26, 2011, a group of citizens, supported by police vehicles and the Tank
Battalion, again entered the WAH Main Camp and stole everything at hand: small
vehicles, trucks, construction machinery, equipment and bedroom, dining hall and
administrative office equipment”*. The WAH Main Camp suffered significant damage,
which Cengiz Libya calculated as LYD 44,882,068 (on assets worth LYD 61,059,447,
ie. 74%)".

386. The last Turkish employees working at the WAH Project had to flee over the Algerian
border, and Cengiz Libya hired some local personnel to secure the remains of the WAH
Main Camp”.

387. There is no evidence that Cengiz Libya was ever able to return to it. At some
unspecified moment what remained of the WAH Main Camp was either destroyed or
looted.

B. Sebha Main Camp

388. The Sebha Main Camp was not evacuated in March, at the same time as the WAH Main
Camp, because at that time the security situation in Sebha was still under control. When
the situation started to deteriorate, Cengiz Libya requested HIB to provide safety for the
Sebha Main Camp and at the worksites", and when such safety was not forthcoming,

decided to evacuate the Sebha Main Camp, leaving only an emergency team. This

happened at the end of April 2011.

389. On August 26, 2011, the Sebha Main Camp was taken over by armed men and the
remaining personnel on site were physically restrained and threatened, and machinery
and equipment were taken away“. On that same day the last Turkish employees fled to
Algeria, together with their colleagues from the WAH Project.

390. There is evidence that Cengiz’ machinery and equipment came into the hands of the

Free Martyrs Brigade of Sebha‘”* and of some “Military Brigades” “in the service of
Free Libya”. This is proven by two letters sent by HIB to these Brigades, politely asking
that the machinery and equipment be returned to Cengiz Libya’, The Brigades seem to
have been troops loyal to the NTC government (which possibly plundered the

machinery and equipment in preparation for the Battle of Sebha, in which the NTC
forces fought and defeated pro-Gaddafi militias in September 2011).

After these incidents the Sebha Main Camp was not totally destroyed, although a
significant amount of machinery and equipment was stolen. The damage suffered by the
Sebha Projects was estimated as LYD 36,368,234 (on assets worth LYD 69,214,742, i.e.
around 50 %)",

Return in autumn 2011

By the end of October 2011 the safety situation had improved sufficiently for Cengiz
staff to return to Sebha and start reparation of the Main Camp.

But the security situation was still worrying, and in May 2012 Cengiz Libya signed an
agreement with a certain Muhammet Omer Zeydan Ali, representing a so-called
“Security Group”, which (against payment) undertook to establish three teams with four
individuals each, to guard the Sebha Main Camp“. The agreement, which was
endorsed by HIB, was successively extended till the end of 2013.

Despite the incorporation of this private security force, on November 5, 2013 the Sebha
campsite was raided by an armed mob”. As a result, two camp guards were injured, an
attacker was killed, and five excavators were taken“**, A few days later, Cengiz
informed HIB of the incident and requested that the campsite be put under HIB’s
protection and responsibility until works could be resumed™.

And then, on December 20, 2013, four road rollers were stolen from the Main Camp"”.

The result was that on January 1, 2014, Cengiz Libya reiterated its request that HIB take
control of the security situation in the Sebha Main Camp*!"

Later in January the situation became even worse, and Cengiz Libya reported “severe
conflicts” which apparently started on January 8, 2014412.

In February 2014 the NTC Government sent the 3" Force of the Libya Shield to Sebha,
with the task of improving law and order*!, But the situation at the Sebha Main Camp
deteriorated: in March three heavily armed groups belonging to this government-

controlled militia entered the Sebha Main Camp, taking control from Cengiz Libya‘!*.

By mid-2014 the Libyan Civil War erupted.
There is little information in the file regarding the fate of the Sebha Main Camp once

the Civil War started*'*, What seems to have happened is that Cengiz repatriated the
totality of its personnel at Sebha, and that the Sebha Main Camp remained under the

control of security forces reporting to the NTC government. It is undisputed that Cengiz
Libya has never regained possession or control of the remaining assets (if any)
pertaining to the Sebha Main Camp.

  

DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF THE FPS STANDARD.

Article 2(2) of the BIT provides as follows:
Promotion and Protection of Investments.
Loe]

2. Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection in the
territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any
way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, or disposal of such investments.

Article 2(2) of the BIT guarantees that qualifying investments “shall enjoy full
protection in the territory of the other Contracting Party”. The BIT uses the expression
“full security” - while the more frequent phrasing in investment treaties refers to full
protection and security (hence “FPS”). There is however no material difference between
the standard of “full protection” established by the BIT, and the FPS standard as
commonly defined in other investment treaties and in international law. As a
commentator has explained, it is frequent that treaties use analogous expressions to refer
to the same FPS standard*!®:

“Thus while the most common formulation is ‘full protection and security’, it
is possible to see ‘the most constant protection’, or simply ‘protection and
security’ and ‘full legal protection and Till legal security”.

In the most basic formulation, the purpose of the FPS standard is to protect the physical
integrity of an investment against interference by use of force”. The perpetrator of
such interference is irrelevant: it could be the State itself, (including agencies, groups,
entities or other organs whose actions can be attributed to the State), or any other third
party"'’. FPS thus entails a two-fold obligation for the host State:

- A negative obligation to refrain from directly harming the investment by acts of
violence attributable to the State, plus

- A positive obligation to prevent that third parties cause physical damage to such
investment.

The FPS standard thus combines an obligation of result and an obligation of means:

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

(i) The obligation of result requires that the State and its organs abstain from directly
causing physical harm. As Dolzer/Schreuer explain’:

“Whenever state organs themselves act in violation of the standard, or
significantly contribute to such action, no such issues of attribution or due
diligence will arise because the state will then be held directly responsible”.

(ii) The second leg of the standard requires the State to exercise reasonable care to
prevent damage caused by third parties. Reasonableness must be measured taking into
consideration the State’s means and resources and the general
country”. This obligation of vigilance does not grant an insurance against damage or a
warranty that the property shall never be occupied or disturbed — it simply requires that
the State apply reasonable means to protect foreign property".

 

LIBYA S BREACH OF THE FPS STANDARD

The Tribunal must establish whether Libya has breached either the negative obligation
(3.4.) or the positive obligation (3.5.) of the FPS standard.

BREACH OF THE NEGATIVE OBLIGATION UNDER THE FPS STANDARD

Cengiz Libya, Claimant’s subsidiary incorporated in Libya, constructed and equipped
two Main Camps (including industrial facilities), one for the WAH Project and another
for the Sebha Project, at a cost of USD 35.3 M and USD 43 M, respectively. These
Main Camps were necessary for Cengiz Libya to perform the work under two
construction contracts awarded by HIB.

There is overwhelming evidence” that the Libyan armed forces, or militia controlled
by the Libyan government, pillaged both Main Camps, and that the Sebha Main Camp
eventually was taken over by a militia controlled by the Libyan government:

 

- The WAH Main Camp was pillaged in August 2011, first by armed soldiers
belonging to the Tarik Bin Ziyad Battalion and a few days thereafter by armed
soldiers belonging to a Tank Battalion of the Army“;

- Simultaneously, the Sebha Main Camp was pillaged by armed men belonging to the
Free Martyrs Brigade of Sebha’™* and to a Military Brigade “in the service of Free
Libya”;

In 2014 the 3" Force of the Libya Shield took over the Sebha Main Camp and

dispossessed Cengiz Libya’.

Attribution

The Parties have discussed extensively whether under international law these actions
can be attributed to Libya.

The Parties” positions

Claimant's starting point is that all acts committed by a State’s police or armed forces
are attributable to the State. Claimant adds that the conduct of an insurrectional
movement which becomes the new Government of a State must be considered an act of
that State. Consequently, a State may incur concurrent liability for acts carried out by its
regular armed forces and by a successful insurrectional movement™”°.

Respondent stresses that by August 2011 it was the NTC, and not the former Gaddafi
regime, that was the rightful government of Libya, and the Gaddafi-aligned forces were
at most unsuccessful insurrectional forces that were seeking to displace the new
government of Libya. In such circumstances, the acts of Gaddafi-aligned forces cannot
be attributable to Libya”. Libya submits that Claimant has not established that the
specific militia or armed group which it says committed the damage to the Main Camps

was directed or controlled by the State”,

The Tribunal’s decision

To settle this issue, it is necessary first to establish the legitimate Government of Libya
at a certain time (i), to identify the attackers in each specific incident (ii), and then to
decide on the alleged responsibility of the Libyan State (iii).

a. Libya’s legitimate Government

Libya says that by the time when the first incidents occurred — end of August 2011 — the
legitimate Government of Libya was that of the NTC”.

The Tribunal tends to agree.

Italy and France recognized the NTC government in April and June 2011, respectively,
and on 15 July US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that the US had decided to
formally recognise the NTC as the country’s “legitimate authority’°, The UK made a
similar declaration on 27 July 2011431. The evidence shows that by the end of August,
international legitimacy had passed from the Gaddafi Government to the NTC
Government, which had arisen out of the Libyan Revolution.

And by that date, the NTC was also in control of the major part of Libyan territory. The
exception may have been certain parts of the Southern Region, a traditional stronghold
of Gaddafi supporters, which were still held by pro-Gaddafi forces. The battle of Sebha,
which led to a defeat of such loyalist forces, was fought in September 2011 — leading to
Coronel Gaddafi’s demise in October 2011.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

b. Identification of the attackers

The identification of the attackers is a task which requires the Tribunal to carefully
weigh the scarce available evidence. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the Tribunal is
confident that the following facts can be deemed to be proven:

 

The WAH Main Camp was pillaged at the end of August 2011 by armed soldiers
belonging to the Libyan army — first by soldiers from a unit belonging to the Tarik Bin
Ziyad Battalion of the Army and a few days thereafter from a Tank Battalion of the
Army. The evidence shows that the attackers were regular units of the Libyan army.

  

Were these units pro-Gaddafi, or where they in favour of the NTC Government?

Although the available evidence is scarce, it seems likely that by August 2011 the army
units in questions were still defending the old Gaddafi regime. The Tribunal submitted
this question to Claimant’s counsel, and he confirmed that this was the most likely

   

The situation in Sebha was different: here there is indirect evidence that attackers
belonged to militias controlled by the NTC Government: Free Martyrs Brigade of
Sebha, a Military Brigade “in the service of Free Libya” and in 2014 the 3" Force of the
Libya Shield. The indirect evidence are two letters drafted by HIB ex post facto, in
which the Government agency asks these Brigades to return to Cengiz the equipment
looted from the Camp Site**

 

 

c. Responsibility of the Libyan State

There are two principles of international law which are relevant for deciding this issue:
the principle that a State is responsible for the actions performed by its armed forces,
and the principle that a State also assumes responsibility for the acts of a successful
insurrectional movement.

(i) Responsibility for acts of armed forces

Article 4 of the Draft ILC Articles of the International Law Commission on
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts [“Draft ILC Articles”]"*
provides as follows:

“Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State

1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State
under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive,
judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization
of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government
or of a territorial unit of the State.

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance
with the internal law of the State”.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/IAYZ

Under this rule a State is responsible for the acts carried out by its regular armed forces.
The rule is relevant in order to establish the responsibility for the attacks on the WAH.
Main Camp: the Tribunal has concluded that the attackers of the WAH Main Camp
were members of the Libyan army, and consequently their acts are attributable to Libya.

Respondent’s counterargument

Respondent raises a counter-argument: it says that the Libyan military units which
attacked the WAH Main Camp were in fact loyal to the previous Government of
Colonel Gaddafi and must be considered as unsuccessful insurrectional forces seeking
to displace the new government of Libya*.

The Tribunal agrees with the statement but disagrees with the conclusion.

It is likely that the Libyan military units which attacked the WAH Main Camp were at
that time defending the Gaddafi regime. But that is irrelevant for the purposes of
attribution: these units belonged to the regular Libyan army, as such they were an organ.
of the Libyan State, and their actions, under international law, were attributable to the
State. Whether these units were loyal to the Gaddafi or the NTC Government does not
affect the principle of attribution. The Libyan State, including its regular armed forces,
never ceased to exist, even if one Government was toppled by the Libyan Revolution
and a new Government was instated. The Libyan State must assume responsibility for
the looting performed by its regular armed forces - independently of purpose or
political affiliation.

(ii) Responsibility for insurrectional movements
Article 10 of the Draft ILC Articles read as follows

1. The conduct of an insurrectional movement which becomes the new
Government of a State shall be considered an act of that State under
international law.

2. The conduct of a movement, insurrectional or other, which succeeds in
establishing a new State in part of the territory of a pre-existing State or in a
territory under its administration shall be considered an act of the new State
under international law.

3. This article is without prejudice to the attribution to a State of any conduct,
however related to that of the movement concerned, which is to be considered
an act of that State by virtue of articles 4 to 9.

The rule implies that acts committed by members of an insurrectional movement are
attributable to the State, if such movement eventually is successful and takes over the
Government of such State. The Commentaries to the Draft ILC Articles provide the
following explanation*®:

“Where the insurrectional movement, as a new Government, replaces the
previous Government of the State, the ruling organization of the insurrectional
movement becomes the ruling organization of that State. The continuity which
thus exists between the new organization of the State and that of the

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

insurrectional movement leads naturally to the attribution to the State of
conduct which the insurrectional movement may have committed during the
struggle. In such a case, the State does not cease to exist as a subject of
international law. It remains the same State, despite the changes,
reorganizations and adaptations which occur in its institutions. Moreover, it is
the only subject of international law to which responsibility can be attributed.
The situation requires that acts committed during the struggle for power by the
apparatus of the insurrectional movement should be attributable to the State,
alongside acts of the then established Government.”

The result of this rule is that the Libyan State must be deemed responsible for acts and
omissions committed by both its regular army (without taking into consideration which
Government the army was defending) and by all insurrectional groups and militias,
which defended the NTC Government and fought the Gaddafi regime, and which
ultimately were successful.

 

Libya Shield

The Libya Shield, the unit which eventually took over the Sebha Main Camp, merits a
specific comment.

In its commencement the Libyan Shield was a group of militias, created to support the
insurrection. Since the Libyan Revolution eventually triumphed, its actions are
attributable to Libya under the principle set forth in Article 10 of the Draft ILC Articles.

When the Libyan Revolution eventually assumed the Government of Libya, the Libyan
Shield became officially affiliated with the state security apparatus, as provided for in
Resolution Num. 47/2012”, and was placed under the command of the Ministry of
Defence. The Libyan Shield thus was transformed into an organ of the Libyan State,
whose actions are directly attributable to Libya under Article 4 of the Draft ILC
Articles. In this new capacity, the NTC Government sent the Libyan Shield to Sebha to
enforce law and order — and eventually to take over Claimant’s Sebha Main Camp.

Breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT

 

Summing up, the Tribunal concludes that the regular Libyan army and militias which
formed part of the insurrectional movement and were then controlled by the NTC
Government, looted and caused physical harm to Cengiz Libya’s Main Camps. Under
the rules of attribution of international law, the Libyan State must assume responsibility
for such conduct, which breached the FPS standard guaranteed in Article 2(2) of the
BIT to protected Turkish investments.

BREACH OF THE POSITIVE OBLIGATION OF THE FPS STANDARD

There is evidence that, further to the pillage and violence perpetrated directly by armed
forces and militias controlled by and attributable to Libya, the Main Camps were also
raided by civilian mobs, supported by groups of armed persons. Both Main Camps were
attacked at the end of August 2011 and at the Sebha Main Camp was raided again in
November 2013.

Breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT

The positive obligation which the FPS standard places on the State is an obligation of
means — not of the result. The question which the Tribunal must address is whether the
Libyan government exercised reasonable care to protect Cengiz’ investment in the
Southern Region, taking into consideration the State’s means and. resources and the
general political and security situation in Libya?

The short answer is that Libya totally failed to provide any security to the two Main
Camps an investment worth almost USD 90 M, full of valuable machinery and
equipment, located in the Southern region and subject to a heightened risk of attack.
Libya never deployed any unit of the regular Army, any police force nor Government
controlled militia to protect such assets.

The responsibility is aggravated by the fact that HIB, an agency of the Government,
repeatedly requested Cengiz Libya not to discontinue and (after the first evacuation) to
promptly resume its construction activities — even signing the 2013 Protocols in order to
induce Claimant to restart work",

Faced with these requests, Cengiz Libya asked at various moments that HIB provide
security, so that construction activity could be safely performed*”. But there is no
evidence of HIB, or any other agency of the Libyan government, or the Libyan
government itself, took any measure to support Cengiz Libya’s situation. The record
only shows two (mildly phrased) letters, send after the attacks, in which HIB politely
requested that the military units which had raided the Camp return the machinery to its
rightful owner”.

Cengiz Libya was left on its own in the task of protecting the Main Camps. To do so it
had to resort to private armed individuals. There is indirect evidence that this happened
at the WAH Project. And there is ample evidence that in Sebha Cengiz Libya had to
resort to an ominous “Security Group”, captained by a certain Muhammet Omer Zeydan
Ali, which (against payment and without much success) provided armed protection to
the Sebha Main Camp.

The Tribunal concludes that Libya also breached the second leg of the FPS standard: it
totally failed to provide any government-sponsored protection to the two Main Camps,
at a time when there was a heightened security deficit in the South of the country. This
failure facilitated that private mobs were repeatedly able to raid the Main Camps,
looting equipment and destroying facilities.

Respondent’s counter-argument
Libya submits a counter-argument: in a situation of civil war and general unrest, it
would be unreasonable to expect a government 2 use scarce resources to protect

ancillary projects like the WAH and Sebha Projects“!

The Tribunal remains unconvinced.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

First the Tribunal has concluded that due diligence required Libya to deploy means to
protect Cengiz Libya’s two Main Camps — not the ability to perform its construction
activities and complete the WAH and Sebha Projects.

The construction sites were scattered over 12 villages in the WAH Project, and over
different quarters of the city in the Sebha Project and. required that a large number of
foreign workers (approximately 1,400) and different types of construction materials and
machinery and equipment move daily from the Main Camps to the construction sites
and back.

The Tribunal agrees with Libya? that to organize this type of dynamic protection, and
to achieve a level of security which would have permitted Cengiz Libya to continue
with its work, would have over-stretched the resources of most countries, and certainly
those of Libya in 2011-2013.

But this level of security is not what the second leg of the FPS standard requires. What
Libya could reasonably have done is to provide basic static protection to the two Main
Camps, as a deterrent against theft and plunder by violent mobs. Libya failed to provide
such protection at all, and the result is that mobs repeatedly were able to enter the Main
Camps and to loot and destroy the property.

Second, there is evidence that Libya, if it had wanted, would have been able to marshal
the limited resources required to provide static protection to the two Main Camps. Mr.
Legrand, Claimant's security expert, declared that the government controlled a number
of fighting units in the South: Libya Shield, Mourzouk Katiba, El Soumoud Katiba,
Batallion num. 30. Any of these could have been used to perform this simple task“,

Third, there actually is a comparable example of a foreign investment which received
this type of protection, Enka Teknik was a Turkish company working on the
construction of the Awbari gas power station, located in the South of the country in the
WAH region. The State allocated to Enka Teknik a group of 30 soldiers to protect their
camp, and this simple measure (together with basic self-protection measures) achieved
the result that the power station was neither looted nor destroyed, and that Enka
eventually was able to resume the project™.

CONCLUSION

The Tribunal concludes

that the Libyan army and militias controlled by the Libyan army caused physical
harm to Cengiz Libya’s Main Camps, looting machinery and equipment and
eventually taking control of the Sebha Main Camp, and

- that Libyan failed to provide any type of military, militia or police protection to the
Main Camps, further facilitating that civilian mobs raided the installation.

This conduct, which is attributable to the Libyan state, implies a breach of the positive
and of the negative obligations of the FPS standard provided for in Article 2(2) of the
BIT.

VII.4. THE WAR CLAUSE

 

The Tribunal has already concluded that the FPS standard in Article 2(2) of the BIT,
and the compensation for war losses provided for in Article 5, give rise to two distinct
obligations. In this section the Tribunal will analyse whether there is evidence which
proves that Libya provided to any Libyan or foreign investor a treatment more
favourable than that awarded to Cengiz. The Tribunal will summarize the Parties’
positions (1 and 2.) and then discuss its own decision (3.).

CLAIMANT’ POSITION

 

Claimant submits that pursuant to Article 5 of the BIT, Libya owes Cengiz “treatment
no less favorable” than it accorded its own investors or other foreign investors,
“whichever is the most favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in regard
to such losses’?

Claimant submits that Article 5 of the BIT applies “as regards any measures [the State]
adopts in relation to such losses”. This drafting also includes measures different from
monetary compensation. Claimant alleges that Libya offered other investors:

- Monetary compensation*®;

- Awarding additional contracts”;

- Increases in the contractual value“

to compensate the losses suffered owing to the Libyan revolution.

RESPONDENT S$ POSITION

 

Respondent Tepresents that no compensation was paid by HIB or the Libyan State to
any forei, an investor”, submits that Claimant was not treated less favorably than other
investors” and that consequently Libya has not incurred in any breach of Art. 5 of the
BIT.

TRIBUNALS DECISION

 

Article 5 of the Treaty, which deals with compensation for losses, reads as follows:

“Investors of either Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the
territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war, insurrection, civil
disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded by such other
Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own
investors or to investors of any third country, whichever is the most
favourable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such
losses”.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

The Tribunal’s task in the present section is to establish whether Libya has accorded to
- its own investors, or
- to investors of any third country,

treatment regarding losses suffered owing to “war, insurrection, civil disturbances or
other similar events”, which is more favourable than the treatment offered to Cengiz.
And the treatment to which Cengiz is entitled derives from the Tribunal’s findings in
the previous section: Libya has breached both the positive and the negative obligation to
provide FPS to Claimant’s WAH and Sebha Main Camps, and Cengiz is entitled to
compensation for the damage suffered. If Libya has accorded any other investor a
treatment which goes above and beyond this standard, Article 5 of the BIT requires that
the improved treatment be also extended to Claimant.

Application of the War Clause in Article 5 requires a three-step approach*"!:
- First an appropriate comparator must be identified, i.e. an investor which is in a

situation similar to that of Cengiz, and which has suffered losses owing to war or
similar events;

Second, Claimant must prove that Libya has applied to this comparator “measures
[...] in relation to such losses”, which are more favourable than those accorded to
Cengiz;

Third, lack of a reasonable or objective justification for the difference of treatment.

The comparator

Cengiz is a Turkish construction company, performing two civil construction contracts
with an agency of the Libyan government, which has suffered losses due to war,
insurrection, civil disturbances or other similar events. The Comparator must meet the
same requirement

 

- Aconstruction company,

- Active in Libya,

Contracting civil works with the Libyan public sector,

Which has suffered similar damage.

Claimant has identified two groups of companies which, in Claimant’s submission,
meet these criteria: the first group includes construction companies which allegedly
have received monetary compensation, and the second group construction companies
which have received compensation in form of new contracts", The Tribunal finds that
this second category does not represent an appropriate comparator: in this arbitration
Cengiz is requesting a monetary compensation for the loss suffered — not the awarding
of new contracts.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

Claimant refers to three companies which allegedly have received monetary
compensation for the losses suffered during the Libyan Revolution**:

Arab Contractors Company [“ACC”], an Egyptian construction company;

Won, a Korean company,

An unnamed contractor working for the Libyan State-owned Al-Gazalla
Company®.

More favourable measures

The second step in the procedure requires that Claimant prove that the comparator
entities received measures more favourable than those accorded to Cengiz.

The evidence marshalled by Claimant is the following:

ACC: the Libya Monitor, an open source of economic news on Libya, informed on
March 28, 2013 that ACC’s chairman had said in a statement that the Libyan
Government had agreed to pay USD 8 M compensation “for equipment that was
damaged or lost during the 2011 conflict”; the statement added a caveat: payment
would be made “as soon as procedures were completed”™**;

- Won: on October 3, 2013 the Libyan Monitor published a piece of news saying that
Won construction had “reportedly agreed to restart work on a 2,500-unit housing
project in Dema, with the Government paying a significant sum in compensation for
stolen or damaged equipment”; the news was based on a report from the Libyan
State news agency LANA, stating “that the government had agreed to pay LYD 10
M (S$8M) to Won Construction cover [sic] the costs of stolen or damaged equipment,
machinery and building materials;

- Al-Gazalla: this is a Libyan State owned company, which had entered into a
construction contract with an unnamed foreign contractor; the Libyan Audit Bureau
(the Government watch-dog) criticized the project in its 2015 report, and among
various items mentioned that “Al-Gazalla Company has compensated the contractor
for losses arising during the period of work suspension during the incidents of 17"
February revolution”

Libya emphatically denies having compensated any foreign construction company for
the losses suffered during the Libyan Revolution:

- Eng. Ajaj, the Chairman of HIB, has declared in his third WS: “I can categorically
state that HIB has not paid any compensation to contractors as a result of the 2011
conflict”***;

Eng. Hmouda, Chief of the Public Projects Board, submitted an official statement to
the Tribunal, confirming “that the Public Board and the implementing boards
affiliated to the Board which implement the public projects which are financed by

the Public Budget have never paid monies (compensation) to whatever company
including Arab Contractors Company”.

Extension to Claimant of such measures

 

Article 5 requires that the measures accorded to other comparable investors be also
extended to Cengiz, provided that such measures are “more favourable” than those
enjoyed by Claimant, and that there is no reasonable or objective justification.

The situation of ACC is unclear. The open source information avers that ACC will
receive compensation for losses “as soon as procedures are completed” — and the
Libyan government avers that payment was never made.

Won’s situation is different and not directly comparable with that of Cengiz: the Libyan
State requested that construction of the housing project restart, and in order to convince
the constructor to reinitiate work the open-source news say that the State compensated
“the costs of stolen or damaged equipment, machinery and building materials”.

Finally, what seems to have happened in the Al-Gazalla project is that the constructor
was indemnified for the suspension of work during the Libyan Revolution — not for the
cancellation of the contract and the destruction of machinery and equipment.

Conclusion

All in all, and after carefully weighing the evidence marshalled, the Tribunal concludes
that Claimant has not been able to prove that any other contractor in a comparable
situation was accorded a treatment which was more favourable than that metered to
Cengiz — including Cengiz’ right to be compensated for the losses suffered at its two
Main Camps, deriving from Libya’s breach of the FPS standard in violation of Article
2(2) of the BIT.

VIL.5.FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

Claimant submits that Libya breached another of its obligations assumed under the BIT:
a failure to provide FET treatment to Claimant’s investment. The Tribunal will again
summarize the Parties’ positions (1. and 2.), and then discuss its own decision (3.)

CLAIMANT S$ POSITION

 

Claimant submits that Libya did not uphold its obligation to provide FET to Cengiz’
investments under Article 2(2) of the BIT. Libya breached this obligation":

- when it applied unreasonable and discriminatory measures;
- frustrated Cengiz’ legitimate expectations;
- and treated Cengiz* investments unreasonably and in an arbitrary manner;

thereby impairing the “management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, or
disposal of such investments”.

Discriminatory measures

 

Claimant alleges that it suffered discriminatory treatment because, unlike other
investors, it was"*':

- not protected;

= nor paid for the works carried out prior to 2011: it did not receive any compensation,
in cash or in kind, and was not put in a position to return and resume the works.

According to Claimant, evidence supports the conclusion that many investors*”

- were able to return safely to Libya after the events of 2011, when the situation
stabilized;

were paid the amounts owed and allowed to resume their projects, or

- were given compensation for losses, whether monetary or by way of additional
contracts.

However, Claimant was afforded none of these, in spite of the fact that it performed its
obligations under the Protocols**

Frustration of legitimate expectations

Claimant avers that the obligation to accord FET to foreign investments comprises the

protection of an investor’s legitimate expectations “+ Thus, it submits that the State’s

signing the Protocols;

engaging in negotiations to sign the protocols and in exchanges with Claimant after
the uprising;

publicizing its eagerness for foreign investors to return to Libya; and
- signing contracts with foreign investors to resume works,
created the expectation that Cengiz would be able to reactivate the Projects and recoup

its losses. Thus, Libya’s unjustified frustration of these expectations must be held as a
violation of its obligation under Article 2(2)!,

Unreasonable and arbitrary treatment

Claimant alleges that the prohibition on arbitrary and discriminatory measures is part of
the State’s obligation to provide FET”. As such, arbitral tribunals have found that a
measure will be regarded as unreasonable or arbitrary if;

- it does not serve any apparent legitimate purpose;

~ itis based on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;

- _ itis taken for reasons different than the ones put forward by the decision-maker or

- itis taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.

Claimant submits that it has been the subject of unreasonable and arbitrary treatment by
468.

the Libyan State*®:

Despite committing, through the Protocols, to resume works it was never put in a
position to do so.

- To the contrary, it has maintained at a significant cost the guarantees for the Projects
put in place in 2009470.

Mr. Ajaj’s statements during the hearing suggest that Claimant was punished by
Libya for what it perceived to be the inimical stance of the Turkish government*”!,

Claimant did not agree to waive its rights to compensation”.

riminatory measures

480. Libya says that Claimant has not established discriminatory treatment” and points to
the following facts that would show that Claimant was not discriminated against by
Libya’:

The fact that some projects were able to continue and others not, makes no
allowance for the differing situation in different regions*”*;

The Protocols were not executed due to Claimant’s inability to extend the guarantees
and insure the Projects as required by the Contracts‘”*;

- As shown in the 20" Committee’s reports*”

were applied to other contractors*””;

concerns as to guarantees and insurance

 

Libya had every reason to desire that the Projects succeed; HIB had a proactive
approach and was a cooperative partner’;

There was no discriminatory treatment of foreign investors per se, and many of the
examples cited by Claimant refer to Turkish companies*”,

Even if the Protocols had been enacted, Claimant might not have been able to finish
the Projects, because the security situation worsened**’,

Frustration of legitimate expectations

481. — First, Respondent alleges that since this claim was not pursued in Claimant’s Statement
of Claim the Arbitral Tribunal should not allow it to proceed“.

 

482. Second, Respondent avers that Libya made no specific representations to Claimant that
would justify reliance’, But even if Claimant could establish that the Protocols were
not enacted due to Libya’s fault, that would not give rise to a FET breach: Claimant
signed the Protocols fully aware of the ongoing conflict and the risks involved (new
suspension, termination)". Further, to the extent that the Protocols were breached,

Unre: ble and arbitrary treatment

Finally, Respondent denies that the high threshold required to prove unreasonable and
arbitrary treatment has been met by Claimant"**.

TRIBUNAL S DECISION

 

To adjudicate this issue, the Tribunal will first establish the proven facts (3.1.) and then
it will analyse the three separate FET sub-claims submitted by Claimant: that Libya
discriminated against Cengiz (3.2), that Libya frustrated Cengiz legitimate expectations
(3.3) and that Libya took unreasonable or arbitrary actions against Cengiz (3.4).

 

PROVEN FACTS

Pro memoria:

The Libyan Revolution started in February 2011;

The WAH Main Camp was evacuated in March 2011; the Sebha Main Camp in
April 2011;

- On 23 and 25 August 2011 the WAH Main Camp was raided by units belonging to
the regular Libyan army; a few days thereafter the Camp was looted and destroyed
by a citizen mob supported by police and army;

On 26 August 2011 the Sebha Main Camp was raided by militia brigades.
The Protocols

Towards the end of 2011, the Libyan Revolution had triumphed, the last Gaddafi forces
had been defeated and the security situation started to improve. At that time Claimant
initiated negotiations with the HIB, requesting that Cengiz Libya be indemnified for the
damage caused during the Libyan Revolution, and that the construction of the two
Projects be resumed.

After various meetings and exchanges with government officials, on June 13, 2013,
Cengiz and HIB finally were able to sign a reactivation Protocol for each Contract*®”.

The Protocols are two very short and simple agreements, whose main provisions can be
summarized as follows***:

- In the Preamble Cengiz Libya recognizes that the event
nature, unexpected and outside the intentions of the parties

f 2011 were “of a general

 

 

- Cengiz Libya agrees to resume the Contracts and carry on the performance of the
works within 30 days of the work continuation order“;

- HIB agrees to enable Cengiz to work on the sites;

Cengiz undertakes to extend all bank guarantees and bonds required by the Contracts
within one month from the signature of the Protocol"”!;

- HIB agrees to pay Cengiz 50% of “the approved and payable notices for contract
works”, i.e. amounts accrued and outstanding in accordance with the Contracts; the
remaining 50% would be paid “after the company embarks on the project™

- The original contractual deadlines are extended to cover the suspension period”,

The Protocols “form an integral part of the original contract” and as such are subject to
Libyan law and the jurisdiction of Libyan courts.

The Protocols do not include any obligation that the HIB indemnify Cengiz Libya for
the damage caused to the contractor’s machinery or equipment during the Libyan
Revolution. The only provision refers to damage caused to completed and delivered
construction. work: if damaged the Contractor is bound to rebuild the work at current

prices
Re-mobilization

After signing the Protocols Cengiz completed its mobilization study, repaired the Sebha
Main Camp and made it suitable to accommodate 250 workers". Work on the WAH
Main Camp, which had been completely destroyed, was not resumed — because the road

from Sebha to WAH was closed due to security concerns’.

Cengiz Libya also extended all bank guarantees and bonds required by the Contracts
within one month of the signature of Protocols (for details see section B. infra).

Security deteriorates

But shortly thereafter the security situation in Libya started to deteriorate, and in the
autumn of 2013 the Sebha Main Camp was repeatedly raided by mobs and militias. On
22 January 2014 Cengiz Libya wrote to the HIB, informing of the deteriorating security
situation and complaining about the cost of maintaining the bank guarantees and bonds,

while resumption of work was impossible”

 

And then in March 2014 three heavily armed groups belonging to the 3“ Force of the
Libya Shield took over the Sebha Main Camp and expelled Cengiz Libya’.

In the meantime, the Protocols were not implemented. Despite Cengiz’ repeated
requests”, HIB never paid the amounts agreed upon in the Protocols for the WAH

Project, nor for the Sebha Project.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

There is very little contemporary evidence explaining the reasons for this failure. The
only letter which has been marshalled is dated March 12, 2014, and in it HIB provides
an answer with regard to the WAH Project™:

after the signature of the 2013 Protocols HIB had followed the financial procedures
to pay Cengiz the outstanding amounts, but payment was delayed due to Cengiz’s
failure to extend the contractual guarantees; and

- requesting that Cengiz assign a manager to the WAH Project, instead of having a
shared management for both Projects.

In his witness statement and in his interrogatory during the Hearing, Eng. Ajaj, HIB’s
chairman, declared that the reason for HIB’s failure to pay and to give the work
resumption order was that Cengiz Libya’s had breached its obligation to provide
guarantees and bonds.

In its submission, Libya advances a second reason: that the security situation in the
Southern Region was very unstable, and that in such circumstances HIB was reluctant
to resume two Projects which required the development of urban facilities, which
required construction activities scattered over many sites in Sebha and throughout the
WAH region™”!.

Extension of bonds

Pro memoria, the Contracts required that Cengiz Libya deposit two types of bank
guarantees with HIB, which were to remain in effect for the duration of the Contracts:

- A performance bond for 2% of total cost of each Contract™”,

- Anadvance payment bond for 15% of the Contract cost of each Contract™.
For the WAH Project, Cengiz issued two guarantees in favor of HIB™*:

- A letter of performance bond valued at EUR 5.65 M*° [“WAH Performance
Bond”] and

- Anadvance payment bond valued at EUR 42 M™ [WAH AP Bond”].
Similarly, for the Sebha Project, Cengiz issued two guarantees in favor of HIB™”:

- A letter of performance bond valued at EUR 4 M* [“Sebha Performance Bond”]
and

- An advance payment bond valued at EUR 26.3 M™ [“Sebha AP Bond”].

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

One of Claimant's obligations under the Protocols was to extend (not to renew)°"” all
bank guarantees and bonds required by the Contracts, within one month from the
signature of the Protocol’!’.

WAH Performance Bond

The WAH Performance Bond was established on January 13, 2010 to be valid until
October 1, 2013°". Thus, at the time of signature of the Protocols and a month
thereafter, the WAH Performance Bond was still valid.

Claimant has provided evidence that HIB periodically sent “extend or pay” requests*;
the WAH Performance Bond expired, however, in 2017, allegedly because the request
by HIB was either late or inconsistent with the conditions set forth in the text of the
Bond*"*.

WAH AP Bond

The WAH. AP Bond was established on January 13, 2010, to be valid until September
30, 2012515.

On June 18, 2012, HIB wrote to the manager of the Jumhouria Bank requesting that the
Bond be decreased from EUR 42 M to EUR 40.3 M°"*. Juiphouria Bank confirmed the
reduction of the guarantee and its extension until June 30, 2013°. Furthermore, by
letter dated September 2, 2013, the bank confirmed that the WAH AP Bond had been
extended until June 30, 2014. Thus, at the time of signature of the Protocols and a
month later, the WAH AP Bond was valid.

Sebha Performance Bond

The Sebha Performance Bond was established on December 8, 2009, to be valid until
July 1, 2013520. It was extended before its expiry date until June 30, 2014, following
HIB’s “extend or pay” letter of May 23, 2013921. Thus, at the time of signature of the
2013 Protocols and a month later, the Sebha Performance Bond was still valid.

509. Claimant has provided evidence that HIB periodically sent the bank “extend or pay”
requests”, The Sebha Performance Bond is currently valid until December 31, 213.

Sebha AP Bond

510, The Sebha AP Bond was established on December 8, 2009, to be valid until July 1,
2013524. On June 14, 2012, HIB sent to the Wahda Bank in Tripoli an “extend or pay” in
order to have the bond extended until December 31, 2013525. Thus, at the time of
signature of the 2013 Protocols and a month later, the Sebha Performance Bond was
valid.

S11. Claimant has provided evidence that HIB periodically sent the appropriate bank “extend
or pay” requests™”° and that the Sebha AP Bond is valid until December 31, 2018527.

512, Summing up, the evidence shows that - contrary to HIB’s case - all bank guarantees and
bonds required by the Contracts were in place one month after the signature of 2013
Protocols. The WAH Performance Bond and the WAH AP Bond expired in 2017, while
the Sebha Performance Bond and the Sebha AP Bond are valid until the end of 2018.

Cc Present situation of the Contracts

 

513. The situation of the two Contracts can be summarized as follows:

514. (i) Construction activities under both Contracts were suspended in March and April
2011.

515. (ii) At the time of suspension, only a small percentage of the work had been carried out
(WALK: design had progressed 65%**, while construction had progressed 9%°*°. Sebha:
design works had been completed by 70.5% and construction works by 12%°**).

516. (iii) At the time of suspension, the HIB had only paid a part of the price due (WAH:
LYD 72.5 M™!; Sebha: LYD 43.6 M*”),

517. (iv) The WAH and Sebha Main Camps have been raided, looted and destroyed and
Cengiz Libya has been dispossessed of both Camps.

518. (v) The Protocols, which amended the original Contracts, were signed in 2013:

 

* Doe. C-179; Doc. SP-3; Doc. SP-5; Doc. $P-6; Doc. SP-7.

* Doc. C-179; Doc. SP-7.

* Doc. C-179; Doc. SA-1; Doc. SA-2.

* Doc. C-149 (please note that this document seems to make reference to bond 6/39/57 for LYD 43,6M).
Even if this bond is not the Sebha AP Bond, the following documents suggest that the guarantee was
extended before its expiry:

- Swift message from Europe Arab Bank to Wahda Bank of December 10, 2013 refers to a “new date of
expiry” of 31 December 2014 and indicates that “the beneficiary has withdrawn his claim for payment”
(Doe. SA-5).

- On October 2, 2013, HIB made an “extend or pay” request to the bank (Doc. SA-4), which was
approved and notified by letter dated January 29, 2014 ( Doc. SA~7).

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

Cengiz Libya agreed to resume work, while

HIB agreed to pay Cengiz 50% of amounts accrued and outstanding; the remaining
_ 50% would be paid once construction is restarted; !

-_ The original contractual deadlines were extended to cover the suspension period.

(vi) Cengiz Libya duly extended all bank guarantees and bonds required by the
Contracts within one month of the signature of 2013 Protocols; the WAH bonds expired
in 2017, the Sebha bonds are valid till the end of 2018.

(vii) HIB never made any payment under any of the Protocols and it never issued the
work continuation order; work has not been resumed.

(viii) Neither HIB nor Cengiz Libya have terminated the Contracts, which are still in
force.

DISCRIMINATION

Claimant says that it suffered discriminatory treatment, because, unlike several other
investors, the Protocols were not implemented, it was not paid for the works carried out
prior to 2011 and was not put in a position to return and resume work. Claimant adds.
that in 2013 HIB paid more than LYD 700 M to different companies that had executed
protocols and then refers specifically to six companies which — in its submission ~
received a better treatment™.

Respondent denies any discrimination: the Projects were not executed because of the
dangerousness of the Southern Region and the Protocols were not implemented because
Cengiz Libya failed to provide the requisite bonds”.

 

The BIT

Articles 2(2) and Article 3(2) and 3(3) prohibit discriminatory treatment of protected
investors and investments:

“Article 2 Promotion and Protection of Investments

1L.]

2 [...] Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use , enjoyment,
extension, or disposal of such investments”.

“Article 3 Treatment of Investments

tLed

2. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns
of investors of other Contracting Party to treatment less favorable than that
which it accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to

investments or returns of investors of any third State, whichever is the most
favorable.

3. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investors of the other
Contracting Party, as regards management, use, enjoyment or disposal of their
investments to treatment less favorable than that which it accords to its own
investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is the most favourable”.

 

Requirements

Claimant says that it suffered discrimination vis-a-vis other investors. To prove the
existence of discrimination, it is necessary that a three-step approach be followed":

- Eirst an appropriate comparator must be identified, ie, an investor which is in a
situation similar to that of Cengiz (or an investment which is in a situation similar to
Cengiz” investment in Libya);

- Second, Claimant must prove that Libya has applied to this comparator a treatment
more favourable than that accorded to Cengiz or to its investment in Libya;

- Third, there must be a lack of a reasonable or objective justification for the
difference of treatment.

Failure to meet the requirements

The burden of proving these three elements lies with Claimant. To discharge this
burden, Claimant refers to six different investors or investments, which allegedly were
in a situation similar to that of Cengiz Libya and received a more favourable treatment,
without there being a reasonable or objective justification.

  

First, Cengiz refers to the fact that HIB in 2013 paid more than LYD 700 M to different
companies that had executed protocols signed with HIB, including local Libyan and
foreign companies™®,

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Eng. Ajaj acknowledged that HIB made
payments in these amounts™’. But the Tribunal does not agree with Claimant's
conclusion that the existence of these payments provides conclusive evidence of
discrimination: HIB was managing many construction projects all over Libya, and the
fact that it paid some contractors but not others is by itself not a sign of discrimination,
For discrimination to exist what is required is that projects similar to those of Cengiz
received (without justification) a better treatment - and the level of overall payments
made by HIB in 2013 does not prove that.

Second, Cengiz refers to Hill, an American consultancy and project management
company which was owed almost USD 60 M by ODAC, a Libyan Government agency,
and which collected USD 10 M, as recorded in Hill’s 2017 financial statements.

The Tribunal finds that the comparator is not in a situation similar to that of Claimant:
- Hill is a consultancy, which was owed moneys by an agency of the Libyan

Government, and which eventually managed to collect roughly 10% of the balance,
while

532.

534,

535.

536.

537.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

- Cengiz is a construction company (not a consultancy), and its case is that HIB is
delaying or obstructing resumption of two construction Projects (while Hill’s
situation relates to its inability to collect a debt owed by the Libyan Government).

Third, Claimant also refers to TML, a Turkish company that was able to complete its
project with the port authorities in Libya worth LYD 100 M.

 

The Tribunal is unconvinced, for two reasons:

- First, the evidence marshalled by Claimant is shaky™*;

- But even if arguendo Claimant's case is accepted, the situation of a company
constructing a port is materially different from that in charge of urban development
in certain villages and towns of the Southern Region — TML is not a valid
comparator.

Fourth, Claimant invokes the situation of CSCEC, a Chinese construction company
which allegedly reached an agreement to resume work on a housing project in Benghazi
and received compensation by means of additional contracts.

Again, the Tribunal finds that the comparator is inappropriate. Claimant’s situation is
materially different from that of CSCEC. The Chinese construction company resumed
work and received additional contracts for the construction of housing in Benghazi.
While Cengiz’ case relates to the resumption of two widely-scattered urban
development projects in the wild and unsecure Southern Region of the country. There
are objective reasons which justify Libya’s decision to advance Benghazi housing
projects, while postponing urbanization projects in the Southern Region.

Fifth, Claimant refers to ACC and Won, two construction companies which allegedly
were compensated by Libya for damages suffered during the Libyan Revolution.

The evidence marshalled by Claimant (to which the Tribunal has already referred in
section VIL4.3.A supra) is the following:

ACC: the Libya Monitor informed on March 28, 2013 that the Libyan Government
had agreed to pay USD 8 M compensation “for equipment that was damaged or lost
during the 2011 conflict”; the statement added a caveat: payment would be made “as
soon as procedures were completed”539;

Won: on October 3, 2013 the Libyan Monitor published a piece of news saying that
Won construction had reportedly agreed to restart work on a 2,500-unit housing
project in Dema, with the Government paying LYD 10 M (USD 8 M) in
compensation for stolen or damaged equipment540;

The Tribunal has already found that™!:

- The situation of ACC is unclear, because the press statement says that ACC will
receive compensation for losses “as soon as procedures are completed”, the Libyan
government avers that payment was never made and Claimant has not marshalled
evidence proving actual payment; and

541.

542.

543.

545.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

- Won’s situation is not directly comparable to that of Cengiz, because the Libyan
State requested that construction of the housing project restart, and in these
circumstances apparently was prepared to compensate “the costs of stolen or
damaged equipment, machinery and building materials”.

Sixth, Claimant finally refers to Enka, a Turkish company constructing a power plant in
the Southern Region, which allegedly was able to resume and finish its project.

The Tribunal again is unconvinced.

Enka is indeed an appropriate comparator, but for a totally different purpose. The
Tribunal has already used ENKA to prove that Libya had the means to provide static
security to relevant foreign investment in the Southern Region (see Section VII.3.3.5B
supra).

But Enka does not serve as an appropriate comparator to prove that Cengiz’ is being
discriminated. Enka entailed the construction of a power plant, which was close to
completion when the Libyan Revolution erupted. The Sebha and WAH Projects were
urbanisation projects which at that time were at their beginning.

Conclusion

The Tribunal concludes that the evidence marshalled by Claimant is insufficient to
prove its case: Cengiz is unable to identify a comparator in a similar situation, which
received a more favourable treatment. And in the few cases were Claimant has been
able to identify an appropriate comparator which has received more favourable
treatment, there are convincing reasons which justify the difference in treatment: the
Sebha and WAH Projects

 

had advanced very little when the Libyan Revolution erupted;

related to urban developments in Sebha and certain villages in the WAH Region;

- were located in the Southern Region, a tribal area of high insecurity; and

required that construction activity be scattered across more than a dozen sites.

aK
The Tribunal consequently rejects Claimant’s submission that Libya engaged in
discriminatory conduct with regard either to Cengiz or to its investment in Libya.

LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS

Claimant says that it had a legitimate expectation that Libya would comply with the
commitments assumed in the Protocols — something which Libya failed to do. But
Libya not only breached the contract, it also acted in bad faith, wilfully refusing to abide
by its obligations and abused its authority to evade the terms of the agreement — thus
violating Claimant's legitimate expectations”.

Respondent denies that HIB breached the Protocols. Libya adds, arguendo, that even if
HIB had breached such contracts, this would not give rise to a violation of legitimate

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ
expectations: a violation of the BIT requires that an act of puissance publique is
committed — something which did not happen here™?,

The BIT

Article 2(2) of the Treaty defines the FET standard:
“Article 2: Promotion and Protection of Investments
i

2 Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment [...]”

Discussion

It is uncontentious that the obligation to “at all times” accord FET to investments
encompasses the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations. If a host State,
through its laws or administrative actions, makes specific representations or
commitments, and thus creates certain legitimate expectations, and those expectations
lead the investor to invest, it is contrary to good faith (and in breach of the FET
standard) for the State to approve laws or take actions that deny or frustrate those
expectations.

 

Claimant says that Libya’s failure to implement the Protocols was performed in bad
faith, wilfully, with abuse of power and thus the conduct transcended a simple breach of
contract, violated Cengiz’ legitimate expectations, constituted an international wrong
and resulted in breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT

The facts do not support Claimant’s case.

In a nutshell: Cengiz Libya signed two construction Contracts with HIB, an agency of
the Libyan Government in 2008 and 2009. Construction activity has been suspended
since the Libyan Revolution erupted in 2011. The Contracts, subject to Libyan law and
jurisdiction, were amended through the 2013 Protocols. HIB has not made the up-front
payment foreseen in the Protocols, nor has it given the order for work to restart.

Claimant avers that HIB’s conduct is in breach of contract, while Libya argues that
Cengiz Libya failed to provide the proper guarantees — an argument which is rejected by
Cengiz Libya. Libya also advances the argument that the location and the nature of the
Projects made them too dangerous for work to restart — especially given the wider
security situation in Libya. Another element is important: neither Cengiz Libya nor HIB
have terminated the Contracts, which are still in force.

The facts do not yield any indication that HIB acted in bad faith, willfully refused to
abide by its obligations or abused its authority to evade the terms of the agreement.
There is also no element of puissance publique, of Libya abusing its sovereign powers
to enhance its contractual position. What the evidence shows is a dispute between the
contractual parties — HIB and Cengiz Libya — where the guarantees were properly
provided, and where there is an impossibility to resume work due to the security
situation in the Southern Region.

Given these factual findings, Claimant’s case that Libya’s failure to implement the
Protocols also constitutes an international wrong, a violation of the FET standard
enshrined in Article 2(2) of the BIT, fails.

ARBITRARY ACTIONS

As a last argument, Claimant submits that it was the victim of unreasonable or arbitrary
measures imposed by the Libyan State, which entitle it to compensation. Claimant says
that HIB has kept sending to Cengiz Libya and its banks “extend or pay” demands for
the bonds, and Cengiz Libya has been forced to keep these bonds in existence, at a
considerable cost. Claimant says that this is an obvious violation of Article 2(2) of the
BIT, which prohibits Libya from taking arbitrary or unreasonable measures — measures
that inflict damage to the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose“.

 

th: The State’s actions

Respondent disagrees. It says that the standard to be met is hi

The BIT
Article 2(2) provides as follows:
Article 2 Promotion and Protection of Investments
1[...]
2 [...] Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or

discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment,
extension, or disposal of such investments.

 

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent.

 

Notwithstanding the long period of suspension, it is a fact that the Contracts, novated by
the 2013 Protocols, are still in force. Neither Cengiz Libya nor HIB have adopted the
decision to terminate the agreements. There is consequently an expectation that at some
future time construction will resume, and that the Contracts will be fully performed.

Cengiz Libya provided the bonds required by the original Contracts. After the signing
of the 2013 Protocols, the bonds were duly extended (within one month, as required in
the Protocols). As the original bonds expired, HIB submitted “pay or extend” notices,
and Cengiz Libya extended the guarantees. In 2017, however, the WAH Performance
Bond and the WAH AP Bond expired — apparently because Libya failed to provide the
appropriate “pay or extend” notice. The Sebha Performance Bond and Sebha AP Bond
are still in force and will expire by the end of 2018.

Claimant says that HIB’s conduct, when it submitted “pay or extend” notices, was
arbitrary.

The Tribunal disagrees.

562.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

The Contracts were at all times and still are valid and in force. HIB requested Cengiz
Libya to comply with one of its contractual obligations, that of establishing and on
maturity extending the requisite bonds. There is nothing arbitrary in HIB's requests: gui
hire suo utitur, neminem laedit. Confronted with these requests, Cengiz Libya complied
with its commitments and duly extended the bonds — except that in 2017 it rejected
HIB’s requests regarding the WAH Performance and AP Bonds, apparently because
there was a mistake in the “pay or extend” notice (a question which eventually may lead
to a contractual dispute between HIB and Cengiz Libya, and which is outside the scope
of this procedure).

This Tribunal is tasked with adjudicating international law disputes for the breach of
commitments assumed. by the State of Libya in an international treaty — including the
commitment, formalized in Article 2(2) of the BIT, not to accord arbitrary treatment to
protected investments.

Having carefully reviewed the facts, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence that

Libya’s conduct regarding the extension of the bonds in any way breached its
commitments under Article 2(2) of the BIT.

VII. COMPENSATION

The Tribunal has reached the conclusion

that the Libyan army and militias controlled by the Libyan army caused physical
harm to Cengiz Libya’s Main Camps, looting machinery and equipment and
eventually taking control of the Sebha Main Camp, and

that Libya failed to provide any type of military, militia or police protection to the
Main Camps, facilitating that civilian mobs raided the installation.

This conduct, which is attributable to the Libyan state, led to the destruction of the Main
Camps and implies a breach of the positive and of the negative obligations of the FPS
standard provided for in Article 2(2) of the BIT.

In this section, the Tribunal must establish the compensation to which Claimant is
entitled for the damage which Libya’s international wrong caused to its investment.

The legal standard which the Tribunal must apply is not disputed by the Parties: it is the
principle of full reparation of the injury caused, firmly established in jurisprudence
since the PCI’s seminal Chorzow Factory decision“’. The PCI held that full
reparation was an essential and consistent principle of customary international law and
should be applied even in the absence of any specific provision setting forth an
indemnification obligation in the treaty underlying the dispute™”:

 

“It is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement
involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form. Reparation
therefore is the indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention,
and there is no necessity for this to be stated in the convention itself’

569. The principle of full reparation, as adopted by the Chorzow Factory decision, was

subsequently codified in the Draft ILC Articles.

570. Article 31 states the principle that the injury caused by internationally wrongful acts

must give rise to full reparation”

“1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for
the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.

2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the
internationally wrongful act of a State.”

As for monetary compensation, Article 36 provides further guidance™.

Al. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an
obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such
damage is not made good by restitution,

2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage
including loss of profits insofar as it is established.”

This understanding of the full reparation principle is constantly being reiterated by
investment tribunals — including cases where the investment was destroyed due to civil
war or military action.

In AAPL a shrimp farm belonging to a Sri Lankan enterprise partially owned by a
foreign investor was destroyed during a conflict between security forces and armed
rebels. Having found that Sri Lanka was in breach of the treaty, the tribunal concluded
that the amount of compensation should reflect the full value of the investment lost®”:

“[I]n case of property destruction, the amount of the compensation due has
to be calculated in a manner that adequately reflects the full value of the
investment lost as a result of said destruction and the damages incurred as a
result thereof.”

In AMT, a case where the Zairian armed forces destroyed property belonging to a
Zairian company owned by a foreign investor, the Tribunal came to a similar
conclusion":
“[T]hat in principle, it is necessary to assess the true value or the actual
market value of the properties destroyed or the losses suffered by AMT.”

Based on these principles, Claimant is claiming for three items of compensation’:

- First an order that Respondent pay monetary losses and damages suffered by Cengiz
in an amount of up to USD 302.6 M (1.);

Second, an order that these amounts bear interest (2.);

 

  

- Third, an order that Respondent release the existing bank guarantees in relation to
the WAH and Sebha Projects (3.).

LOSSES AND DAMAGES,

Claimant requested Mr. Chris Osborne, an economist working for FTI Consulting, to
prepare and submit an expert report assessing the losses and damages suffered by
Claimant. Mr. Osborne presented two extensive expert reports®” and a presentation®,
used as the basis for his expert testimony during the Hearing.

submitted two expert reports®’, and also used a presentation®® for his expert testimony
during the Hearing.

The Tribunal thanks the experts for the quality and independence of their advice.

Mr. Osborne used two alternative approaches to assess Cengiz’ losses:

- the first approach estimates the loss by reference to the Contracts (1.1), and

- the second, which is alternative to the first, by reference to the loss of value of the
shares of Claimant’s subsidiary in Libya, i.e. the company Cengiz Libya (1.2).

FIRST APPROACH: LOSS BY REFERENCE TO THE CONTRACTS.

Under this methodology, Mr. Osborne calculates the loss by adding two different
items”

The actual damage suffered by Cengiz, which is equal to its net investment in the
Projects (A.), plus

- The lost profit, the hypothetical profit which Cengiz would have realized if the
construction Projects had been finalized in accordance with the Contracts (B.).

Actual damage suffered by Claimant

The actual damage suffered by Cengiz is equal to its “net investment” (using: Mr.
Osborne’s terminology) or to its “sunk cost” (the expression preferred by Mr. Shopp).
Both terms refer to the same concept, the actual damage suffered by Cengiz as shown in
Cengiz’ accounts, The net investment is calculated by establishing

the overall amount spent on the Projects (spent directly by Cengiz or by providing
funding to Cengiz Libya), and then deducting

the amounts (i) paid by HIB to Cengiz Libya in the form of advance payments and
progress payments and (ii) then remitted to Cengiz (after payment of local costs in
Libya)’.

Mr. Shopp acknowledges. that Mr. Osborne has conducted a comprehensive analysis of
Cengiz’ cost accounting’” and both experts are in agreement regarding the basic
quantification of the net investment (or sunk cost), with only two points of
disagreement,

The agreement refers to the basic quantification of net investment: Mr. Osborne and Mr.
Shopp coincide that such figure equals USD 48 M™.

The disagreements refer to costs of bank guarantees (a.) and internal mark-up of
equipment (b.).

ICC Case 21537/ZFIAYZ

Cost of bank guarantees

One of the items which forms part of the net investment is the cost of maintaining the
bonds required under the Contracts. In Mr. Osborne’s opinion, the cost of the bank
guarantees through June 2018 should be included™', while Mr. Shopp was instructed’?
to exclude the costs accrued between 2017 and June 2018. The difference is USD 3.2
M.

The Tribunal without hesitation sides with Mr. Osborne.

This is so, as both experts agree that the costs of the bonds should be included in the
calculation. Mr. Osborne failed to include the 2017-2018 costs, simply because his
initial reports were issued in 2016. Costs have continued to accrue, and fairness requires
that these additional costs be added in.

Internal mark-up

Cengiz invested USD 50.2 M in its Libyan Projects, if the amount is calculated taking
the initial purchase price of machinery and equipment, and USD 73 M based on Cengiz*
resale price to Cengiz Libya, on terms reflecting their market value. Mr. Osborne
explains that Cengiz sold machines and equipment to Cengiz Libya at higher prices than
it initially paid for the purchases. This was because Cengiz had access to preferential
rates, and the addition of a mark-up was intended to result in a transfer value that
reflects normal market rates. Mr. Osborne estimates the mark-up on Cengiz’ costs for
the purchase of these machines and equipment at USD 22.7 M (the rounded-up
difference between USD 73.0 M minus USD 50.2 M)**.

Mr. Shopp disagrees, He says that the mark-up is not a sunk cost from Claimant's
perspective, as Cengiz did not actually spend that money out-of-pocket. Hi that he
considers the actual price paid in a real transaction between two parties is more
representative of market value than an internal accounting transfer that shows a 54%°°*
mark-up™”.

   

The Tribunal, after a careful evaluation of the situation, sides with Mr. Shopp and finds
that the internal-mark up should not be included.

The facts are as follows: Cengiz, one of the largest buyers of plant and equipment in the
world, was regularly able to buy at a discount to the official prices. Thus, it was able to
buy the plant and equipment used in the two Libyan Projects for USD 50.2 M. When
the plant equipment was sent to Cengiz Libya, its price was increased, applying an
internal mark-up of USD 22.7 M (a mark-up of 45%) — and the total figure (USD 73.0
M) was recorded in Cengiz’ accounts. Cengiz says that USD 73.0 M is the actual
market value of the plant and equipment.

The problem with Claimant’s argument is that there is no evidence whatsoever that the
mark-up is correct. No proof has been marshalled showing that Cengiz is routinely able
to buy from its suppliers at reduced prices; there is no indication of the range of
discounts Cengiz is able to extract. In the absence of any evidence, the 45% mark-up

seems to be a rough over-the-thumb calculation made by Cengiz’ accounting
department.

Confronted with a figure which is the actual amount paid by Cengiz to its suppliers
(USD 50.2 M), and a figure which is totally unsupported, the Tribunal feels more
comfortable with the first.

ea

Summing up, the Tribunal concludes that the actual damage suffered by Claimant and
caused by Respondent's breach of the commitments assumed under the BIT amounts to
USD 51.2 M (the sum of USD 48 M plus USD 3.2 M).

Lost profits

Claimant says that, to properly evaluate Cengiz’ loss, it is necessary to add to the actual
damage suffered (USD 51.2 M in the Tribunal’s calculation) the lost profits, ie. the
profits that Cengiz would have realized if Cengiz had been able to carry out its work
under the two Contracts.

Mr. Osborne has made an assessment of this profit and comes to a figure of USD 198
M. His calculation assumes that both projects together would yield a revenue of USD
650 M, and that Cengiz would be able to make a profit margin of 30.5% (and 30.5%
applied to USD 650 M results in USD 198 M)**”.

Respondent disagrees. Mr. Shopp says that the profits calculated by Mr. Osborne are
not accurately or reliably forecasted and are highly speculative. In his opinion the most
likely outcome is that the Projects would have failed, when confronted with the
economic challenges and business risks in Libya after the Libyan Revolution™™.

In his opinion lost profits are zero”.

Discussion

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent.

The starting point of the Tribunal’s analysis is Article 36 (2) of the Draft ILC Articles:

“Article 36 Compensation

1[...]

 

2 The compensation shall cover any financially as le damage including
loss of profit insofar as it is ed.” [Emphasis added]

   

 

The provision recognizes that in certain cases compensation for loss of profit may be
appropriate — provided that the expected profit “is established”. As the Commentary to
the Draft ILC Articles explains,

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

“(In other cases, lost profits have been excluded on the basis that they were
not sufficiently established as a legally protected interest”*”.

In AAPL a claim for lost profits by a newly established business was rejected for lack of
evidence of established earnings. The tribunal stated that “according to a well-
established rule of international law”, the assessment of prospective profits requires the
proof that

“they were reasonably anticipated; and that the profits were probable and not
merely possible”>”",

The Tribunal, after carefully reviewing the available evidence, concludes that Claimant
has failed to prove, that the profits could reasonably be anticipated, and that they were
probable and not merely possible.

The Tribunal’s opinion is based on the following arguments:

First, Claimant, although a highly successful Turkish construction company, had no
prior experience nor track-record in Libya — a difficult and risky environment even
under the Gaddafi regime. In the International Country Risk Guide Libya was ranked
from 93" to 97" out of 140 countries during the period of 2008-2010 (i.e. before the
Libyan Revolution)”.

Cengiz had ventured into Iraq in 2008 and had had a negative experience — it suffered
an average loss in its Iraqi projects of -9.3% *”

The assumption that in its Libyan projects Cengiz would reach a positive profit margin
of 30.5% on turnover is unsupported by the Iraqi experience and highly speculative
given the Libyan political environment.

Second, the Projects were at an early stage. Construction work was only 9% complete in
the WAH Project and 12% at Sebha’”*,

 

There is no evidence that this initial construction had been completed at a profit. The
assumption that the remaining 91% and 88% of the work could be successfully
completed and could earn a 30.5% margin is again unsupported by the construction
activity already performed and highly speculative.

Third, in February 2011 the scope of work was still under discussion between HIB and
Cengiz Libya. The estimated prices per hectare in the WAH and in the Sebha Projects
were found to have been significantly understated in the initial calculations, and HIB
was therefore confronted with the choice of either continuing work on the basis of the
original, budget, reducing the scope of work, or to increase the project’s overall
budget”.

The discussions regarding scope reinforce the uncertainties surrounding both
Projects*”®

Fourth, the two Projects were in remote locations in the Southern Region and faced
higher than average risks — even in the context of Libya. The WAH Project and the
Sebha Project came with revenue premiums of 17.4% and 15% respectively. These
premiums were meant to incentive contractors to pursue projects in remote areas, and
prove that the Libyan authorities also considered the Projects as high risk ventures*”’.

 

Fifth, after the Libyan Revolution the economic and business conditions in Libya
worsened. Security decreased. Inflation set in. Economic output declined

The over-all situation of the country would also impact on the two Projects. There
would be difficulties in receiving supplies, increased costs due to worsened security,
increased labour costs and delays in performance. It is unrealistic to assume that during
a period of high economic and political uncertainty, Cengiz would have been able to
extract a 30.5% profit margin from its Libyan construction Projects.

 

Using publicly available information Mr. Shopp has reviewed 12 construction projects
in Libya, where construction companies resumed work after the Libyan Revolution (or
planned to do so). His conclusion is that 11 out of the 12 projects have been suspended,
cancelled or remain unfinished by the end of 2017579. There is a high chance that
Cengiz’ Projects would have suffered a similar fate.

Summing up, the Tribunal concludes that Cengiz’ loss of profit claim is highly
speculative. The evidence proves that it is unlikely that Cengiz would have been able to
successfully conclude the Projects as foreseen in the Contracts, and extremely unlikely
that Cengiz would be able to clinch a 30.5% rate of profit from the Contracts.

 

SECOND APPROACH: LOSS OF VALUE,

Claimant submits a second, subsidiary methodology to assess the damage. The failure to
protect Cengiz’ investment has meant that Cengiz Libya is essentially valueless. The
alternative measure of Cengiz’ loss is the market value of the shares in Cengiz Libya
when its investment was impaired — in August 2011. The market value of Cengiz
Libya’s shares corresponds to the present value of its expected future cash flows at the
time of the breach. Using a standard DCF analysis, albeit in simplified form, Mr.
Osborne estimates the value of Cengiz Libya at approximately USD 302 M — and this is
the amount alternatively claimed by Cengi giz

 

  

 

Mr. Shopp disagrees. He says that a DCF valuation based on the forecast of future cash
flows must be disregarded for the same reasons which support that loss of profit be
excluded from the calculation of damages. In his opinion the value of Cengiz Libya as

57 The conclusion is independent of the fact that Mr. Osborne (correctly) calculates his loss of profit on
the value of the original Contracts — Osborne I, para. 4.3.
577 Shopp IL, para. 67.

578

The Tribunal notes that in the determination of loss of profit, the actual factual situation as it

developed after the breach must be taken in consideration. In DCF valuations the situation may be
different.

of August 30, 2011 was USD 49.2 M, based on the net book value of machinery and
equipment™!,

Discussion
The Tribunal again agrees with Mr. Shopp.

Valuations based on the DCF method have become usual in investment arbitrations,
whenever the fair market value of an enterprise must be established. The Tribunal
agrees that, where the circumstances for its use are appropriate, forward looking DCF
has advantages over other, more backwards looking valuation methods.

DCF, however, cannot be applied to all types of circumstances, and while in certain
enterprises it returns meaningful valuations, in other cases it is inappropriate. The
tribunal in Rusoro has provided a list of criteria which a company must meet for its
DCF valuation to be relevant:

“DCF works properly if all, or at least a significant part, of the following
criteria are met:

~ The enterprise has an established historical record of financial performance;

- There are reliable projections of its future cash flow, ideally in the form of a
detailed business plan adopted in tempore insuspecto, prepared by the
company’s officers and verified by an impartial expert;

- The price at which the enterprise will be able to sell its products or services
can be determined with reasonable certainty;

- The business plan can be financed with self-generated cash, or, if additional
cash is required, there must be no uncertainty regarding the availability of
financing;

- It is possible to calculate a meaningful WACC, including a reasonable
country risk premium, which fairly represents the political risk in the host
country;

~ The enterprise is active in a sector with low regulatory pressure, or, if the
regulatory pressure is high, its scope and effects must be predictable; it should
be possible to establish the impact of regulation on future cash flows with a
minimum of certainty."

Cengiz Libya does not meet most of these requirements:

- Cengiz Libya has no established record of financial performance — the Projects are
the first business activity which the company carries out;

- There are no reliable projections of future cash flows: the same reasons which make
the estimation of loss of profits highly speculative, also undermine the reliability of

the cash flow projections; Mr. Osborne uses a cash flow margin of 34,5%, which in
fact is the profit margin of 30.5% adjusted to account for cash elements”;

It is impossible to calculate a meaningful WACC; Mr. Osborne proposes a WACC
of 15%, including a risk premium of 11%; but the 11% is based on Prof.
Damodaran’s estimate for Libya, and does not take into consideration the political
and war risk after the Libyan Revolution — a risk which is difficult to properly reflect
in a country risk premium.

Finally, there is, like in all valuations, an element of common sense. It seems highly
unlikely that in August 2011 any informed buyer would have been willing to pay more
than USD 300 M for the shareholding of Cengiz Libya, a company with a net book
value of USD 49.2 M and whose book of contracts was limited to two construction
projects in a remote region of Libya, which were still in their initial stages.

ee

In summary, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Shopp’s valuation of Cengiz Libya, based on
net book value, is to be preferred to a DCF approach. The net book value of Cengiz
Libya at the relevant time was USD 49.2 M, and the Tribunal concludes that the loss
suffered by Cengiz, under this alternative methodology, equals this amount.

‘The Tribunal has already established in Section 1.1A that the actual damage suffered by
Cengiz amounted to USD 51.2 M (under Claimant’s preferred methodology of
calculating loss by reference to the Contracts).

Under the alternative methodology analyzed in this section, the result is very close:
USD 49.2 M. The similarity of results reinforces the Tribunal’s confidence in the
accurateness of its calculation.

Since Claimant’s principal case is that loss should be calculated by reference to the
Contracts, while the calculation based on loss of value of Cengiz Libya is submitted as
an alternative, the Tribunal will give preference to the first calculation and award a
compensation of USD 51.2 M.

INTEREST

Parties have devoted little attention to the question of interest. In its first post-hearing
brief Claimant simply reiterates its request that amounts awarded should bear interest of
“USD 6 month LIBOR + 2% from | September 2011 until full payment”™.
Respondent’s position was briefly described in_ its Rejoinder™’: Libya said that
Claimant had not provided any basis for the application of LIBOR, and that
alternatively “a lower rate applied to more accurately reflect the low rates of borrowing
(e.g. the Bank of England Base Rate)” should accrue.

The BIT

The BIT provides a rule for the application of interest in cases of expropriation:

2.1
3 In the event that payment of compensation is delayed, it shall carry an
interest at a rate to be agreed upon by both parties, unless such rate is
prescribed by law from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.
In absence for any provision in the BIT regulating interest for other types of
compensation, the Tribunal finds that Article 4(3) does not prevent the Tribunal from
deciding this issue and can be applied by analogy.
Article 4(3) of the BIT provides three rules:
- That interest shall accrue on compensation due to the investor,

- That such interest shall accrue from the date of the international wrong,

- And that the rate of interest shall be agreed by the parties (unless prescribed by law
— something which has not been argued).

Discussion

In accordance with this rule, and the Parties’ claims and arguments, the Tribunal
decides:

(i) Compensation awarded in this Award shall accrue simple interest in favour of
Claimant.

(ii) The dies a quo shall be September 1, 2011, the date proposed by Claimant and not
disputed by Respondent, which coincides with the breach committed by Libya.

(iii) The dies ad quem shall be the date of effective payment.

(iv) The BIT does not impose any interest rate — it simply refers to the rate of interest
agreed by the Parties.

The Parties have not reached an agreement, Claimant proposing USD LIBOR,
Respondent the Bank of England Base Rate. In the absence of agreement, it is for the
Tribunal to establish the rate.

The Tribunal sides with Claimant.

The Bank of England Base Rate is a domestic UK rate, inappropriate for an
international debt expressed in USD.

LIBOR, on the other side, is an international benchmark: the interest rate at which
banks can borrow funds from other banks in the London market. LIBOR is published
daily for different maturities and currencies and is universally accepted as a valid
reference for the calculation of variable rates*®, Since the compensation is expressed in
USD, the appropriate rate should be the LIBOR rate for six months deposits

denominated in USD. The initial rate shall be established as of the dies a quo, and shall
be adjusted every six-months thereafter, to reflect changing conditions’,

LIBOR reflects the interest rate at which banks lend to each other money. Loans to
customers invariably include a surcharge, and this surcharge must be inserted in the
calculation of interest to reflect the financial loss caused to Claimant by the temporary
withholding of money. Claimant is requesting a 2% surcharge, and the Tribunal finds
the request appropriate.

(v) The principal amount on which interest accrues shall be the compensation awarded
in this Decision: USD 51,200,000 plus Arbitration Costs**,

RELEASE OF BANK GUARANTEES

In its PHB, Claimant repeats its request that Respondent release (or orders HIB_to
release) the existing bank guarantees in relation to the WAH and Sebha Projects™”.
Respondent does not seem to have objected to this claim.

The Tribunal has already established that it must apply the principle of full reparation of
the injury caused, as defined in the Charzow Factory decision. The PCI held, in a well-
known and often cited passage

 

 

“that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the
illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have
existed if the act had not been committed”*””.

 

  

In the present case, the compensation awarded to Claimant includes the cost of
maintaining the bonds until 2018, and implicitly assumes that no additional costs and
commissions will accrue thereafter.

But it is a fact that at least two bonds, the Sebha Performance and the Sebha AP Bond
still in force, and that Respondent could insist on the renewal of these bonds by
ing “pay or extend” orders.

 

 

 

The purpose of compensation is to wipe out all consequences of the international wrong
committed by the delinquent State. To achieve this aim, it is necessary that the Tribunal
orders, as Claimant requests, that all existing bank guarantees relating to WAH and
Sebha Projects be released — otherwise Claimant could be forced to incur additional
costs and expenses and the consequences of the breach would not be fully “wiped out”.

This conclusion is not contradicted by the Tribunal’s finding that the Contracts have not
been terminated and are still in force. If at any time the Protocols are reactivated, before
resuming construction Cengiz Libya will have to re-establish the bonds as required by
the Contracts.

IX. costs

Each Party has requested a decision on the costs of the arbitration [“Arbitration
Costs”).

Arbitration Costs are composed of:

- Fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the ICC administrative expenses fixed by
the Court [the “Administrative Costs”]; and

Reasonable legal and other costs incurred by the Parties for the arbitration [the
“Legal Expenses”’]

Art. 37 of the ICC Rules provides as follows”

“1, The costs of the arbitration shall include the fees and expenses of the
arbitrators and the ICC administrative expenses fixed by the Court, in
accordance with the scale in force at the time of the commencement of the
arbitration, as well as the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the
arbitral tribunal and the reasonable legal and other costs incurred by the
parties for the arbitration. [...]

4. The final award shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the
parties shall bear them or in what proportion they shall be borne by the parties.

5. In making decisions as to costs, the arbitral tribunal may take into account
such circumstances as it considers relevant, including the extent to which each
party has d the arbi in an and ffective
manner”.

 

Art. 37 of the ICC Rules provides that the final award shall fix the costs of the
arbitration, which include the Legal Fees and the Administrative Costs, authorizes the
Tribunal to establish the “reasonable” amount of the Legal Fees, and gives the Tribunal
ample discretion to decide how to allocate these items.

The Tribunal will start by establishing how to allocate the Legal Expenses (1.) and will
then turn to the Administrative Costs (2.).

LEGAL EXPENSES

Claimant has requested that its Legal Expenses be reimbursed. Said Legal Expenses
amount to USD 1,143,177.78 and EUR 1,113,631.47, comprised of:

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

Libya, improving the lot of the population. The Tribunal does not wish to disrupt any
possible resumption of commercial relations by imposing costs on the losing party.

In conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that each Party shall assume its own Legal
Expenses.

The Tribunal notes that there is an item of EUR 66,410.39 for hearing organization
expenses which must be borne equally by both Parties, since both benefited from
such procedural step and should have paid for such expenses in equal parts as provided
in para. 23 of PO No. 2. However, Claimant solely bore the hearing expenses. Thus, the
Tribunal decides that Respondent must reimburse Claimant in the amount of EUR
33,205.20, equivalent to its share of the hearing organizational expenses.

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

 

The Administrative Costs were fixed by the Court at its session of October 25, 2018 at
USD 939,400.

‘The Coutt initially fixed the advance on costs at USD 650,000603 and later readjusted it
to USD 985,000.

Article 36(2) of the ICC Rules provides that:

“[...] The advance on costs fixed by the Court pursuant to this Article 36(2)
shall be payable in equal shares by the claimant and the respondent”.

‘The advance on costs were paid entirely by Claimant, thus it requests a reimbursement
of the entire amount.

The Tribunal has already explained the reasons why it is not persuaded to follow the
costs follow the event approach; however, since Respondent did not pay its 50% share
of the Administrative Costs, it is only fair for it to do so now, as mandated by Article
36(2) of the ICC Rules. Thus, the Tribunal decides that Respondent must reimburse
Claimant in the amount of USD 469,700, equivalent to its share of the Administrative
Costs.

INTEREST

 

Claimant has requested that interest be applied “on all sums awarded to Claimant” ®*.

And the Tribunal agrees.
‘The Tribunal has already decided that the compensation awarded to Cengiz shall accrue
simple interest at a LIBOR rate for six months deposits denominated in USD plus a 2%

surcharge,

The same shall be applied to the amounts that Respondent is ordered to reimburse as
costs, but applying LIBOR denominated in EUR to the amount in Euros.

The dies a quo shall be the date of issuance of this award.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

X. SUMMARY

The dispute brought before the Tribunal required that the Tribunal decide on
Respondent's Jurisdiction and Admissibility Objections (1.), on the breach of
Respondent's obligations under the BIT (2.) and on the compensation owed to Claimant
plus interest and costs (3.).

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY
Respondent submitted the following four Jurisdictional Objections:

- That Claimant had not proven that it made an investment under Article 1(2) of the
BIT;

That Libya did not have sole jurisdiction over its territory when the BIT entered into
force;

That Claimant was not an investor under the Treaty;

That the alleged investment was not made in accordance with Libyan law.
Respondent further submitted that the claims were inadmissible because:
- Claimant’s claim was estopped; and

~ Claimant did not respect the 90-day cooling-off period provided in Article 8(2) of
the Treaty.

The Tribunal sided with Claimant in all Jurisdictional and Admissibility Objections and
found that:

Claimant proved that it was a 65% majority shareholder (entitled to 100% of the
revenue stream and of the net worth) of a Libyan company called Cengiz Libya,
which qualifies as an investment for the purposes of Article 1(2) of the BIT;

the jurisdiction over the Libyan territory remained with the Libyan State at all times,
even during the enforcement of Resolution 1973;

- Claimant is an investor under the Treaty since it is a Turkish corporation, with an
investment in Libya;

- Respondent did not prove that Claimant’s investment was not made in accordance
with Libyan Law;

Claimant was not estopped from bringing the present claims against Respondent; and

= Cengiz. was entitled to exercise its right to commence arbitration proceedings under
Article 8 of the BIT.

MERITS
Claimant’s main claim was that the State of Libya breached Articles 2(2), 3G), 4 and 5

of the Treaty in its relationship with Cengiz, that is to say, that the State of Libya
breached the standards of FPS, FET and the War Clause under the BIT.

ICC Case 21537/ZF/AYZ

The Tribunal first clarified that Article 5 of the BIT does not cover the same subject
matter as Article 2(2), and that both provisions are independent, and create separate
obligations for the host State. The Arbitral Tribunal concluded that under Article 2(2)
the State is obliged to provide FPS to protected investments. On the other hand, Article
5 creates a separate duty: if the State accords measures to protect its own investors or
investors of a third party to compensate losses from war or civil disturbances, such
treatment must be extended to the investor protected by the BIT.

  

The Tribunal then found that Libya did breach the positive and negative obligations of
the FPS standard provided for in Article 2(2) of the BIT, because:

the Libyan army and militias controlled by the Libyan army caused physical harm to
Cengiz Libya’s Main Camps, looting machinery and equipment and eventually
taking control of the Sebha Main Camp, and

- Libya failed to provide any type of military, militia or police protection to the Main
Camps, facilitating that civilian mobs raided the installation.

However, the Arbitral Tribunal dismissed Cengiz’ claims for violation of FET and the
War Clause.

The Arbitral Tribunal decided that:

Claimant was unable to prove that it had suffered discriminatory conduct;

the facts did not support a violation of Claimants legitimate expectations under the
2013 Protocols; and

- there is no evidence that Libya’s conduct regarding the extension of the bonds was
arbitrary or in any way breached its commitments under Article 2(2) of the BIT.

As regards the War Clause, the Tribunal found that Claimant had not proven that any

contractor in a comparable situation was accorded a treatment which was more
favourable than that granted to Cengiz.

QUANTUM

Cengiz claimed the following:

USD 302.6 M in compensation for its losses and damages arising from Libya’s
breaches of the Treaty;

- interest ata LIBOR USD 6 month + 2% from 1 September 2011 until full payment;

an order that Respondent release or order HIB to release the existing bank guarantees
in relation to the WAH and Sebha Projects;

 

- an order that Respondent reimburse all costs and expenses incurred by Claimant in
connection with the preparation and conduct of these arbitration proceedings; and

 

- interest on all sums awarded to Cengiz.
The Tribunal concluded that the proper compensation due to Cengiz under the BIT

amounts to USD 51,200,000. Additionally, the Tribunal decided to award Cengiz
simple interest on the amount of compensation at LIBOR rate for six months deposits

denominated in USD plus a 2% surcharge, to accrue from September 1, 2011 until the
date of full and actual payment.

The Arbitral Tribunal further ordered Respondent to release all existing bank guarantees
relating to WAH and Sebha Projects be released.

Finally, the Tribunal decided that the Arbitration Costs shall be borne equally by both
Parties, and that each Party shall bear its own Legal Expenses. However, since Claimant
paid in full the Administrative Costs and the hearing costs, Respondent must reimburse
Claimant for its share of the Administrative Costs and hearing expenses, which amount
to USD 469,700 and EUR 33,205.20, respectively.

 

Additionally, the Tribunal has found that Respondent must pay interest over such
amounts in favour of Claimant as follows:

- USD 469,700: simple interest at a LIBOR rate for six months deposits denominated
in USD with a 2% surcharge, accrued from the date of issuance of the award until
the date of effective payment; and

  

- EUR 33,205.20: simple interest at a LIBOR rate for six months deposits
denominated in EUR with a 2% surcharge, accrued from the date of issuance of the
award until the date of effective payment.
