L INTRODUCTION

1. This case concerns a dispute arising out of the Claimants’ alleged interest in the Gemerska

Poloma talc deposit located in the KoSice region of the Slovak Republic.

2. The Claimants have submitted this dispute to arbitration under the auspices of the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) on the basis of: (a)
the Treaty between the United States of America and the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, which
entered into force on 19 December 1992 (the “US-Slovakia BIT”);' (b) the Agreement
between Canada and the Slovak Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments,
which entered into force on 14 March 2012 (the “Canada-Slovakia BIT”);? and (c) the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of

Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

A. Parties

3. The claimants are EuroGas Inc. (“EuroGas”), a company incorporated under the laws of
the state of Utah, United States, and Belmont Resources Inc. (“Belmont”), a company

incorporated under the laws of Canada (together, the “Claimants”).

4. EuroGas was incorporated on 15 November 2005 and has its registered office at 3098
South Highland Drive, Suite 323, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84106-6001. According to the
Claimants, EuroGas is a continuation of another company named EuroGas Inc. that was
incorporated in 1985 and administratively dissolved in 2001.3 The Director of EuroGas is

Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, a national of Germany.

1 US-Slovakia BIT (C-1).

? Canada-Slovakia BIT (C-2).

3 The Respondent refers to the Claimant EuroGas as “EuroGas II” and the previous company as “EuroGas I,” whereas
the Claimants refer to the Claimant EuroGas as “EuroGas” and the previous company as the “1985 Company.” As
noted below, the Tribunal uses the terms “EuroGas I” and “EuroGas II” in parts of this Award. The use of this
terminology in this Award is without prejudice to, and in no way reflects, the Tribunal’s understanding of any issue
disputed by the Parties.

 

 

 

Belmont was constituted on 18 January 1978. Its corporate head office is located at 625

Howe Street, Suite 600, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 2T6.

The respondent is the Slovak Republic (also referred to as the “Respondent”), which
became an independent State on 1 January 1993. The Respondent has been an ICSID

Contracting State since 26 June 1994.

Factual Background

The following summary is intended to provide a general overview of the factual
background to the dispute between the Parties. It is not intended to be an exhaustive
description of all facts considered relevant by the Tribunal. Further factual material will be

addressed in the context of the Tribunal’s analysis of the issues in dispute below.

(wD The Gemerska Poloma Talc Deposit

The Gemerska Poloma talc deposit, located in the KoSice region of the Slovak Republic,
is among the largest talc deposits in the world.* The existence of talc in the area was first
discovered in 1988 by the Czechoslovakian State-owned entity Geologicky prieskum 8.p.,
Spi’ské Nova Ves (“GPS”) while performing exploration works in search of tin.> The
quality of the talc deposit was confirmed by additional exploration boreholes drilled

between 1988 and 1992.°

In order to carry out additional exploration, GPS formally applied to the Slovak Ministry
of Environment for the assignment of the exploration area, and its application was granted

on 16 April 1993.7

10. On 21 May 1993, the Ministry of the Environment issued a “Certificate of Exclusive
Mineral Deposit” on the basis of a notice filed by GPS.* This Certificate designated the
Gemerska Poloma deposit as an “exclusive deposit” based on an exploration report
showing that “[e]merging from the mineral deposit is a vein of the highest quality talc.”°

11. By that time, the Slovak Government had begun to seek private capital from foreign
investors to develop the deposit.!° In 1992, the Government entered into discussions with
Gebriider Dorfner GmbH & Co. Kaolin-und Kristallquarzsand-Werke KG (“Dorfner”), a
large German mining company.'' On 18 June 1993, GPS and Dorfner executed a letter of
intent to establish an association for the funding and execution of a geological survey of

the deposit. !

12. On 28 February 1994, GPS, Dorfner, and two Slovak companies (HELL, spol. s.r.o., and
MR Trading, a.s.) entered into a Contract of Association. '* The parties agreed to assess the
deposit, to prepare a feasibility study for its future commercial exploitation and, if this

study yielded positive results, to incorporate a Slovak mining company to exploit the

deposit.'*

13. Dorfner subcontracted the German group Thyssen Schachtbau GmbH (“Thyssen”) and its
Austrian subsidiary OSTU Industriemineral Consult GmbH (“OSTU”) to perform a

technical evaluation of the deposit for the feasibility study.!

14. According to the Claimants, although GPS remained involved, Dorfner was the “driving
force behind the project.”'® The Claimants submit that the Respondent chose not to engage
in talc exploration and financed the drilling of only one borehole after 1993.'7 The
Respondent asserts that its work on the deposit continued, and the results of that work were
set out ina final report on 31 March 1995 (the “1995 Kilik Report”).'* By then, according
to the Respondent, it had fully financed 15 boreholes.!°

15. Under Article 24(1) of the Act No. 44/1988 on Protection and Utilization of Mineral
Resources (the “Mining Act”), an organization’s right to excavate an exclusive deposit
arises when the District Mining Office assigns the excavation area to it.”? On 25 July 1996,
the District Mining Office in Spi8ské Nova Ves (the “DMO”) assigned a 4,965 square km
mining area of the Gemerska Poloma deposit (the “Mining Area”)! to GPS’s successor

entity,” Geologicka sluzba SR (“Geological Survey”).”>

16. In February 1997, Dorfner, Thyssen, and OSTU completed the feasibility study (the
“Feasibility Study”). The Feasibility Study estimated the quantity of talc in the western
side of the Mining Area to be 28.9 million tons of talc and approximately 9 million tons of
mineralized rock containing more than 40% of talc. It identified an area of high expected

tale concentration where the deposit was planned to be opened.” The results were positive,

but the conceptual nature of the Feasibility Study meant that these findings would need to

be confirmed and further assessment and mapping performed.”°

(2) Establishment of Rozmin

Rozmin s.r.o. (“Rozmin’”) was incorporated under the laws of the Slovak Republic on 7
May 1997.7’ At its founding, Rozmin was owned by Dorfner (32.5%), Thyssen (through
its subsidiary OSTU) (24.5%), and the Slovak company RimaMurdii _ s.r.0.
(‘RimaMurait”) (43%).

Immediately upon its incorporation, Rozmin applied to the DMO for a general mining
authorization pursuant to Article 4a of the Mining Act. The DMO issued this authorization
on 14 May 1997 (the “General Mining Authorization”).”° It was valid for an indefinite
period and allowed Rozmin to carry out mining activities on exclusive deposits in the
Slovak Republic subject to its compliance with other statutory and regulatory

requirements.*°

On 5 June 1997, the DMO approved the transfer of the Mining Area from Geological
Survey to Rozmin. Geological Survey and Rozmin then entered into an “Agreement for
the Transfer of the Gemerské Poloma Mining Area” dated June 11, 1997 (the “Transfer
Agreement”).*! The transfer was certified by the DMO on 24 June 1997.°?

The Transfer Agreement provided inter alia that “all rights and obligations concerning this
mining area shall be transferred on to the acquirer.” Accordingly, Rozmin was bound by

the terms of the original assignment of the Mining Area to Geological Survey under the

Decision of 25 July 1996. The Respondent argues that these terms included a requirement
that the assignee “open[] works at the deposit Gemerska Poloma ... not later than on 31
July 1998.” The Claimants accept that the decision “arguably contained” this requirement
but contend that it in no way makes the validity of the assignment conditional upon works

starting by that date.*4

(3) Rozmin’s Initial Activities

21. Throughout 1997, Rozmin secured various required licences and authorizations. It
obtained, for example, a Trade License for the performance of mining activities, *° written
consents from the Ministry of Health*® and other state entities, and a Decision on the
Assignment of an Exploration Area from the Ministry of the Environment, assigning to

Rozmin an additional exploration area nearby the Mining Area.*”
22. Rozmin also purchased the Feasibility Study from Thyssen and Dorfner.**

23. At the same time, Rozmin and its shareholders were seeking investors to finance the next
phase of the project.*? As part of these efforts, it consulted the German State-owned
company Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft GmbH (“DEG”). DEG
commissioned an independent review of the Feasibility Study, and the final report was
issued in January 1998 (“the DEG Report”), concluding that the project was viable and

profitable.*° However, DEG ultimately decided not to invest.

24. In early 1998, Rozmin submitted to the DMO its proposed “Plan for the Opening,
Preparation, and Excavation of the Deposit” to be performed during 1998-2002.*! This

plan was a prerequisite to beginning mining operations at the Mining Area.

25. On 16 March 1998, EuroGas I became an indirect shareholder in Rozmin when its wholly
owned subsidiary EuroGas GmbH purchased 55% of the shares of RimaMurai, which held
a 43% shareholding interest in Rozmin.* As part of the share transfer agreements, EuroGas

GmbH agreed to finance RimaMurai’s share of Rozmin’s financing and operating costs.

26. On 29 May 1998, the DMO issued an authorization for Rozmin to perform mining activities
(the “Authorization of Mining Activities”), which allowed Rozmin to undertake mining

original assignment of the Mining Area.**

27. Rozmin then mandated the State-owned company Rudny projekt a.s. (“Rudny”) to design
the construction works necessary for the opening of the deposit, and Rudny completed the

project design in October 1998.4

28. Between mid-1998 and the end of 1999, Rozmin secured numerous official approvals,

permits and leases that would allow it to begin construction works.*°

29. In the area of exploration, by April 1999, Rozmin had drilled seven boreholes.*° On the
basis of the data from these wells, Rozmin commissioned a 3D model of the Extraction
Area from Technical Bureau DI Skacel & Kloibhofer OEG (the “Kloibhofer Report”).*”
Rozmin also engaged ARP/ECV Ges.m.b.H. to produce three reports to verify the quality
of the talc and identify the most efficient method of processing the raw material extracted

from the deposit.**

30. In light of the facts stated above, the Parties disagree regarding the status of the project in
2000. According to the Claimants, by 2000, “any uncertainties regarding the commercial
and financial viability of the reserves in the Extraction area had been wiped out: the deposit
had been de-risked.”*? Further, Rozmin had secured all necessary permits and also had

carried out substantial topographic and mapping works and geological cuts.”

31. On the other hand, the Respondent points out that Rozmin had failed to perform any surface
construction or opening works. According to the Respondent, Rozmin had also failed to

de-risk the project “because, due to the folding and faulting of the deposit, the reserves of

tale could be reliably established only through underground drilling within the deposit.”*!

Therefore, “the project remained almost entirely in the exploration stage.”*?

(4) Change in Rozmin’s Ownership and Initial Works

32. In early 2000, Dorfner and OSTU, two of the original shareholders in Rozmin, decided to
exit the project. On 24 February 2000, Belmont bought Dorfner’s 32.5% ownership of

the purchase, Rozmin was owned 57% by Belmont and 43% by RimaMurai.

33. On 17 June 2000, Rozmin initiated a tender for completion of the construction works based
on the project design prepared by Rudny. A number of companies submitted bids, including
RimaMurai, which was awarded the work. On 22 September 2000, Rozmin and
RimaMurai entered into a contract entitled “Agreement on Commission of Works on: ‘The

Opening of the Talc Deposit Gemerské Poloma’.”**

34. The DMO was notified of the commencement of works on 25 September 2000. By the end
of 2000, RimaMurai had completed the construction of 90% of the planned surface
construction.*° However, various disputes over payment arose between RimaMuraii and
Rozmin, eventually leading to a suspension of works.*° On 15 October 2001, Rozmin

notified the DMO of the suspension of mining activities.*”

(5) 2002 Amendment to the Mining Act

35. The Slovak Parliament passed an amendment to the Mining Act that took effect on
1 January 2002 (the “2002 Amendment”).** For the Respondent, this development is
critical because Section 27(12) of the 2002 Amendment placed a new rule on entities to
which an excavation area is assigned: if such an entity does not begin excavation of the
deposit within three years after the assignment, or if excavation is interrupted for more than

three years, the DMO will cancel the excavation area or reassign it to a different entity.*°

the three-year rule would apply to inactivity taking place after the effective date of the 2002
Amendment (1 January 2002).

(6) Rozmin’s Activities 2002-2004

38. Following RimaMurai’s exit from the project in 2001, EuroGas GmbH offered to purchase
RimaMurai’s 43% equity interest in Rozmin in exchange for payment of RimaMuraii’s
debt.°! This transaction was concluded on 26 March 2002. In exchange for the equity in
Rozmin, EuroGas GmbH transferred its 55% ownership interest in RimaMurai back to
RimaMurai’s four founding shareholders and agreed to pay off RimaMuran’s debt from

the project.

39. On 5 September 2002, Rozmin applied to the DMO for an extension of the Authorization
of Mining Activities, a process which required various statements of approval and a new
Plan for the Opening, Preparation, Development, and Exploitation. The DMO closed the
procedure for extension, allowing the Authorization of Mining Activities to lapse, on the
basis that Rozmin had failed to submit the necessary documents.°? However, after Rozmin
appealed to the Main Mining Office (the “MMO”), the DMO reopened the procedure.
Eventually, after further written exchanges and an oral hearing, the DMO, on 31 May 2004,

extended Rozmin’s Authorization of Mining Activities until 13 November 2006.°

40. In June 2004, Rozmin initiated a tender for a contractor to resume the opening works. The
Slovak company Siderit s.r.o. Nizna Slana (“Siderit”) was selected, and on 5 November
2004, Rozmin and Siderit entered into a Contract for Work.® On 8 November 2004,

Rozmin notified the DMO that it would resume mining activities within ten days.”

41. On 8 December 2004, the Director of the DMO, Mr. Antonin Baffi, carried out an
inspection at the Gemerska Poloma talc deposit, determining that “no facts were discovered

indicating breach of legal regulations in force.”°*

(7) Reassignment of the Mining Area

42. On 30 December 2004, the Slovak Business Journal, under the heading “Decisions and
notices of state bodies,” announced that the DMO was initiating a new tender procedure

for the assignment of the Mining Area.

43. The DMO notified Rozmin of this procedure by letter of 3 January 2005.”° The letter stated
that the DMO was undertaking this action pursuant to Section 27(12) of the 2002
Amendment because mining activity at the Mining Area lapsed between 1 October 2001

and 18 November 2004, more than three years.

44. The DMO held the tender procedure on 21 April 2005 and received bids from seven
companies.’! The tender was awarded to the Slovak company Economy Agency RV s.r.0.
(‘Economy Agency”). Economy Agency was founded and owned by Ms. Zdenka

shareholder of RimaMurai.’* On 3 May 2005, the DMO wrote to Rozmin and Economy

Agency confirming the assignment of the Mining Area to Economy Agency.

On 3 November 2005, Mr. Vojtech Agyagos, in his capacity as an executive of Rozmin
and as the President and CEO of Belmont, wrote to the Slovak Minister of Economy to
complain that the reassignment of the Mining Area was “unlawful, non-standard and made
on purpose”; he referred to potential proceedings under “international treaties on mutual
support and protection of investments (because the shareholders of Rozmin a.s.ro. are

foreign companies)”.”°

In December 2005, VSK Mining s.r.o. (“WSK Mining”) became the sole shareholder of
Economy Agency and then, in February 2006, absorbed the company.”

(8) Proceedings in the Slovak Republic

After being informed of the reassignment of the Mining area, Rozmin initiated local
proceedings to challenge the DMO’s action, ultimately resulting in three Supreme Court

judgments.

On 27 September 2005, Rozmin brought the first challenge before the Regional Court in
KoSice (the “Regional Court”). Rozmin sought a revision of the DMO’s decision of 22
April 2005 on the basis that (a) a full administrative proceeding was required before the
Mining Area could be reassigned; and (b) Rozmin should have been a Party to the
proceedings in which the Mining Area was reassigned to another entity.” In its decision
of 7 February 2007, the Regional Court rejected the complaint, finding that Rozmin did

not have standing to bring an action.”

Rozmin then appealed the Regional Court decision, arguing that the DMO’s decision to
initiate a new tender did not follow the proper procedure and was both legally and factually
incorrect.”’ On 27 February 2008, the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic issued its
decision, in favour of Rozmin. The Supreme Court found that the DMO had failed to give
Rozmin proper notice of the revocation of its mining rights and had “committed a whole
series of severe procedural misconducts.”’* The Supreme Court concluded that the
assignment of the Mining Area to Economy Agency should be cancelled and ordered the

DMO to carry out additional proceedings.

On 2 July 2008, the DMO awarded the Mining Area to VSK Mining.”? According to the
Respondent, the process by which this was done fully complied with the Supreme Court’s
decision; formal proceedings were held, including Rozmin as a party.*’ The Claimants
disagree, arguing that the assignment was effected through a “corporate sleight of hand,”

without any new tender proceedings.*!

On 12 August 2008, the DMO issued a formal decision revoking Rozmin’s General Mining

Authorization.*?

The MMO subsequently confirmed both of these 2008 decisions. **

Rozmin then brought an unsuccessful challenge of these decisions in the Regional Court.**

On appeal, however, the Supreme Court found in favour of Rozmin. In its decision of
18 May 2011, the Supreme Court held, inter alia, that the 2002 Amendment did not have

retroactive effect and, therefore, the three-year period could not commence until 1 January

2002.5 The Supreme Court also found that the decision to revoke Rozmin’s mining rights
and to award them to another company was “premature, unclear and insufficiently
reasoned.”*° It declared the DMO’s 2 July 2008 assignment to VSK Mining unlawful and

remanded the case to the DMO for further proceedings.*”

Following issuance of the Supreme Court’s decision, on 31 October 2011, EuroGas sent a
“Notification of Claim Against the Slovak Republic” to the Respondent, referring to an

investment dispute under the US-Slovakia BIT.**

According to the Claimants, the Respondent failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s
decision when, on 30 March 2012, the DMO reassigned exclusive rights over the Mining
Area to VSK Mining.*?

The Respondent argues that this decision was based on a thorough investigation and
analysis that comported with the Supreme Court’s decision. Ultimately, according to the
Respondent, the DMO determined that between 1 January 2002 and | January 2005,
Rozmin did not excavate at the Mining Area and failed to perform any of activities that
were necessary to lead to excavation, resulting in the application of Section 27(12) of the
2002 Amendment.” The DMO also concluded that Rozmin’s activities were speculative,
aimed not at excavating the site but at finding a company to buy Rozmin out of the

project.°!

57. The MMO subsequently confirmed the DMO’s 30 March 2012 decision, and Rozmin did

not challenge it in the courts.”

58. On 2 May 2012, Mr. Peter Kazimir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of
the Slovak Republic, responded to EuroGas’ Notice of 31 October 2011, stating that it
would be premature to engage in settlement negotiations because local proceedings were

pending.**

59. On 21 December 2012, Mr. KaZimir again wrote to EuroGas in reference to the 31 October
2011 Notice.** The letter stated that the Respondent was exercising its right under
Article VI of the US-Slovakia BIT to “deny EuroGas, Inc. the benefits of the Treaty,
including the right to arbitration.”

60. Separately, Rozmin had challenged the DMO’s revocation of the General Mining
Authorization in the Regional Court. The challenge was unsuccessful, but on appeal, the
Supreme Court rescinded the Regional Court’s decision and remanded the case for further
proceedings. Ultimately, on 26 September 2013, the Regional Court confirmed the DMO’s

decision to revoke Rozmin’s General Mining Authorization.*°

(9) EuroGas and the U.S. Bankruptcy Proceedings

In the meantime, in 2001, EuroGas I had been administratively dissolved under Utah law.

In 2004, the creditors of EuroGas I filed an involuntary petition for bankruptcy against the
company under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the District of Utah (the “Bankruptcy Court”).!°° On 20
October 2004, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the liquidation of EuroGas I (the
“Bankruptcy Proceedings”) by a Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee, Mr. Joel T. Marker
(“Trustee Marker’). Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, Mr. Reinhard Rauball (Wolfgang’s brother),
and Mr. Hank Blankenstein (EuroGas I’s CFO) were appointed to act for EuroGas I as the
debtor.'°! EuroGas I did not file any statements or schedules of assets during the
Bankruptcy Proceedings. '°* On 19 March 2007, the case was closed with Trustee Marker’s

final report, which does not include any reference to EuroGas GmbH or Rozmin.

On 18 September 2015, a U.S. bankruptcy trustee received a letter from a creditor of
EuroGas I, Texas EuroGas Corp., stating that EuroGas I owned an interest in “Rozmin and
EuroGas GmbH talc mines in Slovakia” that was omitted from its bankruptcy
disclosures. !°? The U.S. Trustee filed a motion to reopen the bankruptcy of EuroGas I,

which was granted by the Bankruptcy Court on 21 December 2015.!°*

undertakings.

e Order Respondent to pay Claimants damages, costs, and
compounded interest, in an amount to be quantified at a later
stage of the proceedings, in accordance with the Tribunal’s
instructions, \°

Subsequently, by letter of 25 December 2015, the Claimants stated that they were raising
a new claim for breach of international law based on an allegation that the Respondent had

illegally interfered with EuroGas’ title over its claims in this arbitration by causing the

reopening of the Bankruptcy Proceedings.

(2) Respondent’s Requests for Relief

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over both EuroGas and
Belmont and that the case should be dismissed on this basis. On the merits, the Respondent
denies each of the Claimants’ allegations of breach of the US-Slovakia BIT and the
Canada-Slovakia BIT.

In the Counter-Memorial and in the Rejoinder, the Respondent requests the following

relief:

(a) a declaration dismissing Claimants’ claims;

(b) an order that Claimants pay the costs of these arbitral
proceedings, including the cost of the Arbitral Tribunal and the

legal and other costs incurred by the Slovak Republic, on a full
indemnity basis; and

(c) interest on any costs awarded to the Slovak Republic, in an
amount to be determined by the Tribunal.''°

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Request for Arbitration

On 27 June 2014, ICSID received from the Claimants a request for arbitration dated 25
June 2014, including exhibits C-1 through C-42, against the Respondent (the “Request for

Arbitration”), pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention.

The Request was supplemented by the Claimants’ letters of 8 and 9 July 2014 in response

to questions posed by ICSID.

On 10 July 2014, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-
General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration and so notified the Parties. In the
Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an

arbitral tribunal as soon as possible pursuant to Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.

Constitution of the Tribunal

By an exchange of letters dated 22 and 24 July 2014, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal
would be composed of three members, with each Party appointing one arbitrator by 29
August 2014, and the two Party-appointed arbitrators jointly appointing the President of
the Tribunal after consultations with the Parties by 30 September 2014, failing which the

appointment(s) would be made by the ICSID Secretary-General.

In accordance with the Parties’ agreed method of appointment, on 29 August 2014, each
Party appointed an arbitrator. The Claimants appointed Professor Emmanuel Gaillard, a
national of France, and the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, also a national

of France. Both arbitrators subsequently accepted their appointments.

83.

On 30 September 2014, the Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed to an amended

schedule for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator.

On 20 October 2014, ICSID informed the Parties that the Party-appointed arbitrators
proposed to appoint Professor Pierre Mayer, a national of France, to serve as President of

the Tribunal.

In response to this proposal, on 24 October 2014, the Respondent made a disclosure
concerning its counsel’s relationship with Professor Mayer in a separate case, and on this
basis, the Claimants objected to his proposed appointment. In light of this objection, on 4

November 2014, Professor Mayer declined to serve as President of the Tribunal.

At this stage, as the Parties’ agreed deadline for the Party-appointed arbitrators to appoint
the President had elapsed, the Parties agreed to an alternative appointment procedure by
letters of 7 November 2014. Under this procedure, the ICSID Secretary-General would
provide the Parties with a list of candidates from which the Parties would strike one
candidate and rank those remaining. The Secretary-General would then appoint the
candidate with the best ranking. On 1 December 2014, ICSID provided the Parties with a

list of candidates.

The appointment procedure was postponed by agreement of the Parties on 2 and 24
December 2014 and | and 8 January 2015, and the list of candidates was amended on 19
and 23 December 2014. Before the procedure was completed, on 13 January 2015, the
Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed to appoint Professor Pierre Mayer as the

presiding arbitrator.

Professor Mayer accepted his appointment on 20 January 2015. On the same date, in
accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General notified the Parties
that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore
deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Lindsay Gastrell, ICSID Legal Counsel,

was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

Parties’ Requests for Provisional Measures

On 8 July 2014, the Claimants submitted a letter to the Secretary-General of ICSID
containing an Application for Provisional Measures, which related to criminal proceedings

launched by the Slovak Republic in June 2014.

As the Tribunal had not yet been constituted, the Claimants requested, pursuant to Rule
39(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, that the Secretary-General establish time limits for
the Parties to present their observations on the Claimants’ Application for Provisional

Measures, which could then be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.

On 10 July 2014, together with the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General provided
the Parties with a schedule for their written submissions on the Claimants’ Application for
Provisional Measures, noting that it would apply unless the Parties agreed on an alternative

schedule.

On 16 July 2014, the Claimants sent a letter to the President of the European Commission,
copied to the Respondent and ICSID, setting forth allegations concerning the actions of the
Slovak Republic in response to the Request for Arbitration and informing the European
Commission that the Claimants had filed an application for provisional measures with

ICSID.

In accordance with the briefing schedule established by the Secretary-General, on 11

August 2014, the Claimants submitted a Full Briefing on Provisional Measures.

On 10 September 2014, the Respondent submitted its Opposition to Claimants’ Application
for Provisional Measures, together with an Application for Provisional Measures in which

it sought an order requiring the Claimants to post security for the Respondent’s costs.

By letter of 11 September 2014, ICSID acknowledged receipt of the Respondent’s
Application for Provisional Measures, and informed the Parties that they were welcome to
agree on a schedule for the Parties to present their observations on this Application, or
alternatively, either Party could request the Secretary-General of ICSID to establish such a
schedule pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(5).

21

95.

On 16 September 2014, the Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed upon a briefing
schedule for the exchange of written submissions on both Parties’ applications for
provisional measures, and ICSID acknowledged the Parties’ agreement by letter of the
same date. The Parties informed ICSID on 30 September 2014 that they had agreed to an

amended briefing schedule.
In accordance with this agreed schedule, the Parties filed the following submissions:

a. Claimants’ Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to

Respondent’s Application for Provisional Measures dated 16 October 2014;

b. Respondent’s Reply Application for Provisional Measures and Rejoinder Opposition

to Claimants’ Application for Provisional Measures dated 21 November 2014; and

c. Claimants’ Rejoinder on Respondent’s Application for Provisional Measures dated 22

December 2014.

On 23 January 2015, the Respondent sought to enter an additional legal authority into the
record (RL-25), and the Tribunal granted this request by letter of 27 January 2015. The
Tribunal also offered the Claimants an opportunity to comment on this new authority. In
response, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they may choose to address the
authority at an oral hearing on provisional measures, should the Tribunal decide to hold

such a hearing.

By letter of 27 January 2015, the Tribunal proposed dates for a first session and hearing on
provisional measures in Paris. The Respondent replied on 28 January 2015, stating that key
members of its counsel team were unavailable on the proposed dates due to a hearing in

another matter.

By letter of 2 February 2015, the Claimants argued that it would be unacceptable for the
Respondent’s unavailability to delay an order on the Claimants’ Application for
Provisional Measures and requested that the Tribunal either proceed to issue an Order on

that Application forthwith or, alternatively, issue a provisional order prohibiting

22

96.

97.

98.

99.

100.

Respondent and its counsel from reading and gathering information from records and

property seized in the context of the relevant criminal proceedings.

In response to an invitation from the Tribunal, on 5 February 2015, the Respondent
provided its comments on the Claimants’ letter of 2 February 2015. The Respondent noted
in particular that the relevant criminal proceedings had been suspended and that neither
counsel for the Respondent nor the Slovak Ministry of Finance had read or gathered any
information from the materials seized in the investigation. The Respondent also undertook
that they would not read or gather such information pending the Tribunal’s decision on the

Claimants’ Application for Provisional Measures.

On 9 February 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in light of the Respondent’s
undertaking, it considered that the Claimants’ request of 2 February 2015 had been

rendered moot.

On 20 February 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, in light of a settlement
in another matter, its counsel would be available to attend an in-person hearing on

17 March 2015.

The Tribunal then confirmed that the first session and the hearing on provisional measures
would be held at the ICC in Paris, France on 17 March 2015. Prior to the hearing, on
6 March 2015, the Parties submitted a jointly proposed schedule for the first session and

hearing, which the Tribunal adopted.

By letter of 15 March 2015, the Respondent sought to introduce three new exhibits into the
record (R-81 to R-83), to which the Claimants objected. In a decision communicated to the
Parties on 16 March 2015, the Tribunal determined that the new exhibits would not be
entered into the record prior to the hearing, but that following the hearing, the exhibits
would be admitted and the Claimants given an opportunity to comment. In accordance with
this decision, the Respondent resubmitted the documents on 23 March 2015 and the
Claimants provided their observations on 3 April 2015. The Respondent then submitted

additional comments on this issue on 16 April 2015.

The first session and hearing on provisional measures was held on 17 March 2015 at the
ICC in Paris. During the hearing, in accordance with the Parties’ agreed schedule, each
Party was given the opportunity to present oral arguments on provisional measures as well
as rebuttal oral arguments. The audio recording of the first session and hearing was

dispatched to the Tribunal and the Parties on 30 March 2015.

On 25 June 2015, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Parties’ Requests for Provisional
Measures (Procedural Order No. 3). In its Decision, the Tribunal (a) denied both Parties’
applications for provisional measures; (b) noted certain undertakings made by the
Respondent during the hearing on provisional measures; and (c) reminded the Parties of
their duty not to take any action that may aggravate the dispute or affect the integrity of the

arbitration.

Initial Procedural Matters

On 16 February 2015, in preparation for the first session, the Secretary of the Tribunal
transmitted to the Parties a draft agenda for the session and a draft procedural order, which
had been approved by the Tribunal. The Parties were invited to confer on procedural
matters and to inform the Tribunal of any agreements they reached or, in the absence of

agreement, of their respective positions.

On 1 March 2015, the President proposed the appointment of Ms. Marie Nioche to serve
as Assistant to the Tribunal and set out the proposed terms of her appointment. The Parties
subsequently agreed to the appointment of Ms. Nioche as assistant, and she provided a

signed declaration of confidentiality and independence dated 13 March 2015.

On 6 March 2015, the Parties submitted a joint draft procedural order, and each Party
submitted a separate letter setting out its position on the limited number of disputed matters.

Among those matters were:

a. Bifurcation: In the Respondent’s view, bifurcation of the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections from the merits would be necessary to resolve the dispute in a time and cost

efficient manner. The Claimants submitted that the contemplated jurisdictional

24

106.

107.

108.

109.

objections would not warrant a bifurcation, and that the dispute could be promptly

resolved in one phase.

b. Public Access to Hearings and Documents: The Respondent requested that the
proceeding comply with the transparency provisions of Annex B of the Canada-
Slovakia BIT, which provide for public access to hearings and case documents. The
Claimants objected to this request on the basis that the Annex was not applicable to

either Claimant.

c. Applicability of Confidentiality Rules to Third-Party Funders: By letter of 23 January
2015, the Respondent had requested that “Claimants specify the identity of their third-
party funder for the purposes of determining whether there is any conflict of interests.”
The Respondent also sought to include a provision in the procedural order stating that
any third-party funder would not be granted access to confidential information, and the

Claimant considered this provision unjustified.

On 15 March 2015, the Respondent sought leave to introduce into the record three new
exhibits. After receiving comments from the Claimants, the Tribunal informed the Parties
that the new documents would be admitted to the record only after the hearing on

provisional measures.

As mentioned above, the first session was held together with the hearing on provisional
measures on 17 March 2015 at the ICC in Paris. The Tribunal and the Parties discussed

procedural matters, including those noted above.

During the hearing, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision that the Claimants
should disclose the identity of the third-party funder, and that the third-party funder would

have the normal obligations of confidentiality.

The Tribunal also instructed the Claimants to produce the Share Purchase Agreement
between EuroGas, Belmont and Rozmin, dated 27 March 2001 (the “SPA”); another
agreement between EuroGas, Belmont, Rozmin, and RimaMurai, dated 9 April 2001; as

well as all other agreements related to the SPA.

25

110.

111.

112.

113.

114.

By letter of 23 March 2015, as instructed, the Claimants disclosed the name of the funder

and filed the SPA and other documents.

Also on 23 March 2015, the Respondent filed the three new documents mentioned in its

15 March 2015 letter as R-81 to R-83 and provided comments on their relevance.

On 24 March 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision not to bifurcate the
proceedings between the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and the merits of the
dispute, but rather to hear jurisdiction and merits in a single phase, followed if necessary
by a separate phase on quantum. The Tribunal also confirmed the corresponding agreed

schedule for the Parties’ written submissions.

On 1 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the other
procedural matters addressed during the first session. Procedural Order No. | provides,
inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10,
2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding

would be Paris, France.

On 16 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 addressing the issue of
public access to hearings and documents. The Tribunal ordered inter alia, that in

accordance with Annex B of the Canada-Slovakia BIT:

2. Hearings held shall be open to the public. To the extent necessary
to ensure the protection of confidential information, the Tribunal
may hold portions of hearings in camera.

3. The Tribunal shall establish procedures for the protection of
confidential information and appropriate logistical arrangements
for open hearings, in consultation with the parties.

4, All documents submitted to, or issued by, the Tribunal shall be
publicly available, unless the parties otherwise agree, subject to the
redaction of confidential information.

5. ... any Tribunal award shall be publicly available, subject to the
redaction of confidential information.

26

115.

116.

117.

118.

On 14 May 2015, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer regarding the procedures for
making documents open to the public and identifying confidential information. In response,
on 11 June 2015, the Parties provided the Tribunal with a jointly proposed draft
Confidentiality Order. On 18 June 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had no
objection to their proposal and issued the Confidentiality Order signed by the President.
The Parties then signed the Confidentiality Order and provided a copy to the Tribunal.

Written Phase

In accordance with the procedural calendar, the Claimants submitted their Memorial dated

31 March 2015, together with:

e the witness statements of Dr. Ondrej Rozloznik, Mr. Vojtech Agyagos and Mr.
Wolfgang Rauball;

e the expert report of Mr. Alex Hill of Wardell Armstrong International;

e exhibits C-75 to C-307; and

e legal authorities CL-125 to CL-195.

On 30 June 2015, also in accordance with the procedural calendar, the Respondent filed its
Counter-Memorial, together with:

e the witness statements of Messrs. Peter Corej, Peter Kukelcik, Ernst Haidecker and

Stephan Dorfner;
e the expert report of Ms. Annette W. Jarvis of Dorsey & Whitney LLP;
e the expert report of Mr. John Anderson of Stikeman Elliott LLP;
e the expert report of Mr. Gregory Sparks of John T. Boyd Company;
e exhibits R-84 to R-209; and

e legal authorities RL-26 to RL-132.

On 29 July 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Respondent requesting that the Respondent’s

expert Ms. Annette W. Jarvis step down on the basis that she lacked independence. The

27

119.

120.

121.

122.

Claimants stated that if Ms. Jarvis did not step down, they would formally apply to the

Tribunal to seek her disqualification.

On 31 July 2015, in accordance with Article 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, each Party
informed the Tribunal that it had served on the other Party a request for the production of
documents, and they asked that the Tribunal establish a schedule for the document
production phase of the proceeding. The Tribunal then invited the Parties to agree on the
dates of the various steps of the procedure for production of documents. On 7 August 2015,
the Parties provided the Tribunal with an agreed timetable, which was adopted by the
Tribunal. In accordance with that timetable, on 17 August 2015, each Party submitted a
Redfern schedule containing its requests for the production of documents, the other Party’s

objections to production, and the requesting Party’s responses to those objections.

On 10 August 2015, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimants’ objection to
Ms. Annette W. Jarvis, together with a Statement from Ms. Jarvis, rejecting the Claimants’

request for her to step down.

On 19 August 2015, the Claimants submitted a letter requesting “as primary relief and
while reserving their rights, that the Tribunal read the opinion of Ms. Jarvis not as an
independent expert report, but as a Party submission.” In response, on 24 August 2015, the
Respondent asked the Tribunal to “deny Claimants’ request for an evidentiary ruling

regarding Ms. Jarvis’ expert report at this stage of the proceedings.”

Having considered the Parties’ submissions on this issue, the Tribunal informed the Parties
of its view that, as the Claimants were not seeking the disqualification of Ms. Jarvis, no
procedural ruling relating to her expert report was needed. In response to the Tribunal’s
decision, on 27 August 2015, the Claimants wrote to clarify their request. The Respondent
responded to Claimants’ letter on the same day. On 28 August 2015, the Tribunal informed
the Parties that Ms. Jarvis’ report remained an expert report and that “[t]he Tribunal will
assess its probative value, taking in consideration all relevant circumstances, which may

include those which the Parties have debated in their recent letters.”

28

123.

124.

125.

126.

127.

In the meantime, on 26 August 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, including

Annexes A and B, containing its decisions on the Parties’ document requests.

On 7 September 2015, the Claimants requested an extension of time, from 15 to 29
September 2015, to file their Reply Memorial. The Respondent informed the Tribunal by
letter of 8 September 2015 that it opposed such an extension. Having considered the
Parties’ comments on the matter, on 16 September 2015, the Tribunal granted the request
and also extended the deadline for the submission of the Rejoinder to 29 December 2015.
The Claimants then filed their Reply dated 29 September 2015, together with:

e the expert report of Messrs. David E. Leta and Brad W. Merrill of Snell & Wilmer;

e the expert report of Mr. John Ellison of KPMG with appendices;

e the supplemental expert report of Mr. Alex Hill of Wardell Armstrong International;

e exhibits C-308 to C-358; and

e legal authorities CL-196 to CL-256.

On 28 October 2015, the President of the Tribunal provided the Parties with a
supplementary disclosure statement regarding his appointment in another ICSID case.

On 29 December 2015, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder, together with:

© the rebuttal witness statement of Messrs. Peter Corej, Peter Kukeléik and Stephan

Dorfner;

e the rebuttal expert report of Ms. Annette W. Jarvis and Mr. Samuel P. Gardiner from
Dorsey & Whitney LLP;

e the rebuttal expert report of Mr. John Anderson from Stikeman Elliott LLP;

e the rebuttal expert report of Messrs. Gregory Sparks from John T. Boyd Company;
e the expert report of Mr. Abdul Sirshar Qureshi from PricewaterhouseCoopers;

On 6 November 2015, in preparation for the hearing scheduled to take place from 18 to 22
January 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consult regarding the logistical
arrangements for the open hearing, including procedures for the protection of confidential
information, and to revert to the Tribunal in this regard. On 16 November 2015, the Parties
informed the Tribunal of their agreement that a video recording of the hearing would be
made available on the ICSID website only after the conclusion of the hearing and the

identification of any confidential information.

On 6 April 2016, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that Ms. Nioche had
left his firm and proposed Ms. Céline Lachmann to replace Ms. Nioche as Assistant to the
Tribunal. Both Parties subsequently consented to the appointment of Ms. Lachmann, and

she provided a signed declaration of confidentiality and independence dated 12 April 2016.

Developments in the Bankruptcy Proceedings

On 2 October 2015, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal in reference to a statement in the
Claimants’ Reply that there was an attempt to reopen the bankruptcy of EuroGas. The
Respondent attached to its letter the Motion to Reopen, which concerned an interest in

“Rozmin and EuroGas GmbH tale mines in Slovakia.”

On 5 October 2015, the Tribunal confirmed that it had taken note of the information in the
Respondent’s letter and that it expected to be informed by the Parties of any related

developments.

By letter of 9 November 2015, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that it had learned that
EuroGas had engaged counsel in Utah to oppose reopening the bankruptcy and that an oral
hearing on the matter was scheduled for 10 December 2015. The Respondent stated that,
in light of these facts, it would likely retain counsel to participate in the reopening

proceeding.

The following day, on 10 November 2015, the Claimants pointed out what they considered
to be a number of inaccuracies in the Respondent’s letter. The Claimants confirmed that
the hearing on the reopening of the Bankruptcy Proceedings would take place on 10

December 2015.

By letter of 22 December 2015, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that on 21 December
2015, the Bankruptcy Court had issued its written decision granting the U.S. Trustee’s

Motion to Reopen the bankruptcy. A copy of the decision was attached as Exhibit A.
On 25 December 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to:

(i) provide the Tribunal with a more comprehensive and relevant
account of the latest developments [US Proceeding]; (ii) raise a
claim for breach of international law arising out of the Slovak
Republic’s illegal interference with EuroGas’ title over the claims
which it has put forward in this arbitration; and (iii) to reserve their
right to request a stay of proceedings upon completion of the
assessment that they are undertaking.

The following day, the Respondent submitted a brief response to the Claimants’ letter,

arguing inter alia that the Claimants’ allegations and new claim were baseless.

Postponement of the Hearing

On 29 December 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal, requesting a postponement of
the hearing scheduled for 18 to 22 January 2016 or, alternatively, a stay of the proceeding
until the issuance of the Trustee Loveridge’s final decision. The Claimants argued that the
appointment of Trustee Loveridge “undeniably has a material impact on the arbitration
proceedings, irrespective of his/her ultimate decision.” The Claimants also asked the
Tribunal to set out a timetable for Respondent to make a written submission on quantum

“so as to mitigate the consequences of any delays.”

The Respondent submitted its response to the Claimants’ letter on 30 December 2015,
urging the Tribunal to maintain the scheduled hearing dates and objecting in particular to
the Claimants’ suggestion that, if the hearing were postponed, the Respondent should be
ordered to submit a written pleading on quantum in the meantime. The Respondent argued

that this would vacate the Tribunal’s decision to bifurcate quantum.

On 2 January 2016, the Secretary informed the Parties of the Tribunal’s decision to
maintain the scheduled hearing dates. The Parties were reminded of the dates for witness

notification and the prehearing conference.

On 5 January 2016, the Claimants’ counsel provided the Tribunal with a letter they had
received that day from their clients (Mr. Vojtech Agyagos, President of Belmont and Mr.
Wolfgang Rauball, CEO of EuroGas). The letter stated that as a result of the reopened

Bankruptcy Proceedings:

we feel that a conflict of interest has arisen between our two
companies, and we are therefore no longer confident in 1 your ability
to jointly repres both of our comy ] ly.
To put it as clearly as possible, given the circumstances, we can no
longer allow you to jointly represent our interests in this arbitration.

 

Counsel for the Claimants explained that under the circumstances, they were not in a

position to proceed with the hearing as scheduled.

On 7 January 2016, the Respondent identified which of the Claimants’ witnesses it

intended to cross-examine at the hearing.

Also on 7 January 2016, the Respondent objected to the postponement of the hearing,
arguing that “an unspecified conflict-of-interest, which existed since the beginning of the
arbitration, cannot possibly be a basis for Claimants to not proceed with the Hearing.” The
Respondent also made the following request, pursuant to Rule 42 of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules:

Claimants are now a “defaulting party” within the meaning of Rule
42(1) of the Arbitration Rules, and the Slovak Republic respectfully
urges the Tribunal to proceed with the case notwithstanding
Claimants’ default. Claimants have offered no valid reason for
refusing to attend the long-scheduled Hearing, and the Slovak
Republic therefore requests that the Tribunal inform the Claimants
that they are still expected to appear at the Hearing. If Claimants
do not withdraw their announced intention to default by noon CET
on Friday, 8 January 2016, pursuant to Rule 42(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules, the Slovak Republic requests that the “the
Tribunal ... deal with the questions submitted to it and to render an
award” on the memorials and evidence that have been submitted.

The Respondent also stated that it was renewing its application for security for costs.

32

145.

146.

147.

148.

149.

The Claimants responded the following day, challenging the Respondent’s allegations and
arguing that it would be a fundamental breach of the Claimants’ due process rights if they
were to be held in default as a result of their inability to participate in the hearing on account
of a conflict of interest. The Claimants again urged the Tribunal to stay the proceeding or
postpone the hearing until the Trustee Loveridge determined the ownership of the interest
in Rozmin. Finally, the Claimants objected to the Respondent’s assertion that it was

renewing its request for security for costs.

On the same day, the Respondent submitted observations on the Claimants’ letter.

On 11 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, in which the Tribunal (a)
cancelled the scheduled hearing; (b) determined that it was not obliged to proceed to render
an award pursuant to Article 45 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 42 of the Arbitration
Rules; (c) ordered the Claimants “to decide now how they wish to be represented until the
end of these proceeding, i.e. by one counsel or two”; (d) decided that the Claimants’ request
to reschedule the hearing did not constitute a valid reason to reconsider the decision on
Respondent’s request for security for costs; and (e) reserved for later determination the

issue of the allocation of the costs of the cancelled hearing.

By email of the same day, the Claimants’ counsel informed the Tribunal that:

it is certain that Claimants will not be represented in this arbitration

by way of joint representation, and will require separate counsel to

represent them independently since the decision of the Tribunal is

to proceed without first a ruling of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
Also on the same day, the Tribunal held a conference call with the Parties in order to
reschedule the hearing. Following the call, on 14 January 2016, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 6, holding that: (a) the rescheduled hearing will be held from 12-16
September 2016; (b) each Claimant shall make sure that its counsel is available for the
rescheduled hearing; and (c) no additional written submissions shall be permitted unless

there are further developments in the Bankruptcy Proceedings.

Communication with Trustee Loveridge

On 12 January 2016, a representative of Trustee Loveridge wrote to inform the Tribunal
that, while Trustee Loveridge was not currently seeking to participate in the arbitration,
she might seek to do so in the future. Trustee Loveridge also asked for guidance on how

she would obtain access to non-public case documents.

The Tribunal invited the Parties’ comments on Trustee Loveridge’s letter. The Claimants
submitted their comments on 27 January 2016, and the Respondent submitted its comments

on 29 January 2016.

By letter of 9 February 2016, the President of the Tribunal responded to Trustee
Loveridge’s representative, requesting that the Trustee identify precisely which documents

she would like to consult and the relevance of the documents to her mission.

By email of 30 March 2016, Trustee Loveridge requested copies of the expert reports filed
in this arbitration. In response to an invitation from the Tribunal, the Claimants commented
on this request on 11 April 2016, and the Respondent commented on 12 April 2016. Neither
Party objected to Trustee Loveridge being given access to the documents, but each Party
specified information that it believed should be communicated to Trustee Loveridge

together with the documents.

On 6 May 2016, the Tribunal notified the Parties that Trustee Loveridge would be provided
with the expert reports and would be informed that (a) the Claimants have not had an
opportunity to rebut the expert reports filed by Respondent with its Rejoinder, and (b) the

procedural timetable does not foresee any rebuttal by Claimants to such reports.

Procedural Issues Leading up to the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits

On 17 June 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the reservation for the hearing
rooms at the ICC from 12 to 16 September would be confirmed. The Tribunal also invited

the Claimants to clarify who would represent them at the rescheduled hearing.

By letter of 21 June 2016, the Respondent confirmed that it was proceeding on the

understanding that the hearing would go forward in September.

By letter of 4 July 2016, Dr. Hamid Gharavi informed the Tribunal that his firm no longer
represented EuroGas in this arbitration and provided the contact details for Mr. Wolfgang
Rauball. In response, on 8 July 2016, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order
EuroGas to immediately state its intentions regarding its attendance at the September

hearing.

On 11 July 2016, Mr. Rauball informed the Tribunal that going forward, EuroGas would
be represented in the arbitration by Ms. Mona Lyman Burton of Holland & Hart LLP.
Mr. Rauball also confirmed that EuroGas would attend the hearing in September. EuroGas

subsequently provided a power of attorney in favour of Ms. Burton of Holland & Hart LLP.

By email of 25 July 2016, the Respondent confirmed its letter of 7 January 2016,

identifying which of the Claimants’ witnesses and experts it intended to cross-examine.

On 26 July 2016, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a draft agenda for the pre-hearing
teleconference. The Tribunal requested that the Parties confer and attempt to reach

agreement on the agenda items in advance of the pre-hearing teleconference.

On 29 July 2016, Belmont identified which of the Respondent’s witnesses and experts it
intended to cross-examine. On the same day, EuroGas, through its new counsel, informed

the Tribunal that it intended to cross-examine the same witnesses identified by Belmont.

On 1 August 2016, the Tribunal notified the Parties that a pre-hearing teleconference would

be held on 5 September 2016.

On 23 August 2016, the Respondent responded to the Tribunal regarding the draft agenda
for the pre-hearing teleconference. The Respondent informed the Tribunal of the Parties’
agreement on certain procedural matters and identified four issues on which the Parties

could not agree. The Respondent stated its position on those four issues.

Also on 23 August 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that Trustee Loveridge
had filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking approval of an agreement with

EuroGas II. The Respondent offered to provide the Tribunal with a copy of the motion and

35

165.

166.

167.

169.

170.

the proposed agreement. Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent provided a

copy of this document on 25 August 2016.

By email of 26 August 2016, EuroGas submitted corrected versions of the Claimants’ legal

authorities CL-225, CL-227 and CL-233.

On 28 August 2016, Belmont informed the Tribunal of its position on the four contested
procedural matters identified in the Respondent’s letter of 23 August 2016. The following

day, EuroGas did the same.

On 1 September 2016, EuroGas wrote to the Tribunal regarding recent developments in
the Bankruptcy Proceedings. EuroGas alleged that the Respondent was interfering with
EuroGas’ rights in that proceeding in an effort to obstruct the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
Together with its letter, EuroGas filed exhibits C-359 and C-360 and legal authorities
CL-257 to CL-264. On 3 September 2016, Belmont informed the Tribunal that it agreed

with EuroGas’ submission.

By joint letter of 3 September 2016, EuroGas and Belmont requested that the Tribunal
order Mr. Peter KaZimir, acting Minister of Finance for the Slovak Republic, to appear as
a witness at the hearing. The Claimants argued that Mr. KaZimir’s testimony was material

and that he was under the Respondent’s control.

By letter of 5 September 2016, the Respondent responded to the Claimants’ respective
letters of 1 and 3 September 2016 concerning the Bankruptcy Proceedings and their joint
letter of 3 September 2016. The Respondent (a) rejected the Claimants’ attempt to raise
new claims relating to the Bankruptcy Proceedings, and (b) opposed the Claimants’ request

for Mr. Kazimir to appear as a witness.

On 5 September 2016, EuroGas wrote to the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants to request:

a provisional measure pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID
Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, ordering
the Slovak Republic (i) to cease any and all interferences in the U.S.
bankruptcy proceedings, in a continuing attempt to obstruct or delay
the resolution of issues that it raised in this arbitration proceedings
as a defense; or at the very least (ii) ... to withdraw its request to

174.

continue/postpone the U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing set for
September 8 to formally approve the conclusions of the Trustee’s
independent investigation into the Rozmin interest, and the
Agreement with EuroGas...

Together with this letter, EuroGas filed the Slovak Republic’s Motion to Continue the
8 September 2016 hearing before the Bankruptcy Court as exhibit C-363.

Later on 5 September 2016, the Tribunal held a prehearing teleconference. The Tribunal
and the Parties discussed the organization of the hearing and other outstanding procedural
matters, as well as the Claimants’ request for a provisional measure. Following the
teleconference, the Respondent submitted a letter to memorialise its opposition to the

Claimants’ request for a provisional measure.

The Tribunal then issued Procedural Order No. 7, dated 5 September 2016. The Tribunal
first addressed the organization of the hearing, including: the hearing schedule, allocation
of time, opening and closing statements, witness and expert examination, hearing materials,
and post-hearing submissions. In addition, the Tribunal denied the Claimants’ request for
an order requiring Mr. Peter KaZimir to appear for examination at the Hearing. In this
regard, the Tribunal noted that it had “taken into account the short notice of this request
and determined that such an order would not be practicable at this stage, just one week
before the Hearing.” Finally, the Tribunal denied the Claimants’ 3 September 2016 request
for a provisional measure, based on its determination that the Claimants had not articulated
a right meriting protection under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal further
stated that it was not inclined to interfere with the administration of the Bankruptcy
Proceedings, particularly in a way that would effectively pre-empt the Bankruptcy Court’s
decision on the Slovak Republic’s motion for a postponement of the 8 September 2016

hearing.

By letter of 6 September 2016, EuroGas requested leave to introduce into the record six
documents relating to alleged corporate transactions involving the interest in Rozmin.
Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the following day, the Respondent submitted
observations on EuroGas’ request, opposing it. On 8 September 2016, the Parties were

informed of the Tribunal’s decision to admit the new documents. The Tribunal invited the

37

175.

176.

177.

178.

179.

Respondent to comment on the new documents orally at the hearing and, if it wished, in

writing before or during the hearing.

Later on 8 September 2016, Belmont requested leave to introduce two additional
documents into the record, namely an affidavit sworn by Mr. Wulf Dietrich Keller, former
CEO of Mondo Minerals, and an email addressed to Mr. Keller concerning the

reassignment of the Mining Area.

On 9 September 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of further developments in
the Bankruptcy Proceedings. In particular, the Respondent stated that a hearing had been
held the previous day to address Trustee Loveridge’s proposed deal with EuroGas, but that
the Bankruptcy Court had decided not to approve or reject the deal at that time. With its
letter, the Respondent filed exhibits R-291 and R-292.

Also on 9 September 2016, Belmont requested leave to file two publicly available
documents concerning Belmont’s business. Belmont noted that the Respondent had
objected to the introduction of these documents, which the Respondent confirmed by email

the same day.

Later on 9 September 2016, the Tribunal issued directions to the Parties concerning a
number of outstanding procedural matters. The Tribunal (a) acknowledged the introduction
of R-291 and R-292, (b) granted Belmont’s 8 September 2016 request to introduce new
documents, (c) denied Belmont’s 9 September 2016 request to introduce new documents,

and (d) provided further guidance relating to the organisation of the hearing.

By letter of the same day, the Respondent asked that the Tribunal reconsider its decision
to grant Belmont’s 8 September 2016 request because the Respondent had not had a
sufficient opportunity to state its objection to the request. In response, the Tribunal
explained that it had not understood that the Respondent wished to object. Therefore, in
light of the objection, the Tribunal suspended its decision on the matter and informed the
Parties that it would make its final decision on the first day of the hearing. Ultimately, after

hearing both Parties at the hearing, the Tribunal decided not to admit the documents.

38

On 11 September 2016, EuroGas submitted exhibits C-366 to C-370 pursuant to the

Tribunal’s instructions of 6 September 2016.

debated, notably whether it includes or amounts to excavation) and (b) documents

regarding the Claimants’ agreement on the allocation of the proceeds of the arbitration.

In accordance with the Parties’ agreement, a video recording of the Hearing was made and

subsequently posted on the ICSID website.

Post-Hearing Phase

Following the Hearing, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, dated 23 September
2016, in which it restated its directions on the procedural matters discussed at the close of

the Hearing.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 8, on 7 October 2016, the Respondent filed
documents related to VSK Mining’s activities as exhibits R-295 to R-297.

On the same date, and also in accordance with Procedural Order No. 8, Belmont filed
documents relating to the agreement between EuroGas and Belmont as exhibits C-370 to

C-374.

By letter of 20 October 2017, Belmont requested (a) leave to comment on the documents
produced by the Respondent on 7 October 2016 and (b) an extension of time for the Parties
to file their submissions on costs. By letter of the same date, EuroGas joined Belmont’s

request.

By letter of 21 October 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no objection
to the Claimants’ requested extension of time for the Parties to file their submissions on
costs, provided that the Claimants would not object to an extension of time for the filing of
the transcript corrections. Both Claimants confirmed that they had no objection to the

Respondent’s proposal.

On 26 October 2016, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ agreement on the procedural
schedule. In addition, the Tribunal granted the Claimants’ request to comment on the

documents submitted by the Respondent on 7 October 2016.

By letter of 1 November 2016, the Respondent provided the Tribunal with an update on
the Bankruptcy Proceedings. In particular, the Respondent noted that the Bankruptcy Court
had approved Trustee Loveridge’s proposed deal with EuroGas in an order dated
29 October 2016, which the Respondent attached as exhibit B. The Respondent also
attached the transcript of the hearing before the Bankruptcy Court as exhibit A and two
legal authorities as exhibits C and D. The Respondent argued that this order had not

resolved the issue of ownership of the ICSID claim.

Also on 1 November 2016, Belmont submitted its comments on the documents disclosed
by the Respondent on 7 October 2016. As part of its comments, Belmont requested that
negative inferences be drawn against the Respondent. Belmont attached an additional
document concerning VSK Mining’s activities as exhibit C-375. By letter of the same date,

EuroGas joined Belmont’s arguments.

On 3 November 2016, the Respondent requested leave to respond to Belmont’s

1 November 2016 letter, which the Tribunal granted on 7 November 2016.

On 8 November 2016, the Parties submitted their Joint Notice of Errata and Interpretation
Errors, identifying corrections to the Hearing transcript. The Tribunal subsequently
informed the Parties that it confirmed all of the agreed amendments to the transcript, and
that it would not issue any decision with respect to four disputed amendments. The Tribunal
noted that if it later determined that one or more of the disputed issues were relevant and

material to the dispute, it would issue a decision at that time.

On 8 November 2016, EuroGas filed a letter commenting on the Bankruptcy Proceedings,
together with exhibits A to R. EuroGas argued that the Bankruptcy Court’s order of
28 October 2016, which the Respondent discussed in its letter of 1 November 2016,

supported EuroGas’ position in the arbitration.

On 11 November 2016, the Respondent submitted its response to Belmont’s letter of
1 November 2016, together with exhibits R-298 to R-306. The Respondent argued that

Belmont had raised new allegations that were untimely, improper and incorrect.

In accordance with the revised post-Hearing procedural schedule, EuroGas, Belmont, and

the Respondent each filed a Statement of Costs on 14 November 2016.

On 18 August 2017, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with ICSID
Arbitration Rule 38(1).

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON THE TRIBUNAL’S
JURISDICTION

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over EuroGas’ claims because:
(a) the company EuroGas, Inc. that is a Claimant in this arbitration does not own the alleged
investment in the Slovak Republic and therefore has no standing to bring its claims;!!! and
(b) the Respondent has validly denied the benefits of the US-Slovakia BIT to EuroGas, a
company without substantial business activities in the United States that is controlled by a

German national. |!

The Respondent further submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Belmont for two

fundamental reasons:

(i) Belmont sold its ownership in the alleged investment to EuroGas
Tin 2001 and thus does not own the alleged investment, and (ii) the
Canada-Slovak BIT only covers disputes arising after 14 March
2009, and all of Claimants’ colorable allegations occurred prior to
that date,''3

The Tribunal summarises below in greater detail each Party’s position on the Respondent’ s
objections, focusing on the Parties’ arguments as set forth in their written submissions. !!4

During the Hearing, the Parties elaborated upon these arguments, and the examination of

witnesses revealed further relevant information. The Tribunal will address these additional

points as necessary in its analysis contained in Sections V and VI below.

EuroGas’ Standing
(dd) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s first jurisdictional objection with respect to EuroGas is that this
Claimant does not in fact own the alleged investment in the Slovak Republic and, as a

result, has no standing to bring its claims before this Tribunal.

In this regard, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants have misrepresented EuroGas’
identity in this proceeding. In particular, the Respondent points to the description in the
Request for Arbitration of EuroGas as a U.S. company incorporated in Utah in 1985.!'5
The Respondent discovered that this statement was false when its research of Utah’s
corporate records revealed that the company named EuroGas, Inc. that was incorporated in
1985 (to which the Respondent refers as “EuroGas I’) no longer exists, and the only entity
named “EuroGas, Inc.” in operation is a company incorporated in 2005 (to which the

Respondent refers as “EuroGas II’”).!!°

According to the Respondent, after this information was uncovered, the Claimants “were
forced to change their story” and admit that the real Claimant was, in fact, EuroGas m7
The Respondent asserts that the Claimants have since presented “one false explanation
after another,” which the Respondent has disproven each time.!!* The Claimants argued in
the Memorial that EuroGas II acquired the interest in Rozmin through a 2008 Type-F
reorganization of EuroGas I.'!° Then, after the Respondent proved that position untenable,
the Claimants “changed their story” in the Reply and argued that the two EuroGas
companies merged through a “de facto merger.” The Claimants also asserted for the first

time in the Reply that EuroGas II acquired the interest in Rozmin from McCallan Oil &

Gas (“McCallan”), a U.K. company.'° According to the Respondent, each of these

various theories is false and results in multiple jurisdictional problems for EuroGas.

In any event, the Respondent contends that these theories are rendered moot by a threshold
issue: EuroGas I did not emerge from bankruptcy with the alleged investment. Therefore,
neither EuroGas II nor McCallan ever could have acquired the investment from

EuroGas I.'2!

Addressing this threshold issue, the Respondent submits that under U.S. Bankruptcy law,
EuroGas I could not have survived the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy with its interest in Rozmin. '
In this regard, the Respondent draws a distinction between Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code. In Chapter 11 proceedings, the debtor’s business is reorganized, usually
with the debtor retaining control of its assets, whereas in Chapter 7 proceedings, the
debtor’s assets are marshalled by the bankruptcy trustee and liquidated to repay creditors.
The only exception is when an asset is “abandoned” by the trustee, in which case it remains

with the debtor.

According to the Respondent, Section 554 of the Bankruptcy Code governs abandonment
of property, as recognized by the Claimants’ experts. '?* Under this provision, there are only
two ways for property to be abandoned in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy: (a) when the court
enters an order authorizing the abandonment and the trustee takes affirmative action to
abandon the property, pursuant to Sections 554(a)-(b); or (b) by operation of law for
property scheduled under Section 521, pursuant to Section 554(c). Otherwise, the property

remains part of the bankruptcy estate. !*4

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ position that abandonment of EuroGas I’s interest

in Rozmin occurred by operation of law under Section 554(c). That section expressly

requires that the asset be scheduled under Section 521(a)(1).!7> Yet it is undisputed that
EuroGas I’s interest in Rozmin was never scheduled in the Chapter 7 proceeding.'7°

Therefore, the Respondent concludes that Section 554(c) could not apply. '?”

According to the Respondent, U.S. courts have consistently held that, for property to be
abandoned by operation of law, it must be disclosed in the schedule of assets. The
Respondent cites, for example, recent rulings of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Tenth Circuit, which have precedential
value in Utah. Those cases concerned a bankruptcy debtor who failed to disclose the
relevant asset in her bankruptcy filings, and the courts held that as a result, the asset was

not abandoned but instead remained property of the estate. !7

According to the Respondent, it follows that EuroGas I’s interest in Rozmin remains with
the bankruptcy estate. '?? The Respondent does not accept the Claimants’ argument that the
investment was abandoned by operation of law because Trustee Marker knew of the
interest in Rozmin but elected not to administer it.!*° According to the Respondent, the
actual or imputed knowledge of a Chapter 7 trustee is irrelevant in light of the requirement
that property must have been formally scheduled to be abandoned.'*! As held by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit:

[I]n order for property to be abandoned by operation of law
pursuant to section 554(c), the debtor must formally schedule the
property before the close of the case. It is not enough that the trustee

25 11 USC §554(c) (RL-69) (“Unless the court orders otherwise, any property scheduled under section 521(a)(1) of
this title not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor...”).

learns of the property through other means; the property must be
scheduled pursuant to section 521(1).'?

212. The Respondent states that this “has been the unanimous holding of virtually every court
that has ruled on the issue,” and that such an approach comports with the policy goals of

predictability and finality. !*°

213. Further, the Respondent considers the Claimants’ argument to be wrong as a matter of fact
because “[nJot only is there no evidence that the EuroGas Trustee knew of EuroGas I’s
interest in Rozmin, but there is evidence to suggest that EuroGas I affirmatively concealed
it.”!*4 In this regard, the Respondent points to testimony before the Bankruptcy Court of
EuroGas’ CFO, Mr. Hank Blankenstein, confirming that EuroGas held no interest in the

Gemerska Poloma deposit.'*>

214. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ reliance on time entries of the Trustee’s accountant
indicating that he reviewed filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). These entries do not specify which SEC filings were reviewed or in any way
reflect the Trustee Marker’s knowledge of EuroGas’ assets. '° In any event, EuroGas’ 2004
and 2005 Annual Reports (10-Ks) suggest that EuroGas I no longer had any interest in the
Gemerska Poloma deposit.'*” It was not until its 2007 10-K, filed after the bankruptcy had

closed, that EuroGas disclosed that it was contesting the reassignment of the Mining Area.

The Respondent concludes that because EuroGas I did not emerge from the bankruptcy
with its interest in Rozmin, EuroGas II could never have come to possess the alleged

investment, and the Tribunal therefore has no jurisdiction over EuroGas 11.38

In any event, the Respondent submits that, even if EuroGas I had somehow retained the
interest in Rozmin, the Tribunal would still not have jurisdiction over EuroGas II, given
that none of the Claimants’ theories as to how EuroGas II obtained the interest in Rozmin

is tenable. '°°

Specifically, the Respondent denies that EuroGas II could have “stepped into the shoes” of
EuroGas I, as asserted by the Claimants. The Claimants rely on a Joint Unanimous Consent
Resolution entered into by the directors of the two EuroGas companies on 31 July 2008
(the “Joint Resolution”), which provides that the companies are “deemed to have merged”
through a Type-F reorganization that is retroactively effective to 15 November 2005.'#°
According to the Respondent, this is a “sham document” that is invalid under both Utah

law and U.S. Bankruptcy law. '4!

The Respondent contends that, in response to its Counter-Memorial, the Claimants were
forced to admit in the Reply that Section 368(a)(1)(f) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code,
which governs Type-F reorganizations, is a tax statute that cannot effectuate corporate

mergers. !47

According to the Respondent, the Claimants then offered a new theory based on “the

common law doctrine of de facto merger,” which is invalid for two main reasons. '*7

filings did not adequately inform shareholders about the bankruptcy case. For the Respondent, it “speaks volumes”
that the Claimants’ own evidence states that EuroGas’ SEC filings were inaccurate. Counter-Memorial 189.

220. First, the Respondent argues that the de facto merger doctrine does not work to merge two
entities engaged in an asset acquisition; rather, it is applicable only in successor liability
cases as a remedy to protect the creditors of an entity that sells substantially all of its assets
to another entity but retains its liabilities. '‘* Therefore, it could not apply to effect a merger

of EuroGas I and II.

221. Second, the Respondent contends that EuroGas I did not have the capacity to merge with
EuroGas II because under Utah law, dissolved corporations cannot merge. '*> In this regard,
it is undisputed that EuroGas I was dissolved in 2001 and did not seek reinstatement within

two years after its dissolution.

222. Pursuant to the Utah Code, a dissolved corporation “may not carry on any business except
that appropriate to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs,” and Utah legal authorities

have held that mergers do not fall into that category. '*°

223. Moreover, according to the Respondent, a dissolved corporation that has failed to seek
reinstatement within the two-year period “has no legal capacity” and may not carry out any
activities, even to wind up the business. '4” The Respondent relies on an order issued by the

Utah Division of Securities in In re Flavor Brands, Inc., which states:

A dissolved corporation has no officers or directors to act on behalf
of either the entity or the shareholders in approving a merger or the
sale of stock ... A dissolved corporation has no shares to offer, sell
or swap. The shares of a dissolved corporation are invalid.‘

224. In the Respondent’s view, it necessarily follows that EuroGas II could not have merged

with EuroGas I or assumed the alleged investment.!4?

225. The Respondent further argues that, even if EuroGas I had the legal capacity to merge
under Utah law, its purported merger would still be ineffective because it was not registered
with the Utah Division of Corporations as required by law.!°° Section 16-10a-1105(2) of
the Utah Code states that a “merger or share exchange takes effect upon the effective date
of the articles of merger or share exchange, which may not be prior to the date of filing.” !>!

The Claimants do not deny the fact that articles of merger were never filed.'°? The

consequence, according to the Respondent, is that the purported merger did not take effect.

226. Turning to U.S. Bankruptcy law, the Respondent argues that EuroGas I also lacked the
capacity to merge pursuant to Section 727(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, which prohibits
a court from discharging a corporate debtor’s debt in a Chapter 7 proceeding. U.S. courts
have found that as a consequence of this provision, the debtor company is “defunct” at the
conclusion of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and cannot carry out business activities.!*
Therefore, EuroGas I was rendered “defunct” after the Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding
concluded on 19 March 2007 and could not have transferred assets to or merged with

EuroGas II after that date.!*4

Finally, the Respondent challenges the purported retroactive effect of the Joint
Resolution. !*> First, Utah corporate law expressly prohibits mergers from being effective
retroactively.'*° Second, when the bankruptcy petition against EuroGas I was filed on 18
May 2004, an automatic stay came into effect under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code
preventing “any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the
estate or to exercise control over property of the estate.”'*”7 Thus, because the Joint
Resolution purports to make the merger and asset transfer effective as of 15 November

2005, when this stay was already in effect, it must be “void and without effect.”1°8

Turning to the Claimants’ allegations concerning McCallan’s acquisition of EuroGas
GmbH, the Respondent contends that this proposition only raises additional jurisdictional
problems for EuroGas.'*? According to Respondent, this theory, if believed, would mean
that on 13 July 2007, EuroGas I sold its shares in EuroGas GmbH but retained its ICSID
claim relating to the reassignment of the Mining Area, such that the ICSID claim became
alienated from the shareholding in EuroGas GmbH. 160 Therefore, the Tribunal would need
to trace each of these assets at each point in time and analyse the consequences for

jurisdiction. '°! The Respondent points specifically to four different periods of time:

a. Before 13 July 2007: assuming that EuroGas I emerged from the bankruptcy with the

d. From 4 June 2012: The Claimants allege that on 4 June 2012, EuroGas II caused
McCallan to transfer its interest in EuroGas GmbH to a Swiss subsidiary, EuroGas AG,
but they offer no information or evidence about this transaction, making it impossible

to assess its impact on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. !°

For all of these reasons, the Respondent concludes that the Claimant EuroGas does not own

the alleged investment and has no standing to bring its claims before this Tribunal. !7°

(2) Claimants’ Position

As a preliminary matter, the Claimants deny that they made any misrepresentation in this
arbitration, including with respect to the identity of the Claimant EuroGas.'”! As further
explained below, the Claimants’ position is that EuroGas “took on the surviving corporate
existence, business, and affairs” of the entity named EuroGas, Inc. that was incorporated

in 1985 (to which the Claimants refer as the “1985 Company”).!”

In response to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection based on EuroGas’ alleged lack of
standing, the Claimants submit that: (a) the Tribunal should “refrain from even
entertaining” the objection because it would be to the detriment of every interested party
and benefit only the Respondent, who would not even have standing under U.S. law to
raise the arguments it advances in this arbitration; '’’ and (b) the objection is groundless, as

EuroGas is the rightful owner of the investment.!7*

The Claimants’ first main argument is summarized as follows:

[I]f the challenge of EuroGas’ ownership interest in Rozmin were
to be accepted by the Tribunal, despite the fact that Respondent does
not have standing under U.S. law to raise this challenge and that it
would in fact be prevented in a U.S. court from doing so, the Slovak
Republic would literally be the only one to benefit from this
decision.‘

According to the Claimants, the results of the Respondent’s position would be:

a.

EuroGas’ interest in Rozmin would remain with the bankruptcy estate and never be
administered. It “would make strictly no business sense to reopen the bankruptcy
proceedings” because: (i) the estate would not have the financial means to bring this
claim against the Respondent; (ii) a trustee would not take on the burden and expense
of bringing a claim, especially because his fees would not be paid until the conclusion
of the arbitration; and (iii) selling the interest in Rozmin at auction would not generate
a worthwhile return. The asset would have little value to any entity other than the 1985
Company or “a company that had genuinely stepped into the shoes of the 1985
Company before there was even any prospect of arbitration,” because no other entity

would be considered a genuine investor with the right to bring a claim.!7°

The shareholders of the 1985 Company would own shares in a defunct company with

no assets, rather than shares in EuroGas, a company in good standing.'7”

The creditors of the 1985 Company would remain creditors of a defunct company with

no assets and have no means of recovering from EuroGas.!7*

The Respondent would never be held accountable for its breaches of international

law. !79

For these reasons, the Claimants assert that “EuroGas is the only party capable of
successfully holding the Slovak Republic liable for its breaches.”'®? The Tribunal should
therefore reject the Respondent’s objection, as it would benefit only the Respondent.'*! In
the Claimants’ view, the unreasonableness of the Respondent’s position is highlighted by
“the fact that Respondent does not have standing under U.S. law to raise this challenge and

that it would in fact be prevented in a U.S. court from doing so.”!**

The Claimants further argue that, in any event, the Respondent’s objection fails on the
merits. According to the Claimants, the 1985 Company (a) emerged from bankruptcy with
the interest in Rozmin;'** (b) was not prevented from acting to wind up its affairs;'*+ and

(c) validly merged with EuroGas to become the rightful owner of the investment.'*

On the first point, the Claimants submit that the Respondent is wrong to argue that the 1985
Company could not have emerged from the bankruptcy with its interest in Rozmin.

According to the Claimants:

Respondent relies on the strictest interpretation of the applicable
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, one which U.S. courts
themselves do not follow, and which moreover blatantly disregards
the very peculiar circumstances of this case, not to mention the very
strong policy reasons that would prohibit finding that the 1985
Company did not emerge from the Chapter 7 reorganization
process..., in disregard of the good faith interpretation required
under international law and the principle of form over substance. '*

237. The Claimants and their legal experts acknowledge that some U.S. courts have ruled that
property cannot be abandoned by a bankruptcy trustee unless it is formally scheduled in
the Bankruptcy Proceedings. '*’ However, they argue that other courts have found that
when a trustee is aware of the asset and chooses not to administer it, the asset is deemed to

have been abandoned. '** One court set forth the test as follows:

The party claiming the abandonment must demonstrate the trustee
had knowledge of the asset as property to the estate such that the
court could impute an intent to abandon the asset upon the closing
of the case. [...] The claiming party must also show an absence of
active administration of the asset at the time of the abandonment.'*°

238. Applying this test in the present case, the Claimants assert that Trustee Marker knew of
EuroGas’ interest in Rozmin and chose not to administer it; as a consequence, that interest
is deemed to have been abandoned.'” In this regard, the Claimants point out that no
schedules were filed in the Bankruptcy Proceedings, so the administration of the entire

estate was based on knowledge obtained by Trustee Marker from external sources. '?!

239. According to the Claimants and their legal experts, the following facts show that Trustee

Marker was aware, or should have been aware, of the Rozmin interest:

a. The interest was reported in EuroGas’ public SEC filings, two of which were attached
to a pleading filed in the bankruptcy case.!°? Indeed, these filings provide more

information about Rozmin than the schedule of assets would have provided.

Trustee Marker’s time records show that he reviewed tax documents relating to
EuroGas, which stated the company’s interest in EuroGas GmbH, RimaMurai, and

Rozmin.!3

Trustee Marker’s accountant, according to its time records and application for fees,
reviewed “[bJusiness records of the prior accountants ... to identify possible assets of
the company which were unknown to the Trustee,” accounting data and tax returns,

and also searched SEC filings for additional information. '**

EuroGas’ 2006 tax return, which was reviewed, signed and filed by Trustee Marker,

identified the company’s interest in Rozmin.'*>

Online news articles from September 2005, which Trustee Marker could have easily
found, report that Rozmin had challenged the Government’s decision to revoke

Rozmin’s mining rights. !°°

In response to the Respondent’s submissions regarding EuroGas’ SEC filings, the

Claimants contend that the filings from 1998 to 2006 clearly identified EuroGas’ interest

in Rozmin and the status of Rozmin’s mining rights, including the revocation of those

rights by the Government.!®” To the Claimants, it is irrelevant that the SEC filings for these

years did not report the legal challenges to the Government’s action because:

a.

the only reason such information was not included is that, until the Slovak Supreme
Court’s 27 February 2008 decision, “EuroGas had very little hope that the Slovak
Republic would acknowledge the illegality of its own decision to revoke Rozmin’s

mining rights”;!°*

b. Trustee Marker had a duty on the basis of the SEC filings “to investigate what, if
anything, he could have done, or what actions had already been undertaken to recover

Rozmin’s interest in the Deposit”; and

c. when considering a “contingent, equitable legal claim,” such as Rozmin’s claim against
the Respondent, U.S. courts have held that the level of disclosure required to establish
abandonment is “much lower.”!”°

241. The Claimants argue that Trustee Marker himself concluded that he had sufficient

information from external sources to administer the estate, and elected to close the case.2
Otherwise, he could have asked the Bankruptcy Court to hold EuroGas and its
representatives in contempt for failing to file the schedules of assets as ordered, or to
dismiss the case under Section 707(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code for “unreasonable delay
by the debtor that is prejudicial to creditors.”?"' Instead, he apparently believed that he had
the information required to fully administer the estate, declaring in his final report that he

had “faithfully and properly fulfilled the duties of the trustee.”?°

242. To the Claimants, it is clear that Trustee Marker did not actively administer the claim
against the Respondent as an asset in the Bankruptcy Proceedings. The Claimants point out
that, even though no schedules were filed, Trustee Marker located and sold EuroGas’
interest in four of its subsidiaries.?°> He did not, however, take such action with EuroGas

been reasonable, given that he did not have the time or financial resources to challenge the revocation of Rozmin’s

the chance of success of such a challenge would have seemed weak.

Marker’s decision not to actively administer EuroGas’ interest in Rozmin, it was

abandoned back to EuroGas.

243. The Claimants’ second main argument is that, despite the administrative dissolution of the
1985 Company, it was able to undertake any act necessary to wind up its affairs, including

the merger with EuroGas.

244. In this regard, the Claimants contest the opinion of the Respondent’s expert that under Utah
corporate law, a dissolved corporation has no legal existence.””° They argue that the Utah
court cases on which Ms. Jarvis relies were decided under the Utah Business Corporation
Act, which was repealed on 1 July 1992 and replaced by the Utah Revised Business
Corporation Act.7°° This point is important to the Claimants because under the previous
law, a dissolved corporation could only pursue a claim that arose prior to its dissolution,
and only if the action was initiated within two years after dissolution. On the other hand,
the current law allows a corporation to undertake any act necessary to wind up its affairs,

and it does not contain a two-year limitation on legal actions.”

245. The Claimants also contest the Respondent’s arguments relating to U.S. Bankruptcy law.
They submit that the Bankruptcy Proceedings could not prevent EuroGas from acting to

wind up its affairs for the following reasons:

a. Bankruptcies cannot cause the dissolution of a company because they are governed by
USS. federal law, whereas the creation and dissolution of corporate entities is governed

by state law.

in dissolution, but the preparatory works of that law contemplate the survival of the

debtor, stating: “[i]n adopting section 727(a)(1), Congress intended that corporate debt
would survive Chapter 7 proceedings and be charged against the corporation when it
resumed operations.”

The majority of case law, including a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, has
confirmed that Chapter 7 proceedings do not dissolve a corporation. The cases cited by

the Respondent are “outlier decisions” that have been subject to criticism.?!”

Ms. Jarvis’ position is nonsensical and inconsistent with her recognition that property
can be abandoned back to the debtor after the conclusion of the Chapter 7

proceeding.!!

Therefore, according to the Claimants, nothing prevented the 1985 Company from taking
action to wind up its affairs, including selling assets or undergoing a merger. EuroGas did

both:

On July 13, 2007, the 1985 Company sold its interest in EuroGas
GmbH to a third party company, namely McCallan Oil & Gas (UK)
... EuroGas thereafter acquired the entirety of McCallan’s issued
shares, and ultimately, on June 4, 2012, caused McCallan to
transfer its interest in EuroGas GmbH, and thus Rozmin, to its new
Swiss subsidiary, EuroGas AG.

Further, in order to complete the winding up process, and at the
same time maintain the interest of its shareholders, the 1985
Company validly merged with EuroGas on July 31, 2008.?'?

Relying on the Joint Resolution entered into by the directors of the two EuroGas companies

reorganization whereby EuroGas assumed all of the assets, liabilities and issued stock

certificates of the 1985 Company.”?!?

The Claimants submit that the two EuroGas companies merged pursuant to the common
law doctrine of “de facto merger.”*'* They contend that the Respondent’s arguments
challenging the validity of this merger are “convoluted and/or formal” and must fail for a

number of reasons. 7/5

First, according to the Claimants, nothing in the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act
prevents a dissolved corporation from merging with another corporation; rather, the law
expressly allows a corporation to take any “act necessary to wind up and liquidate its
business and affairs” and specifies that “dissolution of a corporation does not ... prevent

transfer of its shares or securities.”?!°

Further, the Claimants argue that the requirement of registering a merger with the Utah
Division of Corporations is mandatory only in the case of statutory mergers (as opposed to
common law mergers).”!7 According to the Claimants, the validity of such non-statutory
and de facto mergers is recognized in the official commentary to Utah’s corporate statute,
which states that a “transaction may have the same economic effect as a statutory merger
even though it is cast in the form of a non-statutory transaction.”?'* The Claimants cite
Utah court decisions holding that a dissolved corporation had undergone a de facto merger

with a corporation in good standing, just as they argue occurred in the EuroGas merger.?!?

251. According to the Claimants’ legal experts, there are four factors that must be satisfied for
a de facto merger to be valid under common law, and they are all met in this case. In

particular:

a. continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets and general business
operation: As specified in the Joint Resolution, the two EuroGas companies share the

same directors and officers, principle place of business and assets.°

b. continuity of shareholders: The Joint Resolution states that EuroGas “shall have the
same shareholders as the Predecessor Corporation, and in the same denominations” and
that EuroGas “shall fully and completely recognize and honor the Predecessor
Corporation’s shareholders as its own.”??! This is confirmed by the 2011 share ledger

of EuroGas.?2?

c. cessation of ordinary business by the predecessor: The 1985 Company had already

been dissolved and with the merger it completed its winding up and “ceased to exist
entirely.”?2>

d. assumption of successor liability: The Joint Resolution states that “all assets, liabilities,

rights privileges, and obligations of Predecessor Corporation are in fact the assets,

liabilities, rights privileges, and obligations of [EuroGas].”?*4

252. On the basis of the above, the Claimants’ legal experts opine that Utah courts would affirm
this merger, especially given that “all parties with an interest in the 1985 Company,
EuroGas, or the merger between the two, have benefitted from said merger.”225

on EuroGas’ assets through the Chapter 7 proceeding, the merger is not valid. The
Claimants point out that the Joint Resolution was entered into in July 2008, more than one
year after the stay had been lifted on 19 March 2007, and therefore could not have
interfered with the automatic stay.??° In any event, even if the Joint Resolution could not
have had retroactive effect, the merger would still have been validly completed on 31 July

2008.

254. For these reasons, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to deny the Respondent’s first
jurisdictional objection relating to EuroGas.

B. Denial of Benefits to EuroGas
(dd) Respondent’s Position

255. The Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection relating to EuroGas is based on the
“denial of benefits clause” found in Article I.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT:

Each Party reserves the right to deny to any company the
advantages of this Treaty if nationals of any third country control
such company and, in the case of a company of the other Party, that
company has no substantial business activities in the territory of the
other Party.

256. The Respondent asserts that it validly denied the benefits of the US-Slovakia BIT to
EuroGas pursuant to this provision.?7”

257. In the Respondent’s view, this denial of benefits clause covers all “advantages of this
Treaty” and therefore applies to the right to the procedural benefits of the BIT, including
the right to initiate international arbitration.??* The Respondent points out that the
Claimants do not dispute this.??? As a result, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione
voluntatis over EuroGas’s claims.

According to the Respondent, the two requirements for a denial of benefits set forth in
Article I.2 are met in this case: (a) EuroGas is controlled by a national of a third country,

and (b) it has no substantial business activities in the territory of the United States.?*°

Regarding the first requirement, the Respondent notes that the Claimants have not disputed
that EuroGas is controlled by Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, a national of Germany.*! In addition,
the Respondent points to the following facts, which in its view demonstrate Mr. Rauball’s

control of the company:

a. Mr. Rauball has consistently held the key executive positions in EuroGas II (including
CEO, President and Director). In particular, he held these positions when the
Respondent denied the benefits of the US-Slovakia BIT in 2012.7*?

b. Mr. Rauball has been EuroGas’s largest shareholder, holding 27% of its stock in 2009
and 30% in 2010.75

c. EuroGas’ 2009 SEC annual report states that the company is “dependent on the services
of Wolfgang Rauball, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company” and that

Mr. Rauball had personally guaranteed investments by creditors.?*4

With respect to the second requirement in Article I.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT, that the
relevant company “has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party,”

the Respondent asserts that:

EuroGas II has provided no documentary evidence showing
anything remotely close to “substantial business activity” in the
U.S., and all the evidence points to the opposite conclusion:

EuroGas II lacks any physical presence in the U.S., and it has no

261. To support this position, the Respondent alleges the following facts:?*°

a. Under Utah corporate law, EuroGas I was dissolved in 2001.37

b. EuroGas I entered a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding in 2004 during which all of its
assets (none of which were based in the United States) were auctioned off. The

company became legally “defunct” after the bankruptcy.?**

d. From the time EuroGas II was created in 2005 to the present, there is no evidence that

either EuroGas entity conducted material operations in the United States. Indeed,

EuroGas has acknowledged that it is managed from its “North American Headquarters”

in Canada and its “Central European Headquarters,” and that “Austria and Switzerland

have more recently been its principal places of business.”*4?

g. EuroGas has not filed the audited financial statements required by U.S. law for fiscal

h. According to the Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. Report, EuroGas has been inactive since at

least 2 December 2010.744

262. The Respondent argues that none of the three activities cited by the Claimants could

amount to “substantial business activities” in the United States:?4°

a. Lawsuit between Tombstone Exploration Corporation (“TEC”) and EuroGas: this
lawsuit concerns a breach of contract claim brought by TEC against EuroGas, first in
2014 and then refiled on 25 March 2015. TEC claims that EuroGas entered into an
agreement to provide financing for TEC’s exploration activities in the United States in
exchange for stock in TEC, but then failed to perform its obligation. According to the
Respondent, this only further demonstrates EuroGas’ lack of substantial business

activities in the United States.74°

b. EuroGas’ shareholding in TEC: TEC is a Canadian company with no operating
revenues and significant losses.24”7 In any event, EuroGas’ substantial business
activities cannot be established by the activities of another company. As held by the
tribunal in Pac Rim v. El Salvador, it is the claimant itself which must be shown to

have substantial business activities in the relevant territory.7*

c. The business activities of EuroGas Silver and Gold Inc., a Nevada corporation
(“ESG”): Similarly, the Claimants cannot rely on the activities of ESG to defeat the
Respondent’s denial-of-benefits.”“? This is especially true because ESG is not owned
directly by the Claimant EuroGas, but is rather a “low-level subsidiary” owned through
EuroGas AG, a Swiss subsidiary.?°° In any event, the Claimants have offered no

evidence of any operational activity of ESG, other than Mr. Rauball’s statements.?>!

Nor is the Respondent convinced by the Claimants’ arguments that EuroGas is a “junior
mining company.” In the Respondent’s view, EuroGas does not carry out any of the
activities that the Claimants attribute to junior mining companies (e.g., raising capital,

exploring deposits, securing mining rights) in the United States.*°?

For these reasons, the Respondent submits the Claimants have failed to show that EuroGas
has any substantial business activities in the United States, despite the fact that the
Claimants bear the burden of proof on this issue, as recognized by the Tribunal in

Procedural Order No. 4.?°

The Respondent states that it does not understand the Claimants’ argument that the
Respondent did not attempt to “discharge its burden of proof” on the issue of substantial
business activities until the Counter-Memorial. Aside from the question of who bears the
burden of proof, Article 41 of the ICSID Convention clearly states that an objection to

jurisdiction or admissibility may be raised in the counter-memorial.7**

Therefore, according to the Respondent, the two requirements of Article I.2 of the US-

of the BIT on 21 December 2012. The Respondent submits that this denial of benefits was

valid and timely.”°°

In this regard, the Respondent disputes the proposition that such a denial of benefits can
have only prospective effect. Relying on Ulysseas v. Ecuador, Pac Rim v. El Salvador and
Guaracachi v. Bolivia, the Respondent asserts that tribunals in recent cases have
interpreted denial of benefits clauses to have retroactive effect, and have also confirmed
that States may deny an investor the right to arbitrate up until the filing of the counter-
memorial.?°° Therefore, according to the Respondent, it could have denied benefits to

EuroGas as late as its Counter-Memorial in this case.

The Respondent further asserts that, in any event, even if Article 1.2 of the US-Slovakia
BIT could not be applied retroactively, the Respondent still validly denied EuroGas the
right to arbitration, by doing so prospectively.>’ It denied EuroGas this right by letter of
21 December 2012, more than one year before the Claimants filed their Request for

Arbitration.”* That letter states:

[P]ursuant to Article I(2) of the Treaty, the Slovak Republic hereby
exercises as of today, 21 December 2012, its right to deny EuroGas,
Inc. the benefits of the Treaty, including the right to arbitration
under Article VI of the Treaty.*°

Indeed, according to the Respondent, it is “the first country to deny benefits under an

investment treaty prior to the commencement of arbitration.”?©°

Republic’s offer to arbitrate before this denial of benefits. First, there is a distinction
between when EuroGas agreed to arbitration (the 31 October 2011 letter) and when it
exercised the right to arbitrate (the Request for Arbitration). To the Respondent, the critical
question is whether the Slovak Republic denied the right to arbitrate before that right was
actually exercised, which it did.?°! Second, EuroGas did not in any event validly agree to
arbitration by its 31 October 2011 letter because that letter did not specify a choice of

arbitration forum, as required under Article IV of the US-Slovakia BIT.2

271. Finally, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have adopted an overly-restrictive
interpretation of the denial of benefits clause, which should be rejected. The Respondent

addresses three specific aspects of the Claimants’ interpretation:

a. The Claimants are wrong to suggest that the denial of benefits clause applies only to
“shell” or “sham” companies. There is nothing in the language of Article I.2 that would
limit its application to particular types of companies. In fact, by its express terms, the
clause could apply to a company that is active in one country but not in the territory of

the relevant treaty party.*® In any event, “EuroGas II indeed is no more than a sham

company with no demonstrable business activities.”**

b. The Claimants attempt to read the word “substantial” out of the text of the clause. This

approach runs counter to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties

(the “WCLT”).?° The ordinary meaning of “substantial” is “real and material.”?°°

Therefore, Article I.2 “requires an assessment of the nature of the business of the

company at stake and review the quality of its activities.”

c. The Claimants make a novel argument that it is sufficient for a company to carry out
substantial business activities at any point in time. However, as held by the tribunal in
Ulysseas v. Ecuador, the relevant time for the fulfilment of the requirements for a valid
denial of benefits is the time of the notice of arbitration.?** Applying that test, the
Respondent has shown that EuroGas has not had any substantial business activities in
the United States since its incorporation in 2005. Therefore, the requirements for a valid

denial of benefits were satisfied at all relevant times.”

(2) Claimants’ Position

272. The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s objection based on Article I.2 of the US-
Slovakia BIT is inadmissible and, in any event, meritless because the Respondent has failed
to meet its burden of proving that EuroGas “has no substantial business activities” in the

territory of the United States.?”

273. The Claimants’ first main argument is that “this jurisdictional objection should be declared
inadmissible and/or deemed to have been waived by the Slovak Republic,” as the
Respondent did not attempt to demonstrate that the conditions under Article I.2 of the US-
Slovakia BIT were satisfied until its Counter-Memorial, despite repeated invitations from

the Claimants to do so in earlier submissions.?”!

raised in limine litis in order to be admissible,” and therefore the Respondent should have

attempted to discharge its burden of proof at the earliest opportunity?”

Moreover, in the present case, the Respondent’s delay puts the Claimants at a procedural
disadvantage that could result in an irreparable infringement of their due process rights.?”
This, according to the Claimants, is because they have been “forced to preemptively
address matters for which Respondent bears the burden of proof” in their Reply and will
not have the opportunity to address in writing the Respondent’s response. A decision to
admit the Respondent’s objection “would essentially be rewarding Respondent for its

recurrent failure to meet its procedural obligations.”?”*

The Claimants’ alternative position is that, even if the Respondent’s objection is deemed
admissible, it must fail on the merits. In the Claimants’ view, the burden of proving that
EuroGas “has no substantial business activities” in the territory of the United States lies
with the Respondent, and the Respondent has entirely failed to discharge this burden. The

Claimants offer three main arguments to support this view.

First, the Claimants submit that EuroGas does not fall into the very narrow category of
claimants that the parties to the US-Slovakia BIT intended to be covered by Article 1.2. In
accordance with the VCLT, that provision must be interpreted in light of its “object and
purpose.”?”> According to the Claimants, the object and purpose of denial of benefits
clauses in United States BITs is reflected in the amicus curiae submission of the United
States in Pac Rim v. El Salvador.2”° In that submission, the United States indicated that
such provisions are meant “to safeguard against the potential problem of ‘free rider’
investors, i.e., third-party entities that may only as a matter of formality be entitled to the

benefits of a particular agreement,” and that they allow a treaty party “to deny benefits to

an enterprise if it is merely a ‘sham company’ having no ‘substantial business activities’ in

the ... country in which it is established.”?””

To the Claimants, it follows that the object and purpose of Article I.2 is to prevent “treaty
shopping.” The intended application is limited to companies that are formally incorporated
in a particular State in order to take advantage of the relevant treaty. It would be
“nonsensical” to suggest that EuroGas, which has been operating in the United States for
20 years (first as the 1985 Company and then as the Claimant EuroGas), was incorporated

in order to secure the advantages of the US-Slovakia BIT.””

In this regard, the Claimants assert that EuroGas is unlike the claimant in Pac Rim v. El
Salvador. In particular, until 2011, EuroGas was registered with the SEC and had publicly
traded stock, and today it still has hundreds of shareholders.?”? Notably, after 2011,
EuroGas “continued to own its U.S. assets, namely EuroGas Silver & Gold and Tombstone,

both of which conducted mining exploration activities in the U.S.”?°°

The Claimants’ second argument is that the Respondent has failed to show how its
“disjointed allegations” regarding EuroGas demonstrate an absence of business activities,
as required by Article I.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT.?*! According to the Claimants, these
allegations are irrelevant in assessing EuroGas’ main business and reflect a

misunderstanding of junior mining companies. In particular, the Claimants assert that:

a. The absence of operational revenues is to be expected “because the accumulation of
substantial losses is inherent to the very nature of the activity of junior mining

companies.”*?

requisite “substantial business activities” at any time during the life of the investment, that
“in itself would demonstrate a high level of commitment to the country’s economy.”°’ To
deny such an investor the benefits of the US-Slovakia BIT on the basis of a formal
requirement would run counter to the BIT’s object and purpose, which, as reflected in its

once the existence of substantial business activities has been

very least at the time of the initial investment ... any purported
attempt to invoke the denial of benefits clause would go against the

conclusion would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty,

cease having any substantial activities in the U.S.?°°

that EuroGas lacked substantial business activities in the territory of the United States in

Ratione Temporis Application of the Canada-Slovakia BIT
(dd) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis over Belmont
finds its basis in Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, which limits the treaty’s
application “to any dispute that has arisen not more than three years prior to its entry into
force.” The Respondent submits that because the Canada-Slovakia BIT entered into force
on 14 March 2012, it covers only disputes arising after 14 March 2009, and the Tribunal
therefore lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis over Belmont in relation to any dispute arising

before that date.”?!

In applying Article 15(6) to Belmont’s claims in this arbitration, the Respondent asserts
that the Claimants advance two distinct types of claims: (a) one for the Respondent’s
wrongful reassignment of Rozmin’s mining rights in 2005 (referred to by the Respondent

as the “Reassignment Claim”); and (b) another for the Respondent’s failure to remedy the

wrongful reassignment through its administrative and judicial processes (referred to by the

Respondent as the “Denial-of-Justice Claim”).?°?

286. The Respondent’s primary argument is that the “real cause” of this dispute is the
reassignment of the Mining Area in 2005; the decisions of Slovak administrative and

judicial authorities at issue in this case cannot be considered a separate dispute.?”*

287. In this regard, the Respondent relies on Lucchetti v. Peru, in which the tribunal found that
it lacked jurisdiction ratione temporis to hear a dispute with the same subject matter as a
dispute that arose before the relevant treaty came into force.” The tribunal considered the
critical inquiry to be “whether or not the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier
dispute continued to be central to the later dispute.”*?> Applying this test to the present
case, the Respondent argues that the Slovak administrative and judicial proceedings

“merely continued the earlier dispute.”?°°

288. The Respondent finds further support for this approach in Phosphates in Morocco, in which
the PCIJ drew a distinction between the “real causes of the dispute” and “subsequent
factors which either presume the existence or are merely the confirmation or development
of earlier situations or facts.”?°’ The court found that the real cause of the dispute before it

was the alleged expropriation, not the subsequent administrative and judicial processes

of an earlier claim can give rise to a new investment dispute. Claimants rely solely on

objective analysis shows that this dispute arose upon the reassignment of the Mining

Area.*°

291. However, the Respondent does acknowledge that the ICJ and investment tribunals have in
some cases applied a “more demanding” standard in identifying the time at which a dispute
arises, requiring that the parties have articulated their disagreement.*° According to the
Respondent, even under this standard, the dispute in the present case arose in 2005, when
Rozmin initiated proceedings in the Slovak courts and clearly expressed its disagreement
with the reassignment of the Mining Area.*°” For the Respondent, it is irrelevant that
Rozmin is not a claimant in this arbitration, especially since Belmont and Rozmin both

acted through Mr. Agyagos.*°*

292. Further, the Respondent argues that the present dispute was articulated in terms of

international investment law beginning in 2005, as follows:

a. Ina letter to the DMO of 13 January 2005, Rozmin complained of the withdrawal of
its rights and, after referring to the Canada-Slovakia BIT, stated: “It is undisputable

that the unlawful withdrawal of the excavation area ... is in conflict with the stated

international treaties that have precedence over the Slovak laws.”?°°

b. Ina letter to the Slovak Minister of Economy of 3 November 2005, Mr. Agyagos (as
Belmont’s President and CEO) challenged the reassignment and threatened arbitration

under bilateral investment treaties.*!°

c. In a letter of 22 September 2008, EuroGas GmbH also threatened to bring an

international investment claim.*!!

293. Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that Belmont’s own words contradict the Claimants’
position that the dispute arose after 1 August 2012, when the local Slovak proceedings
were concluded. In Claimants’ notice of dispute of 23 December 2013, the Claimants refer
to EuroGas’ notice of dispute of 2011 and state that “Belmont’s claims are the very same

as those of EuroGas.”3!?

294. In light of these facts, the Respondent concludes that there is no doubt that the dispute
leading to the Reassignment Claim arose before 14 March 2009 when the Canada-Slovakia
BIT first began to apply.

295. In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants try to avoid this clear result by improperly
conflating the words “arise” and “initiate” under the Canada-Slovakia BIT.*? However,
the Canada-Slovakia BIT intentionally distinguishes between the time when a dispute is
initiated (by being notified to the State under the terms of the treaty), and the time when it

arises, which logically must precede its initiation.*!*

296. Turning specifically to what Respondent calls the Claimants’ “Denial-of-Justice Claim,”

the Respondent states:

Once the dispute over the reassignment of the Excavation Area was
submitted to the Slovak Republic’s administrative and judicial
authorities, the treatment by these authorities may only give rise to
a claim for denial of justice.?'*

297. According to the Respondent, the tribunal lacks jurisdiction over any
administrative/judicial actions prior to 14 March 2009. Thus, the Respondent identifies just
four events occurring after that date: (a) the Regional Court decision of 3 February 2010,
(b) the Supreme Court decision of 18 May 2011, (c) the DMO’s reassignment on 30 March
2012, and (d) the MMO’s confirmation of that assignment on 1 August 2012.3!° However,
for the Respondent, the fact remains that “the reassignment of Rozmin’s Excavation Area

in 2005 is the one and only source of this dispute.”?!”

298. Finally, the Respondent addresses the Claimants’ argument that the Respondent is estopped
from raising its objection ratione temporis against Belmont because it “represented, as late
as in May 2012, that the dispute was not yet ripe and that the filing of the arbitration should
therefore be delayed.”*'* In Respondent’ s view, none of the three requirements for estoppel

under international law is met in this case:*!

a. First, there is no clear statement of fact. In the 2 May 2012 letter upon which the
Claimants rely, the Respondent never stated that the “dispute was not ripe,” as the
Claimants allege. Even if this statement had been made, it would be merely a legal

characterisation, not a statement of fact.>2°

c. Third, there was no good faith reliance on the Respondent’s statement.°*”? In fact,
Belmont could not have relied on any statement in the 2 May 2012 letter, because that

letter related only to EuroGas’ claims brought under the US-Slovakia BIT.

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that Belmont could have initiated its investment treaty
claims under the previous BIT between Canada and the Slovak Republic, which was
effective from 30 January 2001 until 14 March 2012, the period when most of the alleged
events relating to Belmont’s claims occurred.*?? Nothing prevented Belmont from
initiating international arbitration immediately after the reassignment of the Mining Area,
whether in parallel or in lieu of Rozmin’s domestic proceedings.*™ In particular, Article
X(5) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT did not restrict Belmont’s choice because Rozmin was
not seeking monetary damages. Indeed, for the Respondent, Article X(5) only confirms

that a treaty claim can arise before the conclusion of local proceedings.*”°

According to the Respondent, Belmont had more than seven years to seek recourse to
arbitration under the previous Canada-Slovakia BIT, and by waiting, it assumed the risk
that its claim would be time-barred.*”° This principle was recently upheld by the tribunal
in Ping An v. Belgium, which held that disputes already notified to the host State, but not
yet submitted to arbitration when a successive investment treaty came into force, fell
outside of the tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis. For the Respondent, the same is true

here.*?”

(b) although certain events giving rise to this dispute occurred before the critical date of 14

March 2009, the dispute arose only thereafter.*”°

302. In connection with the estoppel argument, the Claimants point primarily to a letter of
2 May 2012 from Mr. Peter Kazimir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance
of the Slovak Republic, sent in response to EuroGas’ notice of dispute dated
31 October 2011.**° According to the Claimants, Mr. KaZimir stated that the dispute was
not yet ripe because local proceedings were pending, and it would therefore be premature

to engage in settlement negotiations.**!
303. In light of this statement by the Respondent, the Claimants’ position is that:

Respondent cannot, state, in 2012, that the dispute related to the
revocation of Rozmin’s mining rights is not ripe for arbitration as
long as local proceedings are ongoing, and then, in 2014, once the
domestic proceedings have reached a close, argue that Belmont
should already have initiated proceedings concurrently with
Rozmin’s domestic proceedings. Respondent’s position is
inconsistent and Respondent is therefore estopped from raising, in
the proceedings, any timing issue with respect to the initiation of the
proceedings.***

initiation of proceedings, even after the Claimants sent the Respondent a “Final Notice of

305. In any event, in the Claimants’ view, even if the Tribunal were to determine that the
Respondent is not estopped from raising this jurisdictional objection, the objection should

still be dismissed.**4

306. The Claimants accept that under Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, the dispute
itself must have arisen after 14 March 2009.**> However, unlike the Respondent, their
position is that the dispute arose only after that critical date. The Claimants raise five main

arguments to contest the Respondent’s position.

307. First, the Claimants argue that the Respondent mistakenly focuses on the events leading up
to the dispute, when the only relevant factor in determining whether the Tribunal has
jurisdiction ratione temporis is the time when the dispute itself arises.**° In this regard, the
Claimants point to Maffezini v. Spain, in which the tribunal held that it had jurisdiction
ratione temporis because, even though the events giving rise to the dispute predated the

entry into force of the relevant treaty, the dispute itself did not arise until after that date.**”
308. The Claimants also cite Professors Dolzer and Schreuer’s statement that:

The time of the dispute is not identical with the time of the events
leading to the dispute. By definition, the allegedly illegal acts must
have occurred some time before the dispute. Therefore, the
exclusion of disputes occurring before the treaty’s entry into force
should not be read as excluding jurisdiction over events occurring
before that date.***

According to the Claimants, this important distinction is reflected in the text of
Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, which provides that the treaty “shall apply to
any dispute which has arisen not more than three years prior to its entry into force.”?*? In
contrast, the Claimants point out that the PCIJ’s jurisdiction in Phosphates of Morocco
depended on the time at which the “situations or facts” leading up to the dispute
occurred.*“° Similarly, in African Holding v. Congo, the tribunal explained that it was the
date of the events leading up to the dispute, rather than the dispute itself, which was
determinative of its jurisdiction.**! Therefore, the Respondent’s reliance on these cases is

entirely misplaced.

In the Claimants’ view, the DMO’s reassignment of the Mining Area to Economy Agency
on 3 May 2005 is merely an event leading up to the dispute and is thus “perfectly irrelevant”
to determining whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis.**” Similarly, the fact
that on 16 March 2009 Mr. Agyagos referred to “direct damage” caused by the Slovak
Republic is immaterial, given that damage may be — and often is — incurred before a dispute

arises.

Second, contrary to the Respondent’s position, the Claimants submit that the parties’
formulation of opposing views and articulation of claims in terms of international
investment law are critical in determining when the dispute arose.*4? The Claimants point
to the requirement in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention that the “dispute must concern
the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation.” They assert that tribunals have

repeatedly held that “the decisive factor in determining the legal nature of the dispute was

“the claim of one Party was positively opposed by the other.”*“° As stated by the tribunal
in RDC v. Guatemala, a dispute is “a conflict of views on points of law or fact which

requires sufficient communication between the parties for each to know the other’s views

317. Also in this context, the Claimants oppose the Respondent’s interpretation of the Canada-

it “arises.” According to the Claimants, under Article X(2) of that treaty, “the outset of the

one party articulates its claims, which triggers the parties’ duty to engage in settlement

Belmont’s Ownership of the Investment
(dd) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s jurisdictional objection relating to Belmont’s standing is that this
Claimant no longer holds any shares in Rozmin and cannot bring a claim on the basis of an
alleged investment it does not own. Belmont therefore “has no standing to bring its claims,

and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione materiae over them.”**!

According to the Respondent, Belmont sold its 57% interest in Rozmin to EuroGas I
through a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated as of 27 March 2001 (the “SPA”).*©? The
date of the SPA is important to the Respondent, who asserts that the agreement was
executed at a time when EuroGas I still had the legal capacity to enter the SPA, before the

company was dissolved and before it entered the Bankruptcy Proceedings.*

To support this jurisdictional objection, the Respondent relies on the analysis of the SPA
provided by its expert on British Columbia Law (which governs the SPA), as well as on

certain public statements and actions of EuroGas and Belmont after the SPA’s execution.*™

The Respondent and its expert oppose the Claimants’ argument that Belmont still owns the
shares in Rozmin, as certain conditions precedent provided in the SPA were unfulfilled.
The analysis of the Respondent’s expert focuses in particular on Sections 2.1, 4.1, and 6.1

of the SPA:

a. Section 2.1(a) requires EuroGas to transfer 12,000,000 of its common shares (the

“Purchase Price Shares”) to Belmont. Under Section 6.1 of the SPA, this is a

361 Counter-Memorial 1142. See Rejoinder ILA.

condition precedent to closing of the sale. It is undisputed that this condition was

satisfied 56°

b. Section 2.1(e) requires EuroGas to pay Belmont a USD 100,000.00 non-refundable
advance royalty. Under Section 6.1 of the SPA, this too is a condition precedent to
closing of the sale. The Claimants acknowledge that at least USD 74,000.00 was paid,
and in fact, Belmont’s audited financial statements show, effectively, that the entire

amount was paid.*°

c. Section 2.1(b), (c) and (d) are obligations that “need only be undertaken, not actually
be performed, before the 57% interest transfers.”*“’ This interpretation is confirmed by
the language of the provision and the nature of the obligations. For example, Section
2.1(d) grants to Belmont a 2% royalty on “the gross sale revenue of any talc sold
[during] the mining life of the deposit.” The only condition to closing is the grant of a

2% royalty; the payment of the royalty could not take place until later, after closing.*°

d. Sections 4.1(b) and (c) provide that EuroGas will issue additional shares to Belmont in
certain circumstances following the closing. EuroGas did issue 3,830,000 additional

shares to Belmont under Subsection 4.1(b).°

e. Section 4.1(d) states that EuroGas I “agrees to arrange the necessary financing.”>”°

EuroGas obviously met this requirement by signing the SPA. If EuroGas could not
arrange financing, it was to “pay [Belmont] an advance royalty of USD 10,000.00 per
month.” Any failure to pay that monthly royalty would not prevent the closing of the

sale, although it might be grounds for a breach of contract claim by Belmont.

Section 6.1 states that ownership of the 57% interest in Rozmin will not pass to
EuroGas “unless and until [Belmont] has received 125% of its initial investment equal
to CDN $3,000,000 through the sale of the Purchase Price Shares.” However, “it is
clear that the words cannot be given their plain meaning” because that would lead to a
commercially absurd result: after receiving payment, Belmont could prevent the
transaction by simply selling the shares for less, or not at all.*”! Further, there is a
disconnect between Section 6.1 and Subsections 4.1(b) and (c). To reconcile this,
Section 6.1 should be read to provide that “the shares to the 57% interest remain with
Belmont as collateral, which secures EuroGas I’s obligation to issue additional shares

under Subsections 4.1(b) and (c).”°7?

Based on this analysis, the Respondent concludes that Belmont transferred its 57% stake
in Rozmin to EuroGas at the time of closing, retaining only a security interest in those

shares to secure EuroGas’ compliance with other covenants in the SPA.*7

According to the Respondent, this conclusion is consistent with the fact that the Claimants
have repeatedly declared that Belmont sold the 57% interest to EuroGas, including on the

following occasions:

Belmont’s 2002 audited financial statements stated that Belmont “sold its 57% interest
in Rozmin s.r.o. effective 27 March 2001 ... and holds the shares as a collateral measure

only.”374

In September 2004, Belmont alleged a breach of the SPA and threatened to “repossess”

its shares from Rozmin but then agreed not to “foreclose” on the collateral interest.*”°

Belmont and EuroGas I entered into a letter agreement on 24 September 2004, in which

they recognized “EuroGas, Inc.’s 57% interest in Rozmin s.r.0.”*7”

Mr. Vojtech Agyagos, President and Director of Belmont, testified before Slovak
criminal authorities that Belmont “sold its shares probably in 2002 to EuroGas” and
“did not suffer any direct damage” from the Respondent’s acts alleged in this

arbitration.*”*

On 17 August 2013, Mr. Alexander Danicek, an executive of Rozmin from 2008 to
2014, stated before Austrian criminal authorities that EuroGas owned a 90% share in

Rozmin.*”

Claimants have stated that Belmont will receive just a 3.5% interest in any award in

this case and that it will not cover any of the arbitration costs.**°

EuroGas AG informed the German Stock Market that EuroGas had acquired an

additional 57% of the shares of Rozmin.**!

The Respondent acknowledges that Belmont has also made statements conflicting with
those above. However, “[t]he fact that Belmont both claimed and denied ownership

the doubt.”38? The Claimants bear the burden of establishing the factual basis of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and Belmont cannot rely on its ownership in Rozmin after having

repeatedly admitted that it does not own Rozmin.

According to the Respondent, its position is also supported by the actions of EuroGas and
Belmont. After receiving the EuroGas shares as consideration for the 57% transfer,
Belmont sold them to a third Party.*** Similarly, EuroGas claims to have granted an
irrevocable option on the 57% interest in Rozmin to Protec Industries, Inc. and then

transferred it to EuroGas GmbH.***

Respondent further argues that none of the other facts alleged by the Claimants demonstrate
that Belmont retained ownership of the Rozmin interest. First, in the Respondent’s view, it
is “legally irrelevant” that Belmont is registered as a shareholder of Rozmin.**° Under the
Slovak Commercial Code in effect when the SPA was executed, “the registration of the
change in ownership of shares in a limited liability company was not dispositive of
ownership.”**° Second, the appointment of Mr. Agyagos to the board of EuroGas only
undermines the Claimants’ position, as it was precisely Belmont’s shareholding in EuroGas
— acquired through the SPA — that gave Belmont the right to appoint a director.**” Similarly,
“Belmont’s injections of working capital into the Gemerska Poloma project are fully
consistent with Belmont’s new position as shareholder of EuroGas I,” particularly because

Belmont was to receive a royalty based on revenues from the project.>**

In addition, the Respondent challenges the Claimants’ legal argument that even if Belmont
held the shares in Rozmin only as collateral, the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction over

Belmont. The Respondent contends that:

a. If Belmont held only a collateral security interest, then it would be nothing more than
a creditor of EuroGas. As held by the tribunal in Burimi v. Albania, the creditor of an
investor has no standing to bring claims for losses suffered by the investor. This is true

even if the creditor holds the investment as collateral.**

b. Belmont’s collateral security interest would not qualify as an “investment” under the
Salini test, as it “involves no transfer of economic value from Belmont to the Slovak
Republic, no effective contribution over a period of time, and no contribution to the

development of the Slovak Republic’s economy.”?°°

Finally, the Respondent submits that even if EuroGas did not acquire legal title to the 57%
interest in Rozmin under the SPA, at a minimum it became the beneficial owner of that
interest. Therefore, in accordance with the general principle of law that “the beneficial (and
not the nominal) owner of property is the real Party-in-interest before an international

court,” Belmont would still not have standing to bring its claims before this Tribunal.*?!

(2) Claimants’ Position

In response to the Respondent’s submissions relating to the SPA, the Claimants argue that
(a) Belmont remains the owner of a 57% interest in Rozmin because certain conditions for

The Claimants submit that Belmont never transferred its shares in Rozmin to EuroGas
under the SPA because neither the conditions set forth in Article 2 of the SPA nor the

condition precedent stipulated in Article 6.1 were fulfilled.*”?

First, the Claimants point out that Article 2(1)(a) and (e) of the SPA required EuroGas to
transfer the Purchase Price Shares to Belmont, and to pay Belmont a non-refundable
advance royalty of USD 100,000.00.°%* In turn, under Article 6.1, Belmont was to deliver
to a trust all documentation necessary for the transfer of its shares in Rozmin. According
to the Claimants, while EuroGas did transfer the common shares to Belmont, it fell short
on the advance royalty payment by approximately USD 26,000.00. Therefore, Belmont
never delivered the transfer documentation to the trust, and the shares were not

transferred.*?°

The Claimants contest the opinion of the Respondent’s expert that Belmont waived the
shortfall on the advance royalty payment.*”° They assert that none of the correspondence
cited by Mr. Anderson supports his assumption, and “there is no ground to assume an

implicit waiver of any of the conditions stipulated in the SPA.”*°”

Second, the Claimants point to Article 2.1(d) of the SPA, which provided that EuroGas
would pay Belmont a 2% royalty on the revenue of any talc sold over the life of the
Gemerska Poloma deposit. The Claimants argue that since the deposit never went into

commercial production, EuroGas was unable to pay the 2% royalty. Further, it did not

of the Shares shall not pass to the Purchaser [...] unless and until the Vendor has received
125% of its initial investment equal to CND $3,000,000 through the sale of the Purchase
Price Shares.” According to the Claimants, this condition precedent was never satisfied. In
2002, EuroGas issued Belmont an additional 3,830,000 restricted shares, but by 31 January
2006, Belmont had recovered only USD 1,505,400.00. The Claimants point out that the
Respondent expressly acknowledged this fact in its Application for Provisional

Measures.*””

337. In addition to these contractual arguments, the Claimants submit that, in any event, after
EuroGas’ dissolution in 2001, it could no longer acquire Belmont’s shares in Rozmin.
Under Utah law “‘a dissolved company may enter into agreements after its dissolution only

for purposes of winding up and liquidating its business and affairs. That does not include

acquiring new assets or issuing new shares.”*°”

338. According to the Claimants, in correspondence beginning in October 2003, Belmont and
EuroGas acknowledged that Belmont had never transferred the 57% interest in Rozmin to

EuroGas.*°! For example, on 18 June 2004, Belmont threatened to “offer for sale [its] 57%

Therefore, the Claimants conclude that Belmont remains the owner of its shares in Rozmin.
The Claimants highlight that Belmont is still today a registered shareholder of Rozmin.*°
Further, EuroGas never acted as the beneficial owner of Belmont’s interest in Rozmin.**
Belmont remained active in Rozmin’s management even after the SPA was executed and
never ceded exclusive control to EuroGas. It also continued to make advances of working

capital after the SPA was concluded, none of which was ever reimbursed.‘

342. The Claimants acknowledge that in Belmont’s 2001 and 2002 financial statements, the
company stated that it held the 57% interest in Rozmin as collateral only.*!? They assert
that at this time, Belmont was hopeful that EuroGas would fulfil its obligations. Indeed, in
2002, Belmont explained that it held the Rozmin shares “pending settlement of the amount
of guarantee shares to be issued by EuroGas and completion of the U.S. registration
statement.”*!? Around the same time, Mr. Agyagos was appointed to serve on the board of
EuroGas to ensure the company would perform its obligations under the SPA, and the press
release announcing the appointment stated that Belmont had “conditionally accepted the

sale of Belmont’s 57% interest in Rozmin s.r.o. to EuroGas, Inc.”4!4

The Claimants point to additional Belmont press releases from 2005“! and 2008,*"° stating
that Belmont still owned a 57% stake in Rozmin. They also cite a statement by the
Respondent itself in its Annual Information Form of 2002 that Belmont held “the Rozmin
shares pending realization of an agreed $ amount upon sale of restricted common shares

issued by EuroGas, Inc.’”4!7

For the Claimants, these statements are consistent with their argument that the transfer of

shares to EuroGas never occurred due to the nonfulfillment of the SPA’s conditions.

The Claimants’ alternative argument relating to the alleged sale of Belmont’s shares in

Rozmin is summarised as follows:

Even if the Tribunal were to follow Mr. Anderson’s conclusion that
“Belmont retained a security interest in the 57% ownership
interest,” this would not change anything with respect to Belmont’s
standing in the present arbitration: Belmont would remain an
“investor” for purposes both of the Canada-Slovak Republic BIT
and of the ICSID Convention.*"8

Specifically, the Claimants assert that such a security/collateral interest in the Rozmin
shares would fall within Article I(d)(ii) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, which defines

“investment” to include “shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the

assets thereof.’”4!°

overview of the Parties’ positions and does not reflect the detailed arguments and sub-

arguments raised by the Parties in this proceeding.

Expropriation Claim
(wD Claimants’ Position

Both Claimants argue that the taking and reassignment of Rozmin’s mining rights, as
confirmed by the DMO’s letter of 3 January 2005 informing Rozmin that its rights had de
facto been revoked and were to be awarded to a new organization, constitutes an unlawful
expropriation. The Claimants submit that direct and indirect expropriation is prohibited
under both BITs unless the expropriation was carried out for a public purpose, in a non-
discriminatory manner, in accordance with due process of law and upon payment of

prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

According to the Claimants, the taking of Rozmin’s rights was a substantively unlawful
indirect or creeping expropriation because it was not conducted for a public purpose.
Contrary to the Respondent’s position, the Claimants argue that the 2002 Amendment
could not validly justify the revocation of Rozmin’s mining rights because the Amendment
entered into force after Rozmin was awarded its rights and had no retroactive effect.
Therefore, the Amendment could not be applied to Rozmin. In addition, the Claimants
submit that even if the 2002 Amendment did apply, its application could not justify the
taking of Rozmin’s rights in the circumstances. Notably, the Claimants recall that (a) on
31 May 2004, the DMO granted Rozmin an authorization to carry out activities until 13
November 2006; (b) Rozmin officially announced to the DMO that it would resume mining
activities by 18 November 2004; and (c) the DMO never warned Rozmin of the application
of the 2002 Amendment.

The Claimants further argue that the taking of Rozmin’s right was an unlawful
expropriation having regard to the procedure followed by the DMO. The Claimants
complain that the taking was performed “abruptly,” without consideration for the “most

basic due process rights,” notably due to the lack of any prior notice that the Slovak

authorities contemplated revoking Rozmin’s rights. The Claimants emphasise that the

98

351.

352.

353.

354.

355.

Slovak Supreme Court itself found on three occasions that the procedure followed to

reassign Rozmin’s mining rights was unlawful.

The Claimants finally argue that in any event, the taking was not accompanied by the
“immediate adequate and effective compensation” due in case of a lawful expropriation,

because Rozmin received no compensation at all.

(2) Respondent’s Position

The Slovak Republic maintains that the reassignment of the Mining Area was a legitimate
exercise of the State’s regulatory powers. According to the Respondent, the 2002
Amendment was mandatory law aimed at fostering effective use of the Slovak Republic’s
mineral resources by preventing speculative practices. Rozmin did not excavate from 1

January 2002 to 1 January 2005 and thereby failed to comply with the 2002 Amendment.

In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants merely complain that the value of their
shareholding decreased as a result of the reassignment of the Mining Area; however, the

fact that their shareholding may be worth less does not constitute an expropriation.
Fair and Equitable Treatment Claims

(wD Claimants’ Position

The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s acts and omissions, taken individually or
collectively, constitute substantive and procedural breaches of the fair and equitable
treatment standard set forth in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Slovakia BIT and Article III(1)(a)
of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.

In particular, the Claimants submit that the Respondent failed to act consistently and to

meet their legitimate expectations having regard to the following chronology of events:

a. on 31 May 2004, the DMO authorised Rozmin to carry out mining activities until 13
November 2006;

b. on 8 November 2004, Rozmin officially announced to the DMO that it would resume

mining activities by 18 November 2004, and the DMO did not react;

99

356.

357.

c.

on 8 December 2004, the Director of the DMO conducted an inspection of the deposit
and concluded that Rozmin’s activities were in compliance with legal regulations in

force; and

on 3 January 2005, the Slovak Republic announced that Rozmin’s mining rights had

been awarded to Economy Agency.

The Claimants also consider that the Respondent failed to act transparently and to treat

their investment non-arbitrarily and reasonably, notably because:

(2)

the Claimants were neither notified that the authorities were contemplating revoking

their mining rights nor afforded an opportunity to present their case;

the Respondent announced that it was initiating a new tender procedure for the
assignment of the Mining Area before informing Rozmin of the revocation of its mining

rights;

the DMO disregarded the decision of the Slovak Supreme Court by “stubbornly”
reassigning Rozmin’s rights to VSK Mining in July 2008 and again in March 2012,
which amounts to a denial of justice and hence a breach of the fair and equitable

treatment standard;

in July 2008, following the Supreme Court’s decision of 27 February 2008 cancelling
the DMO’s decision to reassign Rozmin’s rights, the DMO did not initiate a new tender

and simply awarded these rights to VSK Mining; and

finally, in June 2014, on the eve of commencement of ICSID proceedings as announced
in settlement discussions, the Respondent launched criminal proceedings targeting

Rozmin and the Claimants.

Respondent’s Position

The Respondent characterises the Claimants’ fair and equitable treatment claim as a denial

of justice claim because it is based on the assumption that the Slovak administrative and

100

judicial bodies issued incorrect decisions and caused delays in administrative proceedings

commenced by Rozmin following the reassignment of its mining rights.
358. The Respondent states that

it is a fundamental principle of international law that a low-level
administrative or judicial decision can constitute an international
delict only if no effective remedy is available or if the aggrieved
party’s applications for remedy do not lead to redress. In other
words, a State should always be judged by its “final product”, and
will only be held liable if the overall process of its decision-making
is erroneous.”

359. The Respondent concludes that denial of justice requires exhaustion of local remedies and
that the Claimants’ claims therefore cannot succeed, because the Claimants abandoned the
domestic proceedings they commenced by not appealing the decision of the DMO
confirming the assignment of the Mining Area on 1 August 2012. Respondent adds that

Claimants were at all times provided with a fair opportunity to present their case.

360. In any event, the Respondent submits that even if the high standard required for finding a
denial of justice does not apply, the Claimants still have failed to prove a violation of the
fair and equitable treatment standard. In particular, the Respondent argues that a claimant’s
legitimate expectations may be based only on specific assurances given by the host State
at the time when the investor makes the investment; however, the Claimants have not
shown that they received any such assurance from the Slovak Republic with respect to

Rozmin’s mining rights.

361. Regarding the criminal investigation complained of by the Claimants, the Respondent
states that the issue is moot because the Slovak Republic has already returned all seized
documents. In this context, the Respondent refers to its Opposition to Claimants’
Application for Provisional Measures dated 10 September 2014 and its Rejoinder

Opposition to Claimants’ Application for Provisional Measures dated 21 November 2014.

Cc. Arbitrary and Unreasonable Treatment Claim
(wD Claimants’ Position

362. The Claimants consider that the Respondent’s acts and omissions identified as being in
violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard are also in breach of (a) Article IX(1)
of the of the US-Slovakia BIT*?! and (b) Article IX(1) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT,‘??
which is to be read a contrario. They submit that the DMO’s conduct could not be inspired

by a rational policy.

(2) Respondent’s Position

363. The Respondent’s position is that the DMO’s reassignment of the Mining Area was
substantively correct, and that “any and all errors in the Slovak Republic’s administrative
and judicial proceedings were remedied and had no impact on Rozmin.”*?? Thus, in the
Respondent’s view, such errors could not meet the high threshold for arbitrariness
established by the International Court of Justice in the E.L.S.J. case. The Respondent
emphasises that the correct application of Slovak law would have led to the same result
and that the 2002 Amendment was enacted to address a rational policy (namely fostering

effective use of mineral resources and avoiding speculative practices).

D. Full Protection and Security Claim
(wD Claimants’ Position

364. The Claimants consider that the Respondent’s acts and omissions identified as being in
violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard also constitute a violation of the

standard of full protection and security, which is provided in Article II(2)(a) of the US-

1 Article I(2)(b) of the US-Slovakia BIT provides: “neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or
discriminatory measures the manag operation, maii use, enj , acquisiti ion or disposal
of investments.”

422 Article IX(1) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT provid ct to the requirement that such measures are not applied
in a manner that would constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investments or between investors,
or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent
a Contracting Party from adopting or enforcing m ary: (a) to protect human, animal or plant life or
health; (b) to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Agreement; or (c) for the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.”

Slovakia BIT and Article III(1)(a) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, as well as customary

international law.

(2) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the standard of full protection and security invoked by
Claimants is not applicable to their claims as this standard requires events of threats or
actual injury to aliens attributable to a third party, which are absent in this case. Further,
according to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal were to adopt a more expansive
interpretation of the full protection and security standard, the Claimants have failed to

establish facts that would rise to a violation of that standard.

Failure to Comply with Specific Commitments Claim
(wD Claimants’ Position

The Claimants contend that both BITs require the Slovak Republic to honour its specific

obligations towards foreign investors.

As regards the US-Slovakia BIT, the Claimants invoke Article II(2)(c), which provides that
“[eJach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to

investments.”

As regards the Canada-Slovakia BIT, the Claimants recognise that that treaty does not
contain a similar provision and submit that Article II(2)(c) of the US-Slovakia BIT may be
applied to Canadian investors via Article III(2) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, which is a

most favoured nation clause.

The Claimants argue that “the Slovak Republic specifically undertook to allow Rozmin to
carry out mining activities at the Gemerska Poloma deposit until November 13, 2006, by
way of decision of the DMO issued on May 31, 2004, which was reconfirmed on December
8, 2004, by Mr. Baffi, the DMO’s Director, following an inspection of the Mining Area’’424

and breached that obligation by revoking Rozmin’s rights in the weeks which followed.

TRIBUNAL’S DECISIONS ON JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS RELATING
TO EUROGAS

To begin, the Tribunal notes that EuroGas was erroneously described as being incorporated
in 1985 in the Request for Arbitration, leading to confusion as to which company is a
claimant in this arbitration. Even though the mistake would have been very serious if it had
not been rectified, at this stage, the Tribunal sees no consequences to be drawn from the

incorrect description of one of the Claimants in the Request for Arbitration.

In the following sections, the Tribunal will refer to one of the Claimants as “EuroGas II.”
The Tribunal will refer to the company called EuroGas Inc. that was incorporated in 1985

and later dissolved as “EuroGas I.” EuroGas I is not a party to these proceedings.

The question for the Tribunal to resolve is whether EuroGas II validly qualifies as an
investor under the US-Slovakia BIT through its shareholding in EuroGas GmbH, which

was a shareholder in Rozmin at the time of the reassignment of Rozmin’s mining rights.
In order to establish that it does, EuroGas II must demonstrate:

a. that when the Bankruptcy Proceedings closed on 19 March 2007, EuroGas I owned the
shares in EuroGas GmbH and thereby owned the claim relating to the 2005

reassignment of the Mining Area (the “Tale/Reassignment Claims”); and

b. that EuroGas I validly transferred the Talc/Reassignment Claims to EuroGas II.

379.

Did EuroGas I Emerge from the Bankruptcy Proceedings Owning the
Tale/Reassignment Claims?

As a preliminary matter, it is important to recall the chronology of the Bankruptcy
Proceedings initiated in respect of EuroGas I on the basis of Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy

Code.*?5

On 18 May 2004, Mr. Steve Smith, Trustee for the bankruptcy estate of Harven Michael
McKenzie, a creditor of EuroGas I (“Trustee Smith”), filed an involuntary petition of
bankruptcy against EuroGas I in the Bankruptcy Court.*?° Trustee Smith subsequently
obtained a judgment against EuroGas I in a separate bankruptcy proceeding in Texas, in
the amount of USD 113,371,837.65 and filed this claim against EuroGas I in the
Bankruptcy Court in Utah.

The Chapter 7 trustee appointed to administer EuroGas I’s estate was Trustee Marker. The
Tribunal understands that a Chapter 7 trustee is required to “collect and reduce to money
the property of the estate for which [he] serves, and close such estate as expeditiously as is

compatible with the best interests of parties in interest.’”4?”

On 27 January 2005, the Bankruptcy Court ordered Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, Mr. Reinhard
Rauball and Mr. Hank Blankenstein, as designated principals of EuroGas I, to file
schedules and statements of assets and to turn over property and records of the estate of

EuroGas I to Trustee Marker.

No schedules or statements of assets were ever filed. Trustee Marker therefore conducted
an investigation and liquidated EuroGas I’s interest in several affiliated companies and
distributed the proceeds to creditors. The proceedings were closed on 19 March 2007,
without the estate’s interest in EuroGas GmbH or any potential claims that EuroGas I might

have against the Slovak Republic being administered.

45 See also §1(B)(9) above.

Bankruptcy Petition, 18 May 2004 (R-85).

105

380. The question whether the potential claims against the Slovak Republic (the
Talc/Reassignment Claims), which should have been scheduled, became property of the
estate or were abandoned to EuroGas I by Trustee Marker, is debated. The Tribunal has
heard expert evidence from both sides and has been provided with several legal authorities
on the issue. However, the Tribunal considers that the question has become moot due to

the reopening of the Bankruptcy Proceedings and subsequent developments.

381. Indeed, in September 2015, a creditor described as an affiliate of EuroGas II, Texas
EuroGas Corp., sent a letter to the U.S. Trustee, requesting that the Bankruptcy
Proceedings be reopened to investigate whether the Talc/Reassignment Claims were
property of the EuroGas I estate. On 21 December 2015, following a Motion to Reopen
from the U.S. Trustee,*?* the Bankruptcy Court ordered the reopening of the case “for the
specific purpose of determining the bankruptcy estate’s interest in the asset identified in
the Motion to Reopen.”4”? The Bankruptcy Court also ordered the appointment of a
Chapter 7 trustee, Trustee Loveridge, to investigate the bankruptcy estate’s interest in the

asset identified in the Motion to Reopen.**°

382. Having looked into the issue and conducted her own investigation, Trustee Loveridge
entered into discussions with EuroGas II and with the Slovak Republic with a view to
concluding an agreement with one of them to generate cash for distribution to EuroGas I’s
creditors. Eventually, Trustee Loveridge entered into an agreement with EuroGas II on
9 August 2016, subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court (the “Agreement”).**! The
Bankruptcy Court approved the Agreement on 28 October 2016.**? The Agreement

provides as follows in Recitals and substantive provisions:

Based on her independent investigation, the Trustee has concluded
that (a) the Former Trustee [Trustee Marker] had information
available to him concerning the existence of the Talc Claims; (b) the
Former Trustee did not expressly abandon the Talc Claims, but may

or may not have intended that the Tale Claims were abandoned
upon closing of the Bankruptcy Case; (c) in any case, the issue
whether the Talc Claims may not have been abandoned by the
Former Trustee has not been resolved; (d) to the extent the Talc
Claims were abandoned by the Former Trustee, they are
burdensome to the estate and of inconsequential value to the estate;
(e) creditors would stand to benefit from EuroGas pursuing the Talc
Claims because EuroGas has assumed the Debtors liabilities; and
(f) an abandonment of whatever remaining interest the Bankruptcy
Estate may have in the Talc Claims nunc pro tunc to the petition date
[the petition date is 18 May 2004, commencement of the Bankruptcy
Proceedings — cf. Recital C] under the terms of this Agreement is in
the best interests of creditors.

In consideration of the terms and conditions contained therein, the
Parties now agree as follows:

[J

3. Remittance upon Execution. Immediately upon execution,
EuroGas will remit to the Trustee $150,000.00. [...]

4. Notice of Abandonment. Together with the motion to approve the
Agreement, the Trustee shall file a notice of abandonment of any
remaining interest, if any, that the Bankruptcy Estate may still have
in the Talc Claims. [...}*°

The abandonment nunc pro tunc of any interest that may have remained with EuroGas I’s
bankruptcy estate means that the Talc/Reassignment Claims must be considered has having
remained with EuroGas I since the opening of the Bankruptcy Proceedings on 18 May
2004. As stated by the Bankruptcy Court in its Memorandum Decision approving the

Agreement:

The Trustee has requested a determination that the abandonment is
effective nunc pro tunc to the petition date [18 May 2004]. Making
a judicial finding that the abandonment is effective nunc pro tunc to
the petition date is available only in “extraordinary
circumstances.” The legal effect of abandonment is determined as a

+33 U.S, Trustee’s Motion to Reopen, 18 September 2015 including draft agreement (C-360).

107

matter of law. When property is abandoned, it “reverts to the debtor
and stands as if no bankruptcy petition was filed.” +4

384. Therefore, either the Talc/Reassignment Claims had been validly abandoned by Trustee
Marker initially and reverted to EuroGas I, or they had not been abandoned, remained
property of the estate, and reverted to EuroGas I nunc pro tunc following their
abandonment by Trustee Loveridge under the terms of the Agreement. In both scenarios,
the Talc/Reassignment Claims must be deemed property of EuroGas I as from

18 May 2004.

385. Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that it is uncontested that the Tribunal has jurisdiction
to determine the thorny issue whether Trustee Marker validly abandoned the
Talc/Reassignment Claims or not, the Tribunal need not embark on this complex legal and

factual enquiry.

386. The main question to resolve in respect of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over EuroGas II’s
claims in these ICSID proceedings therefore lies in the alleged transfer of the
Talc/Reassignment Claims from EuroGas I to EuroGas II. The Tribunal notes that the
Bankruptcy Court acknowledged the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on this point and made no
factual or legal determination in that respect in the Memorandum Decision approving the

Agreement. The Bankruptcy Court stated that

EuroGas I was administratively dissolved in 2001 for failure to file
an annual report and pay a nominal fee. EuroGas II was
incorporated after the bankruptcy petition was filed, and signed the
Merger documents in which it sought to inherit all EuroGas I's
assets and liabilities. Whether the Talc Claims passed to EuroGas
IT in the Merger or remained with EuroGas I will be a matter for the
Arbitration Tribunal to decide. This Court takes no position on that
question other than to note that whatever interest the bankruptcy

390.

estate had or has in the Talc Claims is authorized to be abandoned
by the Trustee.*>

At this point, the Tribunal specifies that it need not determine EuroGas II’s argument that
the Respondent has no standing to challenge the abandonment of the interest in EuroGas
GmbH by Trustee Marker.**° As noted above, the Tribunal does not make any finding in
that respect and simply draws consequences from the terms of the Agreement between

EuroGas II and Trustee Loveridge, as approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

Did EuroGas I Validly Merge with EuroGas II, Making the Latter the Continuation
of the Former?

According to EuroGas II, the alleged transfer of EuroGas I’s assets and liabilities
(including the Talc/Reassignment Claims) to EuroGas II was implemented through a “de
facto merger” between EuroGas I and EuroGas II in 2008, making the latter the
continuation and the successor of the former. The merger was allegedly effectuated through
the Joint Resolution, the full title of which is “Joint Unanimous Consent Resolution of the
Directors of EuroGas Inc, a Utah corporation dissolved in 2001 and EuroGas Inc, a Utah
corporation formed in 2005 and in good standing approving proposed class ‘F’

reorganisation made retroactively effective to November 15, 2005.43”

The effectiveness of this merger as a means of transfer by EuroGas I of its interest in

EuroGas GmbH and of the Talc/Reassignment Claims to EuroGas II is contested.

First, the Respondent contends that the merger is void (or at least voidable) because
EuroGas I, as a dissolved company, could not enter into any contracts other than for the
purpose of winding up its activities. According to the Respondent, a merger agreement
purporting to enable the business of the dissolved company to continue through a different
corporate shell is inconsistent with winding up. In addition, since EuroGas I had been

dissolved for longer than two years, there was no possibility of reinstatement and therefore

of retroactive validation of any other contracts that EuroGas I might have entered into while

it was dissolved.

Second, the Respondent submits that the Joint Resolution could not possibly effectuate a
merger between EuroGas I and EuroGas II because, under Utah law, the corporate law of
both EuroGas I and EuroGas II, mergers may only be effectuated in accordance with certain

legal provisions which have not been followed.
The Tribunal will address both arguments in turn.

() Can a Dissolved Company Validly Merge with Another Company?

Regarding whether EuroGas I could validly merge with another entity while it was
dissolved, the Tribunal notes that the evidence submitted by the Parties is unclear. It
appeared uncontested during most of the proceedings that EuroGas I, as a dissolved
company, was authorised to enter into contracts aiming at the winding up of its affairs
(although a recent case discussed during the cross examination of Mr. Gardiner appeared
to stand for the proposition that all contracts entered into by a dissolved company are
void).78

To add to the confusion, the Joint Resolution suggests that the Utah Division of
Corporations considers that a dissolved company cannot merge with another company in

good standing. The Joint Resolution recalls:

WHEREAS, under Utah law, a dissolved domestic corporation
cannot formally merge with another domestic corporation under
Utah’s corporate merger statute, the [Utah Division of
Corporations], among other things, being unwilling and lawfully
incapable of accepting and stamping Articles of Merger involving a
dissolved corporation or in which a dissolved corporation is a
Party.*°

The fact that the Utah Division of Corporations appears to have refused to accept articles

of merger involving EuroGas I due to the fact that it was a dissolved corporation is not

438 See Tr. Day 3, 78:15 et seq. (discussion between Mr. Gardiner and Ms. Burton of Wittingham LLC v. TNE Limited
Partnership (2016 UT App 176, or 2016 Utah App Lexus 19 193, or 820 Utah Advance Report 68).

439 Joint Resolution, 31 July 2008 (C-57).

110

conclusive evidence of whether dissolved companies may take part in a merger under Utah
law. However, it is a strong signal that they may not. If that were the case, there would be
no legal avenue for EuroGas I to transfer the Talc/Reassignment Claims to EuroGas II

through a merger.

396. However, the Tribunal will assume that the practice of the Utah Division of Corporations
as recalled in the Joint Resolution is inconclusive or should not be given any weight in the
context of its analysis because neither side has relied on the Utah Division of Corporations

practice in the context of the jurisdiction debate.

397. What the Parties have addressed is the meaning and effects of Section 1405(1) of the Utah

Revised Business Corporation Act, which provides:
A dissolved corporation continues its corporate existence but may

not carry on any business except that appropriate to wind up and
liquidate its business and affairs including:

(a) collecting its assets;

(b) disposing of its properties that will not be distributed in kind to
its shareholders;

(c) discharging or making provision for discharging its liabilities;

(d) distributing its remaining property among its shareholders
according to their interests; and

(e) doing every other act necessary to wind up and liquidate its
business and affairs.*°

398. In the opinion of Mr. Brad W. Merrill, EuroGas II’s Utah corporate law expert, this

provision authorises a dissolved company such as EuroGas I to merge with another entity.

Mr. Merrill states in the expert opinion dated 28 September 2015 that:

None of the provisions of the [Utah Revised Business Corporation
Act], including the merger provisions or dissolution provisions, in
any way restrict or limit a dissolved corporation from pursing or
consummating a merger in connection with its wind up activities.
Indeed, given the very nature of a merger — to combine two

401.

companies into one surviving legal entity where the surviving entity
assumes all assets, rights and liabilities of the extinguished entity —
a merger into an active corporation would in fact be one of the most
effective and efficient ways to wind up and liquidate a dissolved
corporation.**!

 

Mr. Merrill concludes that there is no legal obstacle under Utah law to a merger between

EuroGas I and EuroGas II.

The Respondent’s experts, Ms. Jarvis and Mr. Gardiner, hold a different view. They
consider that the merger that allegedly took place between EuroGas I and EuroGas II
cannot have been entered into validly because it aimed at perpetuating EuroGas I’s
existence, not liquidate it. In support of this conclusion, these experts emphasise the terms

of the Joint Resolution:

The Joint Resolution attempts to establish EuroGas II “as a
continuation” of EuroGas I, specifically “to continue and carry on
the business and affairs” of EuroGas I. Such an effort runs contrary
to the [Utah Revised Business Corporation Act]’s explicit
prohibition of a dissolved corporation from continuing its business.
In addition, such an action is not of the same kind as “disposing of
[the corporation’s] properties.” +?

Having considered both sides’ arguments, the Tribunal leans toward the conclusion that
EuroGas I, though dissolved, was authorised under Utah law to merge with EuroGas II.
The alleged merger would have the effect of transferring all the assets and liabilities of one
company to another, leaving nothing behind in the first company’s corporate shell. This
outcome, which is clearly the desired outcome of the Joint Resolution, is consistent with
Section 1405(1) of the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act. Therefore, the Tribunal
concludes that EuroGas I could merge with EuroGas II in 2008 even though it was
dissolved. The only reason it would have to doubt that this conclusion is correct is the

practice of the Utah Division of Corporations, as described in the Joint Resolution (quoted

above at paragraph 392). However, as previously stated, the Tribunal has not taken this

into account.

However, the Tribunal’s conclusion that a dissolved corporation may, under Utah law, take
part in a merger in order to liquidate its assets is without prejudice to the crucial issue as to

whether a merger between EuroGas I and EuroGas II did occur in the present case.

(2) Did EuroGas I Validly Merge with EuroGas II?

The Tribunal now turns to the issue whether the Joint Resolution validly effectuated a
merger between these two entities, with the result that the Talc/Reassignment Claims

passed to EuroGas II.

First, the Tribunal notes that it is uncontested that the alleged merger did not comply with
the statutory requirements for mergers under Utah law, in particular the filing of articles of
merger with the Utah Division of Corporations (due to, it appears, the Utah Division of
Corporations’ refusal to accept and stamp articles of merger involving a dissolved
corporation). Section 16-10a-1105(2) of the Utah Code states that a “merger or share
exchange takes effect upon the effective date of the articles of merger or share exchange,

which may not be prior to the date of filing.”*“*

The first question to resolve, therefore, is whether there was any possibility for the Joint
Resolution to effectuate a merger without complying with the Utah law statutory

requirements.

According to the express terms of the Joint Resolution, the parties to this resolution
intended to effectuate the merger on the basis of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 to circumvent the refusal of the Utah Division of Corporations to
register a merger involving a dissolved company. They envisaged a so-called “Class F

reorganization” to achieve the merger that the Utah Division of Corporations refused:

WHEREAS, the “winding up” of a dissolved corporation’s affairs
would seem NOT to exclude the engaging or participating in a Class
“F” reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended,

44 Utah Code, §16-10a-1105(2) (RL-93).

113

particularly when nothing in the law appears to require that a Class
F reorganization requires filing and recording of Articles of Merger

with the Division;

407. On the basis of this (hesitant) understanding that the Class F reorganisation described in
Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 would enable EuroGas I and
EuroGas II to achieve the same outcome as a statutory merger, the signatories to the Joint

Resolution (i.e: the directors of these companies) resolved as follows (inter alia):

that the Corporation [EuroGas II] proceed to carry on the business
and affairs for which it was incorporated, namely, to continue and
carry on the business and affairs of the Predecessor Corporation
[EuroGas I]; and, in addition, that the Corporation hereby complete
the so-called Class “F” reorganization with its Predecessor,
namely, carrying out that which is necessary to make the
Corporation assume and inherit the shareholders’ list and other
assets and liabilities of the Predecessor Corporation, including the
recognition of the Predecessor Corporation, including the
recognition of the Predecessor Corporation’s issued and
outstanding shares, shareholder base and issued and outstanding

stock certificates;*°

408. Consistent with the text of the Joint Resolution, EuroGas II initially argued, relying on the
Joint Resolution, that the transfer of EuroGas I’s assets and liabilities to EuroGas II was
effectuated through the Class F reorganisation process referred to in the Joint Resolution

and that this made EuroGas II the continuation of EuroGas I under Utah law:

On July 23, 2008, EuroGas’ corporate documents were amended to
mirror those of the 1985 Company and in order to wind up and
liquidate its business and affairs, in accordance with Utah State law,
the 1985 Company entered into a joint resolution with EuroGas and
performed a type-F reorganization, whereby EuroGas assumed all
of the assets, liabilities and issued stock certificates of the 1985
Company.**6

The Respondent protested, in the Counter-Memorial, that the Joint Resolution is “a sham
document that is a nullity under both (i) the legal regime of the sovereign State of Utah,
and (ii) the legal regime of U.S. federal bankruptcy.”**” It notably argued that “Section
368(a)(1)(F) addresses only whether a corporate transaction qualifies for tax-free treatment
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It cannot revive a corporation under state law or

authorize reorganization of a corporate entity under state law.”*#8

In its Reply, EuroGas II did not express a disagreement and stated that

the reference in the Resolution to Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code only reflected the parties’ intention to treat
the merger as a tax-free transaction. It did not however constitute
the legal basis pursuant to which the merger would be operated and
become effective.”
EuroGas II then re-focused its arguments on the (alleged) transfer of EuroGas I’s assets

and liabilities to EuroGas II to a de facto common law merger theory.

The Respondent has contested the possibility that such a “de facto merger” could ever be
deemed to have occurred between EuroGas I and EuroGas II for the purpose of transferring
the Talc/Reassignment Claims from the former to the latter. According to the Respondent,
the common law de facto merger theory is a liability theory developed by the courts to
sanction parties which attempt to avoid the applicable requirements of a statutory merger,
for example by implementing the merger operation through a series of transactions which
minority shareholders cannot oppose.**? The de facto merger theory can also apply where
two companies enter into an agreement whereby one of them transfers all its assets to

another to the detriment of its creditors.**!

Mr. Gardiner, the Respondent’s Utah corporate law expert, convincingly explained why,
in his view, the de facto merger common law theory is not an autonomous legal basis for
companies to merge validly under Utah law, without complying with the statutory
provisions on mergers. Notably, he provides a full quote of an authority relied upon by
EuroGas II’s corporate law experts: the official commentary of Utah corporation and
business laws. The Tribunal finds this authority helpful in understanding the concept of
“de facto merger” and notes that it was only partially cited by EuroGas II’s experts. The

commentary states:

A transaction may have the same economic effect as a statutory
merger even though it is cast in the form of a non statutory
transaction. For example, assets of the disappearing corporations
may be sold for consideration in the form of shares of the surviving
corporation, followed by the distribution of those shares by the
disappearing corporations to their shareholders and their
subsequent dissolution. Transactions have sometimes been
structured in nonstatutory form for tax reasons or in an effort to
avoid some of the consequences of a statutory merger, particularly
appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders. Faced with these
transactions, a few courts have developed or accepted the “de facto
merger” concept which, to some uncertain extent, grants to
dissenting shareholders the rights they would have had if the
transaction had been structured as a statutory merger. ... These
problems should not occur under the Revised Act since the
procedural requirements for authorization and consequences of
various types of transactions are largely standardized.***

This passage of the official commentary of Utah corporate law, deemed relevant and
authoritative by both sides, supports the Respondent’s position that the de facto merger
theory is not an autonomous legal basis for Utah corporations to merge, but a theory
developed by the courts to address situations which fall in the gaps of statutory provisions.
It addresses situations where the legal rights of third parties to the transactions under review

are unjustly affected, and aims to protect them.

As explained by Mr. Gardiner, the legal authorities cited by EuroGas II do not support the
proposition that Utah law authorises mergers between entities outside the framework of the

statutory provisions on mergers, which both sides agree have not been followed.

But even assuming that such a de facto merger could have taken place in theory, the
Tribunal is doubtful that the merger could have taken place through a joint resolution of
the directors of the allegedly merging entities without shareholders’ consultation and

agreement, especially where the companies are listed.

Even if this could be admitted, which the Tribunal cannot accept, there is a real question

as to whether the Joint Resolution on its own effectuated the contemplated merger.

As noted by Mr. Gardiner, the Joint Resolution falls short of an actual transfer of rights
and liabilities from EuroGas I to EuroGas II. The Joint Resolution records the signatories’
(i.e.: the directors’) agreement to proceed with the transfer, but it also records their
(justified) doubts as to the necessary legal steps to be taken to render the transfer effective

and valid. The Joint Resolution indeed records that:

RESOLVED FURTHER, that a confirmatory transfer of the assets
of the Predecessor Corporation to EuroGas, Inc (incorporated on
November 15, 2005) is hereby authorized and that at least one of
the officers and directors of the Predecessor Corporation is hereby
authorized to execute, on behalf of the Predecessor Corporation,
those documents necessary, if any, to confirm transfer of any
personal property and liabilities from the Predecessor Corporation
to the new successor EuroGas, Inc.*3

Mr. Gardiner explained at the hearing that the directors’ agreement to proceed with an

action is insufficient to make that action occur:

(Mr Gardiner): .... This joint resolution reflects the intentions of the
two boards of directors to do something to, in essence, combine the
two corporations and make them into one, without complying with
merger statute or without at least providing evidence of actual
transfers of assets or contractual assumptions of liabilities. It also
contemplates that the new EuroGas entity would simply treat the
outstanding shares of the prior EuroGas entity, or EuroGas I, as I

call it, simply treat those shareholders as its own, which in my
experience as a corporate lawyer, I don’t know how you do that.
One company can’t, just by a resolution — and by the way, the
directors are the same on both sides, right? — decide that the
shareholders of one company are now the shareholders of another
company. That just doesn’t work, at least in Utah corporate law.

Q. How do companies merge in Utah?

A. (Mr Gardiner) They enter into an agreement: we usually call it
an “agreement and plan of merger.” And they agree to file articles
of merger with the Division of Corporations, and they file them. The
public gets notice of the fact that these corporations have merged.
And the merger is effective once those articles of merger have been
filed.

Q. So the merger cannot take effect before the articles of merger are

filed?

A. (Mr Gardiner) No.***

The Tribunal is convinced by this testimony and finds that EuroGas II and its experts have
failed to establish any basis under Utah law (statutory or common law) by which the Joint
Resolution could have resulted in a valid merger. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that
the Joint Resolution could not, and did not, effectuate a valid merger between EuroGas I
and EuroGas II, with the result that the Talc/Reassignment Claims validly passed from

EuroGas I to EuroGas II.

Are the Transactions with McCallan Relevant to the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction?

In the Tribunal’ s view, the transactions with McCallan, raised for the first time in EuroGas’
Reply, have no bearing on that conclusion. Indeed, in the Reply, EuroGas II submitted that
EuroGas I sold the EuroGas GmbH shares to McCallan in 2007 (before the alleged merger)
and that EuroGas II then acquired that shareholding from McCallan at an unspecified time
between 13 July 2007 and 4 June 2012 (after the merger). The process was described as
follows in the Reply:

On July 13, 2007, the 1985 Company sold its interest in EuroGas
GmbH to a third party company, namely McCallan Oil & Gas (UK)

454 Hearing Tr. Day 4, 110:5-111:6.

118

(hereafter “McCallan” ). EuroGas thereafter acquired the entirety
of McCallan’s issued shares, and ultimately, on June 4, 2012,
caused McCallan to transfer its interest in EuroGas GmbH, and
thus Rozmin, to its new Swiss subsidiary, EuroGas AG.*5

422. The Tribunal regrets that EuroGas II did not file the documents underlying these
transactions in these proceedings. The documents on file do not enable the Tribunal to have
a complete picture of those (complex) transactions involving third parties.*° However, in
any event, the Tribunal views the ownership of the EuroGas GmbH shares after the
reassignment as having no real bearing on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over EuroGas II. The
alleged sale of EuroGas GmbH shares by EuroGas I to McCallan took place in 2007, years
after the reassignment of Rozmin’s rights. The right to receive compensation under the
US-Slovakia BIT, which arose at the time of the reassignment, in 2005,457 belonged to
EuroGas I; it was not transferred together with the EuroGas GmbH shares to McCallan,
since it is by no means incorporated in those shares; it remained with EuroGas I. Therefore,
the right to compensation under the US-Slovakia BIT could not be subsequently transferred

back to EuroGas II with McCallan’s shares or EuroGas GmbH shares.

423. Therefore, the obscure transactions with McCallan have no bearing on the Tribunal’s
conclusion as to its jurisdiction over EuroGas II, as explained above. Since the Talc/
Reassignment Claims never passed from EuroGas I to EuroGas II through the alleged
merger (which the Tribunal considers ineffective), and there is no evidence that EuroGas I

sold its Talc/ Reassignment claims to McCallan in a way that those claims could have then

been transferred to EuroGas II, the Tribunal is compelled to conclude that it lacks

jurisdiction over the claims raised by EuroGas (EuroGas II) in these proceedings.

Because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant EuroGas for the reasons stated
above, the Tribunal does not need to address the Respondent’s objection based on the
“denial of benefits clause” in Article I.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT. The Tribunal turns now

to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections relating to Belmont.

TRIBUNAL’S DECISIONS ON JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS RELATING
TO BELMONT

The Tribunal begins with the Respondent’s objection that Belmont’s claims fall outside the

ratione temporis application of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.

The Slovak Republic’s arguments in respect of the ratione temporis application of the
Canada-Slovakia BIT and Belmont’s responses have been summarised in Section III(C).
The Tribunal will therefore refer only briefly to the Parties’ positions in the analysis that

follows.

Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT provides that the treaty will only “apply to any
dispute which has arisen not more than three years prior to its entry into force.”** The
Canada-Slovakia BIT entered into force on 14 March 2012. Therefore, the dispute between
Belmont and the Slovak Republic must have arisen on or after 14 March 2009 to be
captured by the Canada-Slovakia BIT and for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction over

Belmont’s claims.

The Respondent submits that the dispute with Belmont arose prior to 14 March 2009 and
therefore falls outside the Tribunal’s ratione temporis jurisdiction. In response, Belmont
argues, first, that the Respondent is “estopped” from asserting this objection. In addition,
Belmont submits that the Respondent confuses the events leading up to the dispute with

the dispute itself, and that in fact, the dispute arose after the critical date.

458 Canada-Slovakia BIT, Article XV(6) in fine (C-2).

120

429.

430.

431.

Is the Respondent “Estopped” from Relying on Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia
BIT?

Belmont places great emphasis on the fact that EuroGas sent the Respondent a notice of
dispute on 31 October 20114*? and that the Respondent reacted on 2 May 2012 by asserting
that it was premature to trigger the dispute resolution process provided in the Canada-
Slovakia BIT.* According to Belmont, the State is now “estopped” from asserting that
the dispute is not captured by the ratione temporis application of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.
Belmont’s argument assumes that its dispute with the Slovak Republic is one and the same
with the dispute between EuroGas and the Slovak Republic (which relates to a different
BIT).

The Tribunal considers that the legal consequence that Belmont seeks to draw from the
Respondent’s posture in its correspondence of 2 May 2012 is excessive and unsupported.
First, the Respondent’s letter does not imply any admission that the US-Slovakia BIT, and
a fortiori the Canada-Slovakia BIT (which is not even mentioned) were applicable. The

letter contains an express reservation as regards the applicability of the US-Slovakia BIT:

Therefore, as long as the above mentioned proceedings are ongoing,
the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic is of the view that
this dispute could not be amicably settled at this stage. For
avoidance of doubt, this letter is subject to the reservation that such
conduct is in no way a confession that the claim articulated in your
Notification of claim against Slovak Republic meets the jurisdiction
or substantive requirements of the Slovak-US Bilateral Investment
Treaty The Slovak Republic fully reserves all rights arising under
that Treaty and all applicable laws.*°!

Second, by saying that EuroGas’ claim was premature, the Respondent did not indicate
that it was too early for the factual situation to be considered a dispute within the meaning
of the Treaty; it clearly meant that it was premature to start negotiations under the Treaty

while a dispute was still pending before the local courts.

Third, even assuming that the Respondent had accepted to extend the applicability of the
Treaty in spite of its temporal limitation, it is doubtful that such extension would have any
legal effect, because the applicability ratione temporis of the Canada-Slovakia BIT

depends only on the intentions of the Parties to the Treaty.

There is therefore no basis for Belmont to claim that it is entitled to the protections of the
Canada-Slovakia BIT on the ground of statements made by the Respondent in response to
EuroGas’ notice of dispute. The Tribunal rejects Belmont’s argument that the Respondent
is “estopped” from arguing that Belmont’s claims fall outside the ratione temporis realm

of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.

The real question is whether the dispute arose after 14 March 2009, within the meaning of

Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.

Is the Treaty Dispute Distinguishable from the Dispute Submitted to Domestic
Courts?

According to Belmont, the dispute must be distinguished from the events leading to the
dispute, a distinction notably made by the authors Dolzer and Schreuer in the following

words (cited by Belmont):

The time of the dispute is not identical with the time of the events
leading to the dispute. By definition, the allegedly illegal acts must
have occurred some time before the dispute. Therefore, the
exclusion of disputes occurring before the treaty’s entry into force
should not be read as excluding jurisdiction over events occurring
before that date.“

The Tribunal naturally agrees that the allegedly illegal acts necessarily precede the dispute

in respect of such acts, and that the relevant date is the date when the dispute arose.

As regards the occurrence of a dispute, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s
submission that the relevant consideration is the articulation of opposing views and
interests, as opposed to the articulation of a specific legal basis for the claim. The landmark

case on this point remains the PCIJ Mavrommatis case, where the Court stated that a dispute

122

441.

is “[a] disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests
between two persons.“ A conflict of legal views does not require the expression of all

possible legal arguments and grounds in support of one’s position.

In the present case, the Parties diverge as to whether the dispute submitted to the Slovak
courts prior to the commencement of this arbitration should be treated as the same dispute
as the dispute under the Canada-Slovakia BIT. If it is the same dispute, then the dispute
falls outside the ratione temporis application of the BIT. If the dispute submitted to this
Tribunal is a different dispute, then the question arises as to when that different dispute

arose and whether it is captured by the BIT or not.

According to the Respondent, there is essentially one dispute about the reassignment of
Rozmin’s mining rights (and potentially a denial of justice dispute). The dispute arose in
2005, when Rozmin’s mining rights were reassigned and this reassignment was contested.
The dispute therefore falls outside the ratione temporis application of the Canada-Slovakia

BIT.

The Slovak Republic draws a parallel between the present situation and the situation in the
Lucchetti v. Peru case, where the arbitral tribunal recalled that “[a]ccording to a recent
ICSID case, the critical element in determining the existence of one or two separate

disputes is whether or not they concern the same subject matter.” 4+

Indeed, a provision such as Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT obviously aims at
avoiding that disputes which have accumulated for more than a certain number of years
(three years in the case of the Canada-Slovakia BIT) give rise at the same time to a
multitude of treaty claims brought before arbitral tribunals. A pre-existing “dispute,” in
that context, is any dispute whose intrinsic elements are invoked by the investor as the basis

of the treaty claim.

446.

Based on this analysis, the Respondent considers that the dispute submitted to domestic
courts in the Slovak Republic concerns the same “subject-matter” as the dispute submitted
to the Tribunal under the Canada-Slovakia BIT, and that since 2005, that dispute involved
the same complaints against the State as those now invoked by Belmont before this

Tribunal.

Belmont attempts to distinguish the present situation from that in the Lucchetti v. Peru

case, on two accounts.

First, Belmont emphasises that in the Lucchetti v. Peru case, the Tribunal relied on the fact
that no treaty existed at the time when the investment was made, and therefore the investor
did not make the investment based on the expectation that it would receive the protections
of the treaty which later came into force. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that the
distinction made by Belmont has an impact on the proper approach to determine the
existence of a dispute for the purpose of the application of Article 15(6) of the Canada-
Slovakia BIT: this provision must be applied in accordance with its terms, the meaning of
which is not affected by the existence of a prior BIT in force before the entry into force of

the BIT invoked by Belmont.

Second, Belmont submits that the facts of Lucchetti v. Peru are different from the present
situation because in that case the claimants were the same in the domestic proceedings and
in the BIT proceedings, whereas in the present case the claimants are different: Rozmin
was the claimant in the domestic proceedings whereas its shareholder Belmont is the

claimant in the present ICSID proceedings.

However, it would be artificial to distinguish the dispute between Rozmin and the State
authorities concerning Rozmin’s own mining rights, from the dispute between Rozmin’s

shareholders and the State in respect of Rozmin’s mining rights.

124

447. The terms of the letter from Mr. Agyagos, who was both the executive director of Rozmin
and the President and CEO of Belmont,*® to the then Minister of Economy of the Slovak
Republic Mr. Malcharek on 3 November 2005, while domestic proceedings were pending,

already encapsulated the terms of the dispute as it is submitted to this Tribunal:

The company Rozmin s.r.o. has been engaged, since June 1997, in
the mining activity, in particular in the activity relating to the
opening, preparation and excavation of the talc deposit in the
excavation area “Gemerské Poloma” which is located in the district
Rozhava. [...]

It was a big surprise when there appeared, in Commercial Bulletin
No. 253/2004 dated 30 December 2004, a notice on the
announcement of the selection procedure for the assignment of the
excavation area “Gemerskd Poloma” to another organization,
which was justified to us by the mining office by the fact that we
discontinued the mining activity in the site for a period exceeding
three years. However, such a reason has no support in the Mining
Act and moreover it is not based on the truth because our mining
activity was discontinued for a shorter period (2 years and 10
months). The conduct of the mining office is incomprehensible also
given the fact that it issued to us, on 31 May 2004 by decision No.
1023/511/2004, an authorization for performance of the mining
activity in the excavation area “Gemerské Poloma” with validity
until 13 November 2006! The procedure of the mining office, which
we consider as made on purpose and unlawful, we immediately
challenged by available legal means; however, all filed complaints
were evaluated by the relevant bodies in the competence of the
Ministry of Economy of the SR as unjustified, to which we do not
agree until today. [...]

On 22 April 2005, the planned selection procedure for the
assignment of the excavation area was held, in which bids were
submitted also by leading world talc producers, as, for example,
Mondo Minerals, as well as leading Slovak companies engaged in
the mining activity in various areas. It was a great surprise for the
entire European expert economic society that in such a strong

  

465 Mr. Agyagos indeed identifies himself as follows in his First Witness Statement: “Since October 17, 1996, I hold
the position of President and Director of Belmont Resources Inc. (“Belmont”), an emerging resource company listed
on the Canadian TSX Venture Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, specialized in the acquisition, exploration,
and development of mineral resources. Since May 22, 2001, I also act as Managing Director of Rozmin s.r..
(“Rozmin”), a company that was incorporated in the Slovak Republic in 1997 for purposes of carrying out a mining
project at the Gemerska Poloma deposit in the Slovak Republic, one of the world’s largest talc deposits.” Agyagos

competition the excavation area was assigned to an absolutely
unknown Rozhava company, Economy Agency RV, s.r.o. with its
seat at Marikovszkého 53, Roziiava 048 01, BIN: 36 582 760 with
registered capital of SKK 200,000, which until then was only
engaged in bookkeeping and obtained the mining permit only a week
before holding the selection procedure. [...]

We believe that the procedure of the District Mining Office in
Spisskd Nova Ves is unlawful, non-standard and made on purpose;
however, unfortunately it is shielded by means of the assistance of
the Main Mining Office and until now it also had ensured the highest
political shield from the side of the former Minister of Economy. On
the other hand, we are convinced that neither the Slovak courts nor
the relevant international institutions to which we intend to
subsequently refer, will make any allowances for the interests of the
former Minister, and they will proceed strictly under law and
international treaties on mutual support and protection of
investments (because the shareholders of Rozmin a.s.ro. are
foreign companies), which can cause to the Slovak Republic
considerable damage in the form of an obligation to compensate
damage including the lost profit that will range approximately at
hundreds of millions of crowns, as well as damage of reputation and
cause of an international scandal of similar extent as it was, for
example, in the recent so-called CSOB case.**®

Clearly, the possibility of investment treaty proceedings to challenge the reassignment of
Rozmin’s rights was already foreseen and was the subject of correspondence by the CEO
of Belmont to a Minister in November 2005. A dispute between Belmont and the Slovak
Republic already crystallized with Mr. Agyagos’ letter, which expressly refers to claims
by Rozmin’s shareholders against the State under “international treaties on mutual support
and protection of investments (because the shareholders of Rozmin a.s.r.o are foreign
companies), which can cause to the Slovak Republic considerable damage in the form of
an obligation to compensate damage including the lost profit that will range approximately
at hundreds of millions of crowns.” In addition, Mr. Agyagos signed the letter in his two

capacities of Executive of Rozmin and President and CEO of Belmont:**”

Belmont considers that this letter is only a one-sided position, and invokes the decision in
Railroad Development Corporation v. Guatemala, in which an ICSID tribunal held that “a
dispute is a conflict of views on points of law or fact which requires sufficient
communication between the parties for each to know the other’s view and oppose them.”#°*
However, such was the case after Mr. Agyagos had sent this letter to the Minister, since
the position of the Slovak Republic on points of fact and law was already known to him at
the time he wrote the letter, and was not changed after the Minister received it. Moreover,

it is paradoxical to maintain that a dispute does not exist after one of the parties has

threatened the other of bringing a lawsuit before a tribunal.

EuroGas’ notice of dispute of 31 October 2011 does not highlight anything new, as
compared with Mr. Agyagos’ letter of November 2005, except for the outcome of the

domestic court process regarding the re-assignment of Rozmin’s mining rights.

To counter the approach taken by the tribunal in Lucchetti v. Peru, which this Tribunal
approves, Belmont relies heavily on Jan de Nul v. Egypt, where a provision similar to
Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT was at stake. In that case, a dispute between Jan
de Nul and the Suez Canal Authority had been submitted to local courts well before the
entry into force of the investment treaty. When the treaty came into force, the dispute was
pending before the Administrative Court of Ismailia, which eventually rendered an adverse

decision in 2003, approximately one year after the BIT’s entry into force. Notwithstanding

Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 18 May 2010 (CL-133), 129.

127

the fact that the BIT excluded disputes that had arisen prior to its entry into force, the
Tribunal concluded that it had jurisdiction. However, in the Jan de Nul v. Egypt Decision

on Jurisdiction, the tribunal reasoned as follows:

... the claims regarding the judgment and the manner in which the
Egyptian courts dealt with the dispute address the actions of the
court system as such, and are thus separate and distinct from the
conduct which formed the subject matter of the domestic
proceedings. Hence, they do not coincide with the conduct examined
in the course of the dispute brought under domestic law. [...]

[...] Admittedly, the previous dispute is one of the sources of the
present dispute, if not the main one. It is clear, however, that the
reasons, which may have motivated the alleged wrongdoings of the
SCA [Suez Canal Authority] at the time of the conclusion and/or
performance of the Contract, do not coincide with those underlying
the acts of the organs of the Egyptian State in the post-contract
phase of the dispute. Since the Claimants also base their claim upon
the decision of the Ismailia Court, the present dispute must be
deemed a new dispute.

The intervention of a new actor, the Ismailia Court, appears here as
a decisive factor to determine whether the dispute is a new dispute.
As the Claimants’ case is directly based on the alleged wrongdoing
of the Ismailia Court, the Tribunal considers that the original
dispute has (re)crystallized into a new dispute when the Ismailia
Court rendered its decision.“

452. Thus the Jan de Nul v. Egypt tribunal clearly distinguished between two phases. In the first
phase the actor accused of a wrongdoing was the Suez Canal Authority, which as the
tribunal observed, was not an organ of the State. In the second phase, the actor accused of
a wrongdoing was the Court of Ismailia, an organ of the State. By contrast, in the present
case all the actors accused of a wrongdoing were organs of the State, which were the same

at all stages: the DMO, the MMO and the Regional Court confirming their decisions.

453. The situation in the present case is to some extent similar to that in the PCIJ case
Phosphates in Morrocco,*” in which the PCIJ drew a distinction between the “real causes
of the dispute” and “subsequent factors which either presume the existence or are merely
the confirmation or development of earlier situations or facts.” What matters is the real

cause of the dispute.

454. In this case, there has been no separate act by a Slovak State organ that could be deemed
to have crystallized a new dispute. The chronology of relevant events in this case helps

distinguish the present situation from the situation in Jan de Nul v. Egypt:

This chart illustrates the fact that the situation was exactly the same on 3 May 2005, before
the BIT entered into force, and 1 August 2012, after the BIT entered into force: the mining
rights that were lost by Rozmin were reassigned to another company. In other words, the
mining rights were taken from Rozmin in 2005, allegedly in violation of Belmont’s rights
under the Canada-Slovakia BIT and international law, and several decisions of the mining
authorities (not the judicial authorities) refused to restitute the rights to Rozmin. The
decision of the DMO, on 30 March 2012, to reassign exclusive rights over the Mining Area
to VSK Mining, and its confirmation by the MMO on | August 2012, did not change
Belmont’s legal and factual situation: since the reassignment of the Mining Area in 2005,

it had lost its rights on the Mining Area and was not present on the site.

Contrary to Belmont’s position, the decisions of 30 March 2012 and 1 August 2012 cannot
be considered the source of a new dispute; rather, they were a refusal to resolve the ongoing

dispute, which arose from the alleged breach in 2005.

All the decisions by Slovak authorities that have been mentioned in this arbitration are
elements of the same dispute, the main feature of which is the taking of Belmont’s
investment. Pursuant to Article 15(6) of the BIT, the relevant time is the time when the
dispute arose. It arose with Mr. Agyagos’ letter of 3 November 2005, more than six years

before the entry into force of the BIT.

Since no new State conduct has given rise to a new dispute after 14 March 2009 (or even
(re)crystallised an old dispute), the Tribunal must conclude that it lacks jurisdiction over
Belmont’s claims. To conclude otherwise would deprive Article 15(6) of the Canada-
Slovakia BIT from any meaning and effect, and would require the Tribunal to engineer a
legalistic and artificial reasoning to bypass this provision, and effectively extend the
ratione temporis application of the Treaty to a long-standing dispute dating from well over

three years prior to the entry into force of the treaty.

The State Parties to the Canada-Slovakia BIT cannot have intended that Article 15(6) be
read and applied in a way that exposes them to claims from investors that could date from
more than three years before the entry into force of the treaty, just because a certain dispute

was not settled and/or might give rise to a follow-up action. Considering that the State’s

130

461.

VII.

462.

463.

refusal to overturn an existing alleged breach gives rise to a new dispute would open the
floodgates to a possible complete disregard of the condition ratione temporis of the
application of a BIT. The consequence would be that an investor could bypass the ratione
temporis limitations of a treaty by commencing local court proceedings after the entry into

force of the treaty, in respect of an old dispute. This cannot be a sensible legal result.

The Tribunal does not accept that an investor may invoke the last event in a series of related
or similar actions by the State to claim the benefit of the treaty. In the present case, the
situation is clear-cut since there has not been a series of (alleged) transgressions by the
Respondent, but one (alleged) transgression whose effects have been maintained

throughout domestic court proceedings and repeated decisions by the mining authorities.

To conclude, the Tribunal finds that Belmont’s claims fall outside the ambit of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the Canada-Slovakia BIT. Because the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over the Claimant Belmont’s claims for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal

does not need to address the Respondent’s objection based on Belmont’s standing.

470. In accordance with ICSID Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and paragraph 10 of Procedural
Order No. 1, these arbitration costs have been paid out of advances made by the Parties in
equal parts (50% by the Claimants and 50% by the Respondent). As a result, the Claimants’
share of the arbitration costs amounts to USD 425,262.35, and the Respondent’s share also
amounts to USD 425,262.35. In addition, as mentioned above, the Claimants have agreed
that Belmont and EuroGas are liable for the Claimants’ share of the arbitration costs in
proportion to their respective (alleged) shareholding in Rozmin. Belmont claims to have a
57% interest in Rozmin, and EuroGas claims to have a 33% interest in Rozmin. Therefore,
Belmont bears 63.3% of the Claimants’ share of the arbitration costs (USD 269,332.82),47
and EuroGas bears 36.6% (USD 155,929.53).4”°

of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.

+74 This amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (printing, copying and courier).
“75 Because the Claimants together own 90% of Rozmin’s shares, the applicable formula to determine Belmont’ share
of the arbitration costs is USD 425,262.35 x (57/90).

VII.

476.

This provision establishes the Tribunal’ s discretion in allocating the costs of the arbitration

and the Parties’ costs, including legal fees and expenses.

In reaching its decision on costs in this case, the Tribunal has considered in particular the
following circumstances: the Respondent has succeeded in its plea that this Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction. However, the jurisdictional issues arising in this matter were complex, and it
was not unreasonable for the Claimants to attempt to establish jurisdiction under the BITs,
even if the Tribunal eventually found that treaty protection was not available in the specific

and complex circumstances of the case.

Therefore, in exercising its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the
Tribunal finds it equitable that the arbitration costs identified in paragraph 469 above are
finally apportioned just as they were borne by the Parties during the proceeding, i.e.: the
Respondent shall bear USD 425,262.35 of the arbitration costs; Belmont shall bear
USD 269,332.82; and EuroGas shall bear USD 155,929.53.

Each Party shall bear its own costs for the preparation and presentation of its case (legal

and expert fees and expenses, travel costs, translation and other costs).

AWARD

For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides as follows:
a) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over EuroGas.
b) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Belmont.

c) The Tribunal’s fees and costs and ICSID charges are apportioned as they were
borne by the Parties during the proceeding, which is as follows: USD 425,262.35
by the Respondent; USD 269,332.82 by Belmont; and USD 155,929.53 by EuroGas.

d) Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and other expenses incurred in relation to

this arbitration.

e) All other requests for relief are dismissed.
