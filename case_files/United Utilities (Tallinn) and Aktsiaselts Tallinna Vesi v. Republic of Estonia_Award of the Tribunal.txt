INTRODUCTION

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement on
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of The
Netherlands and the Republic of Estonia, which was signed on 27 October 1992 and entered
into force on 1 September 1993' (the “BIT” or “Netherlands-Estonia BIT” or the “Treaty”) and
the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention’).

2. The dispute relates to certain steps taken by various organs of Respondent allegedly in breach
of the BIT, further to the privatisation of the municipal water and wastewater infrastructure and
services in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital.

I. PARTIES

3. Claimants are:

United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. (‘UUTBV”), a company incorporated under the laws of the
Kingdom of The Netherlands, with its registered office at Teleportboulevard 140, 1043 EJ
Amsterdam, The Netherlands;?

and

Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi (“ASTV”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of
Estonia, with its registered office at Adala 10, Tallinn 10614, Estonia. ? UUTBV and ASTV are
collectively referred to as “Claimants.”

4. Respondent is the Republic of Estonia (“Estonia” or “Respondent”; and together with
Claimants, the “Parties”).

5. The Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

ML PROCEDURAL HISTORY

6. On 15 October 2014, ICSID received a Request for arbitration dated 13 October 2016 from
UUTBV and ASTV (the “Request” or “RFA”), along with Exhibits C-1 to C-46.

7. On 24 October 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the
Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an
arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID
Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three (3) arbitrators, one (1) to be
appointed by each party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of
the two (2) co-arbitrators.

The Tribunal is composed of Mr Stephen L. Drymer, a national of Canada, President,
appointed by his co-arbitrators; Sir David A.R. Williams QC, a national of New Zealand,
appointed by Claimants; and Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France, appointed by
Respondent.

On 19 March 2015, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the Parties that all
three (3) arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore
deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr James Claxton, ICSID Legal Counsel, was
designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Further to the departure of Mr James Claxton,
Mr Paul-Jean Le Cannu was appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal‘ in April 2015.

By letter of 30 March 2015, the Tribunal through its Secretary circulated a draft Procedural
Order No. 1 and a draft Agenda for the first session to the Parties for their comments, which
the Centre received on 20 April 2015.

On 1 May 2015, Respondent filed a Request for bifurcation of the proceeding into separate
jurisdiction and merits phases (the “Request for Bifurcation”) and indicated that it intended
to raise at least two (2) objections under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1). On the same date,
Claimants filed observations, opposing the Request for Bifurcation. The Parties also filed
further comments on the draft Procedural Order No. 1 and the timetable. Updated drafts of the
agenda and the Procedural Order No. 1 were circulated to the Parties on 3 May 2015.

On 5 May 2015, the Tribunal held a first session and a hearing on the Request for Bifurcation
at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London. The Tribunal Secretary circulated
the verbatim transcript of the first session to the Parties on 7 May 2015.

On 22 May 2015, the Tribunal through its Secretary circulated a revised draft Procedural Order
No. 1 for the Parties’ comments, in particular of paragraph 20.6.2. Claimants and Respondent
submitted their comments on 29 May 2015 and 4 June 2015, respectively. On 5 June 2015,
Claimants submitted further comments on paragraph 20.6.2 of draft Procedural Order No. 1 in
response to Respondent's letter of 4 June 2015.

On 5 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO1”) embodying the
agreement of the Parties and the Tribunal’s decisions on procedural matters. PO1 records the
Parties’ confirmation that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that no party has any
objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal.° The Order also provides, inter
alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006,° that the

4 Parties were advised of same by letter of 30 April 2015.
5 PO1, 92.1.
6 PO1, 1.1.

procedural language is English,’ that the place of proceeding is Washington, D.C.,® and that
hearings shall be open to the public. PO1 further provides that the procedural timetable for this
arbitration will be determined in a further procedural order once the Tribunal’s decision on the
Request for Bifurcation has been rendered.°

By letter of 16 June 2015, the Centre informed the Parties of its intention to publish PO1 on its
website by 18 June 2015, pursuant to paragraph 23.1 of PO1, which provides that “[t]he Parties
consent to ICSID publication of any Procedural Orders, Decisions and Award issued in the
present proceeding, subject to the redaction of confidential information.” Both Parties
confirmed on 18 June 2015 that they did not wish to propose any redaction to PO1.

On 17 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO2”) denying Respondent's
Request for Bifurcation and establishing the Timetable for the Arbitration (Annex A), including
the date of the hearing on 7-11 and 14-15 November 2016. By letter of the same date, the
Centre informed the Parties of its intention to publish PO2 on its website by 19 June 2015,
subject to the potential redaction of any confidential information that a Party may propose
within that time period. Respondent confirmed on 19 June 2015 that it did not wish to propose
any redaction to PO2. Claimants did not submit any comments in response to the Centre's
letter of 17 June 2015.

On 19 June 2015, the Tribunal through its Secretary issued a revised version of PO1 to include
the following individuals in the list of participants in the first session:

— Mr Kaupo Lepasepp, Mr Simon Gardiner, and Ms Riina Kai, who participated in the
first session on behalf of Claimants, as requested by Claimants on 18 June 2015.

— Ms Kristiina Rebane, who participated on behalf of Respondent.

On 18 September 2015, pursuant to Annex A of Procedural Order No. 2, Claimants
electronically filed their Memorial (the “Memorial”), along with the following documents:

— The witness statements of Robert John Gallienne dated September 2015 (unsigned),
lan John Alexander Plenderleith dated September 2015 (unsigned), Jiri Mis, dated
15 September 2015, Vladimir Panov'i Esimene Tunnistaja Utlus, dated 11 September
2015 (Estonian language original, together with an English translation);

— The expert report of Andrew Meaney of Oxera Consulting LLP dated 18 September
2015;1°

7PO1, (11.1.
8 PO1, $10.1.
9 PO1, 914.1.

10 By email of 23 September 2015, Claimants informed the Centre and the Tribunal that they had identified
a minor error in Claimants’ expert report and circulated an electronic copy of the corrected expert report,
along with a marked-up version showing the corrections made, the following day.

— The index of Claimants’ factual exhibits and legal authorities;
— Exhibits C-47 through C-265; and
— Legal authorities CL-1 through CL-17."1

By email of 9 October 2015, pursuant to paragraphs 10.2 and 20.6 of PO1 and as instructed
by the Tribunal, the Centre informed the Parties of the options available to them to hold an
open hearing (a livestream to an overflow room or a webcast by internet), and invited them to
confirm their preferences as to these options. The Parties were also invited to confirm the
hearing venue.

By email of 16 October 2015, Claimants confirmed their agreement that the hearing be held at
the Hearing Centre of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”) in Paris, and their
preference for the hearing to be webcast by internet. By letter of 27 October 2015, Respondent
also agreed that the hearing be held at the ICC in Paris. Like Claimants, Respondent further
expressed its preference that the hearing be webcast, but proposed that the webcast not be
live and be made available on the ICSID website after the hearing, lest witness sequestration
be practically impossible to enforce.

By letter of 14 December 2015, the Tribunal through its Secretary conveyed the following
message to the Parties regarding the webcasting of the hearing:

The Tribunal notes that the parties are both agreeable to having the
hearing held at the ICC Hearing Centre in Paris and webcast. They
disagree however as to whether the hearing should be webcast live or
once the hearing has been concluded, with the Respondent arguing
that ‘if the hearing were webcast live, the sequestration of witnesses
would be practically impossible to enforce, or if enforced, it would result
in the absurd situation that the webcast could be followed by the whole
world save the witnesses who have not testified yet.’

The Tribunal does not share the Respondent's reservations as to the
proposed live webcast of the hearing. In the Tribunal’s view, it is not
unusual for a hearing to be webcast live in a case where the applicable
procedural rules also require that witnesses be sequestrated. (See
recently Spence International Investments, LLC, Berkowitz et al v. the
Republic of Costa Rica (UNCT/13/2) where a live webcast was
deemed to be both desirable to afford ‘effective public access to the
hearing’ and compatible with sequestration.) The Tribunal recalls that
it is each party's responsibility to ensure that sequestration is properly
complied with.

In view of the foregoing, it is hereby decided that the hearing in this
case shall be webcast live from the ICC Hearing Centre in Paris.
[Footnote omitted]

11 By letter of 7 December 2015, Claimants informed the Centre and the Tribunal that they were producing
(i) fuller or corrected versions of certain exhibits and (ii) additional Estonian and Dutch language versions
of certain exhibits submitted in English only in September 2015.

By letter of 18 December 2015, Counsel for Claimants notified the Centre and the Tribunal
that Mr Matthew Weiniger QC was made a partner at Linklaters LLP as of 19 October 2015
and would continue to represent Claimants in these proceedings.

On 18 January 2016, Claimants informed the Tribunal that they were producing (i) additional
fuller versions of certain exhibits and (ii) additional Estonian and English language versions of
certain exhibits where only the English translation or the Estonian original had originally been
produced by Claimants. On the same date, the above-described additional documents filed by
Claimants on 7 December 2015 and 18 January 2016 were sent to the Tribunal.

On 27 January 2016, Estonia filed an Application for an immediate procedural order prohibiting
publication of any arbitration materials (the “Application for an Immediate Procedural
Order” or “Application”), along with exhibits R-1 to R-12 and legal authorities RL-1 to RL-3,
which the Centre also received in hard copy.'? Respondent also indicated that it would file a
proper request for provisional measures, which it proposed to do by 26 February 2016.

By letter of 28 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its intention to decide on
Respondent's Application for an Immediate Procedural Order on 29 January 2016 and invited
Claimants to provide their response by the same date. The Tribunal expressed its
understanding and expectation that Claimants would refrain from all further publication or
dissemination of materials related to the arbitration until such time as the Tribunal determined
the questions raised by Respondent's Application.

On 29 January 2016, Claimants submitted their response and proposed to delay the
publication of an extract of their Memorial on the condition that the Parties agree on certain
terms pending the Tribunal’s consideration of Respondent's Application and forthcoming
request for provisional measures.

After the Tribunal had invited the Parties to communicate directly with each other regarding
Claimants’ proposal, Respondent informed the Tribunal on 30 January 2016 that the Parties
had reached the following agreement, pending the Tribunal’s consideration of Respondent's
forthcoming request for provisional measures:

1. Neither Party shall publish the Memorial, the Counter-
Memorial, any witness statement, or any expert report that have been
or will be filed in this arbitration, or any summary, excerpt or extract
thereof.

2. Each Party may publish a stock exchange announcement or
press release, or make public statements regarding the filing of the
Memorial or the Counter-Memorial and the general position that
Claimants claim violations of the Treaty and Estonia denies Claimants’
claims in full. Such communications shall not discuss the specific
content of the Memorial or the Counter-Memorial or the witness
statements and expert reports attached thereto, or identify the
witnesses and experts. The Parties reserve the right to revisit this
agreement with each other and with the Tribunal in the event of
material media coverage which goes beyond the fact of the filing of the

12 See ICSID’s letter dated 9 February 2016.

Memorial and Counter-Memorial and that Claimants claim violations of
the Treaty and Estonia denies Claimants’ claims in full, and which
either Party considers it should respond to.

On 9 February 2016, Respondent electronically filed its Counter-Memorial dated 5 February
2016, along with the following documents:

— The first witness statements of Mr Indrek Teder (in Estonian and English), Ms Karin
Kroon, Mr Ken-Marti Vaher, Mr Mart Ots, and Mr Martin Poder;

— The expert reports of Dr Richard Hern, Mr Hannes Vallikivi, and Mr Mart Rask (in
Estonian and English);

— The lists of Respondent's exhibits and legal authorities;
— Exhibits R-13 through R-212; and
— Legal authorities RL-4 through RL-167.

By email of 12 February 2016, Respondent submitted the corrected version of its Counter-
Memorial, of the report of Dr Richard Hern and of its lists of exhibits and of legal authorities.

On 26 February 2016, Respondent filed an Application for Provisional Measures (the
“Application for Provisional Measures”), along with exhibits R-213 to R-216 and legal
authorities RL-168 to RL-175.

On 4 March 2016, the Parties exchanged requests for document production (“Document
Requests”) in accordance with paragraph 15 of PO1 (as amended) dated 19 June 2015 and
the Timetable at Annex A of PO2.

By letter of 16 March 2016 and email of 17 March 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal of
their proposed calendar for the resolution of Estonia’s Application for Provisional Measures,
which was accepted by the Tribunal on the next day. It provided as follows:

1. Claimants shall file their Response to the Application by 18 March 2016 (the
“Response on PM”);

2. By 22 March 2016, Estonia shall notify Claimants and the Tribunal whether it
wishes to file a reply to the Response (the “Reply on PM’);

3. If Estonia opts to file a Reply, that Reply is to be filed by 1 April 2016, with
Claimants’ Rejoinder to that Reply, if any, to be filed by 15 April 2016;

4. The Tribunal shall resolve the Application without an oral hearing.

On 18 March 2016, Claimants filed their Response on PM to Estonia’s Application for

After advising the Tribunal of its intention of filing a reply on 22 March 2016, Respondent filed
its Reply on PM on 1 April 2016, along with exhibits R-218 to R-224 and legal authorities R-177
and R-178.

On 1 April 2016, the Parties exchanged responses and/or objections to the other party's
Document Requests.

On 15 April 2016, the Parties filed their replies to the other Party's objections to their respective
Document Requests, accompanied by Redfern Schedules setting out the Parties’ positions in
respect of the Requests on which rulings are sought.

On the same day, Claimants filed a Rejoinder to Estonia’s Application for Provisional
Measures, together with exhibits C-270 through C-272, and legal authorities CL-26 through
CL-27.18

By letter of 22 April 2016, Claimants filed comments on Respondent's Reply to Claimants’
Objections to Respondent's Request for the Production of Documents. Upon the Tribunal’s
invitation, Respondent filed comments on 28 April 2016 in response to Claimants’ letter of 22
April 2016.

On 3 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO3"), which recorded its
Decision on the Parties’ Requests for Document Production, along with Annex A (Claimants’
Document Requests) and Annex B (Respondent's Document Requests). On the same date,
the Centre informed the Parties of its intention to publish PO3 on its website by 5 May 2016,
subject to the potential redaction of any confidential information that a Party may propose by
that date. By letter of 4 May 2016, Respondent proposed that PO3 be published without its
Annexes or, alternatively, that specific references to the Parties’ submissions, the witness
statements and expert reports, and the names of witnesses and experts be redacted from
Annexes A and B. By letter of 5 May 2016, Claimants informed the Tribunal that in their view
no redactions were necessary and proposed that PO3 be published immediately but that the
issue of publication of the Annexes be deferred until the Tribunal’s decision on Respondent's
objections to publication.

By letter of 9 May 2016, the Tribunal through its Secretary informed the Parties that it had
asked ICSID to publish PO3 without its Annexes and invited them to submit their comments
on the publication of the Annexes once the Tribunal’s Decision on Respondent's Application
for Provisional Measures had been rendered.

On 12 May 2016, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Respondent's Application for Provisional
Measures (the “Decision on Provisional Measures’). The Tribunal decided as follows:

(1) Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures is granted
in part.
(2) No party is prevented from engaging in general discussion

about the case in public, which discussion is not limited to

Objections to Claimants’ Requests to Produce Documents dated 15 April 2016.

updates on the status of the case, and may include wider
aspects of the case such as a summary of the parties’
positions, provided that such public discussion is not used as
an instrument to antagonise any party, exacerbate the parties’
differences, aggravate the dispute, disrupt the proceedings or
unduly pressure any party.

(3) Such public discussion does not include publication of the
‘Arbitration Documents,’ i.e., the documents filed in this
arbitration, such as the parties’ written submissions, witness
statements, expert reports and documents produced within the
framework of document production, or any excerpt or extract
thereof.

(4) Any request not granted herein is denied.

On the same day, the Centre advised the Parties of its intention to publish the Decision on
Provisional Measures on its website by 16 May 2016, subject to the potential redaction of any
confidential information that a Party may propose by that date. The Parties were also invited
to submit any further comments they may have had on the publication of Annexes A and B to
POS by 19 May 2016.

By letter of 16 May 2016, Claimants informed the Tribunal that in their view no redactions were
necessary either to the Decision or to Annexes A and B to POS. By letter of 19 May 2016,
Respondent confirmed its position stated in its letter of 4 May 2016 regarding the publishing
of PO3. Claimants commented on Respondent's letter of 19 May 2016 by a letter of 26 May
2016. By email of same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would issue a ruling on
the question of the publication of Annexes A and B to PO3 as soon as possible.

By letter of 8 June 2016, Claimants requested, with Respondent's consent, a one-week
extension until 17 June 2016 to submit their Reply Memorial (the “Reply”). Claimants also
submitted the Parties’ proposed joint amendments to the Procedural Timetable set out in
Annex A to PO2. By email of the same date, Respondent confirmed its consent to Claimants’
request, which the Tribunal granted also on the same date. A new version of Annex A to PO2
was circulated, reflecting the following agreed amendments:

— Claimants to file their Reply Memorial on 17 June 2016;
— Estonia to file its Rejoinder Memorial on 16 September 2016; and

— Witness notification to take place on 21 September 2016, with the other dates in the
timetable remaining unchanged.

By letter of 9 June 2016, the Tribunal issued the following ruling on the publication of Annexes
Aand B to POS:

The Tribunal has considered the parties’ positions regarding
publication of Annexes A and B of Procedural Order No. 3, including
their respective proposals regarding redactions. It has considered
those positions and proposals in the light of both its recent Decision on
Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures (‘Decision’) and

8

the parties’ consent, as recorded at §23.1 of Procedural Order No. 1
dated 19 June 2015, to ICSID publication of any Procedural Orders,
Decisions, and Award issued in this arbitration ‘subject to the redaction
of confidential information’.

The Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or correct to prohibit
publication of Annexes A and B in their entirety. Nor does it consider it
appropriate or correct to allow publication of those Annexes in their
entirety.

The Tribunal is of the view that the redactions proposed by
Respondent go far beyond what is required under the principles set out
in the Decision, which are intended to allow for substantive, though not
unrestricted, publication of information concerning the arbitration.
Moreover, the Tribunal does not consider it reasonable or
proportionate to embark upon a redaction-by-redaction process of
analysis and determination of each of the innumerable redactions
proposed by Respondent. The Tribunal prefers the approach proposed
by Claimants, which it considers principled, reasonable, fair and
efficient.

Accordingly, as instructed by the Tribunal, ICSID shall shortly publish
Annexes A and B with the following information redacted: (i) direct
quotations from the parties' submissions, witness statements and
expert reports, and exhibits; and (ii) the names of witnesses and
experts, as well as third parties other than those which (or who) plainly
exercise public functions, such as Estonian Ministries and Ministers,
the Estonian Parliament and its members, the Estonian Competition
Authority, the State Audit Office, the Legal Chancellor, the City of
Tallinn, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and
the European Commission.

47. On 17 June 2016, pursuant to the amended Procedural Timetable recorded in Annex A to
PO2, Claimants electronically filed their Reply Memorial, along with the following documents:

— The unsigned second witness statement of Robert John Gallienne dated June 2016;
— The second witness statement of lan John Alexander Plenderleith dated 16 June 2016;
— The first witness statement of Dennis van Rooijen dated 17 June 2016;

— The second expert report of Andrew Meaney dated 17 June 2016;

— The expert opinion of Toomas Pikamae dated 17 June 2016 (original Estonian version
and English translation);

— An index of the factual exhibits to Claimants’ Reply Memorial;
— An index of the legal exhibits to Claimants’ Reply Memorial;

— Exhibits C-273 through C-411; and

— Legal authorities CL-28 through CL-118.

By email of 18 July 2016, the President of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to propose that Ms
Laurence Ste-Marie be engaged as assistant to the Tribunal (the “Assistant”) and invited the
Parties to provide their views on the proposed appointment. Further to the Parties’ comments
and consent to the appointment of 26 and 28 July and the circulation of draft terms of
appointment on 29 July and Claimants’ comments thereon of 3 August, the Tribunal circulated
the Terms of Appointment for signature by the Parties, Tribunal and Ms Ste-Marie.

On 16 September 2016, Respondent filed its Rejoinder Memorial, along with the following
documents:

— The second expert reports of Dr Richard Hern, dated 16 September 2016, Mr Hannes
Vallikivi dated 13 September 2016 (in Estonian and English), and Mr Mart Rask dated
15 September 2016 (in Estonian and English);

— The first witness statement of Mr Falko Sellner dated 16 September 2016;

— The second witness statements of Mr Ken-Marti Vaher dated 16 September 2016, Mr
Mart Ots dated 14 September 2016, and Mr Martin Péder dated 13 September 2016;

— The lists of Respondent's exhibits and legal authorities;
— Exhibits R-228 through R-331; and
— Legal authorities RL-187 through RL-247.'4

By letters of 21 September 2016, each Party notified the Tribunal of the list of fact and expert
witnesses that it wished to cross-examine at the hearing.

On 29 September 2016, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing telephone conference with the Parties.
By letter of 6 October 2016, Claimants filed a request for leave to file nineteen (19) additional
exhibits (the “Proposed Exhibits”) to the documents accompanying their Reply Memorial
dated 17 June 2016 (the “First Request’).

Upon the Tribunal’s invitation, Respondent filed on 10 October 2016 observations on the First
Request, asking the Tribunal that it be rejected.

By letter of 14 October 2016, Claimants filed comments on Respondent's observations on the
First Request.

By email of 21 October 2016, Claimants submitted a further request for leave to file one
additional exhibit (the “Second Request’).

14 By email of 21 September 2016, Respondent submitted a corrected version of its Rejoinder Memorial
dated 16 September 2016, along with a redline comparing the version of 16 September to the corrected
version of 21 September, and a corrected list of legal authorities.

By letter of the same day, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal regarding the examination of three
(3) of its witnesses. Respondent indicated that Mr Sellner could only testify by video
conference on 10 November, that Mr Ots had reconsidered his decision to testify in English,
and Mr Teder would not be able to attend the hearing due to a medical condition. The Tribunal
invited Claimants’ comments by email of the same day.

By letter of 23 October 2016, the Tribunal granted Claimants’ First Request and asked the
Parties “to discuss and, it is to be hoped, agree on ‘reasonable and practical measures’
intended to allow Estonia to ‘address Claimants’ arguments based on the Proposed Exhibits,’
[...] and to revert to the Tribunal in this regard by no later than Wednesday, 26 October 2016.”
The Tribunal also invited Respondent to submit its comments on the Second Request.

By letter of 24 October 2016, Claimants submitted their comments on the examination of
Messrs Sellner, Ots, and Teder. Although Claimants had no substantive comment on the
position regarding Messrs. Ots and Sellner, they requested that the Tribunal take into account
the lack of opportunity to cross-examine Mr Teder in deciding the weight to be afforded to his
evidence. They also reserved the right to address the reliability of his witness statement in
their later submissions.

By email of 24 October 2016, the Parties requested a one-day extension until 25 October 2016
to submit the (i) Chronology, (ii) Dramatis Personae, (iii) List of Issues, and (iv) Skeleton
Arguments, which they were to submit pursuant to Annex A of PO2. By email of 25 October
2016, the Tribunal granted the Parties an extension until 25 October 2016 to file their Skeleton
Arguments and until 6:00 pm GMT on 27 October 2016 to file the other documents. On 25
October 2016, the Parties submitted their Skeleton Arguments.

By letter of 25 October 2016, further to the Parties’ exchanges regarding the examination of
Messrs Sellner, Ots, and Teder, the Tribunal asked the Parties to submit an updated hearing
schedule. On 28 October 2016, Respondent submitted a medical certificate attesting to
Mr Teder’s health condition.

By letter of 26 October 2016, Respondent confirmed that it did not object to Claimants’ Second
Request of 21 October 2016 on the condition that the additional document introduced into the
record be treated confidentially and that appropriate measures be put into place for that
purpose at the hearing.

On 27 October 2016, the Parties submitted their agreed Chronology and Dramatis Personae,
and their respective Lists of Issues.

Further to the Parties’ request conveyed by Respondent in the above-referred letter of 26
October, the Tribunal granted the Parties until 28 October 2016 to pursue an agreement on
the “reasonable and practical measures” intended to allow Respondent to address Claimants’
arguments based on the Proposed Exhibits. The Tribunal also acknowledged Estonia’s
consent to the filing of the document referred to in Claimants’ request of 21 October 2016. As
regards Estonia’s concern to ensure that the document to which it refers is not improperly
disclosed to the public via the planned web broadcast of the hearing, Tribunal informed the
Parties that it had liaised with the Secretariat in that respect and that they had identified a
means of ensuring that any off-the-record discussions or other necessarily confidential

information was not inadvertently webcast. It asked the Parties to notify it immediately of any
further or specific protocol required as well as to raise the issue with the other Party directly.

By letter of 28 October 2016, Claimants asked the Tribunal to make an order that the Parties’
experts be permitted to make a presentation of up to twenty (20) minutes at the start of their
examination, including using PowerPoint presentations. Claimants also requested that the
Tribunal make an order that the “reasonable and practical measures” referred to by the
Tribunal take the form of Claimants’ proposal, namely that they provide Respondent with “a
list of topics/issues by reference to which Claimants currently expect to rely on the Additional
Exhibits,” rather than “a list of references to the specific propositions allegedly supported by
specific parts of the [Additional Exhibits]” [alterations from the original] as proposed by
Respondent, whom the Tribunal invited to respond to Claimants’ requests by 31 October.

By separate letter of the same date, Claimants advised the Tribunal that it intended to examine
during direct examination their witness, Mr Dennis van Rooijen, on matters that had arisen
after his witness statement was signed.

By letter of 31 October 2016, Respondent indicated that it preferred not to have experts’
presentations at the hearing, and requested that the Tribunal order Claimants to provide “a list
of references to the specific propositions allegedly supported by specific parts of the Additional
Exhibits [...], with the understanding that the propositions and references to the relevant parts
of the Additional Exhibits should be as precise as if Claimants had cited and/or quoted the
Additional Exhibits in their Reply Memorial.”

By letter of 1 November 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that they were free to choose
to have their experts make presentations by way of direct examination, including with
demonstrative visual aids if desired, of no longer than twenty (20) minutes, with the time so
used to be counted against the Party in question. As to the Additional Exhibits, the Tribunal
further informed the Parties of its decision that Claimants’ proposal, i.e. the production of a list
of topics/issues by reference to which Claimants expect to rely on the Additional Exhibits, was
the more reasonable and practical in the circumstances.

On 2 November 2016, further to the Tribunal’s request of 25 October, the Parties submitted
an amended draft hearing schedule.

On 3 November 2016, Claimants submitted a list of topics/issues to which Claimants’
Additional Exhibits relate.

On 6 November 2016, the Parties exchanged by email the demonstratives which they intended
to use in their opening submissions at the hearing.

A hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held at the ICC in Paris, on 7-11 and 14-15
November 2016 (the “Hearing”). The following persons were present at the Hearing:'®

On 10 November 2016, the Centre received an email from Mr Helis Evart of Glimstedt, who
indicated that he represented the Estonian Competition Authority (the “ECA”), asking for
permission to record the hearing from the live webcast. On 11 November 2016, this email was
forwarded to the Parties and the Tribunal. Counsel for Respondent informed the Tribunal that
it would liaise with Glimstedt as requested by the Tribunal.

On the last day of the hearing, 15 November 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their
agreement to file one (1) round of post-hearing briefs on 31 January 2017, with a possibility to
seek permission to apply for a rebuttal on new points. There being no agreement between the
Parties as to the number of pages, the issue was left to be decided by the Tribunal. The
Tribunal also asked the Parties to state their views on the fate of the webcast, as to which they
disagreed, with Claimants arguing that the video recording of the hearing should remain on
the ICSID website and Respondent contending that the video recording may be used by the
Parties as they see fit, including for publication on their own website, but opposing publication
on the ICSID website.

On 22 December 2016, the Centre advised the Parties that the audio recording of the hearing
had been uploaded to BOX. Pursuant to paragraph 21.4 of PO1, the Parties were invited to
inform the Tribunal of any agreed corrections to the hearing transcripts by 5 January 2017,
which was later postponed to 13 January 2017 at the request of the Parties.

On 23 December 2016, having considered the Parties’ views on the fate of the webcast and
the length of post-hearing briefs, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decisions (i) not to

14

77.

78.

79.

80.

81.

82.

83.

84.

overrule Respondent's objection to posting the recording on the ICSID website, especially
where transparency can be achieved by publication on ASTV’s website, and (ii) to limit the
length of post-hearing briefs to a hundred (100) pages. The Tribunal further advised the Parties
that it had not ruled out the possibility of asking the Parties to address certain specific issues
in their post-hearing briefs, it being understood that the Parties could if necessary apply for an
extension of the filing deadline to address these issues.

On 13 January 2017, Claimants submitted the Parties’ agreed corrections to the hearing
transcript, which Ms Claire Hill, the court reporter, incorporated in a revised version of the
transcript. The revised hearing transcript was circulated to the Parties on 27 February 2017.

By letter of 24 January 2017, the Tribunal through its Secretary circulated its list of topics and
questions for the Parties to address in their post-hearing briefs. The Tribunal also invited the
Parties to confer with each other with a view, if necessary, to proposing an appropriate
extension of the deadline for the filing of the Parties’ post-hearing briefs.

On 27 January 2017, Claimants informed the Tribunal on behalf of the Parties that
on 26 January 2017, the Tallinn Circuit Court issued a decision in the Estonian proceedings,
which the Parties wished to put on record and comment on in their post-hearing briefs. In
addition, in order to allow the Parties to respond to the Tribunal’s questions and to address the
new decision of the Tallinn Circuit Court, the Parties proposed, by agreement, that the deadline
for the exchange of post-hearing briefs be extended to 22 February 2017, and the page limit
for those post hearing briefs be increased to one hundred twenty-five (125) pages.

On the same date, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it accepted their proposals.

By emails of 22 February 2017, the Parties simultaneously filed their post-hearing briefs, with
Claimants also filing an updated estimate of damages from Mr Meaney of Oxera, dated 21
February 2017, a copy of exhibit C-432, and Claimants’ index of legal exhibits to their post-
hearing brief. On 1 March 2017, Claimants commented on a calculation error which they saw
in Respondent's post-hearing brief.

The Parties filed their submissions on costs on 12 May 2017 and their reply submissions on
same on 26 May 2017.

On 20 December 2017, Claimants provided to the Tribunal an update on the status of the
Estonian proceedings between ASTV and the ECA by submitting a copy of the Estonian
Supreme Court decision issued on 12 December 2017 (the “Supreme Court Decision”), an
English translation of this decision as well as submissions on the impact of the decision on the
current arbitration.

On 22 December 2017, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on the Estonian Supreme
Court Decision by 5 January 2018. That same day, Respondent requested an extension until

85.

12 January 2018 to file its remarks as well as leave to file its own translation of the decision,
both of which were granted by the Tribunal."

Respondent filed its remarks and its own translation of the Supreme Court Decision
on 12 January 2018. On 19 January 2018, Claimants asked to file a reply, and did so
on 26 January 2018 after obtaining the Tribunal’s authorisation. With permission of the
Tribunal, on 9 February 2018 Respondent filed a rejoinder. On 13 February 2018, Claimants
expressed certain disagreements with Estonia’s submissions but refrained from seeking
another opportunity to comment on the Supreme Court Decision.

On 13 March 2018, Respondent sought leave to file (i) a copy of the judgment rendered by the
Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) in Case C-284/16
(Slovak Republic v Achmea BV; the “Achmea Judgment” and the “Achmea Case’”)"” that
addresses the compatibility of investor-state arbitration clauses in intra-EU bilateral investment
treaties, and (ii) observations on the Achmea Judgment. Claimants consented to
Respondent's requests, provided that they would also have an opportunity to comment, and
the Tribunal consequently invited the Parties to file simultaneous ten-page submissions on 26
March 2018.

On 25 March 2018, Claimants sought leave of the Tribunal to submit a document request to
Respondent, consisting of the written observations that Estonia had filed in the Achmea Case.
Further to the Tribunal’s invitation, Respondent provided its comment on this request on 27
March 2018. The next day, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its rejection of Claimants’
request. As directed by the Tribunal, the Parties filed their respective submission on the
Achmea Judgment on 29 March 2018, together with legal authorities CL-123 through CL-133
and legal authorities RL-250 through RL-261, respectively.

On 22 August 2018, the European Commission filed an Application for Leave to Intervene as
a Non-Disputing Party, along with annexes 1 and 2 (the “European Commission’s
Application’).

On 24 August 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the European
Commission's Application of 22 August 2018 by 31 August 2018.

On 31 August 2018, as per the Tribunal’s instructions, the Parties filed their respective
comments on the European Commission's Application.

On 2 October 2018, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Application for Leave to Intervene
as a Non-Disputing Party Submitted by the European Commission. The Tribunal decided as
follows:

(1) The Commission's Application is granted in part;

16 Art. 16.3 of PO1 provides that no party shall be permitted to file an additional document after the filing of
its respective written submission, save in exceptional circumstances, and that, where a party seek leave to
file such document, it must not annex such document to its request.

(2) The Commission is granted leave to participate in the present
arbitration as a non-disputing party to the extent and in the manner set
out below;

(3) The Commission is invited to submit a single, written amicus curiae
submission of not more than 15 pages on the legal question specified
at para. 12 of its Application, by no later than 10 days from the date of
dispatch of the present Decision to the Commission;

(4) The parties (Claimants on the one hand, Respondent on the other)
may each file comments of not more than 15 pages to the
Commission's submission, should they wish to do so, within 14 days
of the date of transmission to them of the Commission’s submission;

(5) The Commission's request for access to the documents filed in the
case is rejected;

(6) The Commission's request for attend any further hearing in the
case is rejected, as no such hearing is either scheduled or foreseen.

By letter of the same date, the Centre informed the Parties of its intention to publish the
Decision on its website by 4 October 2018, subject to the potential redaction of any confidential
information that a Party may propose by that date. No comments were received from the
Parties.

On 18 October 2018, the European Commission filed an Amicus Curiae, along with annexes
EC 1 through EC 20 (the “Amicus Brief’).

On 19 October 2018, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal requesting that the award in the case
of UP and C.D Holding Internationale v. Hungary (\CSID Case No. ARB/13/35) rendered on 9
October 2018, referred to in the European Commission's Amicus Brief, be produced by the
Commission. On 22 October 2018, Respondent withdrew its request.

On 1 November 2018, Claimants filed their Comments on the European Commission’s Amicus
Brief, along with legal authorities CL-134 through CL-140. On the same date, Respondent
submitted its comments on the European Commission’s Amicus Brief, together with legal
authorities RL-262 through RL-275.

On 21 November 2018, Respondent sought leave to file a copy of the German Federal Court
of Justice’s decision in the Achmea Case following the judgement of the CJEU in this case
and, on 23 November 2018, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to provide their comments on
same. After Claimants did on 27 November 2018, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's
request on 14 December 2018.

By letter of 21 December 2018, Claimants requested that the Tribunal issue “its decision in
this arbitration without delay, with its reason to follow thereafter when the Award is issued.”

On 24 December 2018, Respondent submitted preliminary comments on Claimants’ request

of 21 December 2018 and requested an extension until 4 January 2019 to comment on the
request, which was granted by the Tribunal on 2 January 2019.

On 4 January 2019, Respondent filed its supplemented response to Claimants’ request
of 21 December 2019.

By email of 8 January 2019, Claimants requested the opportunity to provide a brief reply to
Respondent's letter of 4 January 2019. That same day, the Tribunal granted Claimants’
request and, on 11 January 2019, Claimants submitted said reply.

By email of 14 January 2019, Respondent requested leave to comment on Claimants’ reply of
11 January 2019. On 15 January 2019, the Tribunal granted Respondent's request and invited
Respondent to file a brief comment solely on the issue whether Claimants may request that
the Tribunal “issue its decision in this arbitration without further delay, with its reasons to follow
in its Award” by 18 January 2019.

By letter of 17 January 2019, Respondent (i) informed the Tribunal that “the Representatives
of the Governments of Estonia and the Netherlands [had] signed a declaration of the majority
of the Member States of the European Union dated 15 January 2019 [...] on the legal
consequences of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union [...] in the
proceedings Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV [...] and on investment protection in the European
Union [(the “EU Majority Declaration’)]”; and (ii) sought leave to file a copy of the Declaration
along with an explanation of its importance and implications for this arbitration.

By letter of 18 January 2019, Respondent filed its comments on Claimants’ request
of 11 January 2019 regarding the issuance of the Award.

By letter of 29 January 2019, the Tribunal through its Secretary informed the Parties that it
rejected Claimants’ request of 21 December 2018, “noting Respondent's 18 January 2019
statement that the Estonian Competition Authority (ECA) is prepared to extend the time limit
for ASTV to file its submissions in the regulatory proceedings in question so as to allow the
Tribunal to issue its final award.”

By letter of the same date, Respondent informed the Tribunal as follows:

Estonia is no longer in a position to guarantee that an extension is
granted if ASTV re-applies for one. Thus, Estonia withdr[ew] the
penultimate paragraph of its letter of 18 January 2019 to the Tribunal
and respectfully request{ed] that the Tribunal reject Claimants’
application on the other grounds explained in Estonia’s
communications of 24 December 2018, 4 January 2019 and 18
January 2019.

Estonia further explained in its letter that it was planning and that it planned to inform the
Tribunal of the ECA's decision on that day.

By letter of 30 January 2019, the Tribunal (i) asked Claimants to file by 1 February 2019 any
observations that they wished to make with regard to the Respondent's request to file the EU
Majority Declaration; and (ii) invited both Parties

to inform the Tribunal whether, if the Tribunal were minded to allow the

Declaration to be admitted in the record (after receiving the Claimants’
observations), they would agree to dispense with the submission of

observations on the Declaration itself, taking into consideration that the
document is both clear and speaks for itself, and that the question of
the legal consequences of the Achmea Judgement and its impact on
this arbitration and final award have been, as noted by the
Respondent, “extensively argued in [the parties’] prior submissions.”

By letter of the same date, Claimants informed the Tribunal that they did not wish to pursue
their request of 21 December 2018 at that time. Claimants, however, reserved the right “to
revive their Request in future.”

By letter of 31 January 2019, Claimants agreed to Respondent filing a copy of the EU Majority
Declaration and to dispense with the submission of observations on the EU Majority
Declaration provided that Estonia also agreed to this proposal.

By letter of the same date, Claimants informed the Tribunal that the ECA “ha[d] granted
ASTV's extension request, thereby extend[ing] the deadline for ASTV to respond in the
ongoing regulatory proceedings with the ECA to 1 April 2019.”

By letter of 31 January 2019, the Tribunal, through its Secretary, confirmed receipt of
Claimants’ letter of 30 January 2019 and noted that Claimants did not at that stage pursue
their request of 21 December 2018.

By letter of 1 February 2019, Respondent maintained its 17 January 2019 request that “the
Parties be permitted to submit short comments on the EU Majority Declaration and its
significance for the Tribunal’s decision on Estonia’s intra-EU objection.”

On 2 February 2019, the Tribunal granted Respondent's request of 17 January 2019 and
invited the Parties to submit their observations on the Declaration by 8 February 2019.

On 8 February 2019, Respondent filed a copy of the EU Majority Declaration (RL-276), along
with its comments thereon. That same day, Claimants submitted their comments on the EU
Majority Declaration, together with exhibits C-433 through C-435.

On 11 February 2019, Claimants filed their observations on Respondent's comments
of 8 February 2019, stating that “Estonia used the opportunity of its comment to also make
submissions on matters going beyond the Majority Declaration.” Claimants further indicated
that it did not seek leave to file the authorities referred to in its letter or to comment on them
unless the Tribunal so desired.

By email of 15 February 2019, the Tribunal through its Secretary informed the Parties that it
had taken note of the points made and the matters referred to in Claimants’ letter of
11 February 2019.

By letter of 4 March 2019, Claimants requested that the Tribunal provide an update as to
whether it expected to render its award by the end of March 2019.

By letter of 15 March 2019, the Tribunal through its Secretary informed the Parties that it would
render its award by 3 May 2019.

By letter of 30 April 2019, the Tribunal, through its Secretary, further informed the Parties that
due to unexpected scheduling conflicts among Tribunal members, the Tribunal’s award could
not be fully finalized and circulated to the parties until June. By letter of 30 May 2019, the
Parties were advised that the Award would be rendered by Friday 21 June 2019.

By letter of 8 May 2019, Respondent sought leave to file a copy of Opinion No. 1/17 of the
CJEU, along with an explanation of its importance for this arbitration and its implications for
the Tribunal's decision in this matter. By letter of 10 May 2019, Claimants submitted comments
on the Respondent's request and asked the Tribunal to reject it.

By letter of 15 May 2019, the Tribunal, through its Secretary, informed the Parties of its
decision to reject the request, there being no compelling reason to enter into the record what
Respondent referred to as “further” reasoning and comments of the CJEU on matters that
have already been extensively briefed by the parties.

The proceeding was closed on 20 June 2019.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A) THE CREATION OF ASTV AND ITS OPERATION PRIOR TO THE PRIVATISATION

Tallinn Waterworks and Sewerage Management, the predecessor of ASTV, was formed in
1967 in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. Further to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
management of local water supply and sewerage was assigned by the Estonian Government
(the “Central Government’) to various municipalities. '® Tallinn Waterworks and Sewerage
Management was transferred to the City of Tallinn in 1992 and was reorganised as the Tallinn
Waterworks and Sewerage Municipal Enterprise.

In 1994, the Tallinn Waterworks and Sewerage Municipal Enterprise entered into a twinning
agreement with the Helsinki Water and Sewage Works for the improvement of the quality of
its services. This project was financed by a loan of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (the “EBRD”) of 44.44 million Deutsche Marks (the “1994 EBRD Loan’).'° The
Estonian State intervened in this loan agreement as a guarantor of the Tallinn Waterworks and
Sewerage Municipal Enterprise (the “State Guarantee”).

In 1997, ASTV was incorporated as a public limited company entirely owned by the City of
Tallinn and all assets, contractual rights and obligations of the Tallinn Waterworks and
Sewerage Management were transferred to ASTV.2°

ASTV (and its predecessor) and the EBRD communicated several times during the period
1995-1998 regarding the level of water tariffs, the possibility of waiving certain financial
covenants of the 1994 EBRD Loan as well as ASTV’s financing plan and investment

programme.?' In September 1998, the EBRD communicated to the Ministry of Finance of
Estonia its Semi-Annual Monitoring Report of ASTV, including financial statements and
financial projections, and brought to the attention of the Ministry certain breaches and other
financial issues.?* In October 1998, the EBRD also copied the Ministry of Finance on its
correspondence with ASTV regarding the latter's investment plan.?°

127. The 1994 EBRD Loan contained a covenant that the water tariffs from 1 March 1995 would be
maintained by ASTV at levels at least equal (in real terms) to 1.3 times those applicable
on 1 March 1994. As later became clear in the Information Memorandum associated with
ASTV's privatisation, ASTV appears to have been in breach of the covenant since 1998, which
was the last time during the pre-privatisation period that it increased its tariffs.24

128. In February 1999, the Estonia Parliament enacted the Public Water Supply and Sewerage Act,
which entered into force on 22 March 1999 (the “1999 PWSSA’). The 1999 PWSSA set out a
national legislative framework regulating the public water supply and sewerage.”>

129. Pursuant to the 1999 PWSSA, so-called “water undertakings” were to be appointed by decision
of local government councils. The supervision of water tariffs remained at the municipal level.
In this latter respect, s. 14(3) of the 1999 PWSSA laid out the following criteria for the
determination of water tariffs:

(3) The price of the service specified in subsection 1 of this section
shall be established such that the water undertaking can:

1) cover production costs;

2) comply with quality and safety requirements;

3) comply with environmental protection requirements;
4) operate with justified profitability.

130. On 26 July 1999, the City of Tallinn adopted a decision to decrease ASTV’s water tariffs as of
1 October 1999.76 Various exchanges ensued between the EBRD, the City of Tallinn and the

Ministry of Finance, and the matter was discussed by the Government of Estonia on 31 August
1999.2” On 24 November 1999, the City of Tallinn revoked its decision.?°

131. On 22 December 1999, the Tallinn City Council adopted Resolution No. 47, regulating water
supply and sewerage services. The regulation reiterated the pricing provisions of s. 14(3) of
the 1999 PWSSA and delegated to the City government the authority to establish the
procedure for determining water tariffs.°

B) THE PRIVATISATION OF ASTV
1) The Privatisation Process Established by the City of Tallinn

132. On6 July 1999, the Tallinn City Council adopted a decision to sell 18 million shares of ASTV
to private investors.°° The EBRD demonstrated an interest in this privatisation and offered its
collaboration, expertise and support.°"

133. The City of Tallinn established a committee to manage the privatisation process (the
“Privatisation Committee”) and retained various industry, legal and financial advisors to
assist, including SevernTrent Water International (“SevernTrent”), the law firm Allen & Overy,
and Suprema Securities AS (“Suprema”).

134. On 20 April 2000, the Privatisation Committee approved an explanatory memorandum that
had been prepared by Suprema, setting out the objectives and general parameters of ASTV's
privatisation (the “Explanatory Memorandum’).°2

135. The objectives of the privatisation were stated as follows:

* To increase the quality of water and sewerage services and increase the
availability of the service, incl. to cover the whole City with the public sewerage
system, and to secure the quality of drinking water complying with the
requirements of the European Union by the end of 2011 at the latest.

+ To finance large investments by raising private capital,

140.

* To use the know-how and management experience of the private sector to
increase the efficiency of Tallinna Vesi,

* To develop a stable and transparent tariff regulation,
+ To regulate water management instead of company management.*?

In aid of these objectives, the Explanatory Memorandum provided that, under the terms of the
privatisation, the chosen investor would acquire 50.4% of ASTV’s common shareholding,
comprised of 28 million existing shares and by subscribing to 30 million newly created shares.

The Explanatory Memorandum envisaged an investment horizon of at least 15-20 years and
underscored that investors could expect certainty with respect to the control of management,
the ability to make decisions according to parameters previously agreed on, the ability to
decide the tariff distribution, as well as clear and stable tariff regulation.5*

Regarding the determination of water tariffs, Suprema noted that (i) water tariffs are directly
related to both the level of services and the needed investment, and (ii) tariffs must allow the
investor to achieve justified profitability. It advised adopting a formula based on a price index
and pre-established coefficients designed to reflect the operating expenses and investment
needs of ASTV.%5

With respect to ASTV's corporate structure, the Explanatory Memorandum indicated that
ASTV’s Supervisory Council, the organ ultimately responsible for ASTV’s management, would
be constituted by a majority of the investor's representatives and that the investor would
determine the composition of ASTV’s Management Board, the body entrusted with the daily
management of ASTV (and whose activities are supervised by the Supervisory Council). The
City of Tallinn was to be issued a preferred share, the B-share or so-called “golden share,”
which entailed veto rights on certain important decisions by the Supervisory Council and the
General Meeting of ASTV’s shareholders, the highest governing body of ASTV. The City of
Tallinn would also retain the right to revoke ASTV's license.°°

On 26 June 2000, the City of Tallinn issued a notice for sale of a 50.4% stake in ASTV (the
“Tender Notice”)®’ and, on 3 July 2000, the City of Tallinn circulated an information

memorandum (the “Information Memorandum’),®° which was based on the Explanatory
Memorandum.

The Information Memorandum provided background information on the prevailing regulatory
framework, including the criteria for setting water tariffs under the 1999 PWSSA, but contained
a waiver of liability in that respect and encouraged bidders to conduct their own legal due
diligence.°9

The City of Tallinn set out a two-stage selection process. Prospective investors had first to
meet pre-qualification criteria, including international experience in the management of water
and wastewater systems, to be considered as qualified bidders (the “Qualified Bidders”).“°
Draft transaction documents and other relevant documents would be made available to the
Qualified Bidders which would be invited to conduct their due diligence and to comment on the
draft transaction documents.*'

The Information Memorandum explained that, as a result of the transaction, the investor would
hold 50.4% of ASTV’s ordinary shares (A-shares). The investor would gain management
control over ASTV via majority shareholding in the Supervisory Council and the right to appoint
the members of ASTV’s Management Board. The City of Tallinn would hold the balance of
ASTV's A-shares, in addition to the B-share. The investor and the City would be required to
enter into a shareholders’ agreement.

The Information Memorandum also detailed the level of services that ASTV would be required
to achieve over the first five (5) years of operation after the privatisation (/.e. from 2000 to
2005) and laid out tentative levels of services for the 2006-2010 period.**

Regarding the determination of water tariffs, the Information Memorandum indicated that the
regulatory framework remained to be defined and that the proposals being discussed assumed
that the Tallinn City Government would act as the regulator for the years 2001-2005. It also
explained that tariffs would have to comply with the 1999 PWSSA.** The Information
Memorandum stated that water tariffs would be determined on a yearly basis according to the
following formula:

AT =CPI+K
Where

e AT = annual change in tariff;

¢ CPI = change in Consumer Price Index (the CPI being published in the monthly
bulletin of Estonian Statistics six months before the new tariff increases are to
be applied); and

eK = a Coefficient to reflect potential productivity and efficiency gains and an
increase in tariffs to finance the provision of the agreed level of service to
customers.

The tariff determination method set out in the Information Memorandum distinguished between
tariffs for the first five (5) years (2001-2005) and those for the years 2006 to 2015, inclusively.

Concerning the years 2001 to 2005, the tariffs were to be determined as a result of the bid
process. The Information Memorandum specified that the bid was to contain a business plan
sufficiently detailed “to enable the tariffs to be determined in respect of the investment required
and the levels of service to be achieved.”*5

Concerning the 2006 to 2015 period, a price review was to take place in the fifth year of
operation (2005) to determine the value of the K-coefficients for the subsequent five (5) years.
ASTV would be required to submit a business plan for that period “to enable the Regulator to
fulfil his duties." “Regulator” was defined as an entity related to the City of Tallinn.*”

The Information Memorandum stated that the bids would be evaluated according to two (2)
criteria: (i) the price of the A-shares to be sold and issued to the investor, and (ii) the K-
coefficients of the yearly changes in the price of water and wastewater for the first five (5) year
period (i.e. from 2001 to 2005). The first factor was attributed a 40% weight and the second
one, a 60% weight. The bidders were not required to bid on the K-coefficients for the years
after 2005.

The bidders were further required to include in their bid: 1) “a detailed business plan of [ASTV],
including investment schedule and sources of financing necessary to meet the levels of
service” and 2) a “description of sources of financing of the purchase and subscription price.”

The Information Memorandum disclosed that the 1994 EBRD Loan to ASTV was backed by
the State Guarantee and that this loan would be refinanced upon privatisation and the State
Guarantee terminated.*°

2) The “Derogation” concerning the Term of ASTV’s License, and the 2000
EBRD Loan

On 5 May 2000, prior to the issuance of the Tender Notice and of the Information
Memorandum, the City of Tallinn had applied to the Ministry of Finance for a “derogation” to
the applicable regulation setting the maximum term of licenses to operate water undertakings.
Whereas the applicable regulation provided for a recommended term of five (5) years, the City
of Tallinn requested to be allowed to establish a twenty-year term for ASTV’s license.°°

On 20 June 2000, after having sought and obtained advice from the ECA,°! the Ministry of
Finance recommended to the City of Tallinn to apply for a right to grant a license for fifteen
(15) years.5* On 1 August 2000, the Prime Minister and other members of the Estonian
Government signed an order allowing the City of Tallinn to grant a fifteen-year license to
ASTV.%9

On 31 October 2000, in preparation for ASTV’s privatisation, ASTV and the EBRD agreed on
a credit facility of EUR 22.5 million (the “2000 EBRD Loan’)™, structured as follows:
EUR 15.5 million were to replace the 1994 EBRD Loan and EUR 7 million were to replace an
existing syndicate loan from various banks. The State Guarantee was to be released upon the
drawing of the 2000 EBRD Loan. This loan was never drawn and was replaced by another
financing facility in 2002.55

3) UUTBV’s Participation in the Tender Process
a) Creation of UUTBV

UUTBV was created on 11 July 2000 for the purpose of bidding on ASTV’s privatisation.
UUTBV was at the time a 50%-50% joint venture between United Utilities International Limited
(‘United Utilities’) and International Water (Holdings) BV (“International Water”), which itself
was a joint venture between Bechtel and Edison.®°

b) Discussions between UUTBV and the City of Tallinn prior to UUTBV’s Bid

After having pre-qualified as a Qualified Bidder,5” UUTBV sought clarifications and exchanged
with the City of Tallinn and its advisors on several issues, three (3) of which have particular
bearing on the current dispute: the definition of “justified profitability,” the status of the business
plan to be enclosed with the bids, and the matter of contro! over ASTV.

(i) Pre-Bid Discussion regarding Justified Profitability

On 16 October 2000, UUTBV put to Suprema that the reference to “justified profitability”in the
1999 PWSSA “needs to be clearly defined.”*® Approximately one (1) month later, UUTBV
stressed that the tariff mechanism ought to be predictable so as to ensure a level of certainty
of the investor's revenues. UUTBV further suggested that the privatisation agreements define
the method for determining water tariffs beyond 2005.

In a meeting on 17 November 2000 (the “November 2000 Meeting”), UUTBV and the City of
Tallinn’s advisers discussed the issue of justified profitability. The City’s advisors expressed
their unwillingness to “consider any definition of ‘Justified Profitability’ that specified a number
(or range of numbers) or made explicit reference to the Investor's Business Plan,” stressing
that they did not want to create a “fixed income instrument.”® It was agreed that UUTBV would
propose a method for determining justified profitability,®" which UUTBV did on 18 November
2000:

We propose that the following principles should be used as the basis
for the establishment of “Justified Profitability” when tariff levels are
determined.

+ Target Rate of Return will be set by an independent financial advisor,

159. On 23 November 2000, the Privatisation Committee resolved to include the following
methodology in the privatisation contracts to better define “justified profitability”:

As of the fifth year, the tariff coefficients are determined for an advance
period of five years by way of negotiations between the city and the
company on the basis of the company’s tender. The tender also
includes the investor's understanding of JP [justified profitability]. If the
city considers the offered JP [justified profitability] to be unjustified and
the parties fail to reach a consensus, the size of JP [justified
profitability] shall be determined by an independent international expert
who shall analyse JPs [justified profitability] of five comparable
companies and shall additionally take into account:

e the generally accepted business practices of water companies
¢ the economic situation of Estonia and Tallinn
¢ the vision presented in the business plan[.]®
(ii) The Pre-Bid Discussion regarding the Status of the Business Plan

160. At the November 2000 Meeting, UUTBV and the City of Tallinn advisors also addressed the
status of the business plan to be included in the bid. Whereas the City of Tallinn’s advisors
were divided on this issue, UUTBV informed them that the approval of the business plan before
the closing of the transaction was “essential.”®4

161. A few days after, on 21 November 2000, Suprema transmitted to UUTBV a memorandum
summarising the changes to be incorporated into the privatisation agreements. In response to
UUTBV’s request to obtain approval of the business plan prior closing, the memorandum
stated, under the heading “Action taken”:

Shareholders undertake to carry out the business plan as attached to
the SHA [the Shareholders’ Agreement], provided it does not violate
other Clauses in the SHA [the Shareholders’ Agreement] and the AoA
[Articles of Association].

162. On 23 November 2000, the Privatisation Committee resolved to not consider the business
plans to be submitted with the bids in the evaluation of the tenders. The Committee also

resolved that such business plans would only become binding on the Parties upon approval
by ASTV’s Supervisory Committee.®

(iii) The Pre-Bid Discussion regarding control over ASTV

Throughout its exchanges with the advisors of the City of Tallinn, UUTBV raised concerns
regarding control of the privatised ASTV. These issues were addressed in various
amendments to the draft privatisation agreements, with the exception of UUTBV’s request to
modify the veto rights of the City of Tallinn.®”

4) Appointment of ASTV as Tallinn’s Exclusive Water Supplier and Operator of
Sewerage Facility

On 23 November 2000, the Council of the City of Tallinn adopted Decree No. 396 appointing
ASTV as the exclusive water supplier and operator of sewerage activity in the main public
water supply and sewerage activity area of Tallinn for a period of fifteen (15) years.

5) UUTBV’s Bid

On 1 December 2000, UUTBV submitted a bid to the City of Tallinn. Only one (1) other
Qualified Bidder, Compagnie Locale d’Investissement et de Gestion 4 S.A. (“CLIG 4’),
submitted a bid.®°

a) Share Price
UUTBV bid for the purchase of 30 million new shares to be issued by ASTV for a price of
687,000,000 Kroons (equivalent to approximately EUR 44 million) and the purchase of 28
million shares from the City of Tallinn for a price of 641,200,000 Kroons (equivalent to
approximately EUR 41 million). As a result, UUTBV offered to invest a sum of 1,328,200,000
Kroons (EUR 84,871,908).7°

b) K-coefficients (Tariffs)

UUTBV's bid provided for the following K-coefficients for the years 2001-2005:

As required by the Information Memorandum, UUTBV included a business plan for ASTV
covering the period 2001-2005 (the “2001 Business Plan’), which was also intended to be
used as a basis for the drafting of future ASTV’s business plans:

This Business Plan covers in detail the period 2001-2005 inclusive,
and provides the commercial, financial, operational and technical basis
upon which the period from 2006 onwards will be defined. This
Business Plan will therefore be used as the basis for the drafting of
future Company Business Plans.”!

The 2001 Business Plan included financial projections for the entire term of ASTV’s license
(the “Financial Model”), comprised of a “cash flow statement” laying out the projected
distributions to ASTV’s shareholders over the fifteen-year period.”

The 2001 Business Plan also set out a methodology for the determination of water tariffs for
the years after 2005, including how the City of Tallinn or other “Regulator” would assess
justifiable profitability. According to the 2001 Business Plan, justifiable profitability would be
determined by reference to five (5) international proxy companies.”*

On 5 December 2000, the City of Tallinn Privatisation Committee adopted a resolution
declaring UUTBV's bid to be “the best offer.””4

The 2001 Business Plan gave rise to various exchanges between Suprema and UUTBV over
the following weeks.’® After UUTBV had provided the requested particulars, the Tallinn City
Government passed a resolution on 21 December 2000 that also declared UUTBV’s bid to be
the best submitted. The resolution specified that, should UUTBV fail to execute a purchase
and sale contract within one (1) month, the second best bidder would acquire a right to
conclude such a contract under the “terms and conditions listed in point 2 above.” These terms
and conditions consisted of the purchase price and K-coefficients included in UUTBV’s bid.’°

C) THE ENTRY OF UUTBV INTO ASTV AND THE SIGNATURE OF THE PRIVATISATION
AGREEMENTS

Between 12 and 22 January 2001, the following agreements were entered into:
* The Share Sale and Subscription Agreement;
° The Services Agreement;
« The Shareholders’ Agreement.
1) The Share Sale and Subscription Agreement

On 12 January 2001, the City of Tallinn, UUTBV and ASTV entered into a Share Sale and
Subscription Agreement (the “Share Sale and Subscription Agreement’).””

UUTBV subscribed to 30 million newly issued ordinary shares in ASTV (for a price of about
EUR 44 million) and purchased from the City of Tallinn 28 million ordinary shares (for a price
of about EUR 41 million).” As a result, UUTBV acquired of 50.4% of ASTV’s ordinary
shareholding. The City of Tallinn owned from thereon the balance of the ordinary shareholding,
as well as the B-share.

2) The Services Agreement

On the same date, ASTV and the City of Tallinn executed the Services Agreement setting out
the terms according to which ASTV was to supply water and sewerage services to the region
of Tallinn (the “Services Agreement’).”°

a) The Body of the Services Agreement
The Services Agreement defined ASTV’s mandate as the:

[...] exclusive rights and obligations acquired and assumed by the
Company under this Agreement and under the Resolution of Tallinn
City Council Number 396 dated 30 November, 2000 including, without
limitation, the obligation of the Company to perform the Services and
the right to charge the Tariffs pursuant to the Statutory Requirements
and this Agreement and the appointment of the Company as the
provider of the Services pursuant to the PWSSA [...].°°

The Services Agreement further stipulated that the Mandate Period was to start from the
fulfilment of certain conditions precedent to the transaction and to expire fifteen (15) years

77 C-49, Closing Memorandum of the Share Sale and Subscription Agreement for the 58,000,000 Shares

after the adoption of Resolution No. 396 granting ASTV’s license, or at the termination of the
agreement.®!

179. The Services Agreement detailed the levels of services (“Service Levels”) as well as the
capital investment requirements (“Investment Requirements’) to be fulfilled by ASTV. These
capital investments included works for the extension of Tallinn’s water infrastructure network.

180. The Services Agreement defined the Regulator as “the independent water utilities regulator
appointed pursuant to the regulatory framework referred to in Clause 5(3),”®* which provision
concerned the setting up of the Mandate Monitoring Unit (the “MMU”). The MMU was to be
created shortly after the privatisation to monitor ASTV's compliance with the Service Levels
and to assume an advisory role in the determination of the tariffs.8° The City undertook that
the City of Tallinn, the Regulator or an “other person responsible for setting the Rates” would
determine the water tariffs in accordance with Clause 7 of the agreement with the support of
MMU.*4

181. Clause 7(1)(a) provided that water tariffs were to be determined in accordance with the
provisions of the agreement and “Statutory Requirements,” which were defined as including
changes in the applicable law. Further, tariffs ought to reflect the stated Tariff Criteria (Part |
of Schedule E, discussed below) as well as the K-coefficient and a price index:

The Rates of Tariffs shall be determined in accordance with the Tariff
Criteria and to the extent consistent with the Tariff Criteria shall reflect:

(i) the K coefficient as provided in paragraph (c); and

(ii) any changes in the Retail Prices Index referred to in Clause 12(3)
as provided in the Tariff Criteria.®

182. As did the Information Memorandum, the Services Agreement distinguished between the first
five (5) years of the fifteen-year license period (i.e. 2001-2005), referred to as the first five (5)
“Operating Years” or the “Initial Period,” and the subsequent ten (10) years (i.e. 2006-2015).
The K-coefficients for the years 2001-2005 were those included in UUTBV's bid, as provided
in Part Il of Schedule E to the Services Agreement. The K-coefficients for the subsequent
years were to be determined according to the process set out in Part | of Schedule E, in
accordance with the following criteria at Clauses 7(4) and 8:

81 C-22, Services Agreement (including schedules) (12 January 2001
12 January 2001

(4) (a) The City undertakes that:

(i) the City, the Regulator or other person responsible for
setting the Rates of the Tariffs in accordance with the Statutory
Requirements (the ‘Tariff Authority’); and

(ii) the Mandate Monitoring Unit in making recommendations in
relation to the Rates of the Tariffs,

shall determine or recommend (as applicable) the Rates of Tariffs
in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 7.

(b) The Rates of Tariffs shall be determined in accordance with the
Tariff Criteria and to the extent consistent with the Tariff Criteria shall
reflect:

(i) the K coefficient as provided in paragraph (c); and

(ii) any changes in the Retail Prices Index referred to in Clause
12(3) as provided in the Tariff Criteria.

It is acknowledged that operation of the Tariff Criteria may result in it
not being possible to increase the Rates to reflect fully increases which
would otherwise be required pursuant to Clause 16 (Variations) or
Clause 17 (Changes in Law). In this event the Company shall not under
this Agreement, to the extent that the Rates have not been increased,
be obliged to carry out the Capital Works or make the changes to the
Services as required by the operation of Clauses 16 and 17, and shall
not be required to comply with the additional requirements comprised
in the Change of Law, and to such extent any failure to comply with
such obligations shall be deemed to be due to a Force Majeure Event.
This relief of liability shall not affect the operation of the Statutory
Requirements but the City shall take all action within its powers to
procure that the Company is relieved of its liability under the Statutory
Requirements in the same manner as it is relieved of liability under this
Agreement.

(c) (i) In respect of the period during the First Operating Year from
18 April 2020[] to 31st December, 2001 and the four Operating
Years commencing 1st January, 2002, 1%' January, 2003, 1°
January, 2004 and 1st January, 2005, the City shall, undertake
in determining the Rates of Tariffs in accordance with the Tariff
Criteria, to use the K coefficient for the relevant Operating Year
as set out in Schedule E Part Il.

(ii)The K coefficient for the Operating Periods following the
Initial Period shall be determined in accordance with the criteria

set out in Clauses 7(4)(a) and (b) and the provisions of Clause
8.85

86 C-22, Services Agreement (including schedules) (12 January 2001), Clause 7(4)(a), (b) and (c).

Clause 8 provided for a project review to be conducted at each five-year block of the license
period, each being defined as an “Operating Period.” Concerning the second and third
Operating Periods (i.e. after the first five (5) year of the license period), the MMU was to review
ASTV's performance for the current Operating Period and the programme for the next one:

Within six months prior to the end of each period of five Operating

Years the first such period being the Initial Period (each an ‘Operating

Period’), the City and the Company or, following the establishment of

the Mandate Monitoring Unit, the Mandate Monitoring Unit shall review

the performance of the Company during the current Operating Period

and the programme for the next Operating Period (the ‘Project

Review’) in accordance with the procedure set out in Clause 9 (Review

Procedure). The Project Review shall cover the following matters: [...]

(b) in relation to the period of the next Operating Period (being the
period of the next five Operating Years):

(i) measures to be taken to comply with the Requirements
applicable to the period;

(ii) the matters listed in paragraphs (a)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi); and
(iii) the K-coefficient.
b) Schedule E of the Services Agreement

Schedule E of the Services Agreement provided for a process for determining the Rate of
Tariff, for both the Initial Period and the two (2) subsequent Operating Periods.

Part | of Schedule E of the Services Agreement, entitled “Rate of Tariff Criteria,” laid out the
procedure for determining the tariffs for the two (2) last Operating Periods (i.e., 2006-2010 and
2011-2015) by first providing that tariff shall be set in accordance with the 1999 PWSSA and
the following formula:

T1=TO* (1+ ATHI + K)

Where

T1 — Rate of Tariff for the next period

TO — Rate of Tariff for the current period

A THI- Change in CPI (per cent)

)

The accounting period for the change shall be 12 months to the end of
a quarter, which ends less than 6 months prior to the fixing of the new
Rate of Tariff by the City.®”

Second, the Parties were to negotiate and agree on the applicable K-coefficients, which were
to reflect “the change in necessary expenses to be made by the Company to achieve the set
Service Levels, and justified profitability, but [...] not include the changes in costs that are
included in the change of CPI.”®° The Services Agreement provided that K-coefficients were
to be presented for five (5) years in advance and that ASTV had to submit a proposal in that
respect, including “a detailed business plan for the period to be regulated.”®°

Schedule E also particularised the “criteria of justified profitability” by stating that it would be
determined by reference to five (5) suitable market comparable and by taking into account the
following:

(i) generally accepted commercial principles for water and wastewater
utilities

(ii) the specific economic situation in Tallinn and Estonia and

(iii) the Business Plan.%°

3) The Shareholders’ Agreement

Also on 12 January 2001, UUTBV, the City of the Tallinn and ASTV executed a shareholders’
agreement (the “Shareholders’ Agreement’).°'

The 2001 Business Plan, as submitted by UUTBV in its bid, was appended to the
Shareholders’ Agreement and, at s. 5.5.8, the Parties undertook to “make reasonable efforts
to ensure the fulfilment of the Business Plan.”

The Shareholders’ Agreement also provided that UUTBV would appoint four (4) of the
seven (7) members of the Supervisory Council,°° and it was agreed that the votes of UUTBV’s
appointees would be sufficient for the election and/or removal of all the members of the
Management Board.%*

4) The Closing of the Share Sale and Subscription Agreement

On 22 January 2001, International Water issued a performance guarantee in favour of the City
of Tallinn for the fulfilment of UUTBV’s obligations under the Share Sale and Subscription
Agreement.

All conditions precedent having been met, the transaction contemplated by the Share Sale
and Subscription Agreement was closed on 24 January 2001 and a closing memorandum was
executed by the City of Tallinn, ASTV and UUTBV (the “Closing Memorandum’). The Closing
Memorandum recorded the payment of the share price by UUTBV and the signature of the
Subscription Agreement. It also recorded the execution of the Letter of Understanding, which
set out UUTBV and the City of Tallinn’s common understanding of the status and interpretation
of the 2001 Business Plan.

D) THE FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION AFTER ASTV’S PRIVATISATION

On 29 March 2001, as contemplated in the 2001 Business Plan, UUTBV and ASTV concluded
a technical services agreement for the provision by UUTBV of certain management services
to ASTV in return for a management fee (the “Technical Services Agreement’).%°

Later in 2001, it was resolved at ASTV’s General Meeting to pay out dividends in the total
amount of EUR 11.6 million from (i) ASTV’s annual profits of EUR 1.5 million and (ii) ASTV’s
investment reserve.°’ UUTBV received an amount of EUR 5.9 million in such dividends.

Further to a proposal by UUTBV, it was also resolved at an extraordinary General Meeting of
ASTV to reduce the share capital of ASTV by 80%, from EUR 71.3 million to
EUR 12.8 million. As a result, UUTBV received EUR 30.6 million. Such restructuring had
also been envisioned in the 2001 Business Plan, although at a later stage of the first five (5)
years of the privatisation.°

E) THE 2002 AMENDMENT TO THE SERVICES AGREEMENT

In April 2002, the City of Tallinn informed ASTV that it wished to enter into negotiations with
respect to a number of issues, the most notable being the determination of tariffs. The City of
Tallinn expressed concerns regarding the increase of tariffs planned for 2005 to 2010 in the
light of the rising cost of living in Estonia and the negative impact that an increase could have
on ASTV’s business and customers. '°

The negotiations spanned the following six (6) months. The issues identified by the City of
Tallinn were discussed for the first time on 23 April 2002 at ASTV’s Supervisory Council. In its
reply of 25 April 2010,'' ASTV put to the City of Tallinn that a review of levels of tariffs would
require as a corollary a review of the investments program, and of the Service Levels, and that
it would be necessary to ensure the respect of the financial conditions on which the original
investment was made. '

On 30 September 2002, the City of Tallinn, ASTV and UUTBV concluded an amendment to
the Services Agreement (the “2002 Amendment’). '%

Schedule |: Part V of the 2002 Amendment revised the K-coefficients for the 2003-2005 years,
as determined through the bidding process, and introduced K-coefficients for the years 2006-
2010:104

Pursuant to the new Financial Model attached to the 2002 Amendment, the tariffs for the period
beyond 2010 (2011-2015) were assumed to be only based on the CPI as the K-coefficients
were set to zero (0).1°

The 2002 Amendment also laid out the functions and responsibilities to be assumed by the
MMU at its Schedule |, Part Ill, as foreshadowed in the Services Agreement. '°°

Finally, the 2002 Amendment addressed the reimbursement of costs incurred for the
expansion for ASTV’s network. 107

respect the financial conditions upon which the original investment of 85 million euro was based.”

F) THE 2002 EBRD Loan

203. The 2000 EBRD Loan, which had been executed for purposes of the privatisation, as
mentioned above at paragraph 154, was never drawn. Rather, ASTV entered into a new loan
agreement of EUR 80 million with the EBRD (the “2002 EBRD Loan’), '°° which replaced the
2000 EBRD Loan.

204. The purpose of the 2002 EBRD Loan was to finance the water supply and sewerage network
extension programme (referred by the stakeholders as the Network Extension Programme or
the “NEP”) and other investments required under the Services Agreement, to refinance the
1994 EBRD Loan, to finance the costs of the 2000 EBRD Loan as well as to restructure ASTV’s
balance sheet through share capital reduction.

205. Two (2) securities were granted in favour of the EBRD. First, UUTBV pledged its shares in
ASTV to the EBRD.1°° Second, UUTBY, its shareholders, ASTV and the EBRD entered into a
Share Retention and Subordination Agreement pursuant to which ASTV pledged all of its
material assets, present and future.11°

206. The 2002 EBRD Loan resulted in the release of the State Guarantee.'""

Two (2) amendments to the Services Agreement were executed by ASTV, the City of Tallinn
and UUTBV in connection with the IPO. The first concerned certain changes in the structure
of ASTV (the “First 2005 Amendment’),''® whereby the signatories recorded among other
things their intention to maintain the status quo as to the balance of rights between the City of
Tallinn and UUTBV and the maintenance of UUTBV's full operational control of ASTV. The
second concerned a review of the Network Extension Programme (the “Second 2005
Amendment’), which would have become necessary due to the insufficiency of the City of
Tallinn’s financing."'”

) 2005-2008: REFORMS PROPOSALS FOR THE WATER TARIFF REGULATION UNDER THE
1999 PWSSA

In 2005, various Estonian authorities began discussing reforms to the water tariff regulatory
framework. Three (3) reform proposals have been referred to in the course of these
proceedings:

« The reform proposal of the Ministry of Environment;

* The reform proposal of the State Audit Office;

¢ The reform proposal of the Chancellor of Justice, Mr Allar J6ks.
1) Reform Proposal of the Ministry of Environment

In 2006, the Ministry of Environment became concerned that the tariffs charged by various
water undertakings in Estonia did not cover all of the relevant costs. More specifically, there
was a concern that many localities had failed to implement appropriate tariffs and that the
water undertakings were not abiding by the tariff increases forecasted in applications for
European Union aid. The Ministry of Environment concluded that these failures had a negative
impact on the country’s infrastructure and that it was necessary to transfer the authority over
water pricing to an independent State agency. The Ministry of Environment proposed an
amendment to the 1999 PWSSA accordingly. "8

2) Reform Proposal of the State Audit Office

In 2005, the State Audit Office, an independent government agency responsible for financial
supervision and auditing of the Estonian public sector, commenced an audit of the wastewater
development projects supported by the European Union. For the purposes of this investigation,
the State Audit Office commissioned an expert assessment of three (3) EU-funded projects,
which was completed in 2006.''9 In its report published in 2007, the State Audit Office
concluded that the level of water tariffs failed to cover all costs and did not ensure sustainable

management. Amongst other, it recommended that authority over water tariffs, water supply
and sewerage service be transferred to an entity forming part of the Ministry of Environment. '7°

214. Following its investigation, the State of Audit Office recommended to the Minister of
Environment to initiate the process for amending the 1999 PWSSA in order to transfer the
authority for setting water tariffs, which it had already undertaken. !21

3) Reform Proposal of the Chancellor of Justice

215. Concurrently with the foregoing initiatives, Mr Allar J6ks, the Chancellor of Justice, an
independent official mandated to review the conformity of Estonian legislation with the national
constitution, '?? expressed criticism regarding the water tariffs system in 2005 and 2006.

216. The Chancellor's concerns were directed at what he considered to be an abuse of dominance
by the water utility companies.'?° In 2007, the Chancellor of Justice suggested the
establishment of an independent body to supervise the determination of water tariffs.°4

4) October-November 2007: the Government Cabinet Supports the Ministry of
Environment's Reform Proposal

217. On 4 October 2007, the Ministry of Environment submitted a memorandum and draft decision
to the cabinet of the Central Government concerning the financing of water infrastructure
projects funded by the European Union. Among the Ministry's recommendations was a
proposal to amend the legislative framework so as to transfer authority for the determination
of water prices from local, city and rural governments to a competent existing national
authority. 125

218. On 9 October 2007, the Ministry of Environment convened municipal representatives,
including from the City of Tallinn, to a public information session on its ongoing work
concerning the funding of water infrastructure projects. Proposed amendments to the 1999
PWSSA were then introduced. "6

219. On 22 November 2007, the cabinet of the Central Government approved the Ministry of
Environment's proposal to amend the legislative framework applying to the water and
sewerage services. '27

5) June 2008: the First Draft Amendment to the 1999 PWSSA by the Ministry of
Environment

220. The Ministry of Environment finalised its draft amendments to the 1999 PWSSA in June
2008.'?6 The amendments provided that:

¢ Only the governments of the local municipality would have authority to determine the
water tariffs (as opposed to both municipal governments and local councils under the 1999
PWSSA). The local councils would however retain the power to set out the procedure for
determining water tariffs;'7° and

* Two (2) State agencies at the national level would be entrusted with the control of the
level of the water tariffs: the ECA and the Environmental Inspectorate.'°° Where tariffs
would be found to be non-compliant, these authorities would be authorised to issue
binding orders to increase or lower tariffs in order to bring them to an appropriate level.
Should a local municipality fail to abide by such order within six (6) months, the ECA could
directly enforce it:

If the price of the service specified in subsection (1) of this section is
not fair and does not correspond to the expenses of the water
undertaking specified in subsection (3) of this section, the Competition
Authority and the Environmental Inspectorate shall have the right to
issue a precept to the local government for the establishment of a new
service price.

[...] If the local government has not established a price complying with
requirements within 6 months after receiving a precept specified in
subsection (32), the Competition Authority shall have the right to
establish with an order a new service price complying with subsection
14 (3), which shall be made public at least ninety days before the price
is applied, publishing a notice concerning the change of the price in at
least one local or county newspaper twice with an interval of two
weeks. 131

J) THE 2007 AMENDMENT TO THE SERVICES AGREEMENT

221. On30 November 2007, the City of Tallinn, UUTBV, and ASTV concluded a fourth amendment
to the Services Agreement (the “2007 Amendment’).'*? A 2007-2020 business plan was
appended. 53

222. By way of this new amendment, the mandate period of ASTV was extended until 30 November
2020 (even though ASTV’s current license expired in 2015).'% It was also agreed to re-profile
the K-coefficients negotiated in the 2002 Amendment as follows:

K) THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT’S DRAFT AMENDMENT TO THE 1999 PWSSA

225. On 12 January 2009, the Minister of Environment presented its proposed amendment to the
Environment Committee of the Estonian Parliament and further held presentations in that
respect with other Estonian officials and authorities, including the ECA.'°” Two (2) days later,
the draft amendment was presented to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications,
which at the time had jurisdiction over the ECA.1%°

226. On 20 October 2009, the most recent version of the Ministry of Environment's draft amendment
to the 1999 PWSSA was made publicly available on the website of the Central Government.
A copy of the draft amendment was also communicated to various stakeholders, including the
Estonia Homeowners’ Association (the “EOKL’),'*° a not-for-profit organisation that receives
funding from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications and that advocates for
Estonian landowners.

227. In contrast to the first draft amendment prepared by the Ministry of Environment, this
amendment assigned the regulatory authority over water tariffs in large city areas to the
ECA.14°

L) THE STATEMENTS BY THE EOKL IN 2009

228. Throughout 2009,'41 the EOKL issued various public statements concerning the level of
Estonian water tariffs. In a January 2009 press release, EOKL called for a reduction of ASTV’s

by the local government, in turn to the Competition Authority for approval before setting the prices for water
services.”

141 It is to be noted that the EOKL had already issued a press release concerning ASTV's water tariff on
1 August 2008, R-238, Article by the EOKL “The mechanism of price increase in the City of Tallinn is

of 2009. 143

229. At the time, two (2) members of the EOKL’s management board, Mr Ken-Marti Vaher and
Mr Urmas Reinsalu, were members of the Estonian Parliament affiliated with the Ismaa-Res
Publica coalition (the “IRL”), the party then in control of Parliament.‘

M) END OF 2008 AND 2009: THE ECA’s INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF ASTV’S TARIFF

230. On 5 December 2008, the ECA issued a decree launching an investigation of the water and
sewerage service market. 145

231. For the purposes of its investigation, the ECA sought information from fifty (50) municipalities,
including the City of Tallinn'#° which provided the requested information on 12 January
2009.147

232. In the context of its investigation, in February 2009, the ECA also requested detailed
information from water utility companies, including ASTV, regarding their profits and
accounting practices. '48

233. Representatives of the ECA and of ASTV met on 3 March 2009.'4° On 25 March 2009, ASTV
complied with ECA’s request, noting at the same time that the information it provided was

confidential and commercially sensitive “inside information” within the meaning of the
Securities Market Act. 18°

On 3 April 2009, Mr Juhan Parts, the Minister for Economic Affairs and Communications,
publicly criticised ASTV’s level of profit and stated that the City of Tallinn had not been in a
position to resist the increase of water tariffs owing to the terms of the Services Agreement.
The Minister further announced that the tariff setting process was changing, referring to the
Ministry of Environment's works on amending the 1999 PWSSA. On the same day, Mr Ots,
director of the ECA, was reported to have stated that legislation supersedes contract but
acknowledged that the ECA could only intervene in cases of “extremely high profitability.”'5'

Representatives of ASTV and the ECA met during the fall 2009, in particular on 3 November
2009.52

On 30 November 2009, the ECA issued a report entitled “Analysis and Opinion on AS Tallinna
Vesi’ Price Formation” (the “Analysis”) by which the ECA primarily attempted to determine
“what would the prices applied by ASTV be in a situation, if the prices were controlled by an
independent regulator following the recognised price regulations principles.”*° The ECA
Analysis was said to be based on publicly available information.'** The ECA nonetheless
specified that the main conclusion of its preliminary analysis, which took into consideration
non-public information, did not differ from the Analysis. >

The ECA Analysis assessed ASTV’s price structure, as well as the notion of “justified
profitability.” For this purpose, the ECA relied on the return on invested assets methodology,
which the ECA elected to base on the net book value (the “NBV”) of ASTV’s assets.'5° The
ECA posited that ASTV’s allowed rate of return ought to correspond to its weighted average
cost of capital (the “WACC’”), which it calculated to be 8.31%. The ECA compared this figure
with ASTV's actual rate of return on invested assets, which it calculated to be of 16.9% for
2007 and 18.1% 2008. The ECA inferred from the difference between these “allowed” and
“actual” rates that the City of Tallinn had failed to fulfil its responsibility as the regulator of water
tariffs in Tallinn.157

The ECA further expressed concerns as to whether the water tariffs applied by ASTV were
cost-based and compliant with the relevant law and regulations. It noted that ASTV had failed

assets of ASTV in 2008 (18.1%) is considerably higher (18.1/8.31=2.18 times higher) than the company’s
weighted average capital cost that is taken as the basis in the formation of justified profitability, because

to provide the ECA with its calculations for water and wastewater services by price
components and that it had not found any evidence that the City of Tallinn had conducted any
detailed review of ASTV’s costs. '®

The ECA Analysis did not address either the terms of the Services Agreement, or, more
generally, ASTV’s privatisation and UUTBV’s investment. Rather, the ECA took the position
that its method of assessment of justifiable profitability was wholly incompatible with the
Services Agreement. 59

In transmitting its Analysis to ASTV, on 30 November 2009, the ECA recommended that ASTV
look to the Tallinn City Government “in order to bring the price of water supply and sewerage
services into compliance with the law.”'® The ECA informed ASTV that it intended to publish
the Analysis and issue a press release no later than 10:00 the following morning.'®' It also
invited ASTV to communicate its comments by 1 February 2010.

On 1 December 2009, Mr Ots, the ECA director, was reported to have stated that based on
the ECA Analysis, water tariffs in Tallinn could be decreased by 25%, and that he had publicly
recommended that ASTV submit a new tariff application to the City of Tallinn. 1

Further to the communication of the ECA Analysis, representatives of ASTV met with the ECA,
including on 4 January 2010.'® ASTV explained its disagreement with the ECA’s methodology
for determining “justified profitability,” which according to ASTV, failed to consider the
appropriate period, failed to take into account the privatisation value of the company, and
improperly disregarded the tariff-setting process adopted by the City of Tallinn.

On 1 February 2010, ASTV communicated to the ECA its position in writing regarding the ECA
Analysis. ASTV refused to submit a new tariff application to the City of Tallinn to reduce its
tariff on the ground that it would be in breach of both applicable legislation and the Services
Agreement. ASTV further submitted to the ECA that the 1999 PWSSA neither defines “justified
profitability” nor establishes any methodology for determining justified profitability.

Regarding the economic analysis performed by the ECA, ASTV submitted that it disregarded
appropriate international standards in three (3) respects:

e The length of the requlatory period: the ECA would have wrongly based its analysis on
data for only a two-year period, whereas data for a 3-5 year period would have been
required;

e The use of real or nominal returns: the ECA used nominal returns, without next taking
into consideration the inflation rate in Estonia during the relevant period;

e The regulatory asset value: the ECA wrongly referred to ASTV’s historic NBV without
making any allowance for the capital invested on privatisation. 1

ASTV closed its remarks by bringing to the ECA’s attention that Estonia is signatory to several
international treaties, including one (1) with UK, and that an “unbalanced approach to price
regulation” could lead to a breach of Estonia’s international obligations.

N) THE INVESTIGATION BY THE CHANCELLOR OF JUSTICE

In July 2009, concurrently with the ECA’s investigation, Mr Indrek Teder, the then-Chancellor
of Justice, launched an investigation on the legality of ASTV’s tariffs under the 1999 PWSSA
and the provisions of the Competition Act on abuse of dominant position.'©> Mr Teder seized
himself of the matter after the Harju County Governor received an application from the EOKL
to that effect. 1

On 28 August 2009, Mr Teder sent a request for information to the City of Tallinn.'® In its reply
dated 23 October 2009,'®* the City of Tallinn explained that ASTV’s water tariffs had been
established in the Services Agreement and reported that, in a decision dated 17 September
2009, '®° ASTV's privatisation was deemed “non-satisfactory and detrimental to the interest of
the City of Tallinn and its citizens.”17°

On 1 December 2009, the ECA transmitted the ECA Analysis to Mr Teder and invited him to
issue an opinion on same.'7' Mr Teder next made a request for information to the ECA, '” with
which the ECA complied on 23 February 2010.1 The ECA notably explained that the
determination of tariffs by way of agreement, such as the Services Agreement, could not

enjoining it to bring ASTV’s tariffs into compliance with the applicable law.'”® The Chancellor
of Justice stated that s. 14 PWSSA, and more specifically the phrases “cost-oriented” and
“justified profitability,” ought to be construed and applied according to general principles of
competition law.'7° He acknowledged that in respect of the water industry, this would require
modelling a competitive market. He concluded that, for the regulation adopted by a local
government to be compliant with the law, the local government ought to define the phrases
“cost-based” and “justified profitability” in a manner that lead to fair price by reference to prices
in a real competitive market situation.'’7 Relying on the ECA Analysis, he stated that the
application by the City of Tallinn of the phrases “cost-based” and “justified profitability”
breached the law and he requested that City Regulation No. 75 dated 30 September 2009
regarding water tariffs be modified accordingly.

The City of Tallinn refused to amend ASTV's water tariffs, claiming that the Chancellor of
Justice had exceeded his jurisdiction. Most notably, the City asserted that Regulation No. 75
was an administrative act (as opposed to a legislative act of general application), the legality
of which is not subject to review by the Chancellor of Justice. 178

The Chancellor of Justice applied to the Supreme Court of Estonia for an order enforcing his
recommendation. On 22 November 2010, the Court dismissed the application, holding that
Regulation No. 75 was an administrative act over which the Chancellor had no authority.17° In
a press release regarding its decision, the Supreme Court noted, however, that such
administrative act may be challenged before the Administrative Court.'® The Chancellor of
Justice closed his investigation but invited consumers to commence legal proceedings against
ASTV. The EOKL began assembling potential claims in that respect. 81

0) THE 2009 AMENDMENT TO THE SERVICES AGREEMENT

In September 2009, the City of Tallinn, ASTV and UUTBV entered into a final amendment to
the Services Agreement (the “2009 Amendment’).'® The Parties agreed to extend the
duration of the Network Extension Programme to 31 March 2012 and to modify the payments
to be made by the City of Tallinn in this respect.

P) THE ANTI-MONOPOLY BILL (AMB) AND THE ECA METHODOLOGY

In parallel with the ECA’s Investigation, '®* Mr Reinsalu and Mr Vaher, both members of the
IRL and EOKL,'* drafted a proposed Anti-Monopoly Bill (the “AMB”). The AMB addressed
issues pertaining to the heating and water tariffs from a consumer's perspective and sought,
amongst other, to amend the 1999 PWSSA."85

In June 2009, Mr Vaher and Mr Reinsalu discussed ASTV’s tariffs with the ECA. Mr Ots
informed them that ASTV’s actual profitability was 19.6%, whereas its justified profitability was
7-B%, 186

On 8 October 2009, Mr Vaher presented the AMB to the Estonian Union of Cooperative
Housing Association in the course of its annual forum.8”

The AMB was introduced in the Estonia Parliament on 15 October 2009, shortly before the
release of the ECA Analysis. The explanatory letter appended to the AMB (the “AMB Letter”)
stated that the objective of the AMB was to enhance consumers protection with regards to
water and heating tariffs:

The objective of this law is to amend the District Heating Act, Public
Water Supply and Sewerage Act, Competition Act and Penal Code in
such a manner as to ensure a higher protection of consumers in their
relations with companies providing universal services and in a
dominant position and in the price formation of their services.

This will be achieved through:
1) Fixed justified rates of return,

2) Undertakings obligation to initiate lowering prices if the input prices
or other production costs change,

3) The right of establishing temporary prices by the Competition
Authority,

4) Full control of the Competition Authority over the heat producers,

5) Control of the Competition Authority over 52 larger water
undertakings,

6) Stricter punishment for a significant violation of the requirements. '®°

258. The AMB Letter explicitly referred to ASTV — the only undertaking referred to by name in the
Letter — as an example of how the 1999 PWSSA had failed to properly protect consumers:

Poor protection of consumers’ rights and not following the competition
law has in more conspicuous cases led to a situation in which for
example the productivity of the assets invested of the leading water
undertaking of Tallinn is 19.6%. Taking as the basis the general
European practice regarding the justified rate of profit of the water
undertaking (7-8%), if the draft bill applies the price of water for the end
consumer of Tallinna Vesi alone should reduce by ca 24% next year.

Prices of these services influence significantly also consumer prices.
Based on the earlier statistics of the Ministry of Finance, a reduction in
the prices of Tallinna Vesi by ca 24% alone would bring about an
estimated reduction in CPI by ca 0.2%. 18°

259. The most salient amendments put forward by the AMB were the following:

* The ECA, in lieu of municipalities, was to supervise the setting of tariffs of water
undertakings servicing more than 2,000 people, which included ASTV. As a result, the
concerned undertakings could only charge tariffs previously approved by the ECA;19°

* The ECA would have jurisdiction to establish recommended principles for the calculation
of water tariffs (the “ECA Methodology’ or the “Methodology”);‘*'

« The water utilities company had to apply for new tariffs in cases of change of
circumstances (including regarding costs and expenses). 192

260. Under the AMB, water utilities companies were to apply the tariffs in force as at 31 October
2010 until the adoption of the ECA Methodology, and agreements entered into before 1

utility undertaking fail to make the necessary adjustments. 1%

261. The AMB was modified in two (2) significant respects prior to its adoption. First, the AMB
initially set a maximum limit to ‘justified profitability,” and this limit was removed.'® Second,
the phrase “justified profitability” was qualified by the addition of the words “of the capital
invested by the water undertaking.”'°° This modification was proposed by the ECA for the
purpose of clarifying that non-refundable aid would not be included in the assets base for
calculating justified profitability. 19”

262. On 5 March 2010, a second version of the AMB Letter (the “Second AMB Letter”) was
submitted for the first parliamentary reading of the AMB. At the plenary session of Parliament,
the draft AMB was merged with the draft amendment prepared by the Ministry of
Environment.19°

263. The AMB was enacted by the Estonian Parliament on 3 August 2010 and entered into force
on 1 November 2010.'99

Q) THE ECA METHODOLOGY
1) The Discussion regarding the Methodology

264. In May or June 2010, the ECA started developing the Methodology envisioned by the AMB.?0°
On 7 September 2010, the ECA circulated a draft Methodology to various stakeholders,
including ASTV and the City of Tallinn, and invited them to comment.?°1

265. ASTV and the City of Tallinn provided the ECA with their comments on 27 September 2010.70?
ASTV stressed the importance of considering the privatisation process of 2001 and
recommended using the approach adopted by Ofwat, the English and Welsh regulator of water

sector. The City of Tallinn, for its part, referred the ECA to the terms of the Services Agreement
and announced that it had commissioned an analysis by Oxera, an English consultancy firm.

Representatives of the ECA and ASTV met in October 2010. Their disagreement concerning
the relevance of the terms of the Services Agreement was evident.2o

ASTV also provided to the ECA an accounting analysis of the ECA Methodology by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (the “PWC Report”). PWC noted, inter alia, that the Methodology
did not consider income tax, that the ECA used a nominal WACC and that the Methodology
was based on the NBV of assets.?°>

The Estonian Water Companies Association (Eesti Vee-Ettevdtete Liit, “EVEL”) submitted two
(2) reports to the ECA, prepared by the accounting consultancy KPMG that raised similar
concerns.

On 25 October 2010, the ECA circulated a second draft of the Methodology.”°7 In its comments
on this new draft, the EVEL stated that the changes were only cosmetic.2°%

On 9 November 2010, the ECA adopted the Methodology further to the entry into force of the
AMB on 1 November 2010. The Methodology was published on the ECA’s website on
12 November 2010.79

On 15 November 2010, ASTV filed a complaint before the Chancellor of Justice for various
breaches of due process by the ECA in its consultation regarding the Methodology.?'° On
12 April 2011, the Chancellor issued a recommendation to the ECA in which he concluded that
the ECA had failed to properly explain the respective role of the participants in the consultation
process.2"1

On 8 December 2010, the ECA responded to the comments and opinions received regarding
the Methodology.?'? It stated that water undertakings were required by law to justify the
investments to be taken into consideration in the determination of tariffs and that guidelines
shall not discriminate the water undertakings based on either their ownership or size.

On 10 December 2010, ASTV submitted a complaint against Estonia to the European
Commission alleging that Estonia was violating the freedom of establishment and the freedom

of capital guaranteed by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”)
through the enactment of the AMB.?'?

2) The Methodology Adopted by the ECA
The ECA Methodology relies on two (2) principal notions: the value of the undertaking’s
regulatory asset base (the “RAB”), which is to be compared to a benchmark of justified
profitability;2'4 and the nominal WACC, which is used to define justified profitability.21

The Methodology defined the RAB as “the capital invested into the undertaking by the
undertaker”*"® and provided that it was to be determined according to the formula below:

RAB = RABr + WC,
Where
RAB - regulated asset base;
RAB r — residual book value of RAB in the end of a regulation period;
WC - working capital.?!7
The Methodology specified that physical assets were to be assessed according to their

NBV,?"8 and that the working capital of a water utility company should be set at 5% of the value
of the regulated assets.?'°

R) ASTV’s TARIFF APPLICATION TO THE ECA
1) ASTV’s 2011 Tariff Application

On 9 November 2010, the same day that the ECA adopted its Methodology, ASTV filed a tariff
application with the ECA (the “2011 Tariff Application”) by which ASTV sought approval of
the tariffs for the years of 2011 to 2015, inclusively.22°

In order to provide comfort as to ASTV’s level of profitability, ASTV enclosed a report by Oxera
on the estimated allowed revenues of ASTV.

The Oxera report adopted a “building block approach” aimed at capturing the main aspects of
the methodology applied by Ofwat. The report only considered ASTV’s revenues of 2010 and
2011 and assumed that the regulator would have considered ASTV's operating expenses
appropriate. Oxera concluded that, since the privatisation, ASTV had under-recovered, based
on a high level comparison of ASTV’s regulatory capital value, set at the price paid by UUTBV
at privatisation, and ASTV’s so-called vanilla WACC, which accounts for the pre-tax cost of
debt and post-tax cost of equity.2’ More specifically, Oxera assessed ASTV's allowed
revenues for 2010-2011 to EEK 764 million. Oxera acknowledged that the NBV method could
also be used to assess allowed revenues but stated that this method does not align with the
Ofwat principles:

For 2010-11, the allowed revenues are estimated to be EEK 764m. This result
is highly sensitive to a number of assumptions described in section 3, and in
particular the opening RCV [Regulatory Capital Value]. As described in the
earlier sections, the opening RCV relies on the assumption that the
replacement cost of ASTV’s assets was greater than the value inferred from
the price paid at the time of privatisation. An alternative could be to use the net
book value of assets at the time of privatisation, but this would be out of line
with the real Financial Capital Maintenance approach adopted by Ofwat.?22

On 17 November 2010, the ECA informed ASTV that the 2011 Tariff Application suffered from
deficiencies that prevented it being considered.?@° The ECA notably stated that it was not open
to ASTV to apply for a tariff increase for the period of 2011 to 2015 and that the 2011 Tariff
Application did not allow for a proper assessment of ASTV’s costs.2*4 The ECA closed by
enjoining ASTV to cure the listed deficiencies by 13 December 2010, to use the ECA’s
questionnaire developed for the purposes of tariffs application and to provide the financial data
for the previous three (3) financial years so as to allow for the assessment of the justifiability
of the costs and revenues to be included in the tariff submitted for approval.225

281. Representatives of ECA and ASTV met the following day. It appears that Mr Ots informed
ASTV that pursuant to the applicable law, a tariff application could not cover a five-year period
and that, although the fulfilling of ECA’s questionnaire was mandatory, the ECA Methodology
was merely a recommendation.?26

282. ASTV and the ECA continued to exchange correspondence over the following six (6)
months.?27

283. On 2 December 2010, ASTV resubmitted a further tariff application.2?® ASTV stated that the
2010 PWSSA did not prevent establishing tariffs over several years, namely for the 2011-2015
period.?2° ASTV also acknowledged not having followed the ECA Methodology but stated that
its application and the information provided to ECA were sufficiently detailed for the ECA to
discharge its supervisory role.2°°

284. On 15 January 2011, after additional exchanges, the ECA agreed to initiate a formal review of
ASTV's application.2°"

285. On 28 February 2011, the ECA informed ASTV of its intention to reject its tariff application and
offered ASTV the opportunity to respond by 15 March 2011. The ECA also notified ASTV that
it had initiated an investigation into ASTV’s existing tariffs.292

286. The ECA stated that ASTV’s tariffs may only be assessed by reference to the PWSSA, and
not the agreements between the company and the City of Tallinn.2°° The ECA excluded the
possibility that tariffs might be set for the period 2011 to 2015 because it would not be possible

to forecast costs over such a long period.?*4 The ECA also refused to consider the privatisation
value in the determination of ASTV’s RAB*°> and held that tariff increases could not be set
solely as a function of the CPI, but must be fact-based.?°° The ECA further informed ASTV
that justified profitability is to be assessed according to the “capital invested” and disagreed
with ASTV’s use of the “ordinary’ WACC, as opposed to nominal WACC. Finally, the ECA
requested that ASTV comply with its guidelines published in January 2011.27

287. On 29 March 2011, ASTV communicated to the ECA an updated application, in which it
restated that the determination of its tariffs ought to consider the privatisation agreements as
well as the privatisation value.?5°

2) The ECA’s Rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application, and the ECA Prescription

288. On 2 May 2011, the ECA dismissed the 2011 Tariff Application on the ground that the tariff
increases sought by ASTV did not comply with the 2010 PWSSA.”°9

234 R-173, Letter from the ECA to ASTV (28 February 2011), p 45 of the pdf: “The KA has the opinion that
the approval of the water service price for the period of 2011 to 2015 with a prescribed specific annual price
increase does not comply with the UVVKS because the UVVKS prescribes neither the approval of the price
for a certain period nor an annual price increase. The expenses prescribed by UVVKS § 14 (2) as the basis
for calculating the water service price are dynamic in time, due to both the undertaking’s activities and
factors beyond the undertaking’s control (for example, the pollution charge rates or the water resource
charge rates). An undertaking cannot forecast its expenses so clearly in long term, the more so that some
of the changes related to expenses may stem from law amendments. An undertaking cannot foresee the
long-term changes in the economy that may affect the water service price, particularly concerning the
expenses, the rates of which depend on the legislators will (the pollution charge rates or the water resource
charge rates). Due to that and pursuant to UVVKS § 142 (6), a water undertaking is required to monitor the
circumstances which are independent of its activities and affect the price of water services and is required
to notify the Competition Authority of any circumstance that may affect the price of water services by more
than 5 per cent no later than thirty days as of the occurrence thereof. Therefore, the approval of the water
service price for a longer period, in this case for the years 2011-2015, and the prescribing of a specific
increase of the water service price by the water undertaking are excluded for objective reasons.”

235 R-173, Letter from the ECA to ASTV (28 February 2011), p 57 of the pdf: “ASTV’s approach where the
value of regulated assets is derived from the undertaking’s value agreed between two parties cannot be
considered justified. If following ASTV's principle, the aforementioned transaction would cause an increase
of the water service price for consumers because the value of regulated assets increases. Yet, no
improvements were made in ASTV’s public water supply and sewerage system (no new investments were
made), only the owner changed. Pursuant to UVVKS § 14 (2), a change in the water service price can take
place only on the basis of expenses made for the public water supply and sewerage system. Thus there is
no basis for changing the water service price only for the reason that the owner changes, i.e. it is not
compliant with the law to base the calculation of the water service price on the amount paid upon privatising
ASTV.”

289. In its rejection letter, the ECA valued ASTV’s RAB at EUR 135.116 million, as compared with
the EUR 353 million value calculated by ASTV.”4° According to the ECA, the RAB was to be
calculated by determining the NBV and could not be derived from a contract or from
privatisation value. The ECA also raised the following issues:

e Even if the privatisation value method were adopted, ASTV’s RAB calculation was
inflated by EUR 44 million by not accounting for the funds invested in 2001 to reduce its
debt;

e ASTV’s application unduly adjusted the RAB annually by the change of CPI;
¢ The calculations of the WACC;

e ASTV's failure to comply with the requirement to progressively eliminate price
discrimination between private and commercial clients;

e ASTV's application of pollution charges, which it claimed were a result of ASTV’s breach
of environmental law;

e ASTV's operating costs included write-offs of receivables resulting from non-paying
customers.?41

290. On 26 June 2011, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communication addressed a letter to
ASTV's shareholders stating that (i) neither the Ministry nor the ECA had been involved in the
privatisation, and (ii) the statutory regime in force at the time of the privatisation only allowed
the setting of tariffs to the level necessary for ensuring a reasonable return on capital invested.
The Ministry also invited the shareholders to stop depicting Estonia as an unsafe country for
foreign direct investment and to bring their claim to a third party, should they believe that they
were the victims of some illegality.242

291. On 10 October 2011, the ECA concluded its investigation into ASTV’s tariffs. It issued an order,
Prescription No. 9.2-3/11/11-001 (the “ECA Prescription”), compelling ASTV to apply for
tariffs 29% lower than its 2010 tariffs.24°

Ss) THE ESTONIAN PROCEEDINGS

On 1 June 2011, ASTV challenged the rejection by the ECA of its 2011 Tariff Application before
the Tallinn Administrative Court (the “Main Estonian Case”), and sought the following
remedies:244

1) to annul the ECA's decision of 2 May 2011 rejecting the 2011 Tariff Application;

2) to declare that s. 14 (2)5) of the 2010 PWSSA is unconstitutional and that it does not
apply to ASTV in the context of these judicial proceedings;

3) to find that the ECA violated the Services Agreement in rejecting the 2011 Tariff
Application by way of its 2 May 2011 decision;

4) to compel the ECA to fulfil the Services Agreement;
5) to compel the ECA to review the 2011 Tariff Application.

On 10 October 2011, the day that the ECA Prescription was issued, ASTV also challenged the
legality of the ECA Prescription before the Tallinn Administrative Court. On 11 November 2011,
the Court granted a temporary interim injunction suspending the ECA Prescription.24° On
6 February 2012, the same court issued an interim injunction suspending the ECA Prescription
pending the outcome of the Main Estonian Case, and this proceeding was merged with the
Main Estonian Case.?4°

On 31 May 2012, the Tallinn District Court ruled in the Main Estonian Case that the provisions
of the Services Agreement regarding tariff setting constitute an administrative act under
Estonian law.?47

On 10 September 2012, ASTV filed a complaint with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
Communication claiming that the ECA and its general director, Mr Ots, discriminated against
ASTV in its tariff review as compared to its review of tariffs of Kunda Elamu (“Kunda’), a
heating company in the city of Kunda:#48 whereas the ECA refused to consider the privatisation
value in ASTV's application, it factored in the investment made in connection with Kunda’s
privatisation. ASTV also alleged that Mr Ots had a personal interest in Kunda.”4° ASTV's claim
was dismissed on 18 December 2012. The Ministry found no conflict of interest and explained

that Kunda was privatised through an asset purchase, which warrants a different treatment
than a share-purchase transaction such as ASTV's privatisation.25°

296. In 2013,251 2014752 and 2015, ASTV made further applications for water tariffs to the ECA.
The ECA refused to review those applications, and ASTV sought the annulment of the
decisions pertaining to the 2013 and 2014 tariffs before the Tallinn Administrative Court. ASTV
further filed a claim for compensation for the damages incurred or to be incurred as a result of
the rejection of ASTV’s applications, in the amount of EUR 10.8 million for damages already
incurred, and EUR 80.8 million for future damages.?5?

297. On5 June 2015, the Tallinn Court of Administration dismissed all of ASTV’s claims in the Main
Estonian Case *°4 and released its reasons on 12 October 2015.55 The Court found that:

e ASTV had not raised the issue of whether the ECA was bound by the Services Agreement
during the application process, and the ECA did not have to consider the obligations
arising out of the Services Agreement;?5°

e The Services Agreement had not been transferred to the ECA, and the ECA was not party
to said contract. Accordingly, the ECA had no obligation towards ASTV under the Services
Agreement;?5”

¢ The Tallinn City Council had failed to set a proper method to determine tariffs because
the 22 December 1999 Regulation No. 47 merely repeated the 1999 PWSSA wording and
the Tallinn City Government did not have the authority to adopt the formula set out in the
Services Agreement as the method for setting tariffs;25°

p 3710: “When approving the maximum price for a company that has purchased the necessary assets for
producing heat or providing water services, the value of the assets on the balance sheet of the company
that bought the assets as stated before shall be proceeded from. Usually for the buyer of assets, the
purchase cost of the assets is equal to the book value of the assets (which must not get confused with the
so-called historic, earlier book value of assets). In case of such transactions as the CA has explained the
reasonableness of asset value is checked based on ratios in the similar manner with other price
components (ratio of asset value to the volume of sid heat, comparison with different companies).”

« ASTV had failed to demonstrate that the price formula of the Services Agreement was

298. The Court refrained from making any finding on the ECA’s allegations that the Services
Agreement was unlawful and null.26?

299. On 11 November 2015, ASTV lodged an appeal of this decision, which was dismissed by the
Tallinn Circuit Court on 26 January 2017.76

300. The Tallinn Circuit Court found that:

° The tariff part of the Services Agreement constituted a regulation of specific application
directed at a particular undertaking and was governed by the provisions on public law
contract;?64

« ASTV and the City of Tallinn could only have had for legitimate expectation a level of
justifiable profitability protected by law and there was no evidence that calculating justified
profitability by using the capital invested did not ensure ASTV’s justified profitability;2°°

« There was no ground to establish the nullity of the tariff part of the Services Agreement,
as suggested by the ECA, the Services Agreement could be performed until the entry into
force of the AMB;765

« Further to the entry into force of the AMB, the justified profitability could no longer be
calculated by reference to the privatisation value since the phrase “justified profitability”
had been qualified with the phrase “of the capital invested by the undertaking”;?6”

« The ECA was not bound by the terms of the Services Agreement and ASTV could no
longer demand performance of the Services Agreement after the amendment of the

PWSSA seeks to protect;76°

« The ECA had implicitly terminated the Services Agreement by virtue of its rejection of the
2011 Tariff Application and the Services Agreement could not be enforced because it
contradicted the terms of the Methodology;

* The Estonian legislator had granted the ECA the discretion to set the recommended
principles for the calculation of water tariffs. As such, it was not open to interfere with the
ECA's choice of methodology and the Methodology could not violate specific rights if it
provides for cost-based tariff and allows justified profitability;2”°

« ASTV had been provided with the opportunity to express its opinion in the elaboration of
the Methodology and the ECA did not have to account for the Services Agreement in that
respect;2”!

© To accept the 2011 Tariff Application would have required deviating from the Methodology

ASTV appealed from the District of Tallinn Court's decision?”? and, as mentioned above, the
Supreme Court of Estonia issued its decision on 12 December 2018.

The Supreme Court partly reversed the District of Tallinn Court's decision by only allowing
ASTV’s complaint with respect to clause 6 of the ECA Prescription, which conditions the
application of the order to the ECA's approval of ASTV’s novel application.2”4 The Supreme
Court's judgment leaves intact the remainder of the ECA Prescription.

The Supreme Court further found as follows:

The ECA did not legally succeed to the City of Tallinn since the 1999 PWSSA modified
the duties of the water tariffs regulator.?”® As of consequence, the ECA would have
terminated the Services Agreement.?”°

The 1999 PWSSA further rendered the compliance with the Services Agreement
impossible because the 1999 PWSSA introduced a change by forbidding reference to the
privatisation value for calculating justified profitability.2&°

The amendments to the 1999 PWSSA neither breached ASTV’s legitimate
expectations,?°! nor EU law.76?

The Methodology is an administrative regulation, for the purpose of which the ECA was
afforded a wide discretion. Since the tariff calculation it sets out constitutes one (1) of the
possible options, the Methodology is valid.?8%

The ECA rightfully rejected ASTV’s 2011 Tariff Application and issued the Prescription
due, inter alia, to the impossibility to calculate water tariffs based on the privatisation

value.?84

ASTV’s COMPLAINT BEFORE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

As mentioned above,” ASTV filed a complaint before the European Commission on
10 December 2010 on the grounds that, by enacting the AMB, Estonia breached the principles
of freedom of establishment (Art. 49 TFEU) and of free movement of capital (Art. 63 TFEU).

On 26 September 2011, the European Commission issued a pre-closure letter stating that the
AMB did not violate the principles of freedom of establishment or freedom of movement of

regime, the AMB did not affect the stability of regulatory regime and was not discriminatory,
ASTV’'s investors could not have had any legitimate expectation regarding the changeability
of the regulatory system since the Services Agreement had to comply with the PWSSA, and,
even if the Services Agreement was binding on the ECA, it could not take precedence over
the PWSSA as amended.

On 14 May 2014, the Commission issued a closure letter confirming its previous assessment
that the AMB was not contrary to EU law.?67

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
A) CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

It is Claimants’ principal case that Estonia has breached a number of Claimants’ legitimate
expectations arising out of the privatisation, and as such, has breached its obligation under
the BIT to afford them fair and equitable treatment (“FET”).7°° Claimants also claim that
Estonia's failure to afford them due process and the negative publicity campaign against them
in which Estonia engaged constitute further FET breaches. Claimants claim as well that
Estonia has breached its obligation under the BIT to not impair their investment by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures and has also breached the BIT’s umbrella clause. °°

According to Claimants, Estonia’s breaches prevented and prevent Claimants from recouping
their investment of EUR 85 million made at the time of ASTV’s privatisation in 2001.

1) The Breach of Claimants’ Legitimate Expectations Arising Out of the
Privatisation

According to Claimants, as of 2001, they had for legitimate expectations that the privatisation
agreements would be observed and that water tariffs for the years after 2005 would be set by
reference to the 2001 Business Plan or, alternatively, that these tariffs would be determined
by following the tariff methodology set out in the Services Agreement.?°°

These expectations arose in the course of and against the backdrop of ASTV’s privatisation,
including the negotiation, drafting process and terms of the privatisation agreements as well
as the involvement of the EBRD and the Estonia Central Government in the privatisation.

Claimants argue that the purpose of ASTV’s privatisation was to secure long-term investment,
which had become necessary due to the dire state of the water and sewerage system in
Tallinn, and that the City of Tallinn was seeking to bring in an experienced international

operator to remediate to the situation. The privatisation also had as its objective the release of
the State Guarantee, to the benefit of the Central Government of Estonia. Claimants also rely
on the structure of the bidding process: since bidders were required to bid on only two (2)
elements, the share price and the K-coefficients, and UUTBV’s bid linked these elements, it
was entirely legitimate for Claimants to expect that the proposed tariff increases would be
followed. Also material to Claimants’ case is what they assert was the express approval of the
2001 Business Plan by the City of Tallinn and the City’s recognition that UUTBV was investing
on this basis.29"

More specifically with regards to the tariffs for the years beyond 2005, Claimants state that the
Central Government of Estonia expressly granted an extended licence period on the
understanding that such extended period was required for UUTBV to earn a return on its
investment. Claimants rely also on the discussion and negotiations pertaining to “justified
profitability’ and the detailed provisions on same included in the 2001 Business Plan.?92

In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants particularise their legitimate expectations as of 2001 as
follows:

a. that the contracts entered into by the City of Tallinn with the
Government's knowledge on 12 January 2001, in reliance on which
UUTBV invested €85 million in ASTV, would be respected;

b. in the five year Initial Period, that ASTV’s tariffs would be set by
reference to the specific K factors bid by UUTBV and incorporated into
the Services Agreement;

c. that in setting the K factors for subsequent Operating Periods any
consideration of justified profitability would be by reference to the tariff
methodology in the Services Agreement and the Business Plan
submitted at the time of UUTBV’s bid, not on the basis of a clean slate
which took no account of the Services Agreement, the privatisation, or
the €85 million investment UUTBV made on the basis of them; and

d. the key principles of the regulatory framework applicable to ASTV,
as set out in the Services Agreement, would not be radically overturned
during its term. In spite of the absence of an express stabilisation
clause in the Services Agreement, the Claimants could legitimately
expect that the fundamental basis of the tariff methodology envisaged
in the Services Agreement would be maintained and would not be
unreasonably and arbitrarily undone during the term of that agreement.
This is so regardless of the existence of certain provisions in the
Services Agreement relating to future regulatory change.”°° [Footnotes

319.

These expectations were reinforced, if not strengthened, in the course of ASTV’s operations
over the 2001-2009 period.?°* Reference is made to the reconfirmation of the Services
Agreement's tariff methodology through its various amendments, the 2002 EBRD Loan and
the EBRD’s involvement in ASTV as an indirect investor from 2003 to 2010, and the delivery
by ASTV of the required improvement to the Service Levels. Claimants further stress that
ASTV achieved lower profitability in eight (8) years than it had been projected to achieve in
the first five (5) years.

Estonia breached these expectations by adopting the AMB, by the rejection by the ECA of the
2011 Tariff Application and, later, by ordering ASTV to lower its tariff by 29% pursuant to the
ECA Prescription. These breaches amount to a violation of FET.29°

2) The Other Alleged FET Breaches, and Unreasonable and Discriminatory
Measures

Claimants also assert that Estonia failed to afford them due process, and thus breached its
obligation to provide FET, and adopted unreasonable and discriminatory measures in
contravention to its international law obligations. The key elements of Estonia’s unfair
treatment would lie in:

a

the negative campaign against ASTV instigated by the EOKL;

b) the ECA’s market investigation in 2009, in the course of which the ECA allegedly did not
afford ASTV due process;

c

alleged flaws in the ECA Analysis;
d

the alleged targeting of ASTV in the adoption of the AMB.

With respect to the EOKL’s conduct, Claimants emphasise that the organisation focused on
ASTV's profitability as opposed to the affordability of its services.7°°

Concerning the ECA’s conduct, Claimants argue that the agency wrongly disregarded the
privatisation agreements and the privatisation as a whole in its analysis. The ECA also failed
to address the flaws in its approach identified by Claimants at the relevant times and by relying
on a flawed methodology.?°”

Claimants assert that the adoption of the AMB was specifically directed at ASTV, with the
intention of forcing it to lower its tariffs.2°° This is evidenced by the fact that the AMB was
sponsored by two (2) IRL members who were also members of the EOKL’s management
board, by the fact that the preliminary calculations of the ECA were used to justify the AMB,

and by the specific references to ASTV in the AMB’s preparatory works. Furthermore, the
modification of the term “justified profitability” was specifically directed at ASTV so as to
prevent any consideration of the capital invested in ASTV by its shareholders. The reliance by
the ECA on the modified wording of “justified profitability’ in rejecting the 2011 Tariff
Application also demonstrated that the Estonian authorities targeted ASTV by means of the
regulatory reform of water tariffs.29°

It is also Claimants’ case that the AMB as adopted and applied to ASTV did not in fact derive
from the concerns and reform proposals regarding the country’s water undertakings. Rather,

the proposals predating the AMB expressly concerned the problem of tariffs that were too low
to ensure the sustainability of water and sewerage services.°°

3) The Breach of the Umbrella Clause

In addition to the aforementioned breaches, Claimants allege that Estonia breached its
obligations under Article 3(4) of the BIT, an umbrella clause, by failing to observe:

a

The tariff methodology in the Services Agreement and the commitment in Clause 7 to
calculate tariffs in accordance with this methodology;

b) The contractual commitment in s. 5.5.8 of the Shareholders’ Agreement requiring the City
of Tallinn to make reasonable efforts to ensure the fulfilment of the 2001 Business Plan;

c) The commitment in the Letter of Understanding by which the City of Tallinn agreed to
make its best efforts to ensure the implementation of the 2001 Business Plan;

&

Article 4.1.2 of the 2007 Amendment to the Services Agreement, which required that the
process for determining the K factors as the basis for ASTV’s tariffs would not be
applicable until 1 July 2020; and

&

Article 6.2 of the 2007 Amendment which required the Parties to ensure that the
conclusion of the 2007 Amendment will not reduce the shareholder value of ASTV.2°"

4) The Claimants’ Prayer for Relief

As articulated in their Reply and updated in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants seek the
following remedies:

a) Adeclaration that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims brought by both ASTV and
UUTBV in these proceedings;

b) Adeclaration that Estonia has breached Article 3(1) of the BIT by failing to ensure fair and
equitable treatment to the Claimants’ investments;

of the BIT, would have been generated by ASTV;

An order requiring Estonia to pay interest on any sums it orders Estonia to pay pursuant

An order that Estonia pay all other costs incurred by the Claimants as a result of its

RESPONDENT'S POSITION

323. Respondent raises three (3) objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and further denies having
breached any of its international obligations.

1) Respondent’s Objections to Jurisdiction®®

324. First, Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks ratione personae jurisdiction over the
claims brought by ASTV, in that ASTV does not qualify as a Dutch national pursuant to the

302 Cl, Reply, 4608; Cl. PHB, 9576-581.

303 As further exposed below at paragraphs 339 and following, Claimants submit that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction over their claims insofar that (i) ASTV benefits from the protection of the BIT since UUTBV has
exercised a sufficient degree of control over ASTV during the relevant period, (ii) the Estonian proceedings
commenced by ASTV do not seek the same remedies than the current arbitration and, as such, does not

BIT and the ICSID Convention. More specifically, Estonia claims that UUTBV never exerted
sufficient control over the management, as opposed to the operations, of ASTV; alternatively,
any such control would vest, not in UUTBV, but in its parent company, a UK national.°*

325. Second, Respondent contests the Tribunal’s ratione voluntatis jurisdiction. It alleges that
Claimants are barred from bringing the current arbitral proceedings considering that ASTV
seeks equivalent remedies before the Estonian courts. A finding of jurisdiction over Claimants’
claims would thus violate Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, pursuant to which parties’
consent to submit a dispute to the Centre is deemed to be consent to the exclusion of any
other remedy.9°°

326. Third, Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because of the incompatibility of
the BIT with EU law.2°°

2) Respondent Denies Having Breached any of its International Obligations

a) Claimants cannot Claim any Legitimate Expectations regarding Water
Tariffs beyond 2005

327. According to Respondent, Claimants could not have had for legitimate expectations that
ASTV's water tariff would be set by reference to the 2001 Business Plan, as said plan was
intended only to set tariffs for the years of 2001-2005. Respondent particularly stresses that
the Services Agreement did not benefit from any insulation from regulatory changes: the terms
of the Services Agreement were subordinated to the applicable law, which was defined as
including any amendments to the existing regulatory regime, and envisioned the transfer of
authority over water tariffs to an entity other than the City of Tallinn. The 2001 Business Plan
also could not ground any legitimate expectation since bidders were informed that the business
plan included in the bid would not be evaluated in determining the winning bidder, and the
Services Agreement referred to a business plan as only one of three (3) factors to be weighed
in ascertaining justified profitability.°°7

328. Respondent further notes the distinction between the various privatisation agreements. It
underlines that only the City of Tallinn and ASTV, but not UUTBV, executed the Services
Agreement. Moreover, although the City executed the Services Agreement in its capacity as
the local government regulator of water tariffs, its intervention in the other agreements,
including the Shareholders’ Agreement to which was appended the 2001 Business Plan, was

preclude the Tribunal from ascertaining its jurisdiction and (iii) the arbitration agreement contained in the
BIT is not incompatible with EU law.

as a commercial party, and the terms of those agreements did not involve and could not
preclude the City from using its regulatory powers.2°8

Respondent also disputes the materiality of any involvement by the Central Government of
Estonia or the EBRD in ASTV’s privatisation.5°° The Central Government was not involved in
the tender process and did not review the terms of the privatisation, the objectives of which in
any case did not include the release of the State Guarantee given the good financial standing
of ASTV at time.

In any event, says Estonia, any of Claimants’ legitimate expectations arising from the
privatisation were undermined by subsequent events. These include the 2001 dividend
payment and capital restructuring, by which UUTBV largely recouped its investment, and the
fact that ASTV never made any application for tariffs relying on the Services Agreement's tariff
mechanism. In addition, Estonia emphasises that both the 2002 Amendment and the 2007
Amendment increased ASTV’s profitability. Respondent further contends that these
amendments were illegal under Estonian law.3'°

b) The AMB’s Regulatory Reform and the ECA’s Measures Do Not Violate
FET

Respondent submits that the amendments to the 1999 PWSSA introduced by the AMB and
the ECA's decisions that ensued were all bona fide regulatory measures.

The proposed reforms and the AMB were aimed at depoliticising the setting of water tariffs, a
nation-wide problem, notably by removing the larger cities’ authority over this matter and
transferring it to an independent State agency. Furthermore, the AMB did not modify, but
merely clarified, the existing tariff-setting rules.°"!

According to Respondent, the measures adopted by the ECA were in accordance with the
applicable law. The rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application and the adoption of the ECA
Prescription merely sought to reduce ASTV's monopolistic profits to a reasonable level.3"? It
explains that the ECA had discretion to specify a tariff mechanism in the Methodology and that
such Methodology accords with Estonian law and international best practices.5"° As for the
rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application, Respondent underscores that the application did not
make any explicit reference to the Services Agreement and that it was economically flawed.°'4

It is also Respondent's position that Claimants were afforded due process in their exchanges
with the ECA as the latter complied with the applicable law.°1®

c) Estonia’s Conduct did not Breach its International Obligations in any
other Manner

Respondent denies having instigated any negative media or other campaign against
Claimants, let alone one for which it could be held internationally liable.o'® According to
Estonia, not only can the EOKL’s conduct not be attributed to the Estonian State, but its
statements regarding ASTV's tariffs themselves reflected growing public criticism long before
the advent of the AMB.°"7

Finally, Respondent alleges that Claimants’ umbrella law clause claims must fail for four
reasons. First, the alleged contractual commitments of the City of Tallinn were subject to law
and regulatory action and were not binding on the ECA. Second, the 2007 Amendment was
unlawful to the extent that it is interpreted as fixing tariffs for a period of thirteen (13) years.
Third, the 2007 Amendment did not create international obligations for Estonia because the
City of Tallinn is distinct from the Estonian State. Fourth, the claim obviously fails with respect
to UUTBV insofar that it is not privy to the Services Agreement.*"8

JURISDICTION

As noted above at paragraphs 324-326, Respondent raises three (3) objections to the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal:

a) ASTVis not a Dutch national under the BIT and the ICSID Convention;
b) The Tribunal lacks ratione voluntatis jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims;
c) The BIT is incompatible with EU law.
Each of these objections is dismissed for the reasons set out below. Although these matters
were not contested, the Tribunal also finds that all other conditions for it to have jurisdiction
are met, including that the claims submitted to arbitration pertain to an investment and are
directed against a party to the ICSID Convention, and that UUTBV is a Dutch national.
A) THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL OVER ASTV’s CLAIMS
Respondent posits that ASTV fails to meet the nationality requirements under the BIT and the
ICSID Convention. ASTV (an Estonian entity) it says, is not actually controlled by UUTBV (a

Dutch national); and, in any event, UUTBV could not be a source of jurisdiction because it is
merely a shell company and is not the ultimate controller of ASTV.

340. After considering relevant texts (1), the Tribunal will identify the point(s) in time at which control
of UUTBV over ASTV must be established (2), decide whether UUTBV indeed controlled
ASTV (3) and then consider the impact of the fact that UUTBV is itself controlled by a non-
Dutch entity (4).

1) The Relevant Texts

341. It is undisputed that, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over ASTV’s claims, ASTV must fulfil
the jurisdiction requirements of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT.

342. Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention sets out the nationality prerequisites for the Centre’s
jurisdiction:

(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or
any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State
designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another
Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to
submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no
party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

(2) “National of another Contracting State” means:

Ll

(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State
other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the
parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration
and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting
State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign
control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of
another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.
[Emphasis added]

 

343. As for the BIT, the nationality requirement is addressed at Art. 1 and 9:
Article 1
For the purposes of the present Agreement: [...]

(b) the term “nationals” shall comprise with regard to either Contracting
Party:

Ll
iii. legal persons not constituted under the law of that Contracting Party
but controlled, directly or indirectly, by natural persons as defined in (i)
or by legal persons as defined in (ii) above.

Article 9

71

344.

345.

346.

347.

348.

(1) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit any legal dispute
arising between that Contracting Party and a national of the other
Contracting Party concerning an investment of that national in the
territory of the former Contracting Party to international conciliation or
arbitration. [...]

(4) A legal person which has the nationality of one Contracting Party
and which, before such a dispute arises, is controlled by nationals of
another Contracting Party. shall for the purpose of article 25 (2)(b) of
the Convention referred to in paragraph (3) above be treated as a
national of that Contracting Party. [Emphasis added]

 

The Parties agree that, as regards jurisdiction over a legal person incorporated under the laws
of the host State, Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention establishes a two-part test comprising a
subjective prong and an objective prong:

First, the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention must have agreed to treat certain juridical
persons as foreign nationals notwithstanding that these persons are nationals of the host State
of an investment (i.e. the subjective test arising out of the phrase “which ... the parties have
agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this
Convention”). Second, the party bringing a claim against a Contracting State must meet the
applicable nationality requirements (i.e. the objective test arising out of the phrase “because
of foreign contror’).3'9

 

It is common ground that Art. 9(4) of the BIT, whereby Respondent consented to the
jurisdiction of the Centre, combined with the submission by Claimants of their Request for
Arbitration on 13 October 2014 fulfil the subjective test for jurisdiction.22° The Parties further
agree that Claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that ASTV should be deemed to be a
foreign — i.e., Dutch — national by virtue of its control by UUTBV.321

2) The Time when Foreign Control Must Be Established
The Parties disagree as to the moment when control over ASTV must be established.

Respondent contends that, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over ASTV’s claims, UUTBV
must have controlled ASTV uninterruptedly from the beginning of the alleged violations of the
Treaty in 2009,°% to the filing of Claimants’ Request for Arbitration on 13 October 2014.
Respondent further states that Claimants must offer evidence that ASTV was under UUTBV's
control (i) before the dispute arose, (ii) at the time of each of the alleged breaches of Estonia’s

treaty obligations and (iii) at the date of the consent to arbitration (i.e. the date of the filing of
the Request for Arbitration).525

Claimants posit that the critical date for establishing control is the date of consent. They do not
specifically engage as to whether control must be established before this time. In their view,
this issue is academic because UUTBV's control over ASTV would not have materially
changed since the privatisation of ASTV.54

Construction of the relevant texts facilitates the resolution of this issue.

The ICSID Convention does not contain any specific requirement regarding the ratione
temporis jurisdiction of the Centre, except that the wording of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention
makes clear that control must exist at least at the time of consent to submit a dispute to
conciliation or arbitration.

For its part, the BIT specifies at Art. 9(4) that the relevant nationality must be established
“before such dispute arises,” without further precision.

A reading of the BIT nonetheless confirms that the benefits of the instrument, including its
dispute settlements provisions, are inextricably tied to the nationality of the purported protected
investor. Pursuant to Art. 2 of the BIT, the Contracting Parties undertake to foster and protect
investments of “nationals of the other Contracting Party” within their respective territory.
Similarly, the preamble states that the Treaty aims at intensifying the Contracting Parties’
relationships “with respect to investments by the nationals of one Contracting Party in the
territory of the other Contracting Party.” Art. 9(1) also refers to disputes pertaining to the
“investment of that national.”

Not requiring from a purported foreign investor to demonstrate that it meets the nationality
criterion at the time of the alleged breach of the Treaty would run afoul of the clear intent of
the BIT’s signatories, that is, to promote “investments by the nationals of one Contracting Party
in the territory of the other Contracting Party.” In other words, the phrase “before such dispute
arises” should be tied to the alleged breach of the investment protections afforded by the BIT.

Claimants must thus establish that ASTV was a Dutch national not only at the time of consent
to the October 2014 which is unchallenged, but also before the dispute arose, that is when the
alleged breaches of the BIT first occurred.

Claimants allege that ASTV became the target of a negative public relations campaign by
various Estonian stakeholders and authorities starting in 2009 and culminating in the adoption
of the AMB in 2011 and ultimately in the ECA’s rejection of ASTV’s 2011 Tariff Application in
May of that year.

It is Claimants’ case that Respondent failed to afford them due process and otherwise violated
the FET standard, in breach of the BIT, beginning in 2009, which as mentioned culminated in
the adoption of the AMB and subsequent rejection of ASTV's 2011 Tariff Application.225

Considering that the various alleged breaches are said to have begun in 2009, Claimants must
demonstrate that UUTBV had control over ASTV as of that time as well as on 13 October
2014.

3) UUTBV’s Control of ASTV

The Tribunal will first lay out the applicable legal standard (a) and the relevant facts (b). It will
then consider the relevance of the Estonian law evidence pertaining to control presented by
Respondent (c) before discussing its analysis and conclusions (d).

a) The Applicable Legal Standard
(i) Claimants’ Position

Claimants are of the view that the notion of control under both the ICSID Convention and the
BIT is broad: “control” was intentionally left undefined in the ICSID Convention, and the Treaty
does not prescribe its ambit. They further stress that the determination of control consists in a
factual inquiry to be made on the basis of all facts at hand.

According to Claimants, shareholding is not in and of itself dispositive of the issue of control;
other factors, such as voting and management rights, must also be taken into account.
Establishing control over an entity does not require demonstrating absolute control. Evidence
of a “dominant influence” suffices.°2°

Claimants challenge the relevance for the notion of control of EU and Estonia law and submit
that, in any event, ASTV meets the Estonian law test for control as elaborated by Respondent's
Estonia law expert (addressed at paragraphs 402-410 below).22”

(ii) Respondent's Position

Respondent criticises Claimants for failing to identify an objective standard for control and for
failing to identify a case where factors other than shareholding formed the basis of a tribunal's
assertion of jurisdiction over a domestic entity. In Respondent's contention, such other factors
may be relied on merely to rebut or bolster a presumption of control where a foreign party
holds a majority shareholding over the domestic entity.

368.

Respondent submits that control must be defined by reference to general principles of
company law°?6 and that, for this purpose, reference should be made to Estonian and EU
law.°29 Respondent relies on Mr Vallikivi’s expert evidence in this regard.

b) Meaning of Control in International Investment Law

The ICSID Convention does not specify the meaning of control. Nor does the BIT contain an
autonomous definition of control; its language mostly mirrors the ICSID Convention's. The BIT
does, however, specify that, when the putative foreign investor is incorporated under the law
of the host State, such control may be “direct or indirect.”59°

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that control is a flexible concept, which can only be
determined case by case in the light of the particular facts. This derives from the will of the
drafters of the ICSID Convention not to constrain the notion of “foreign control.”°5' This need
for flexibility arises from the complexity of ascertaining control over a juridical person. As noted
by Professor Schreuer, ICSID tribunals have adopted different approaches to determining
whether a party controls a national of the host State.°? By way of illustration, the tribunal in
Vacuum Salt v Ghana noted that Art. 25(2)(b) does not specify any particular percentage of
share ownership and concluded that each case “must be viewed in its own particular
context.”393

Attempting to circumscribe the meaning of control through the identification of essential
factors, or bright-line rules, thus appears unnecessary, if not inappropriate. Doing so could
prevent tribunals from fulfilling their duty to conduct a full factual and legal assessment of the
case at hand and could unduly curtail the scope of their jurisdiction and thus deprive parties of
the protections that the ICSID Convention and the relevant treaty intended would inure to their
benefit.

Bearing in mind that the determination of control is context-specific, it is nonetheless
appropriate to consider how international tribunals and scholars have approached the issue.
Various principles can be gleaned from the authorities submitted by the Parties.

A majority shareholding may give rise to a presumption of control, but such presumption may
be rebutted in the light of other circumstances.**4 Conversely, it was envisioned in the course
of the ICSID Convention's drafting that a minority holding of as little as 25% or 15% might
suffice to establish control if coupled with a capacity to block major changes.**> That being
said, not any substantial minority shareholding should be considered as “control.”*°° Reference
is also frequently made to other factors, including voting rights and contractual arrangements
such as shareholders’ agreements.°9”

The particular nature of the influence exerted by the foreign person over the domestic entity
may be considered in the assessment. For instance, Professor Schreuer suggests that “a joint
venture in which the foreign investor and local interests hold equal shares may be under
effective control of the foreign partner due to the latter's management_and_know-how”
[emphasis added].*°° On the other hand, in Vacuum Salt v Ghana, the tribunal stated that
control over purely technical matters by a foreign minority shareholder did not suffice to attract
jurisdiction under the relevant treaty. The reasons of the tribunal suggest that a “material
influence” would be necessary to ground control.*°°

Professor Schreuer thus explains that what might be called a “holistic” approach is to be
preferred:

On the basis of the Convention’s preparatory works as well as the
published cases, it is possible to conclude that the existence of foreign
control is a complex question requiring the examination of several
factors such as equity participation, voting rights and management. In
order to obtain a reliable picture, all these aspects must be looked at
in conjunction.24°

The paramount concern in conducting such an inquiry lies in ensuring that a domestic investor
does not improperly avail itself of the protections offered foreign investors by the ICSID
Convention and the relevant treaty.

As for joint control, the tribunal in Sempra v Argentina considered that joint control of a
domestic entity by several foreign investors constitutes foreign control, whereas joint control

by a foreign person and national of the host State is not foreign control and does not, as of
consequence, give rise to jurisdiction:5*1

51. The pertinent question is whether a foreign investor can add to its
own participation in a local company an additional percentage
belonging to another foreign investor so that their combined weight will
thereby achieve the necessary control. Of course, combination of the
participation of a foreign investor with that of a local investor should be
excluded, since in that case, although the combination could result in
control, this would not be foreign control.

374. Similarly, Professor Schreuer opines that joint control of a domestic entity by foreign
shareholders from different Contracting States to the ICSID Convention “should be admitted
in principle.” Where both foreign and host State nationals exercise a degree of control, he
suggests that in order to find “foreign” control, “[t]he combined control of nationals of
Contracting States other than the host State should, at least, outweigh the combined control
of nationals of non-Contracting States and of the host State.”542

c) The Relevant Facts regarding Control over ASTV

375. Respondent does not expressly deny that UUTBV enjoyed operational control over ASTV.%4?
The matter in its view turns rather on whether UUTBV held strategic control over UUTBV at
the relevant time and whether such control, if any, was joint with the City of Tallinn.

376. The Tribunal notes that Respondent argues that any alleged control by UUTBV over ASTV
prior to 2009 has no bearing on the issue because nationality must be assessed at the time of
the alleged violation.*4 The history of control over ASTV nonetheless provides relevant insight
on the role played by UUTBV in the operation and management of ASTV, and will be reviewed
below.

(i) Control over ASTV as discussed and negotiated during the privatisation
process

377. It appears unchallenged that the privatisation of ASTV had as one key objective to bring in an
international water and sewerage operator. This notably stems from the criteria set in the

341 RL-115, Sempra Energy International v the Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision
on Objections to Jurisdiction (11 May 2005), 951; see also RL-116, Camuzzi International S.A. v the
Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/03/2, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction (11 May 2005), 438.

Tender Notice, which disqualified any domestic Estonian investor insofar as any bidder ought,
at the date of its application, to:

a. [Exercise] management control in a company (or itself a company)
supplying water and sewerage services to at least 500,000 inhabitants.

b. [Exercise] _management_control_in water and/or wastewater
companies in at least four (4) different countries, whereas at least in
one of these companies the period of management control must have
minimum three (3) years.

c. [Have] had [an] annual average turnover from provision of water
services or from activities directly related to water services of at least
EEK 300,000,000 (three hundred million), or the equivalent amount
thereof in local currency over the last three (3) years.
[Emphasis added]

378. Further, review of the history of the negotiations shows that the issue of control over ASTV by
the foreign investor was material, indeed central, to the privatisation.

379. Under the proposed transaction, the City of Tallinn would detain the B-share and associated
veto rights over certain matters at the General Meeting (ASTV’s highest governing body).54°
On the other hand, the Information Memorandum also announced that the investor would gain
management control over ASTV via a majority on the Supervisory Council and the right to
appoint the Management Board of ASTV.°4”

380. In October 2000, and as mentioned at paragraph 163 above, UUTBV raised specific concerns
regarding the veto rights provided in the Articles of Association and in the draft Shareholders’
Agreement. UUTBV stressed the importance to it of enjoying and exercising control over
ASTV's affairs.°4* These concerns were addressed by amendments to the draft Shareholders’

Agreement, though the Articles of Association, including the rights attached to the B-share,
remained unchanged in these respects.°“9

(ii) Control over ASTV after the Privatisation

ASTV is managed through three (3) directing bodies: the General Meeting (i), the Supervisory
Council (ii), and the Management Board (iii).°°

¢ The General Meeting
The General Meeting, the highest governing body of ASTV,°*" has jurisdiction over the most
critical corporate matters, including approval of the company’s annual reports, the distribution
of profits and the appointment of the members of the Supervisory Council.252
The City holds the single B-share and, as a result, a veto right over certain matters decided at
the General Meeting, pursuant to both the Articles of Association and the Shareholders’
Agreement. The Articles of Association provide that the B-share grants to its holder a veto over
the following matters:
- The amendment of the Articles of Association of ASTV;
- The increase or decrease of the share capital of ASTV;
- The issuing of convertible bonds;
- The acquisition of treasury shares by ASTV;

- The decision on the merger, division, transformation and/or dissolution of ASTV;

- The issues pertaining to the operation of ASTV submitted to the General Meeting by either
the Management Board or the Supervisory Council.9°°

Pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, the City of Tallinn also holds a veto right regarding:

imposed by the Articles of Association, to be quite unacceptable and would be unable to bid on that basis.
We therefore urge you to ensure that the provisions for the City to veto Company management decisions
are set at an acceptable (i.e. substantially reduced) level, and that the Articles of Association are amended
accordingly.”

ASTV’'s share capital or issue of convertible bonds;

- The distribution of ASTV’s profits for the years of 2000, 2001 and 2002;

- Any transaction of a substantial nature or having a substantially similar effect to any of the
above or any agreement or proposal to do any of the above.°*

Yet, at the same time, the City of Tallinn undertook in the Shareholders’ Agreement not to
unreasonably withhold its consent regarding matters falling under the General Meeting’s
jurisdiction, provided that ASTV’s affairs are conducted in compliance with certain
standards.355

The evidence is that the City never sought to exercise the prerogatives attached to the
B-share. According to Mr Plenderleith, who acted as ASTV’s Chief Financial Officer from
October 2004 to August 2007,°5° and Mr Gallienne, who held various executive positions at
ASTV from 2002 to 2014,°5” the City always voted with UUTBV’s representatives. At best, they
say, the B-share would have allowed the City to prevent the passing of a resolution. Not only
did the City never seek to exercise its B-share rights, it never even attempted to outvote
UUTBV.35°

¢ The Supervisory Council

The Supervisory Council is responsible for organising the management of the company and
supervises the Management Board. Prior to the IPO, it was constituted of seven (7)
members.°°°

Pursuant to ASTV’s Articles of Association, a resolution of the Supervisory Council is
considered as adopted if more than one-half of the participating members vote in its favour
save for specified matters where a unanimous vote is required (such as the approval of the
development plan and strategy of ASTV, the approval of the business plan as well as
investments exceeding 10 million Kroons).3%

Prior to the IPO, the Shareholders’ Agreement provided, that UUTBV would appoint four (4) of
the seven (7) members of the Supervisory Council.3*

According to Mr Plenderleith, who took his first position at ASTV in October 2004,°° the
dominant role played by the Chairman of the Management Board (i.e. ASTV’s CEO, who has
always been a UUTBV appointee*®) regarding the strategic matters handled by the
Supervisory Council more than offset any lack of majority on the Supervisory Council.
Mr Plenderleith never witnessed a situation and there is no evidence of there ever having been
a situation in which the Supervisory Council could not reach a unanimous decision whenever
required by the Articles of Association.° Indeed, it appears that the City and ASTV developed
the very useful practice of resolving any disagreements through negotiations outside ASTV’s
management structure.265

Similarly, Mr Gallienne testified that the Chairman of the Management Board always benefited
from substantial autonomy in his management. During his tenure as ASTV’s CEO, he has
always considered obtaining the Supervisory Council's approval as to be, in effect, obtaining
the approval of UUTBV.*%° It is of note that the Chairman of the Supervisory Council has
always been an employee or consultant of UUTBV or another United Utilities entity.5°”

« The Management Board

The Management Board represents and manages ASTV as well as organises its accounting.
The Management Board cannot, however, execute transactions beyond the scope of ordinary
business without the Supervisory Council's approval.

Prior to the IPO, the Shareholders’ Agreement provided that the votes of the four (4) UUTBV
members of the Supervisory Council would be sufficient for the election and/or removal of all
of the members of the Management Board.9%

(iii) The EBRD’s entry into ASTV

A mentioned above at paragraphs 207 and 208, from 2003 to 2010, the EBRD held an indirect

As a condition of its investment, the EBRD obtained the right to nominate two (2) of the
representatives of UUTBV on ASTV’s Supervisory Council. The EBRD consistently voted with
UUTBV.S7°

(iv) The Impact of the 2005 IPO on control over ASTV

As a result of the 2005 IPO, UUTBV became a minority shareholder, holding 35.3% of ASTV’s
ordinary shares. The City of Tallinn held 34.7%.37!

As stated above at paragraph 210, the City of Tallinn and UUTBV recorded their intention to
maintain the status quo (described as UUTBV’s “full operational control over the Company and
responsibility related thereto”) in the First 2005 Amendment:

The City [of Tallinn] and [UUTBV] acknowledge that the amendments
to be made in the Shareholders Agreement and other agreements
executed between them should take into account the fact that the
objective of the sale of 50.4% of shares in [ASTV] to [UUTBV] in 2001

was to transfer a full operational control over [ASTV] and responsibility
related thereto to [UUTBV]. The amendments introduced by this
Agreement are not intended to change this principle or the respective
rights or obligations of [JUTBV] and the City [of Tallinn].972

Similarly, the 2005 Amendment recorded that UUTBV would not forfeit its ability to appoint all
members of the Management Board. For this purpose, the City of Tallinn guaranteed that its
representatives at the Supervisory Council would vote with UUTBV’s appointees concerning
the composition of the Management Board precisely “to ensure the continuing operational
control of the Investor.”375

During the negotiations of this amendment, the City of Tallinn had initially suggested that the
Supervisory Council be constituted of eight (8) members and that UUTBV and the City of
Tallinn would each nominate three (3).574 The City of Tallinn nonetheless retracted and agreed
to amend the Shareholders’ Agreement so that the Supervisory Council be formed of nine (9)
members, four (4) of which were to be appointed by UUTBV, three (3) by the City of Tallinn
and two (2) were to be independent members.?”° Mr Plenderleith testified that the two (2)

independent members were always nominated by either him or Mr Gallienne, and the City of

The Articles of Association of ASTV were also amended to notably reflect the changes in the
number of members of the Supervisory Council.5’”

Lastly, it is noted that the prospectus issued for the purposes of the IPO (the “Prospectus”)
described ASTV as a joint venture by the City of Tallinn and UUTBV, controlled by the City of
Tallinn and UUTBV.°78

d) Estonian Law Expert Evidence

Respondent submitted two (2) legal expert reports from Mr Hannes Vallikivi that address the
notion of control under Estonian and EU law. Although the applicable international law
standard does not stem from either, this evidence nonetheless bears some relevance to the
extent that it fleshes out how ASTV is structured and operates as an Estonian juridical person,
That being said, Estonian law can only be of limited assistance since, as conceded by
Mr Vallikivi during the Hearing,°7° even under Estonian law, the determination of control may
vary depending on the context in which the issue is assessed and may be founded on a
number of factors and considerations.

In Mr Vallikivi's opinion, ASTV is jointly controlled by the City of Tallinn and UUTBV. In his
view, the acquisition by the City of Tallinn of veto rights through the privatisation of ASTV
precludes a finding of control by UUTBV since any control depended on the City:28°

The City of Tallinn holds strategic control through a unanimous vote
requirement for strategic decisions by the Supervisory Board and the
Golden Share of the City of Tallinn allowing it to veto strategic
decisions if referred to the General Meeting because consensus was
not reached in the Supervisory Board. The Golden Share also allows
the City of Tallinn to veto fundamental decisions of ASTV in the
General Meeting such as amendment of the Articles of Association,
change of capital and status of ASTV. UUTBV and the City of Tallinn
also need to act in concert in order to appoint the Management Board
of ASTV, elected by the Supervisory Board, since 2005.°°'

407.

For the purposes of his expert opinion, Mr Vallikivi elaborated a definition of control after having
studied how control is defined in different sources of law, including Estonian company law,
competition law, and securities law and related EU law. Mr Vallikivi’s definition consists of three
alternative scenarios:82

All of the above definitions seem to have common features that allow
proposing a general definition of “control”. A direct or indirect
shareholder is deemed to control a public limited company if on the
basis of (i) the law, (ii) the Articles of Association, or (iii) a contract with
the company or other shareholders, it:

(a) has a majority of voting rights (>50%);

(b) has the power to (i) appoint or remove a majority of the members
of the Management Board or Supervisory Board, or (ii) control the
financial and operating policies of the company, or (iii) determine the
decision making of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, or
(iv) use or dispose of all or significant proportion of assets of the
company; or

(c) is able to veto strategic decisions in the company (negative
control).38°

It appears from Mr Vallikivi’s reports that his conclusion that ASTV is jointly controlled by
UUTBV and the City of Tallinn is not affected by the voting conventions agreed to in the
Shareholders’ Agreement because these obligations are only contractual in nature. Such
obligations would bear lesser importance since, should the City fail to abide by its contractual
obligations, UUTBV’s sole recourse would be an action in damages and would not affect the
validity of a resolution adopted in contravention to the voting convention. Additionally,
according to Mr Vallikivi, the members of the Supervisory Council appointed by the City of
Tallinn are deemed independent and thus are not required to vote in accordance with the City
of Tallinn’s direction and/or the Shareholders’ Agreement.35+

That being said, Mr Vallikivi conceded during his cross-examination that a shareholder who
can appoint or remove a majority of the Management Board’s members pursuant to an
agreement with another shareholder in fact meets his control test.28

Mr Vallikivi also acknowledged during the Hearing that the most important matters over which
the City may impose its veto through the B-Share consists of issues for which minority
shareholders are usually protected by the corporation’s articles of association and which do

not have bearing on the issue of control.%8° In any event, considering that the passing of a
resolution on these subjects requires a two-thirds majority, the B-share would not confer any
practical advantage to the City since it has always held at least a third of the ordinary
shareholding.2®”

As a result, according to Mr Vallikivi, the B-Share would only provide the City with the ability
to block the passing of resolutions pertaining to two (2) matters: (i) the acquisition of treasury
shares and (ii) issues referred to the General Meeting at the request of the Management Board
or the Supervisory Council.

Regarding the first category of resolutions, Mr Vallikivi recognised that the inability for a
shareholder to force the adoption of such a resolution does not necessarily indicate that this
shareholder does not control the company.°®° Regarding the second category of resolutions,
Claimants submit — and the Tribunal cannot help but agree — that it is unlikely that such a
matter would be referred to the General Meeting by either the Supervisory Council or the
Management Board considering that i) all members of the latter are appointed by UUTBV
(pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement) and ii) the decisions of the Supervisory Council are
shaped by UUTBV, and the evidence is that UUTBV never failed to pass a resolution at the
Supervisory Council.5®°

Claimants also downplay the importance of the duty of independence of the members
appointed by the City (which according to Mr Vallikivi would trump the voting agreement
contained in the Shareholders’ Agreement). In Claimants’ view, it would be unlikely that a
UUTBV-sponsored resolution would be defeated on this basis because the UUTBV’s members
only need to secure another vote to pass a resolution at the Supervisory Council and could
easily obtain the support of the two (2) independent members as de facto UUTBV
appointees. °°°

e) Analysis of the Tribunal: Control of ASTV

The Tribunal is of the view that the evidence establishes that UUTBV controlled ASTV at the
relevant points in time.

It is noted that UUTBV and the City of Tallinn carefully negotiated the provisions of the
privatisation agreements regarding control over ASTV. The Parties appear to have struck a
balance between the need for the foreign investor to assume effective control of ASTV and
the desire to maintain the corporate structure set out in the company’s Articles of Association.
This outcome aligns with the statements in tender documents to the effect that the investor
would gain both operational and management control of ASTV.

386 Namely the amendment to the articles of association, the increase and decrease of share capital, the
issuing of convertible bonds, the dissolution, merger and other transformations of the company.

419.

As discussed above, it is not in dispute that UUTBV enjoyed operational control over ASTV. It
should also be recalled that UUTBV has always been the most important private shareholder
of ASTV.

Regarding strategic control, it is manifest that UUTBV exerted a dominant influence over ASTV
management, notwithstanding that the City of Tallinn held certain special voting rights by virtue
of the B-share.

First, UUTBV had the ability to nominate the members of the Management Board pursuant to
the Shareholders’ Agreement, both before and after the 2005 IPO, which Mr Vallikivi confirmed
would meet even his control test.

Second, UUTBV effectively enjoyed dominant influence over the Supervisory Council pursuant
to the voting convention agreed pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement. Even if after the
IPO these rights did not grant UUTBV a majority of appointees to the Supervisory Council, the
evidence is that UUTBV was at all times the party directing and driving the Supervisory
Council's activities and decisions. This is manifest not only from the fact of UUTBV’s special
management and technical expertise, the exercise of which was the raison d’étre of ASTV's
privatisation, but also from the uncontradicted evidence concerning the dominant role played
by ASTV’s CEO, a UUTBV appointee, in the management of ASTV's affairs. It bears repeating
that UUTBV never failed to obtain the adoption of a resolution that it supported, including on
issues requiring a unanimous vote, that UUTBV de facto nominated the independent members
of the Supervisory Board, and that the chairman of the Supervisory Board has always been a
person related to UUTBV (and not to the City of Tallinn).

Third, the powers attached to the B-share, when viewed in the overall context here, conferred
only minimal advantage to the City of Tallinn, as appears from a review of the Estonian law
evidence. The incidence of the B-share rights seems all the more accessory in the light of the
City’s undertaking to not exercise them, save in the extreme case where ASTV could not
otherwise be properly managed. In the circumstances, those rights do not support the
assertion that ASTV was jointly controlled by UUTBV and the City of Tallinn.

The fact that ASTV was referred to as a joint venture in the IPO documentation changes
nothing in this regard. It certainly does not prevent a finding of control, considering how loosely
joint ventures are defined and given the evidence of UUTBV’s overwhelming control of the
company. Furthermore, to the extent that the subjective understanding of the Parties bears
relevance, it should be pointed out that, as of 17 September 2009, the Tallinn City Council
itself declared that from its perspective the privatisation had deprived the City from making
management decisions regarding ASTV.2*"

Finally, the fact that, from 2003 to 2010, two (2) UUTBV appointees to the Supervisory Council
were nominated by the EBRD does not impact the Tribunal’s assessment considering that this
right was itself a consequence of the EBRD’s stake in UUTBV. Furthermore, the evidence is
to the effect that the EBRD’s nominees always voted with UUTBV’s representatives on the
Council.

426.

In sum, the evidence is that UUTBV controlled ASTV and dominated all aspects of the
company's operational management and strategic decision-making throughout the period from
2009 until the rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application, as well as at the time of consent, the
whole in accordance with one of the fundamental purposes of the privatisation over ASTV.

4) The Relevance of UUTBV’s Corporate Structure

Having determined that UUTBV controlled ASTV, the Tribunal must nonetheless decide as to
whether the fact that UUTBV became wholly owned by United Utilities, a UK corporation, has
any bearing on the question of the “nationality” requirement under Art. 9 (4) of the BIT.

Respondent argues that UUTBV is nothing more than a “shell” company, and that any control
exercised by UUTBV over ASTV actually rests with its UK parent company, United Utilities.
This means, in Respondent's view, that any foreign control over ASTV, as required by the
ICSID Convention, rests not with a Dutch national (UUTBV) but with a UK national (United
Utilities) that is not covered by the Estonian-Dutch BIT.

The Tribunal will first review the relevant international investment law authorities and the
position of the Parties (a), and after considering the relevant facts (b), will address the
relevance and impact of United Utilities’ control of UUTBV (c).

a) Positions of the Parties, and Relevant International Authorities

According to Respondent, several international tribunals have determined that a shell
company may not ground a finding of control. A shell company merely channels control to the
upstream entity.°°? Respondent relies heavily in this respect on National Gas v Egypt and on
TSA Spectrum v Argentina. °° Respondent also relies on the expert evidence of Mr Vallikivi,
who opines that under Estonian law as well control is usually found to vest in the ultimate
controller in a chain of corporate entities.9%*

As regards the international law authorities, Claimants emphasise that Respondent has not
submitted a single case in which an international tribunal has pierced the veil of the second
corporate layer (e.g., in this case, the veil between UUTBV and United Utilities), and where
the ultimate controller was found to be neither a national of the host State nor a national of a
non-Contracting State of the ICSID Convention. The so-called ultimate controller in the present
case — United Utilities — is neither; the TSA Spectrum and National Gas cases are
distinguishable and of little assistance here.

In TSA Spectrum v Argentina, the tribunal indeed examined the claimant's “upstream” chain
of ownership and control, and declined jurisdiction on the basis of its finding that TSA was
ultimately controlled, not by a foreign entity, but by an Argentinian national through a Dutch
holding. The tribunal noted that there is no consistent practice as to whether it is necessary to
pierce the second corporate layer (beyond, in that case, the domestic entity) in identifying

430.

control.°°5 However, it determined that such an approach was especially warranted when the
ultimate control is alleged to be in the hands of a national of the host State.

In National Gas v Egypt, the tribunal also pierced the veil of the claimant entity, based on the
reasoning of TSA Spectrum. It too emphasised that this approach is appropriate where there
is a suggestion that the relevant entity might be controlled not by a foreign entity but by a
national of the host State.°°” In that matter, the tribunal found that 90% of National Gas’
shareholding was detained by an UAE company that was wholly owned by an Egyptian
national.

According to Claimants, the notion of control is independent from the question of whether the
entity claiming jurisdiction is a so-called shell company; the corporate nature of this entity is
irrelevant to the “control” analysis. Precluding a shell company from claiming control would be
contrary to the broad and liberal meaning of control under the ICSID Convention. Claimants
also contend that the BIT here does not contain any language forbidding a shell company from
benefitting from the Treaty’s protections. Claimants further submit that the only exception to
this rule — the only instances in which tribunals have “looked through” the corporate structure
of a claimant — have been where there were suggestions that the claimant was ultimately
controlled by local (host State) interests or from a non-Contracting State to the ICSID
Convention. They refer to Professor Schreuer, who comments that looking at the ultimate
controller in such a scenario is necessary for the purpose of “blocking access to the Centre for
juridical persons that are controlled directly or indirectly by nationals of non-Contracting States
or nationals of the host State.”°%°

Two other cases also provide particularly relevant and compelling guidance.

In Autopista v Venezuela, the respondent argued that the alleged US control of the domestic
entity, Aucoven, was a fiction and that claimant lacked jurisdiction accordingly. At its
incorporation, 99% of Aucoven’s shareholding was held by ICA, a subsidiary of a Mexican
conglomerate, ICA Holding. A few days after the start of its operations, Aucoven requested
authorisation to transfer 75% of its shares to Icatech, an American subsidiary of ICA Holding.
This authorisation was obtained 15 months later, after ICA Holding submitted a guarantee and
accepted to be jointly responsible for Icatech’s obligations. The relevant concession
agreement defined control as ownership of a majority of Aucoven’s shares. The tribunal
refused to interfere with the parties’ definition and declined to look beyond the immediate
control of Aucoven. According to the tribunal, the agreement of the parties fell within the ambit
of Art. 25 of the Convention, which does not require a demonstration of what the tribunal called
“effective control.”39

431. In AdT v Bolivia, although there was no question that AdT was controlled by a foreign entity,
the parties disagreed on the locus of this foreign control. Bolivia notably submitted, as does
Estonia in the present case, that control can only be said to lie with the ultimate controlling
entity. The applicable treaty, The Netherlands-Bolivia bilateral investment treaty, contained a
definition of foreign nationals substantially identical to the BIT in this case.4°° A majority of the
tribunal found that there were no indications from the various definitions of “controf and
“controlled” that control necessarily entails a degree of active exercise of powers or direction.
It further dismissed Bolivia’s argument that it should refer to the notion of control under
international law for the purposes of defining corporate nationality.

432. Construing the phrase “directly or indirectly controlled,” the majority ruled that foreign-
controlled entities could avail themselves of the treaty’s protections even if there existed
several links in the chain of control:

The phrase, “directly or indirectly,” in modifying the term “controlled”
creates the possibility of there simultaneously being a direct controller
and one or more indirect controllers. The BIT does not limit the scope
of eligible claimants to only the “ultimate controller.”4°1

b) Relevant Facts

433. UUTBV became wholly owned by United Utilities in November 2010,*°? and there is no
question that UUTBV's ultimate parent companies have always been UK companies.*°

434. Estonian and Dutch authorities have confirmed that UUTBV is a Dutch resident.404 Upon
International Water's exit from UUTBV, UUTBV applied to the Northern Tax Centre of the Tax
Customs Board of Estonia for a confirmation that the Estonia-Netherlands Double Taxation
Treaty would apply. The Estonian authorities declared that UUTBV was a Dutch resident as
per the definition of the applicable treaty.4°

435. The Respondent points out, however, that as a matter of Dutch law, all Dutch B.V.s are
considered to be Dutch residents for tax purposes, and the requirements to maintain Dutch

400 The Netherlands-Bolivia treaty defines nationals as: “(ii) without prejudice to the provisions of (iii)

the law of the other Contracting Party,” RL-117, AdT v Bolivia, supra note 334, 480.

436. It appears from Mr van Rooijen’s evidence that of the thirteen managing directors of UUTBV,
seven resided in the UK, one in The Netherlands, one in Ukraine and four (4) in Estonia.4°8
There is no evidence as to the location from which the UUTBV directors who remotely attended
UUTBV's board meetings (e.g., by telephone) participated in these meetings.“

provides to UUTBV domiciliation services as well as management, accounting, reporting and
legal administration services.*1°

438. Mr van Rooijen, an Orangefield employee, testified that UUTBV is managed independently
from the other entities of the United Utilities group. He testified that UUTBV, as opposed to
other entities of the United Utilities group, received reports and took key commercial decisions
regarding ASTV.‘"' Mr van Rooijen also affirmed that UUTBV maintains other commercial
activities beyond holding and financial activities, though he did not particularise those
activities.4'? His evidence also contains reference to the minutes of UUTBV's board meetings.
These minutes mostly refer to a “business update” on ASTV's activities, which would be based
on a report distributed beforehand,*'3 and the appointment of the members of the Supervisory

with high-ranking executives of United Utilities almost exclusively through UUTBV.*1° He is not
aware of, and he never experienced any pressure exerted by United Utilities regarding ASTV,
and he would be surprised if ASTV had been discussed at United Utilities’ board meetings.‘

440. Mr Plenderleith explained that United Utilities and its related entities play a contractual role as
technical advisors.**' This was formalised through the conclusion of the Technical Services
Agreement, referred above at paragraph 193.4? United Utilities also provided legal, public
relations and treasury functions to ASTV.*° In the latter respect, the Prospectus made explicit
references to the fact that ASTV benefitted from United Utilities’ technical know-how.‘424

441. The Tribunal notes that other connections between UUTBV and the United Utilities stem from
the latter's intervention in certain agreements pertaining to ASTV's privatisation. For example,
United Utilities guaranteed the performance of UUTBV’s monetary obligations under the

in that view that United Utilities attempted to sell its interest in ASTV to Veolia. This transaction was not

c) Analysis of the Tribunal: Relevance of the Ultimate Controller of UUTBV

In view of the Tribunal’s conclusion regarding UUTBV's control of ASTV, the nature of the
relationship between UUTBV and its parent United Utilities is irrelevant to the question of
jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention. Whether control of ASTV is said to reside in one or
the other, control clearly vests in a national of a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention
other than the host State. The question is whether, and how, that relationship affects the issue
of jurisdiction under the BIT.

The preamble of the Treaty and its provisions establish that it aims to promote economic
cooperation between The Netherlands and Estonia by encouraging investment in each State
by nationals of the other.*#8 In defining nationals, the parties introduced the important
qualification of “direct or indirect’ control, and elected not to define the meaning of control.

As in AdT v Bolivia, a majority of the Tribunal concludes that the signatories of the Treaty did
not exclude the possibility that multiple sources of foreign control of a domestic entity could be
identified, as well as the very real possibility that a person having direct or indirect — though
not necessarily the “ultimate” — control could bring a claim under the Treaty so long as that
person is a national of the non-host State party. It is not for the Tribunal to limit or curtail such
an intentionally broad and open-ended definition.

The facts at hand demonstrate that UUTBV clearly forms part of the chain of control — it is in
fact the first, direct link in that chain. There is no question that there is interaction between
ASTV and other members and employees of the broader United Utilities group with respect to
ASTV. That being said, the Tribunal is satisfied that UUTBV, a Dutch corporate vehicle, is the
converging point within the group at which the management of ASTV is addressed. Indeed,
the minutes of UUTBV record not only that UUTBV’s directors were appraised of ASTV
activities but that they were also entrusted with the appointment of the members of the
Supervisory Council, the very entity responsible for ASTV’s strategic management. That
certain decision-making regarding ASTV might also have occurred at so-called upstream links
in the corporate chain is irrelevant under the BIT.

The Tribunal thus concludes that United Utilities’ control of UUTBV does not preclude a finding
of jurisdiction by the Dutch intermediary company over ASTV’s claims, under The Netherlands-
Estonia BIT.

B) THE RATIONE VOLUNTATIS JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

By way of its second objection to jurisdiction, Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction because the current arbitral proceedings are essentially the same as the Estonian
proceedings commenced by ASTV. As noted above at paragraphs 292-301 and following,
ASTV is currently seeking before the Estonian courts various remedies in relation to the
rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application. According to Respondent, a finding of jurisdiction would
thus violate Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention.

After discussing the authorities submitted by the Parties on this point (1), the Tribunal will
review the position of the Parties on the application of Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention (2) and
then proceed with its own analysis (3).

1) The Breadth and Effect of Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention
Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention reads:

Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless
otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the
exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the
exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of
its consent to arbitration under this Convention. [Emphasis added]

Estonia argues that its consent to the ICSID Convention was premised on the exclusivity of
ICSID proceedings and that this exclusivity principle operates as a pre-requisite for ICSID's
jurisdiction in any given case. A breach of Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention would thus deprive
the Centre of any jurisdiction.*2° Respondent does not rely on any ICSID-specific authority on
this precise point.

Claimants argue that Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention boils down to a rule of interpretation
aimed at clarifying the nature of parties’ consent to arbitration, as opposed to a condition to
consent per se. In their view, unless the parties have expressed otherwise, consent to refer a
dispute to the Centre is understood to exclude other types of remedies concerning this same
dispute.*°° They refer to Professor Schreuer’s commentaries, according to which this rule
operates only from the moment of valid consent, and not before:

The first sentence of Art. 26 has two main features. The first is that,
once consent to ICSID arbitration has been given, the parties have lost
their right to seek relief in another forum, national or international, and

CL-10, Lanco v Argentina, \CSID Case No. ARB97/6, Decision on Jurisdiction (8 December 1998), 938:
“Article 26 is merely a standard for interpretation, a presumption that arbitration is the exclusive remedy,
but that the parties may require exhaustion of domestic remedies”; CL-11, SGS v Philippines, ICSID Case
No. ARB/02/6, Decision on Jurisdiction (29 January 2004), 9146, where the tribunal noted that the ICSID
Convention’s travaux préparatoires make clear that Art. 26 was intended as a rule of interpretation.

456.

are restricted to pursuing their claim through ICSID. This principle
operates from the moment of valid consent.**' [Emphasis added]

Claimants further posit that a breach of Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention does not in any event
invalidate a party's consent or otherwise vitiate the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.*** They find
support in certain decisions on provisional measures issued in the Tokios Tokelés v Ukraine
and Perenco v Ecuador cases.*%>

In Tokios Tokelés v Ukraine, the claimant sought diplomatic protection concerning a tax
investigation commenced by Ukraine. The arbitral tribunal held that the claimant's efforts in
that respect were inconsistent with Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention. It nonetheless refrained
from discontinuing the arbitral proceedings, finding that abstention from diplomatic
proceedings is not a condition for the Centre’s or a tribunal's jurisdiction.

In Perenco v Ecuador, the claimant sought the tribunal’s assistance further to Ecuador's effort
to enforce certain rights pursuant to Ecuadorean domestic law. The tribunal held that
Ecuador's conduct was inconsistent with Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention; it did not, however,
comment on the impact of Ecuador's conduct on the tribunal’s or the Centre’s jurisdiction.

According to Respondent, reliance on these two (2) cases is inapposite since they do not
concern situations where parallel proceedings have been commenced before domestic courts.
Respondent submits that Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers (Greece) v Albania would
be the most relevant authority.

In that matter, the tribunal held that the claimant could not simultaneously seek recourse for
losses incurred in the performance of contracts before domestic courts and in arbitral
proceedings.‘** The tribunal (comprised of a sole arbitrator) applied the “fundamental basis”
test, which calls for a determination of whether the fundamental basis of the dispute submitted
to arbitration is the same as in the dispute pursued in the other forum. He emphasised that
this inquiry is context-dependent and that no definite guidance may be ascertained:

The same facts can give rise to different legal claims. The similarity of
prayers for relief does not necessarily bespeak an identity of causes of
action. What | believe to be necessary is to determine whether claimed
entitlements have the same normative source. But even this abstract
statement may hardly be said to trace a bright line that would permit
rapid decision. The frontiers between claimed entitlements are not
always distinct. Each situation must be regarded with discernment.*95

461.

The arbitrator found that the claims asserted in the arbitration were substantially the same as
those for breach of contract brought before the Albanian courts. It was not sufficient for
claimant to assert that the tribunal's jurisdiction was based on the BIT, as opposed to the
contract — the claims submitted to arbitration must have an autonomous existence outside the
contract. Conversely, the sole arbitrator found that the bringing of domestic proceedings did
not prevent claimant from seizing the arbitral tribunal of its denial of justice claim.4°°

Respondent also invites the Tribunal to consider the second award on jurisdiction issued in
EURAM v Slovakia,**’ an ad hoc arbitration. The tribunal there held that the claimant's conduct
before the Slovakian courts amounted to a waiver to arbitrate pursuant to Swedish law, the /ex
arbitri. As such, the claimant was precluded from bringing arbitral proceedings. The claimant
had initially commenced proceedings before Slovakian courts in order to preserve its rights.
Those proceedings included its claims under the relevant BIT. The tribunal found that not only
did the domestic and arbitral proceedings share the same factual basis and were “substantially
the same,” but that claimant was effectively treating the domestic proceedings as a simple
precautionary measure, and not as a means to obtain a substantive remedy.*#8

In the same vein, Respondent refers to Commerce Group v El Salvador, in which an ICSID
tribunal declined jurisdiction on the basis that claimant had not complied with the waiver
provision under the CAFTA.** It so held on the basis that the impugned “measures” referred
to arbitration were substantially the same as those referred to the domestic courts.

2) Positions of the Parties on the Application of Art. 26 to the Facts at Hands

Respondent argues that Claimants seek the same remedies before the Estonian courts and
in the present arbitral proceedings. Respondent concludes that both the domestic and arbitral
proceedings pertain to a claim for damages flowing from the ECA's alleged failure to comply
with the Services Agreement and the 2007 Amendment.*#°

Respondent alleges that, should the Tribunal find a breach of Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention,
such breach would impact both Claimants, even if UUTBV is not a party to the Estonian
proceedings. Respondent submits that the “fundamental basis” test referred to above relates
to the “claims” at issue, as opposed to the relevant domestic proceedings. It adds that, due to
ASTV's corporate structure, UUTBV would benefit from any award of damages to be rendered

in favour of ASTV.“4' Finally, Respondent submits that the risk of double recovery by ASTV
remains extant until the Estonian proceedings become final.442

462. Claimants, for their part, argue that their claims in the present arbitration differ from ASTV's
Estonian court claims because the former only relate to claims under the BIT. Claimants do
not dispute that both sets of claims arise from the same factual background. Yet, they say,
each proceeding rests on a distinct legal basis: the arbitration claims relate to breaches of
international investment norms, such as the fair and equitable treatment, as opposed to a
contravention to Estonian administrative law in the national courts.“4%

463. Moreover, should the Tribunal be minded to find in favour of Estonia in this regard, it could bar
only ASTV, but not UUTBV from pursuing its claims in this arbitration since UUTBV is not a
party to the Estonian proceedings.‘“*

3) Analysis of the Tribunal: Ratione Voluntatis Jurisdiction

464. The Tribunal considers that it is unnecessary to engage in an exercise of construction of Art. 26
of the ICSID Convention. This flows from the Tribunal’s conclusion, discussed further below,
that the present proceedings and the matter before the Estonian domestic courts are not
substantially the same. As a result, Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention simply does not enter into
play.

465. The remedies sought in this arbitration derive from a different normative source than those
articulated before the domestic courts. The thrust of Claimants’ case consists of alleged
breaches by Respondent of the fair and equitable treatment standard and of due process, as
well as other international obligations. It is unchallenged that the Estonian courts have
considered facts that are also before the Tribunal, including most notably the rejection of the
2011 Tariff Application. Yet, a review of the decisions issued by the Estonian courts‘
establishes clearly that those courts considered ASTV’s and the ECA's respective rights and
obligations solely through the prism of Estonian law. At no point were the rights of ASTV as a
foreign investor in Estonia pursuant to the BIT and international public law considered or
adjudicated. That the Estonian courts were seized of claims sharing much of the same factual

the “fork in the road” clause would have been triggered by the Argentinian entity in which the investor was
a shareholder at the commencement of domestic proceedings. The tribunal recalled the differences
between contractual and treaty-based claims and held that this distinction was all the more applicable here
considering that the investor had not instituted any recourse before the domestic courts.

basis as the present arbitration cannot prevent a finding of jurisdiction by the Tribunal.
Moreover, Claimants’ contentions before the Tribunal, as set out above at paragraphs 307-
322, cannot be said to amount to a mere international window-dressing of the claims brought
by ASTV before the Estonian Courts.

Cc) THE ALLEGED INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE BIT WITH EU Law

The Parties have commented at length on the alleged incompatibility of Article 9 of the BIT
with EU law in numerous submissions either general or specific to the Achmea Judgment. ‘4°

Whereas Respondent adopts an approach primarily focused on EU law, Claimants adopt the
framework of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”) as the starting point for
the relevant analysis.*4”

In a nutshell, Respondent argues that Claimants’ claims are barred due to the incompatibility
of the BIT with EU law. Respondent contends that Estonia’s accession to the EU on 1 May
2004, or the entry in force of the Lisbon Treaty, had the effect of terminating the BIT and of
“[conferring] upon investors and investments from other EU Member States a vast array of
rights of free establishment, free movement of capital and services, and post-establishment
treatment and operations.”“48 According to Respondent, ‘[t]hese rights are directly enforceable
before Member State courts and prevail over conflicting provisions of Estonian domestic
law.” Alternatively, it argues that, should the analysis be conducted pursuant to the VCLT,
the outcome would remain unchanged.

Considering the several procedural developments reported above and the extensive
submissions by the Parties, as well as by the European Commission, the Tribunal will review
and comment on those submissions chronologically, before closing with its overall conclusion
regarding this important question.

1) Respondent’s Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder

For the Respondent, “[t]he degree of incompatibility between the Treaty and EU law is so great
that the Treaty (including its Article 9) must be considered as having been terminated by virtue

of Estonia’s accession to the EU Treaties, or the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, at the
latest."45°

As mentioned above, Respondent premises its reasoning on the proposition that since EU law
forms part of international law, the Tribunal must apply EU law. While there is no doubt that
EU law is international law, the Tribunal considers that Respondent's position overlooks the
existence of sub-sets of international law, as discussed more fully below.

Respondent relies on the first paragraph of Art. 351 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union (“TFEU”), which provides:

The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before
1 January 1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their
accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and
one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the
provisions of the Treaties.45'

According to Respondent, the application of the pacta sunt servanda principle enshrined in
Art. 351 TFEU is limited to agreements between, on the one hand, EU Member States and,
on the other hand, non-EU countries. This principle does not, in Respondent's view, apply to
intra-EU treaties, over which EU law takes precedence. #5?

Respondent contends accordingly that Art. 9 of the BIT, which provides that disputes arising
out of the Treaty may be submitted to international arbitration, is incompatible with Art. 344,
267 and 18 TFEU. Furthermore, Estonia submits that under both EU law and public
international law (as per the VCLT, addressed below), the BIT is inoperable as a result of this
incompatibility to the extent that disputes falling under the BIT involve the application of
Estonian law, which in turns includes EU law.45°

First, Respondent posits that Art. 9 BIT runs afoul Art. 344 and 267 TFEU, which address the
settlement of disputes regarding the interpretation/application of EU law:454

Jurisdiction (30 November 2012), 94.183 (CL-107) [Electrabel (Decision on Jurisdiction)].

Article 344 (ex Article 292 TEC)

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement
other than those provided for therein.

Article 267 (ex Article 234 TEC)

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to
give preliminary rulings concerning:

(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies,
offices or agencies of the Union;

Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a
Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision
on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the
Court to give a ruling thereon.

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or
tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial
remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter
before the Court.

If such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal
of a Member State with regard to a person in custody, the Court of
Justice of the European Union shall act with the minimum of delay.

476. These provisions have been interpreted as providing exclusive competence to the CUEU over
the interpretation of EU treaties.*°> Respondent also refers to Opinion 1/09 of the CUEU, which
deemed the creation of a unified patent litigation system through international agreement
incompatible with EU law.45° The CJEU reasoned that this system would infringe its monopoly
over the rendering of judgements concerning significant issues of EU law.45”

477. Second, Respondent argues that Art. 9 BIT is incompatible with Art. 18 TFEU, which prohibits
discrimination among EU nationals:45°

Article 18 (ex Article 12 TEC)

Within the scope of application of the Treaties, and without prejudice
to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on
grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.

The European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with
the ordinary legislative procedure, may adopt rules designed to prohibit
such discrimination.

Respondent refers then to the amicus curiae observations of the European Commission in the
Achmea v Slovakia matter, where it submitted that intra-EU BITs lead to discrimination among
EU State Members.‘59

As to consequence of this alleged incompatibility between Art. 9 of the BIT and the EU law
provisions reported above, Respondent asserts: “As a result of the conflict between Article 9
of the Treaty and mandatory provision of EU law, Article 9 is inoperative.” It is unclear
whether Respondent refers here, implicitly, to a peremptory norm of general international law
(or jus cogens) — being the only norm that can render a treaty automatically void pursuant to
Article 64 VCLT.“*" In any case, in the Tribunal’s view it can hardly be argued that EU law
rules constitute rules of jus cogens.

In order to canvass all possible avenues, Respondent also contends that even if
Articles 30(3) VCLT, which addresses the application of successive treaties relating to the
same subject matter, and 59 VCLT, which addresses the termination or suspension of a treaty
implied the conclusion of a later treaty, were to apply, the result would be the same: EU law
having the same subject-matter and being incompatible with the earlier BIT, EU law - not the
Treaty — would apply.

2) Claimants’ Reply Memorial

Adopting what the Tribunal itself considers to be the correct approach, that is, the application
of general international law, Claimants argue that “[t]he BIT is not ‘implicitly abrogated’ by
Art. 59(1) VCLT because (a) the operation of that provision is subject to the provisions of
Art. 65 VCLT that prevents automatic termination by operation of law, and (b) the requirements
of Article 59(1) VCLT itself are not met.”462

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that — as already mentioned — a treaty can only terminate
automatically where the instrument contravenes a norm of jus cogens, and that the EU law
rules at issue are not of such imperative nature. In all other situations of conflict between

461 Art. 64 VCLT reads: “If a new peremptory norm of general international law emerges, any existing treaty
which is in conflict with that norm becomes void and terminates.”

treaties, including where Art. 59 VCLT apply, the VCLT mandates the following of the
procedures set out at its Art. 65 to 68.

Claimants correctly point out that, before these procedures can be applied, two (2) conditions
precedent must be met: “(1) the later treaty must relate to the ‘same subject-matter’ as the
earlier treaty; and (2) ‘the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the
earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time’.”4
[Emphasis in original omitted]

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that none of these conditions are fulfilled: the TFEU does
not share the “same subject-matter” as the BIT; and there is no incompatibility between Article
9 of the BIT and the EU treaties, including Art. 18, 267 and 344 TFEU. As Claimants
convincingly explain, there is no incompatibility between the BIT and Article 18, as the BIT
does not discriminate on the basis of nationality since it in no way prevents rights being granted
to nationals of other Member States. There is also no incompatibility between the BIT and Art.
267 TFEU, as there exist a variety of means by which the CJEU can be seized of a request to
redress any misapplication or misinterpretation of EU law.*® And there is no incompatibility
with Article 344 TFEU, as this article only applies to inter-State arbitrations.

Furthermore, Claimants argue that the BIT cannot be rendered inoperative by application of
Art. 30(3) VCLT or Art. 351 TFEU, for the same reasons already indicated, i.e. the absence of
the existence of the “same subject-matter” and of an incompatibility.

3) The Achmea Judgment

After the exchange of the Parties’ submissions discussed above, the CJEU rendered the
Achmea Judgment. As mentioned above at paragraphs 86 and 87, Respondent obtained leave
to file a copy of this judgement, and the Parties were granted the opportunity to provide their
observations on the relevance or non-relevance of this development.

The Achmea Case results from the referral by the German Federal Court of Justice to the
CJEU for a preliminary ruling under Art. 267 TFEU in the context of the Achmea v Slovakia
arbitration, commented below at paragraphs 549-551, and opposing Slovakia to Achmea BV,
a Dutch national. The CUEU was asked to interpret Art. 18, 267 and 244 TFEU, all of which
provisions are relied on by Estonia in the present proceeding. More specifically, the Achmea
Judgment addresses whether (1) Art. 344 TFEU precludes the application of a dispute
resolution provision contained in an intra-EU BIT and, alternatively, (2) whether Art. 267 TFEU
precludes the application of such a provision.4®

In brief, the CJEU held that the arbitration provisions contained in intra-EU BITs are
incompatible with EU law. It found that arbitral tribunals constituted under such instruments

463. Cl. Reply, 9581.

464 The tribunal in Electrabel makes an exhaustive list of these means, CL-107, Electrabel (Decision on
Jurisdiction), supra note 452.

465 RL-251, Achmea Judgment, supra note 17, (23. The CJEU was also requested to consider Art. 18
TFEU but this issue became superfluous considering the responses to the two (2) first questions.

101

might be called on to interpret and/or apply EU law, given that that EU law forms part of the
law of the contracting parties to the BIT*®° and in view of the nature of EU law.*®” The CJEU
also concluded that such arbitral tribunals are not situated within the EU judicial system and,
more specifically, cannot be regarded as a court within the meaning of Art. 267 TFEU.*® The
CJEU next inquired whether an intra-EU BIT arbitral tribunal is subject to control by a court of
a Member State, and would allow the referral of issues of EU law to the CJEU. It concluded
that this was not the case because the controlling authority by a court depends on the locus of
the seat of arbitration, which may not be in the European Union. Additionally, control over an
arbitral award, as opposed to the conduct of the arbitral tribunal itself, would be too limited to
be considered as sufficient.*® In the light of the foregoing, the CJEU held that intra-EU BIT
arbitrations are not compatible with EU law:

58 In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes
falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article
8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and
of EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes to a body which
is not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by an
agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States.
Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into question not only the principle
of mutual trust between the Member States but also the preservation
of the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties, ensured
by the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU,
and is not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere
cooperation referred to in paragraph 34 above.

59 In those circumstances, Article 8 of the BIT has an adverse effect
on the autonomy of EU law.

466 On this latter point, the CJEU found that “EU law is characterized by that fact that it stems from an
independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and by the
direct effect of a whole series of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member States
themselves. Those characteristics have given rise to a structured network of principles, rules and mutually
interdependent legal relations binding the EU and its Member States reciprocally and binding its Member
States to each other,” Achmea Judgment, supra note 17, §33.

487 RL-251, Achmea Judgment, supra note 17, 4940-42.

468 RL-251, Achmea Judgment, supra note 17, 943-49. Intra-EU BITs tribunals would not form part of the
EU judicial system because they would not be connected to the judicial systems of the Member States.

463 RL-251, Achmea Judgment, supra note 17, §§50-56. On this latter point, the CUJEU distinguished
commercial arbitrations and investor-state proceedings as follows: “However, arbitration proceedings such
as those referred to in Article 8 of the BIT are different from commercial arbitration proceedings. While the
latter originate in the freely expressed wishes of the parties, the former derive from a treaty by which
Member States agree to remove from the jurisdiction of their own courts, and hence from the system of
judicial remedies which the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU requires them to establish in the
fields covered by EU law (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 February 2018, Associagao Sindical dos Juizes
Portugueses, C-64/16, EU:C:2018:117, paragraph 34), disputes which may concern the application or
interpretation of EU law. In those circumstances, the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph
relating to commercial arbitration cannot be applied to arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in
Article 8 of the BIT.” (at 955).

102

489.

491.

60 Consequently, the answer to Questions 1 and 2 is that Articles 267
and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as
Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member
States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the
other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member
State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State
has undertaken to accept.4”°

4) Respondent’s Observations on the Achmea Judgment*”!

On the one hand, Respondent argues that the Achmea Judgment confirms that the Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction. It first submits that the judgement applies to the current proceeding since the
CJEU’s reasoning does not hinge on the particulars of the dispute at play, but rather on the
mere possibility that a tribunal constituted under an intra-EU BIT may be asked to interpret or
apply EU law, and that the judgement does not distinguish between the various procedural
avenues for investor-state arbitration.*”* Considering that the Achmea Judgment does not
specify any temporal limitation to the incompatibility between investor-state dispute resolution
and EU law, Respondent also posits that such incompatibility arose as of Estonia’s EU
accession on 1 May 2004.478

Respondent further argues that the Achmea Judgment is binding on the Tribunal because: (i)
it forms part of public international law, (ii) the CJEU has exclusive authority to adjudicate on
the EU law matters pursuant to Art. 19 TEU and (iii) the Tribunal has a duty to avoid issuing
an unenforceable award, which risk would likely materialise (should the Tribunal find that it has
jurisdiction) considering the principle of supremacy of EU law.‘ Finally, Respondent restates
that the incompatibility between Art. 9 of the BIT and Art. 4(3) TEU and Art. 267 and 344 TFEU
renders the former inapplicable.4”5

Respondent also reiterates that Art. 351 TFEU is the applicable conflict rule,‘”° including with
respect to pre-accession instruments such as the BIT, and automatically renders Art. 9 of the
BIT inapplicable. As a result, the offer to arbitrate contained in Art. 9 of the BIT would have
been invalidated upon Estonia's accession to the EU in 2004.

5) Claimants’ Observations on the Achmea Judgment*””

For their part, Claimants submit that the Achmea Judgment fails to address the nature of the
particular arbitration agreement at issue here insofar as Art. 9 of the BIT only contains an offer
to arbitrate.*”® Claimants emphasise that this arbitration agreement was concluded upon the
filing of their Request of Arbitration and that the parties’ consent may not be withdrawn.479
Claimants also argue that the Tribunal is not bound by the Achmea Judgment considering that
it is not appointed pursuant to the EU Treaties and, indeed, investment treaty-based tribunals
have rejected similar jurisdiction objections in other cases.‘®° Furthermore, Claimants contend
that the Achmea Judgment is not relevant given inter alia the most favourable treatment clause
contained at Art. 3(5) of the BIT.481

6) The European Commission Amicus Curiae Submission*®?

The Tribunal authorised the intervention of the European Commission by way of the filing of
an amicus curiae brief limited to “the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of
Justice in Achmea for the case before your Arbitral Tribunal.”48>

The main contention of the European Commission is that “the offer of Estonia and the
corresponding offer of the Netherlands to investors from the other Contracting Party to enter
into investment arbitration is no longer valid since 1 May 2004, when Estonia acceded to the
European Union [...].”48

This statement is based on two (2) premises: the retroactive application of the Achmea
Judgment; and its binding effect on an international arbitral tribunal.

First, the Commission contends that the Achmea Judgment applies retroactively because this
decision, “just like any judgment of the Court of Justice, applies, as a matter of principle, from
the date of its entry into force (ex tunc), because the Court only interprets the law, and does
not create new law."48

Second, the Commission posits that the Achmea Judgment binds international arbitral
tribunals because these bodies must apply international law, which includes EU law.

498. The European Commission, however, appears to disregard the CJEU’s reasoning on Article
8,486 where the Court rightly (in the Tribunal’s view) indicates that EU law has a dual nature4®”
in the sense that it “must be regarded both as forming part of the law in force in every Member
State and as deriving from an international agreement between the Member States.”48° The
CJEU did not qualify EU law as “general principles of international law” and, although not
explicitly mentioned by the CJEU, EU law clearly derives from international law agreements
(the EU treaties). What should be added, as far as the Tribunal is concerned, is that EU law
and the BIT belong to two (2) distinct subsystems of international law. The Achmea Judgment
cannot, as of consequence, bind an international entity asserting its jurisdiction based on the
BIT.

499. The Commission goes further by stating that even when considering EU law solely in its
domestic facet (i.e. as part of Estonian national law), it would also be applicable and binding
on the Tribunal. This, however, disregards the principle that national law cannot trump
international law, as recorded at Art. 27 VCLT.*®9

500. The European Commission also purports to apply EU law conflict rules that would, in its view,
prevail over international law rules (i.e. Art. 30(3) to (5) VCLT).4%° The first of these is said to
be embodied in Declaration 17 to the Lisbon Treaty, which the Commission says establishes
the primacy of EU law. The second conflict rule referred to is Art. 351(1) TFEU, reproduced
above at paragraph 472 above.

486 Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT reads: “1. All disputes between one Contracting Party and an
investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if, possible, be settled
amicably.

2. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to
an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date
on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement. [...]

6. The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not
exclusively:

— the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

— the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties;
— the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;

— the general principles of international law.”

487 This was for example explicitly mentioned by the tribunal in AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-
Tisza Eré6mti Kft v The Republic of Hungary, |CSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Award (23 September 2010)
(RL-154) [AES v Hungary\: “7.6.6 Regarding the Community competition law regime, it has a dual nature:
on the one hand, it is an international law regime, on the other hand, once introduced in the national legal
orders, it is part of these legal orders.”

488 RL-251, Achmea Judgment, supra note 17, 941.

489 Art. 27 VCLT reads: “A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure
to perform a treaty.”

The Commission argues that “in matters governed by the EU Treaties, EU law takes
precedence over international treaties concluded between Member States, regardless of
whether they were concluded before or after EU accession.”4*" It relies not only on the positive
interpretation of this article, but also what has been called its negative interpretation as notably
articulated in the Electrabel award.*9?

As further discussed below, the Tribunal does not consider that Electrabel supports such
reasoning. The Electrabel tribunal found that Art. 351 TFEU, under both its negative and
positive interpretation, only applies if the TFEU and the other treaty have the same subject-
matter and are incompatible. It concluded that none of these two (2) conditions were met in
that case.

In the Tribunal's view, the Commission’s reasoning also disregards the fact that while Art.
351(1) TFEU might well govern conflicts of laws within the European legal order, the Tribunal
is not situated within that legal system. Rather, it is situated in the international legal order
stemming from the BIT and the ICSID Convention, where conflicts are resolved pursuant
Articles 30 and 59 VCLT.

Finally, the European Commission argues that the Tribunal is bound by the Achmea
Judgment’s pronouncement to the effect that EU law precludes investment arbitration clauses,
such as the one at Art. 9 (1) of the BIT. Again, however, while this reasoning might be correct
ona strict EU law point of view, it does not apply outside the EU legal order.

In the alternative, the European Commission argues that even if, as this Tribunal considers to
be the case, the conflict rules of the VCLT (i.e. Articles 59 and 30(1)) apply, EU law would still
prevail. The European Commission in fact concentrates its analysis on Art. 30(1), which
addresses the application of successive treaties.*°°

While Art. 30 VCLT clearly treats the identity of subject-matter and the incompatibility as two
(2) distinct conditions, the European Commission argues that “same subject matter’ and
‘conflict’ are one and the same thing.” Art. 30 VCLT would therefore apply owe to the alleged
conflict between EU law and the BIT. In the Tribunal’s view, this can be explained by the fact
that, although the CJEU indeed found a conflict between EU law and arbitration clauses in
intra-EU BITs, it did not analyse whether EU treaties and intro-EU BITs share the same
subject-matter, which is far from evident.

491 European Commission Amicus Curiae, 434.

492 The European Commission explicitly refer to the articulation of this interpretation by the Electrabel
tribunal: “If Article 307 EC [now Article 351(1) of TFEU] provides that treaty rights between Non-EU
Members cannot be jeopardised by the subsequent entry of a Non-EU State into the European Union, it
appears logical, taking into account the integration processes of the European Union, that the opposite
consequence should be implied, i.e. the non-survival of rights under an earlier treaty incompatible with EU
law as between Member States,” CL-107, Electrabel (Decision on Jurisdiction), supra note 452, 94.183.

7) Respondent’s Comments on the European Commission Amicus Curiae*™*

According to Respondent, the European Commission Amicus Curiae confirms that the
Achmea Judgment applies to the present case since (i) it declares an incompatibility between
EU law and the arbitration agreement of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, which closely mirrors
Art. 9 of the BIT, and (ii) the BIT was entered into prior to Estonia’s accession to the EU, on 1
May 2004. The BIT has thus been invalid from the moment Estonia became an EU member
and, as of consequence, the BIT has not, from that time, included a valid offer to arbitrate from
Estonia that Claimants could have accepted.

Respondent reiterates that the Achmea Judgement binds the Tribunal as it forms part of
international law. This argument has already been addressed: it ignores that international law
is composed of various sub-systems and that the EU legal system is different than that in
which the ICSID Convention and the BIT are situated.

Respondent also submits that because of the stated conflict, “[t]he immediate consequence of
this conflict was that the arbitration clause in Article 9 of the Treaty became automatically
inapplicable on the same day.”4°> Respondent insists on this point stating: “The Commission
confirms that the effect of such incompatibility between EU law and an inter se international
agreement — such as the Treaty — is that conflicting provisions of the latter are automatically
inapplicable even if the relevant EU Member States — such as Estonia and the Netherlands —
have not yet formally removed the conflicting instrument from their legal order.”4°° [Emphasis
omitted] Yet, as already indicated by the Tribunal, the only instance of automatic annulment of
an international treaty is where the instrument in question is in conflict with a rule of jus cogens,
which is not the situation here.

In the Tribunal’s view, all of Respondent's arguments bear the same flaw, being that they are
confined to the EU legal order and the so-called primacy of EU law within that order. Whereas
this hierarchy of norms certainly apply within the EU law system, it has no reach is beyond its
limits.

Respondent, following the European Commission, accepts for the sake of argument to analyse
the issues under international law and to apply Art. 30(3) VCLT. Contrarily to the European
Commission, it does not conflate the conditions of “same subject-matter” and “conflict” but
limits itself to asserting that EU law and the BIT do have the same subject-matter.

8) Claimants’ Comments on the European Commission Amicus Curiae‘’”
Claimants are highly critical of the European Commission Amicus Curiae. They state:

has waged against intra-EU BITs, the Commission's Brief takes the

position that the legal consequences of Achmea are that the Tribunal
does not have jurisdiction. However, the Commission's Brief
overstates the effect of and significance of Achmea, fails to engage
properly with the decisions of arbitration tribunals since Achmea which
have made clear that its effect is much more limited that [sic] the
Commission would like, and misrepresents the position of the parties
to the BIT and legal authority to support its campaign. The
Commission's arguments should be rejected by this Tribunal.49°

Claimants — rightly in the Tribunal’s view — consider the issue from the perspective of
international law, from which the two (2) sources of the arbitration agreement, i.e. the ICSID
Convention and the BIT, originate. Upon review of these two (2) agreements, it is beyond
doubt in their view that a valid ICSID arbitration was concluded between Estonia and
Claimants.

Claimants submit that “[t]|he Commission’s Brief overstates the significance of Achmea in order
to claim that the Tribunal in this case lacks jurisdiction.”*°° Claimants’ criticism is directed
principally to certain elements of the Achmea Judgment: first, they mention that “the CUEU
draws a confused (and misplaced) distinction in Achmea between commercial arbitrations on
the one hand, and investment treaty arbitrations on the other [...]"5°°; second, they claim that
“the CJEU’s decision in Achmea does not explain the consequence of its finding that Article 8
of the NL-SK BIT is incompatible with the TFEU, in terms of the validity of the arbitration
agreement [...]"°°'; and they conclude that the European Commission's opinion on the
consequence on the Achmea Judgment is merely a “view” of the latter.5°?

In order to refute the European Commission argument that the BIT must be considered as
automatically void because such it would contravene the common will of the BIT’s parties as
expressed further to the Achmea Judgment, Claimants point out that the declaration of the
Dutch minister referred to by the European Commission indicates The Netherlands’ intent to
terminate the Dutch intra-EU BITs, which necessarily implies that these treaties could not have
been automatically terminated.

Claimants also rely on the award rendered in the UP and CD Holding v Hungary case, which
was strongly criticised by Respondent, and approve its reasoning to the effect that the case at
hand and the UP and CD Holding v Hungary arbitration proceed under the ICSID Convention,
whereas the underlying arbitration to the Achmea Case was governed by the UNCITRAL
tules.504

With regards to the application of conflict rules, Claimants do not deny that international law is
applicable and that EU is part of international law. But contrary to the European Commission,
which considers international law as an undifferentiated body of international law, Claimants
present a more subtle analysis, with which the Tribunal agrees. According to Claimants,
“elements of EU law do form part of international law, in the sense that EU law, as a system
established by treaty, is one legal system that sits within the broader framework of international
law, alongside multiple other elements of international law, such as investment treaties [...].”5°

The existence of different sub-systems of international law requires the application of conflict
rules. In that respect, Claimants criticise the European Commission’s reliance on the EU law
primacy principle, in the following terms, with which the Tribunal agrees:

The Commission's argument as to the primacy of EU law is made from
the perspective of the CJEU, and in reliance upon a concept that in
itself is a construct of the CUEU. The fact that the CUEU may be of the
opinion that EU law has primacy over other treaties is not determinative
of the position of EU law in the hierarchy of different legal systems from
an international law perspective. 5%

Claimants also contest the alternative analysis of the European Commission of the VCLT
conflict rules, explaining that the European Commission misapplied these rules in trying to
conflate the two (2) conditions of “same subject-matter” and “conflict.” According to Claimants,
“the TFEU and the BIT do not relate to the same subject matter. As a result, neither Article 30
nor Article 59 VCLT is applicable.”®°” Claimants, for the sake of completeness, add that even
if the TFEU and the BIT would be considered as relating to the same subject matter, they
would not be incompatible and, should they be incompatible, this would either automatically
terminate the BIT or invalidate the Parties’ ICSID arbitration agreement.

Claimants conclude that, even if their international law argument fail and Estonia’s accession
to the EU had for effect that Art. 9 of the BIT become in breach of EU law from thereon, Estonia
did not, as both a matter of fact and international law, withdraw its consent to arbitrate under
Art. 9 of the BIT. As a consequence, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claim.

9) The Declaration of the Majority of EU Member States of 15 January 20195
On 15 January 2019, a majority of EU Member States, including Estonia and The Netherlands,
adopted a declaration seeking to address the consequences of the Achmea Judgment (the
“EU Majority Declaration”), which states inter alia:

In its judgment of 6 March 2018 in Case C-284/16, Achmea v Slovak
Republic (the Achmea judgment’), the Court of Justice of the

508 Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 15 January 2019 on
the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in
the European Union, RL-276 [the “EU Majority Declaration”). Two (2) other declarations were adopted on
16 January by a minority of EU Member States.

109

European Union held that “Articles 267 and 344 [... of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union] must be interpreted as precluding
a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, [...] under which an investor from one of those Member States
may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other
Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State
before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has
undertaken to accept” (“investor-State arbitration clauses”).

 

Member States are bound to draw all necessary consequences from
that judgment pursuant to their obligations under Union law.

Union law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties
concluded between Member States. As a consequence, all investor-
State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties
concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus
inapplicable. They do not produce effects including as regards
provisions that provide for extended protection of investments made
prior to termination for a further period of time (so-called sunset or
grandfathering clauses). An arbitral tribunal established on the basis of
investor-State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a
valid offer to arbitrate by the Member State party to the underlying
bilateral investment Treaty. [...]

Taking into account the foregoing, Member States declare that they
will undertake the following actions without undue delay:

1. By the present declaration, Member States inform investment
arbitration tribunals about the legal consequences of the Achmea
judgment, as set out in this declaration, in all pending intra-EU
investment arbitration proceedings brought either under bilateral
investment treaties concluded between Member States or under the
Energy Charter Treaty.

2. In cooperation with a defending Member State, the Member
State, in which an investor that has brought such an action is
established, will take the necessary measures to inform the
investment arbitration tribunals concerned of those consequences.
Similarly, defending Member States will request the courts,
including in any third country, which are to decide in proceedings
relating to an intra-EU investment arbitration award, to set these
awards aside or not to enforce them due to a lack of valid consent.

3. By the present declaration, Member States inform the investor
community that no new intra-EU investment arbitration proceeding
should be initiated.

4. Member States which control undertakings that have brought
investment arbitration cases against another Member State will take
steps under their national laws governing such undertakings, in
compliance with Union law, so that those undertakings withdraw
pending investment arbitration cases.

110

522.

523.

5. In light of the Achmea judgment, Member States will terminate all
bilateral investment treaties concluded between them by means of
a plurilateral treaty or, where that is mutually recognised as more
expedient, bilaterally.

6. Member States will ensure effective legal protection pursuant to
the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU under the control of
the Court of Justice against State measures that are the object of
pending intra-EU investment arbitration proceedings.

7. Settlements and arbitral awards in intra-EU investment arbitration
cases that can no longer be annulled or set aside and were
voluntarily complied with or definitively enforced before the Achmea
judgment should not be challenged. Member States will discuss, in
the context of the plurilateral Treaty or in the context of bilateral
terminations, practical arrangements, in conformity with Union law,
for such arbitral awards and settlements. This is without prejudice
to the lack of jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals in pending intra-EU
cases.

8. Member States will make best efforts to deposit their instruments
of ratification, approval or acceptance of that plurilateral treaty or of
any bilateral treaty terminating bilateral investment treaties between
Member States no later than 6 December 2019. They will inform
each other and the Secretary General of the Council of the
European Union in due time of any obstacle they encounter, and of
measures they envisage in order to overcome that obstacle.

9. Beyond actions concerning the Energy Charter Treaty based on
this declaration, Member States together with the Commission will
discuss without undue delay whether any additional steps are
necessary to draw all the consequences from the Achmea judgment
in relation to the intra-EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty.

10) Respondent’s Comments on the EU Majority Declaration®®

Estonia explains at the outset that its comments are intended to fulfil its obligation in the EU
Majority Declaration to “inform investment arbitration tribunals about the legal consequences
of the Achmea Judgment,” as provided in the EU Majority Declaration."

Respondent relies on the political statements of the Member States to support its objection to
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Again, in its view the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction results from the
principle of the primacy of EU law as enshrined in Declaration 17 to the Lisbon Treaty and
Art. 351 TFEU and, alternatively, from Art. 30(3) VCLT. According to Estonia, this conclusion

stands notwithstanding the so-called sunset or grandfathering clause of the Treaty, as
indicated in the EU Majority Declaration.

Respondent argues that the EU Majority Declaration is binding on the Tribunal, as it reflects
the common understanding of both signatories to the BIT, The Netherlands and Estonia. It
derives from this that the Tribunal was never presented with a valid arbitration agreement. It
further explains that the constitution of the Tribunal predates the Achmea Judgment has no
impact on this conclusion since the CJEU did specify any temporal limitation to the
incompatibility of intra-EU investment arbitration clauses and EU law.

Last but not least, the EU Majority Declaration confirms, according to Respondent, that an
award upholding the Tribunal’s jurisdiction would be unenforceable. The Tribunal is not
convinced by the relevance of such an argument, a will be developed below.

11) Claimants Comments’ on the EU Majority Declaration®"'

Claimants submit that “[t]he Tribunal should base its decision on legal analysis and the rule of
law, not on retroactive political statements made by the majority of EU Member States.”51
Claimants invite the Tribunal to consider the EU Majority Declaration into its European political
context:

As the Tribunal will be aware, the [European] Commission has, for
many years, pursued a policy agenda favouring the removal of intra-
EU BITs. However, up until the decision in Achmea, it has been
unsuccessful in obtaining the support of EU member States. The
Majority Declaration (and the declarations issued by the other
Member States) represent a turning point in this process, with all EU
Member States now agreeing to terminate the intra-EU BITs.5'
[Footnote omitted]

Claimants points out that, the Member States merely undertake to “inform” investment arbitral
tribunals and the investor community of their interpretation of the Achmea Judgment, which
denotes that the Member States had no intention of binding these tribunals."

Moreover, Claimants do not agree with the statements in the EU Majority Declaration to the
effect that there was never a valid arbitration clause. To the contrary, they argue that “Estonia's
offer to arbitrate in the Netherlands-Estonia BIT was valid at the time it was accepted by the
investor.”®'5 But even if Estonia offer to arbitrate is considered invalid under EU law by virtue
of the Achmea Judgment, this indeed does not imply that this offer would be invalid under the
ICSID Convention and the BIT.

Finally, Claimants also criticise the EU Majority Declaration for introducing a discrimination
between ongoing arbitral proceedings, which would ought to be terminated, and “arbitral
awards in intra-EU investment arbitration cases that can no longer be annulled or set aside
and were voluntarily complied with or definitely enforced before the Achmea Judgment, [which]
should not be challenged.”5"6

Claimants’ conclusion is straightforward: “The approach advocated in the Majority Declaration
is contrary to the Rule of law, and should not be accepted by this Tribunal.”5"7

12) Analysis of the Tribunal: the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction and the Irrelevance of
the Achmea Judgment

Although the Tribunal has made a number of comments in its review of the Parties’
submissions, above, it considers it appropriate to wrap up its analysis, which it does here.

While EU law forms part of both Dutch and Estonian law and is relevant to public international
law, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal arises from and is founded on the BIT and the ICSID
Convention, as well as on the Parties’ consent as required by these instruments. As a result,
the question of jurisdiction is properly to be approached by analysing those agreements and
the relevant facts from a public international law perspective.

It is useful to recapitulate the applicable rules of international law dealing with the invalidation,
termination and suspension of the operation of treaties as embodied in the VCLT.

Art. 59(1) VCLT addresses those situations where a treaty is implicitly terminated or
suspended. It reads:

Article 59. Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty
implied by conclusion of a later treaty

1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it
conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject-matter and:

(a) It appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the
parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or

(b) The provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those
of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied
at the same time.

Thus, three (3) conditions must be met for Art. 59 VCLT to apply: (1) identity of the parties to
the treaties in question, (2) identity of “subject-matter” of those treaties, and (3) an
incompatibility so great that the treaties cannot be applied concurrently.

Art. 65 VCLT concerns the procedure to be followed with respect to, inter alia, the termination
or suspension of a treaty:

516 Claimants’ Comments on the EU Majority Declaration, 23.

517 Claimants’ Comments on the EU Majority Declaration, 24.

113

Article 65. Procedure to be followed with respect to invalidity,
termination, withdrawal from or suspension of the operation of a Treaty

(1) A party which, under the provisions of the present Convention,
invokes either a defect in its consent to be bound by a treaty or a
ground for impeaching the validity of a treaty, terminating it,
withdrawing from it or suspending its operation, must notify the
other parties of its claim. The notification shall indicate the measure
proposed to be taken with respect to the treaty and the reasons
therefor.

(2) If, after the expiry of a period which, except in cases of special
urgency, shall not be less than three months after the receipt of the
notification, no party has raised any objection, the party making the
notification may carry out in the manner provided in article 67 the
measure which it has proposed.

(3) If, however, objection has been raised by any other party, the
parties shall seek a solution through the means indicated in Article
33 of the Charter of the United Nations.

537. Art. 30 VCLT addresses the application of successive treaties having the same subject-matter
but which are not incompatible as a whole:

Article 30. Application of successive treaties relating to the same
subject matter

(1) Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the
rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties
relating to the same subject-matter shall be determined in
accordance with the following paragraphs.

(2) When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be
considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the
provisions of that other treaty prevail.

(3) When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later
treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in
operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the
extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later
treaty.

(4) When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to
the earlier one:

(a) As between a State party to both treaties the same rule applies
as in paragraph 3;

(b) As between States parties to both treaties and a state party to

only one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties
governs their mutual rights and obligations. [Emphasis added]

114

539.

541.

The Tribunal’s analysis is based on these rules. Nothing argued by Estonia in this case
persuades the Tribunal to adopt a different approach, or to reach a different conclusion than
that arrived at by other investment arbitration tribunals, discussed below. As in those cases,
the Tribunal finds that it cannot be said that Art. 9 of the Treaty (let alone the Treaty as a whole)
is incompatible with the TFEU or EU law or has become inoperative. Moreover, absent the
triggering of the termination process laid out at Art. 65 VCLT, it cannot be contended that the
BIT terminated upon the accession of Estonia to the EU.

Furthermore, as hinted above and after due deliberation, the Tribunal respectfully considers
that the CJEU’s analysis rests on a different foundation, and so proceeds from a different
premise than that which is applicable here. The arguments made by Estonia and the reasoning
of the CJEU in the Achmea Judgment all assume that the issue must be considered through,
and only through, the lens of EU law. Yet, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal considers
that the question before it must be approached from a public international law perspective.

The Tribunal also considers that it is not authoritatively bound by the Achmea Judgment,
notwithstanding that the decision may form part of public international law. First, unlike the BIT
interpreted by the CJEU, the Treaty on the basis of which Claimants instituted these
proceedings does not refer to the domestic law of the Parties.5'® Second, the Achmea
Judgment does not comment on the impact of instituting arbitral proceedings under the ICSID
Convention. Third, the Tribunal is not convinced that Art. 19 TEU provides exclusive authority
to the CJEU on the issue at play. Rather, in the Tribunal’s view Art. 19 TEU arguably applies
only to the extent that the interpretation and the application of the EU Treaties are required.
This is not, however, the case in the matter at hand.

Lastly, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Estonia's argument concerning the potential difficulties
of enforcement. Not only does the present award not require interpreting and/or applying EU
law, more importantly, the prospect of potential difficulties enforcing an arbitral award should
not prevent a tribunal from assuming rightful jurisdiction over a dispute.5'? The Tribunal is of
course aware that it is preferable to render an award that will be easily enforceable. But it does
not agree with the proposition that it is limited in its jurisdiction if potential issues exist that
might arise at the enforcement stage. For example, ICSID tribunals routinely make awards
against States, although Art. 55 of the ICSID Convention warns that “[nJothing in Article 54
[relating to enforcement of an ICSID award] shall be construed as derogating from the law in
force in any Contracting State relating to immunity of that State or of any foreign State from
execution.” This Tribunal’s jurisdiction is not determined by national rules governing the
enforceability of arbitral awards, but by the Treaty, the ICSID Convention and international law.
It will be up to the courts at the enforcement stage, if called upon, to draw the necessary

518 RL-251, Achmea Judgment, supra note 17, 4, quoting Art. 8(6) of the Slovakia-Czech Republic-
Netherlands BIT: “The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular
though not exclusively: - the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned; - the provisions of this
Agreement, and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties; - the provisions of special
agreements relating to the investment; the general principles of international.” [Emphasis added]

513 In addition, as noted in a commentary filed by Respondent, most awards are voluntarily executed:

International (2003), p 310.

consequences from the Achmea judgment and their national laws with respect to the
enforceability of this Award.

The only remaining question is whether, pursuant to Art. 30 VCLT, Art. 9 of the BIT can operate
notwithstanding the accession of Estonia to the EU.

In applying Art. 30 VCLT, it must first be determined whether the TFEU and the BIT share the
“same subject-matter.” For the same reasons as discussed in Oostergetel v Slovakia, the
Tribunal finds that the two do not concern the same subject-matter or address the same rights
and obligations, primarily because the TFEU does not provide any mechanism for adjudicating
disputes between EU Member States and private investors.

In any event, the Tribunal further agrees with Claimants that no incompatibility arises as
between Art. 9 of the BIT and the TFEU.

Regarding the alleged incompatibility of the BIT with Art. 267 and 344 TFEU, the Tribunal
adopts as its own the reasoning developed by the tribunal in Electrabel v Hungary: no rule of
EU law explicitly or implicitly forbids the application of the arbitral mechanism set out in the
Treaty and the ICSID Convention. Such a mechanism does not interfere with the jurisdiction
of the CJEU and is not incompatible with the TFEU.

Regarding the alleged incompatibility of the BIT with Art. 18 TFEU, the Tribunal is not
convinced that, as a matter of public international law, potential discrepancies as between the
protections offered to the nationals of different EU State Members amounts to an
incompatibility between the two (2) regimes. As submitted by Claimants, the BIT does not
preclude nationals of other EU State Members being granted the same rights, and, by the
same token, the BIT may be applied concurrently with the TFEU.

The Tribunal is comforted in its conclusions by decisions of other investment arbitral tribunals,
which arrived at the same findings.

The issue of the compatibility of intra-EU BITs and EU law has indeed been discussed by
several arbitral tribunals. Their most salient findings are canvassed below.

In Achmea v Slovakia, after noting that it does not derive its authority from EU law,%° the
tribunal proceeded by first deciding whether the BIT under consideration was terminated or
otherwise incompatible with the EU Treaties by application of Art. 59 or 30 VCLT. It then
addressed the issue of whether or not the BIT was inapplicable under EU law. In proceeding
to its analysis, the tribunal discussed the respective scope of application of Art. 59 and 30
VCLT as follows:

239. The second main reason for dismissing this objection to
jurisdiction is that the application of VCLT Article 59 is expressly limited
to situations where there are successive treaties “relating to the same
subject-matter” (see Article 59(1) cited above). The same phrase
appears in VCLT Article 30 in a different context; but while the notion

520 RL-123, Achmea B.V. v. The Slovak Republic, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2008-13 (formerly Eureko
B.V. v. The Slovak Republic), Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension (26 October 2010), 4225
[Achmea v Slovakia].

552.

of “sameness” may be common to those two instances, the manner in
which the overlap between the treaties is approached is manifestly not
common. This is evident from the roles accorded by the VCLT to
Articles 30 and 59.

240. Article 59 is concerned only with the termination of the entire
treaty. Article 30, in contrast, is concerned with the priority between
particular provisions of earlier and later treaties relating to the same
subject-matter. While Article 30 is, therefore, focused on particular
provisions, the question under Article 59 is whether the entire treaty
should be terminated by reason of the adoption of a later treaty relating
to the same subject-matter. The very fact that these situations are
treated separately in the VCLT points to the need under Article 59 for
a broader overlap between the earlier and later treaties than would be
needed to trigger the application of Article 30.

241. This conclusion is borne out by a comparison of the terms of
Article 30 and Article 59. Under Article 30 the test is whether the two
successive treaty provisions are “compatible.” Under Article 59 the test
is whether the provisions of the later treaty are “so far incompatible with
those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being
applied at the same time.” Article 30 may be triggered by the slightest
incompatibility between the provisions of the earlier and later treaties.
Article 59 clearly requires a broader incompatibility between the two
treaties. [Emphasis added and omitted; Footnotes omitted]

 

The tribunal concluded that the two (2) provisions do not address the same type of overlap
and, as such, the corresponding incompatibility required to trigger their application cannot be
the same." Art. 30 VCLT applies where Art. 59 does not, i.e., where the provisions of
successive are not such that the two (2) treaties as a whole are not capable of being applied
at the same time.

Moreover, although Art. 59 VCLT speaks of termination or suspension of the operation of a
treaty implied by the conclusion of a later instrument, the tribunal in Achmea v Slovakia found,
and the point is restated here by Claimants,°*? that Art. 59 VCLT does not provide for the
automatic termination of treaties, but rather describes the circumstances in which termination
can be invoked “according to the Art. 65 procedure.” The Tribunal agrees with this analysis.

In Eastern Sugar v The Czech Republic, a SCC tribunal analysed the issue exclusively
pursuant to Art. 59 and 30 VCLT, implicitly excluding the possibility that EU law, on its own,
could have the effect of rendering a BIT inoperable. The tribunal concluded that the BIT regime
significantly differs from TFEU framework and that they do not cover the same subject-
matter:525

521 On this point, see also RL-233, Mark E. Villiger, Commentary on the 1969 Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties, BRILL (2009), pp 725-726.

[Estern Sugar v The Czech Republic].

117

159. First, the Arbitral Tribunal does not accept the Czech Republic’s
argument that the EU treaty as the later treaty (as between the Czech
Republic and the Netherlands) covers the same subject matter as the
BIT, the earlier treaty.

 

160. While it is true that European Union law deals with intra-EU cross-
border investment, say between the Netherlands and the Czech
Republic, as does the BIT, the two regulations do not cover the same
precise subject-matter.

161. The European Union guarantees the free movement of capital.
Thus, it guarantees to non-Czech investors from other EU member
countries the right to invest in the Czech Republic on a par with any
Czech investor.

162. The precedents cited by the Czech Republic concern
impediments to the free movement of capital such as cases where one
EU Member country — France — retained a “golden share” which allows
the host state to assume, when it suits it, control over the company,
thereby making it unattractive for investors from fellow EU Countries to
invest in such companies in the host state.

163. Similarly, the European Union guarantees the free movement of
capital outwards, thus, the investor may take out profits and even the
investment as such out of the host country.

164. By contrast, the BIT provides for fair and equitable treatment of
the investor during the investor's investment in the host country,
prohibits expropriation, and guarantees full protection and security and
the like. The BIT also provides for a special procedural protection in
the form of arbitration between the investor state and the host state
and, especially arbitration of a “mixed” or “diagonal” type between the
investor and the host state, as in the present case.

165. From the point of view of the promotion and_protection of
investments, the arbitration clause is in practice the most essential
provision of Bilateral Investment Treaties. Whereas general principles
such as fair and equitable treatment or full security and protection of
the investment are found in many international, regional or national
legal systems, the investor's right arising from the BIT’s dispute
settlement_clause_to address an_ international arbitral tribunal
independent from the host state is the best guarantee that_the
investment will be protected against potential undue infringements by
the host state. EU law does not provide such a guarantee. [Emphasis
added and omitted]

 

In addition, the tribunal rejected the Czech Republic’s argument, similar to the position
advocated by Estonia, that the BIT discriminates as between the citizens of different EU
Member States. According to the tribunal, that some nationals of the EU could benefit from
some protections unavailable to others does not render the BIT incompatible with EU law:

If the EU Treaty gives more rights than does the BIT, then all EU
parties, including the Netherlands and Dutch investors, may claim

118

those rights. If the BIT gives rights to the Netherlands and to Dutch
investors that it does not give other EU countries and investors, it will
be for those other countries and investors to claim their equal rights.
But the fact that these rights are unequal does not make them
incompatible.6*4 [Emphasis omitted]

554. The tribunal in Oostergetel v Slovakia reached a similar conclusion.5* The tribunal first
recalled that to be considered as relating to the “same subject matter,” two (2) treaties must
bear the same overall objective and “share a degree of general compatibility." With regards
to the BIT at hand, it concluded that the treaty did not have the same subject-matter as the
Treaty establishing the European Community (the “EC Treaty”), noting that the EC Treaty
offers no investor-State dispute mechanism:

As to the first condition, the Tribunal agrees with the argument
advanced by the Claimants that the EC Treaty’s objective to create a
common market between all EU Member States is different from the
objectives of a BIT, which provides for specific guarantees for the
investor's investment in the host country pursuant to a bilateral
agreement made between two countries (Tr. J., pp. 16-17). The EC
Treaty provisions on the fundamental freedoms are aimed at all types
of cross-border economic activity. The BIT, on the other hand, is mostly
concerned with providing a set of guarantees for protection of a long-
term investment in the host state.

Furthermore, it is at least questionable whether the substantive
protection afforded to the foreign investor under the BIT is indeed
comparable to the safeguards found under the EC Treaty. In other
words, irrespective of a certain degree of overlap between the two
regimes in terms of substantive provisions applicable to any potential
investment disputes, this Tribunal is not convinced that the safeguards
offered by the two are identical.

Without going into further detail in determining the exact differences
between the substantive safeguards provided to foreign investors
under the two regimes, there is at least one fundamental distinction
between the two, which renders them incomparable: the EC Treaty
provides no equivalent to one of, if not the most important feature of
the BIT regime, namely, the dispute settlement mechanism providing
for investor-State arbitration.**” [Emphasis omitted; Footnote omitted]

Finally, the award on jurisdiction in Electrabel v Hungary,°*° which rejected the argument that
the Energy Charter Treaty (the “ECT”) is incompatible with EU law, also provides helpful
assistance.

The Electrabel tribunal first found that EU law “has a multiple nature: on the one hand, it is an
international legal regime; but on the other hand, once introduced in the national legal orders
of EU Member States, it becomes also part of these national legal orders,” and that in its
international law dimension, “there is no fundamental difference in nature between
international law and EU law.”©2° It further dismissed the contention that Art. 234 TFEU
excludes mixed dispute settlements arrangements, such as investor-State arbitration. A better
view of EU law, the tribunal found, is that the TFEU forbids recourse to arbitration as between
EU Members States.5°° According to the tribunal, no rule of EU law prevents, “expressly or
impliedly,” recourse to arbitration between a national of an EU Member State and another EU
Member State; should EU Members State have intended otherwise, the absence of a clear
provision to this effect would amount to “an extraordinary omission.”©*' The tribunal thus
summarised:

4.175. First, it is necessary to note again that the EU law is not
incompatible with the provision for investor-state arbitration contained
in Part V of the ECT, including international arbitration under the ICSID
Convention. The two legal orders can be applied together as regards
the Parties’ arbitration agreement and this arbitration, because only the
ECT deals with investor-state arbitration; and nothing in EU law can be
interpreted as precluding investor-state arbitration under the ECT and
the ICSID Convention.

 

 

4.176. As regards the substantive protections in Part III of the ECT, the
Tribunal does not consider that the ECT and EU law share the same
subject-matter; and, accordingly, it considers that Article 16 ECT is
inapplicable.°%? [Emphasis added]

The tribunal also noted that an objection under Art. 351 TFEU, such as articulated by Estonia
here, and an objection based on Art. 30(3) VCLT have the same consequences.**?

The Tribunal cannot end without noting one particular aspect of the EU majority Declaration
which in fact would seem to support the Tribunal’s own conclusion. The Declaration states:

Member States will make best efforts to deposit their instrument of
ratification, approval or acceptance [...] of any bilateral treaty

later than 6 December 2019.5°4

This necessarily implies, in the Tribunal’s view, that the BIT remains in force and that its Article
9 can therefore constitute a valid offer to arbitrate, which Claimants accepted.

The unavoidable consequence is that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the case. The
objection based on the incompatibility of the BIT with EU law is rejected.

LIABILITY
Claimants’ claims may be divided into three (3) categories:

(i) A breach of the FET standard by Estonia consisting in the violation by Respondent of
Claimants’ legitimate expectations arising out of the privatisation of ASTV;

(ii) Other breaches by Respondent of the FET standard and due process as well as the
taking of discriminatory measures against Claimants;

(iii) Breaches of the umbrella clause contained in the Treaty.
These alleged breaches of the Treaty are assessed below.
A) CLAIM OF BREACH OF FET BASED ON LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS

Claimants’ first claim consists in the alleged breach by Estonia of the FET standard, primarily
through the violation of Claimants’ legitimate expectations related to the privatisation of
ASTV.55 Claimants divide the analysis of this claim into two (2) distinct periods: (1) their
expectations at the time of the privatisation (i.e. in 2001) and (2) their expectations as of 2009
(i.e. at the beginning of the process by which Respondent allegedly breached these
expectations).

Regarding the first period, Claimants explain in their post-hearing submissions that:

[their] key legitimate expectation at the time of the privatisation was
that, if UUTBV made the investments agreed in the privatisation and
through its management of ASTV achieved the ambitious quality and
service level improvements required by the privatisation, the contracts
entered into as a result of the privatisation would be respected, with
tariffs set by reference to the tariff methodology in the Services
Agreement for its full 15 year term.

534 RL-276, EU Majority Declaration, supra note 508, 48.

535 In their post-hearing submissions (3), Claimants assert that “not only has Estonia acted in breach of
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations, the way in it has done so — and its treatment of UUTBV and ASTV
since 2009 — has not been fair and equitable.” It is unclear what precisely this means. In any event, the
Tribunal does not understand that Claimants intend to introduce a new or different claim from those
previously asserted.

536 C|. PHB, 418.

121

565.

566.

567.

They identify four constituent elements of this expectation, as follows:

a. that the contracts entered into by the City of Tallinn with the
Government's knowledge on 12 January 2001, in reliance on which
UUTBV invested €85 million in ASTV, would be respected;

b. in the five-year Initial Period, that ASTV’s tariffs would be set by
reference to the specific K factors bid by UUTBV and incorporated into
the Services Agreement;

c. that in setting the K factors for subsequent Operating Periods any
consideration of justified profitability would be by reference to the tariff
methodology in the Services Agreement and the Business Plan
submitted at the time of UUTBV’s bid, not on the basis of a clean slate
which took no account of the Services Agreement, the privatisation, or
the €85 million investment UUTBV made on the basis of them; and

d. the key principles of the regulatory framework applicable to ASTV,
as set out in the Services Agreement, would not be radically overturned
during its term. In spite of the absence of an express stabilisation
clause in the Services Agreement, the Claimants could legitimately
expect that the fundamental basis of the tariff methodology envisaged
in the Services Agreement would be maintained and would not be
unreasonably and arbitrarily undone during the term of that agreement.
This is so regardless of the existence of certain provisions in the
Services Agreement relating to future regulatory change.**” [Footnotes
omitted]

Claimants have confirmed that these expectations do not turn on a pre-defined level of
profitability®** but relate instead to the overall framework governing the parties’ conduct as set
out in the privatisation agreements. This framework, they say, gives rise to legitimate
expectations as recognized in international investment law in the light of the overall context,
purpose and circumstances of the privatisation. Claimants nonetheless acknowledge that they
do not benefit from a stabilisation clause or any other explicit assurance as to the stability of
the legal and regulatory framework governing their investment. To the contrary, they recognise
that the privatisation agreements clearly anticipated certain regulatory changes.*°°

According to Claimants, and as indicated above, Respondent breached their legitimate
expectations by its conduct primarily in relation to the rejection of ASTV’s 2011 Tariff
Application and the adoption of the Prescription.

587 Cl. PHB, 497.
538 Claimants have confirmed that they were not entitled to a guaranteed return or any guaranteed tariffs,
Cl. PHB, 9117-121.

589 See for instance Cl. PHB, 419, where Claimants recognise that the Services Agreement anticipated
some regulatory changes, and 949-51, where Claimants argue that the lack of a stabilisation agreement
does not undermine their claim.

122

568. Respondent challenges the notion that Claimants could have formed any expectation
protected under international law in the circumstances. According to Estonia, Claimants fail to
demonstrate any specific assurances by the host State, most notably because it was not
reasonable for them to expect that ASTV’s tariffs would be insulated from the law, its changes
and its enforcement, and because, in any event, the privatisation agreements did not provide
for an expected range of profitability.5“°

569. The Tribunal will first review the relevant authorities pertaining to the protection of legitimate
expectations in international investment law (1). It will next assess whether Claimants have
demonstrated, on the facts, that they formed any legitimate expectations at the time of the
privatisation (2) and then will assess the impact, if any, of events after the privatisation (3).
The Tribunal will then determine whether Respondent's conduct breached Claimants’
legitimate expectations, in violation of the BIT and customary international law (4).

1) A General Approach to FET

570. Any claim related to the FET standard, including a claim for breach of legitimate expectations,
must find its source in Art. 3(1) of the Treaty:

Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the
investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not
impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation,
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by
those nationals. [Emphasis added]

571. The parties to the Treaty specified in its preamble that the FET standard “is desirable” but
refrained from defining it. Guidance may however be obtained from the many tribunals which
have elaborated upon the nature and the breadth of the FET standard.

572. The need to distinguish between the FET standard and other more specific international
wrongs is clearly acknowledged by the case law. For instance in PSGE v Turkey it was held
that:

Because the role of fair and equitable treatment changes from case to
case, it is sometimes not as precise as would be desirable. Yet, it
clearly does allow for justice to be done in the absence of the more
traditional breaches of international law standards. This role has
resulted in the concept of fair and equitable treatment acquiring a
standing on its own, separate and distinct from that of other standards,
albeit many times closely related to them, and thus ensuring that the
protection granted to the investment is fully safeguarded.5“' [Emphasis
added]

573. An often-relied general statement of the content of FET is the one made by the Tribunal in
Waste Management.

[T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is
infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the
claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or
idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional
or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an
outcome which offends judicial propriety—as might be the case with a
manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete
lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In
applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of
representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied
on by the claimant.5“? [Emphasis omitted]

574. This is not to stay, however, that the protection afforded to investors under this standard finds
its source in investors’ expectations. The protection derives from the terms of the applicable
treaty; the expectations of an investor do not constitute a standalone source of obligations for
the host State.545 Although the investor's expectations will be at the heart of the analysis, they
are not to be assessed on a purely subjective basis, nor without due consideration of the
State’s sovereign right to regulate:

[Llegitimate expectations cannot be solely the subjective expectations
of the investor, but have to correspond to the objective expectations
than [sic] can be deduced from the circumstances and with due regard
to the rights of the State. In other words, a balance should be
established between the legitimate expectation of the foreign investor
to make a fair return on its investment and the right of the host State to
regulate its economy in the public interest.5

575. Absent an express commitment to that effect by the host State, it is not reasonable for an
investor to expect that its investment will enjoy a static legislative and regulatory regime;
foreign investors must anticipate changes and adapt accordingly:

332. It is each State’s undeniable right and privilege to exercise its
sovereign legislative power. A State has the right to enact, modify or
cancel a law at its own discretion. Save for the existence of an
agreement, in the form of a stabilisation clause or otherwise, there is
nothing objectionable about the amendment brought to the regulatory
framework existing at the time an investor made its investment. As a
matter of fact, any businessman or investor knows that laws will evolve

No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award (30 April 2004) [Waste Management v Mexico], 98.

Award (31 October 2011), 358 [E/ Paso v Argentina]. Similarly, a tribunal may conclude to a breach of the
FET even if there is no evidence of the State’s subjective bad faith (357). See also Electrabel, where the
tribunal explained: “Consequently, the requirement of fairness must not be understood as the immutability
of the legal framework, but as implying that subsequent changes should be made fairly, consistently and
predictably, taking into account the circumstances of the investment,” RL-124, Electrabel SA. v Republic of
Hungary, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Award (30 November 2012), 7.77 [Electrabel (Award)].

over time. What is prohibited however is for a State to_act_unfairly.
unreasonably or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative power.

 

333. In principle, an investor has a right to a certain stability and
predictability of the legal environment of the investment. The investor
will have a right of protection of its legitimate expectations provided it
exercised due diligence and that its legitimate expectations were
reasonable in light of the circumstances. Consequently, an investor
must_anticipate_that_the circumstances could change, and thus
structure its investment in order to adapt it to the potential changes of
legal environment.®° [Emphasis added and omitted]

576. The Tribunal nonetheless recognises, as noted in Parkerings, inter alia, that legitimate
expectations do not arise solely from explicit promises by the State. The State may also have
made implicit assurances or representations reasonably relied on by the investor, and the
circumstances surrounding the conclusion of an investment may be decisive to determine if
the expectation of the investor was legitimate.**° Yet, these statements cannot be applied so
broadly as to relieve foreign investors from their burden of both articulating precise
expectations and establishing that they are objectively reasonable.54”

577. Indeed, the precise delineation of an investor's expectations and their origin(s) in the
circumstances of a given case is essential to any claim. As stated by the tribunal in E/ Paso v
Argentina:

375. A reasonable general regulation can be considered a violation of
the FET standard if it violates a specific commitment towards the
investor. The Tribunal considers that a special commitment by the
State towards an investor provides the latter with a certain protection

(11 September 2007) [Parkerings], 9331-333. See also RL-155, EDF (Services) Limited v Romania, |CSID
Case No. ARB/05/13, Award (8 October 2009), 4217 and 218. See also RL-144, Saluka Investments B.V.
v The Czech Republic, UNCITRAL, Partial Award (17 March 2006), §§305-307 [Saluka v Czech Republic]:
“No investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made
remain totally unchanged. In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign investor's expectations
was justified and reasonable, the host State’s legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in
the public interest must be taken into consideration as well.”

546 RL-157, Parkerings, ibid, ]331: “The expectation is legitimate if the investor received an explicit promise
or guaranty from the host-State, or if implicitly, the host-State made assurances or representation that the
investor took into account in making the investment. Finally, in the situation where the host-State made no
assurance or representation, the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the agreement are decisive
to determine if the expectation of the investor was legitimate. In order to determine the legitimate
expectation of an investor, it is also necessary to analyse the conduct of the State at the time of the
investment.” [Footnotes omitted]. In the same vein, the tribunal in E/ectrabe/ noted that specific assurances
may not be indispensable to prove a breach of legitimate expectations, although such assurances have
undoubtedly great bearing, RL-124, Electrabel (Award), supra note 544, 97.78: “While specific assurances
given by the host State may reinforce the investor's expectations, such an assurance is not always
indispensable [...] Specific assurances will simply make a difference in the assessment of the investor's
knowledge and of the reasonability and legitimacy of its expectations.”

547 See RL-124, Electrabel (Award), supra note 544, 9155: “Even in the absence of a specific
representation, however, the investor must establish a relevant expectation based upon reasonable
grounds, which Electrabel has failed to do so.”

against changes in the legislation, but it needs to discuss more
thoroughly the concept of “specific commitments.” In the Tribunal’s
view, no general definition of what constitutes a specific commitment
can be given, as all depends on the circumstances. However, it seems
that two types of commitments might be considered “specific”: those
specific as to their addressee and those specific regarding their object
and purpose.

 

376. First, in order to prevent a change in regulations being applied to
an investor or certain behaviour of the State, there can indeed exist
specific commitments directly made to the investor — for example in a
contract or in a letter of intent, or even through a specific promise in a
person-to-person business meeting — and not simply general
statements in treaties or legislation which, because of their nature of
general regulations, can evolve. The important aspect _of the
commitment is not so much that it is legally binding — which usually
gives rise to some sort of responsibility if it is violated without a need
to refer to FET — but that it contains a specific commitment directly
made to the investor, on which the latter has relied.

377. Second, a commitment can be considered specific if its precise
object was to give a real quarantee of stability to the investor. Usually
general texts cannot contain such commitments, as there is no
guarantee that they will not be modified in due course. However, a
reiteration of the same type of commitment in different types of general
statements could, considering the circumstances, amount to a specific
behaviour of the State, the object and purpose of which is to give the
investor a guarantee on which it can justifiably rely.54® [Emphasis
added and omitted]

As a result, should an investor fail to demonstrate sufficient specificity with respect to the
commitment on which it relies, the FET standard would subject States to the impossible task
of meeting constantly moving targets.5#°

The assessment of alleged legitimate expectations thus requires balancing these expectations
against the State’s legitimate regulatory interest.°°° As put by the tribunal in E/ Paso v
Argentina:

[...] FET is linked to the objective reasonable legitimate expectations
of the investors and that these have to be evaluated considering all
circumstances. As a consequence, the legitimate expectations of a
foreign investor can only be examined by having due regard to the
general proposition that the State should not unreasonably modify the

548 RL-145, E/ Paso v Argentina, supra note 544, (9375-377.

548 |t is noted that the tribunal in Arif v Moldova arrived at a similar conclusion. See Franck Charles Arif v
Republic of Modolva, \CSID Case No. ARB/11/23, Award (8 April 2013), 99534 and 535 [Arif v Moldova].

legal framework or modify it in contradiction with a specific commitment
not to do so [...].5°' [Emphasis omitted]

Furthermore, in assessing objectively ASTV’s and UUTBV’s alleged expectations, the Tribunal
must have due regard not only to the context of the investment but also to the relevant socio-
economic and historical background.®5?

2) The Distincti Ci Ci i its and L
Expectations

In addition to the factors noted above, the present case requires a consideration of the
relationship between purely contractual rights that do not on their own entail a guarantee of
stability of the regulatory regime, and the formation of legitimate expectations. °°

Although Respondent does not expressly deny that contractual rights may inform the analysis
of a FET claim, the parties diverge as to how and when contractual entitlements (alone or
coupled with other factual elements) give rise to legitimate expectations.

Claimants argue that legitimate expectations may rest on a contractual relationship, and that
contractual arrangements may inform the analysis of a FET claim.°©* They further posit that
neither an express stabilisation clause nor an explicit undertaking of legal stability by the State
is essential to obtain redress.°°> Claimants draw a distinction between “pure” contractual
breaches, which would not attract international liability, and cases where the existence and
breach of an investor's legitimate expectations arise from a broader factual matrix, such as the
case at hand. According to them, only a sovereign acting qua sovereign, and not as a
commercial party, could have performed the actions (including the amendment of PWSSA’'s
provisions on justified profitability, the change of regulator and the decisions adopted by the
new regulator) which comprise the basis of Claimants’ treaty claims, thereby removing this
case from any purely commercial setting.5°°

Respondent takes the position that contractual rights per se cannot give rise to legitimate
expectations; should this be otherwise, umbrella clauses would be redundant.55” Absent a
stabilisation clause, Respondent submits that an investor must identify a precise and clear
representation by the State, in the form of statements or conduct, concerning the stability of

the regulatory system. “Implicit assurances,” unless sufficiently specific, cannot ground a FET
claim.558

585. The Parkerings v Lithuania tribunal made a clear distinction between contractual obligations
and expectations and legitimate expectations under international law:

It is evident that not every hope amounts to an expectation under
international law. The expectation a party to an agreement may have
of the regular fulfilment of the obligation by the other party is not
necessarily an expectation protected by international law. In other
words, contracts involve intrinsic expectations from each party that do
not amount to expectations as understood in international law. Indeed,
the party whose contractual expectations are frustrated should, under
specific conditions, seek redress before a national tribunal.5°°
[Emphasis added and omitted]

586. The same position was adopted in Hamester.

It is important to emphasise that the existence of legitimate
expectations and the existence of contractual rights are two separate
issues. This has been highlighted by the Parkerings v. Lithuania
tribunal [...]

Christoph Schreuer also explains that contractual rights are not to be
equated with legitimate expectations:

“Taken to its logical conclusion this argument would put all agreements
between the investor and the host State under the protection of the
FET standard. If this position were to be accepted, the FET standard
would be nothing less than a broadly interpreted umbrella clause.”

The Tribunal fully endorses this comment, and concludes that it is not
sufficient for a claimant to invoke contractual rights that have allegedly
been infringed to sustain a claim for a violation of the FET standard.
[Emphasis added; Footnotes omitted]

587. In other words, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that, should “every contractual right
amounted to a legitimate expectation protected under international law, umbrella clauses
would be completely redundant.”

3) A Necessary Balance between the Investor's Expectations and the State’s
Right to Regulate

In the Tribunal’s opinion, contractual undertakings may indeed inform the existence of
legitimate expectations, depending on the circumstances, including most notably the
assurances contained in the contract, the other terms of the relevant agreement and the
context in which the contract is executed. This said, absent other circumstances, the mere
expectation that a contractual commitment will be respected and performed cannot suffice to
establish a breach of the FET standard. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that, should this
be otherwise, “umbrella clauses would be redundant.” As the tribunal in Toto v Lebanon
acknowledged, contractual commitments may in appropriate circumstances give rise to
legitimate expectations and entitle an investor to presume that the “overall legal framework will
remain stable.” Yet, for that to be the case, some manner of conduct by the State is required;5°
and, where a FET claim is grounded on contractual rights, a higher threshold must be met.5®

The Tribunal notes the appeal of contrasting the conduct of a so-called “regular contractual
partner” from conduct that could not have been committed in a purely contractual relationship
(such as Claimants endeavour to do when they insist that Respondent's acts were that of a
sovereign, not a commercial party).5°4 However, as aptly noted by Schreuer, seemingly simple
tests rarely offer conclusive responses: “the distinction between sovereign and commercial
acts, which is accepted in the field of state immunity, is of unclear validity in the area of state
responsibility. Also, even if the underlying relationship and the breach are clearly commercial,
the motives of a government for a certain act may still be governmental.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the typology of FET cases developed by the authors McLachlan, Shore
and Weiniger provides an arguably useful (though in no way determinative) description of how
tribunals seek to balance investors’ desire for stability and States’ right to amend their laws
and regulations:

In striking a balance between stability and flexibility in the regulatory
regime, tribunals have typically required the presence of one of the
following three elements in finding a breach of the treaty standard:

(a) A specific assurance or promise of a competent organ
attributable to the State upon which the investor reasonably
relied in deciding to invest;

(b) Regulations that are substantively arbitrary or discriminatory
in their application to foreign investors; or

591.

592.

593.

594.

(c) A total alteration of the entire regulatory framework for
foreign investments in the particular field that has the effect
of virtually eliminating the benefits that the investor
reasonably anticipated upon making the investment.5°
[Emphasis added]

The second category of cases referred to above would seem to capture Claimants’ allegations
of violation of the FET standard pertaining to discrimination and violation of due process,
addressed below at paragraphs 867 and following.

As to the first scenario, and as stated above at paragraph 566, Claimants recognise, at least
implicitly, that they do not benefit from any explicit promise as to the stability of the regulatory
regime. Rather, as appears from the excerpt above at paragraph 565, their legitimate
expectation case revolves around the enforcement of the privatisation contracts or, at
minimum, on the application of the key principles of the regulatory framework which they say
were contemplated in those agreements. They describe their expectations in this regard as
being that “the key principles of the regulatory framework applicable to ASTV, as set out in the
Services Agreement, would not be radically overturned during its term.”5°” Therefore, in the
Tribunal’s opinion, if made out, Claimants’ FET case most likely falls within the third category
of cases identified by McLachlan et al.

In this respect, the authors explain that “tribunals have found a breach of the standard on the
ground that the cumulative effect of the State’s regulatory changes has been to alter
completely the regulatory framework in a manner that virtually eliminates the investor's
reasonably expected benefits.”5°* Indeed, in the three (3) cases they study, which were all
commented on by the Parties here, the tribunals did not treat specific commitments by an
organ of the State as a sine qua non. These tribunals rather emphasised the investor's reliance
on the regulatory regime in place at the time of the investment, and focused on the total
structural changes to the original regime and the extreme economic consequences of such
changes on the investor.

First, in E/ Paso v Argentina, the tribunal expressed the view that a State may be found to have
infringed the FET standard where it totally alters the legal framework applicable to an
investment, and this, even in the absence of a stability clause or a similar specific commitment:

In other words, fair and equitable treatment is a standard entailing
reasonableness and proportionality. It ensures basically that the
foreign investor is not unjustly treated, with due regard to all
surrounding circumstances. FET is a means to guarantee justice to
foreign investors.

There can be no legitimate expectation for anyone that the legal
framework will remain unchanged in the face of an extremely severe
economic crisis. No reasonable investor can have such an expectation
unless very specific commitments have been made towards it or unless
the alteration of the legal framework is total.5°° [Footnote omitted]

595. It determined on this basis that the cumulative effect of the measures adopted by Argentina in
the wake of the 2001 economic crisis amounted to a total alteration of the legal environment
originally established to attract foreign investors. The tribunal then took into consideration the
various means by which Argentina had represented to foreign investors that a devaluation of
the Argentinian Peso would not affect their investments.5”°

596. Second, in Micula v Romania, the investors demonstrated that they had been induced to invest
in a particular region of Romania by means of a programme of tax incentives, and that
Romania had later completely stripped the programme of those incentives. The record also
showed that Romanian officials had represented to the claimants that they would be
compensated should the regime be repealed or fundamentally altered over a 10-year
period.5”!

597. The tribunal reasoned that the intent of the State to commit itself, or not, bears little relevance
to determining whether the investor holds legitimate expectations. Rather, the analysis turns
on a factual assessment as to whether the State acted in such a way as to create such
expectations.” It concluded, on the facts at hand, that Romania had violated the FET
standard, given that the investor had relied on the State’s assurance of support and that a quid

570 RL-145, El Paso v Argentina, ibid, 517 [footnotes omitted]: “It cannot be denied that in the matter before
this Tribunal the cumulative effect of the measures was a total alteration of the entire legal setup for foreign
investments, and that all the different elements and guarantees just mentioned can be analysed as a special
commitment of Argentina that such a total alteration would not take place. As stated by the tribunal in LG&E,
when evaluating the same events, tere, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Argentina went too far by
completely dismantling the very legal framework constructed to attract investors. ”

(11 December 2013), 9686-689 [Micula v Romania]. Claimants relies on this decision to support their
position that implicit assurances may form legitimate expectations, Cl. Reply, 9167, referring to paragraph
669 of the award.

572 CL-109, Micula v Romania, ibid, (669. As regards a specific assurance of regulatory stability, the tribunal
explained: “However, the fair and equitable treatment obligation is not an unqualified guarantee that
regulations will never change. Investors must expect that the legislation will change from time to time,
absent a stabilization clause or other specific assurances giving rise to a legitimate expectation of
stabilization. The BIT’s protection of the stability of the legal and business environment cannot be
interpreted as the equivalent of a stabilization clause. In the Tribunal’s view, the correct position is that the
state may always change its legislation, being aware and thus taking into consideration that: (i) an investor's
legitimate expectations must be protected; (ii) the state’s conduct must be substantively proper (e.g., not
arbitrary or discriminatory); and (iii) the state’s conduct must be procedurally proper (e.g., in compliance
with due process and fair administration). If a change in legislation fails to meet these requirements, while
the legislation may be validly amended as a matter of domestic law, the state may incur international
liability.” (529).

pro quo had been required from the investor. In the tribunal's words, Romania “did not merely
‘trim down’ the incentives, as the Respondent contends [...] [it] virtually eliminated rather than
simply modified or amended” the relevant regime.5’° This sufficed to engage Romania's
liability: “it cannot be fair and equitable for a State to offer advantages to investors with the
purpose of attracting investment in an otherwise unattractive region, require these investors to
maintain their investments in that region for twice the period they receive the incentives, and
then maintain the formal shell of the regime but eviscerate it of all (or substantially all)
content.”574

Third, the tribunal in Perenco v Ecuador, a case that Claimants analogise with their own case
here,5”5 emphasised that the terms of a contract entered into by the State bear particular
significance,*”° even where the contractual arrangement does not contain a stabilization
clause.5””

In Perenco, a State entity had entered into production sharing contracts with several foreign
investors, including the claimant, for the exploration and exploitation of two (2) oil blocks. The
tribunal noted that these contracts had been executed under a specific and duly considered
legislative framework and that this framework had also been integrated in the agreements. In
the tribunal's view, it was therefore reasonable for the investors to expect that the contracts
would not be altered unilaterally by State action, except in accordance with the terms of the
contracts and the State’s law:576

The Participation Contracts were anchored in a legislative framework
duly considered and enacted by the Nation’s Congress. That
framework and its rationale set out certain key features of the new
contractual regime which were then reflected in the contracts
subsequently concluded with oil companies. Consequently, any
contractor could reasonably expect that the contracts’ structure would
not be altered by Petroecuador unilaterally or undone by subsequent
State action external to the contract except in accordance with their
terms and the State’s law. [Footnotes omitted]

The tribunal declined to find that the increase of the State’s taxation of the revenues of the oil
concessions in question to 50% breached the FET standard (given, inter alia, that such an
increase was not proven to fundamentally alter the structure of the contracts and that there
was no evidence that “it blunted further investment”).°’° By contrast, the tribunal found that

subsequent tax increase to 99%, coupled with other State measures, completely overturned
the existing system and therefore violated the FET standard.5®°

The Tribunal considers it appropriate to refer to two (2) other cases relied on by Claimants,
Walter Bau v Thailand and TECO v Guatemala, both of which would also fall in the third
category of the aforementioned typology.

The UNCITRAL tribunal in Walter Bau v Thailand found the respondent State liable toward the
investor based on an assessment of what it referred to as the “total factual matrix,” rather than
on any finding of an explicit statement or specific conduct by Thailand.5*' The latter had
refused to approve toll hikes contemplated in a concession contract for the building of a toll
road. This was, according to the tribunal, in contradiction with the common understanding of
the parties that the claimant would earn a “reasonable rate of return” on its investment. The
tribunal factored into its assessment: (i) the semi-public nature of the concession, (ii) the
“inherent unlikeliness that any investor would contemplate entering into such a long-term
arrangement without a legitimate expectation of reasonable return,” (iii) tolls were the only
mean to recoup the investment made and (iv) “there had been extensive consideration of the
economic viability of the concession by many parties.”5® On this latter element, the Tribunal
notes in its analysis of legitimate expectations that the parties to the agreement had addressed
the issue of the return to be earned by the investor. More specifically, the parties to the
agreement had conducted studies to ascertain what would constitute a reasonable rate of
return and that they had entered into this contract with the belief that this return would vary
between 15 and 21%. In the course of the negotiation of an amendment to the contract, the
minister of Finance had even explicitly mentioned that the various alternatives envisioned
would allow the concessionaire to “achieve a reasonable rate on his investment (14%).”583 As
discussed below at paragraphs 686 and following, however the circumstances of the present
case differ significantly from those in Walter Bau v Thailand.

In TECO v Guatemala, the claimant alleged, as do Claimants in the present matter, that it
benefited from assurances regarding the methodology for establishing utility tariffs.

TECO had acquired a formerly state-owned electricity company, EEGSA. Prior to the
privatisation, Guatemala had adopted a new tariff regime through the General Electric Law.
This legislation provided that tariffs were to be based on the VAD factor, designed to represent
the average cost of capital of an efficient company asset base. The VAD factor was to be
determined based on a consultant study submitted by the distributor of electricity and to be
reviewed by the regulator, the CNEE, according to parameters adopted in State resolutions.
The regulatory scheme also provided for the appointment of an Expert Commission should
disagreement between the distributor and the regulator arise. Eleven years later, a dispute
arose after CNEE employed a methodology requiring that the CNEE (and not the distributor)

undertake the VAD factor study which resulted in lower tariffs. This new methodology required
that the VAD factor study be undertaken by the CNEE, as opposed to the distributor.

605. In support of its FET claim, TECO relied on certain statements made by Guatemala in
preparation for the privatisation as well as on the Memorandum of Sale prepared at the time
by EEGSA’s consultant:

614. Page 19 of the presentation states that “any material change in
tariff methodology must be supported by a study conducted by an
internationally recognized independent consultant.” As for the
Memorandum of Sale, it is more specific and states, in the relevant
parts relating to the regulatory framework, that “VADs must be
calculated by distributors by means of a study commissioned from an
engineering firm, but the Commission may dictate that the studies be
grouped by density. The Commission will review those studies and can
make observations, but in the event of discrepancy, a Commission of
three experts will be convened to resolve the differences.”

615. Attached to the Memorandum of Sale was an English-language
draft of the future law of electricity, providing in Article 75 that “the
Commission [CNEE] shall review the studies performed and may make
comments on the same. In case of differences made in writing, the
Commission and the distributors shall agree on the appointment of an
Expert Commission made of three members, one appointed by each
party and the third by mutual agreement. The Expert Commission shall
rule on the differences in a period of 60 days counted from its
appointment.”5®4 [Emphasis omitted; Footnotes omitted]

The tribunal found that these were not specific assurances regarding the stability of the
regime®*> and that, in any event, the amendments to the law did not alter the fundamental
principles of the regulatory regime.5®* The tribunal also determined that the change in the
methodology, i.e. that tariffs would be set according to the regulator's own study rather than the
distributor's, was neither unfair, nor arbitrary.°°” It suggested however that, in the absence of a
stabilisation clause, regulatory changes may breach the FET standard where such changes are
either made in bad faith or with the intent of depriving the investor of the benefit of its
investment.5® The matter rather turned on whether Guatemala had applied domestic law in a

588 CL-110, TECO v Guatemala, ibid, (629: “At any rate, this argument is ill-grounded. As rightly pointed
out by the Respondent, Guatemala never agreed or represented that the regulatory framework would
remain unchanged. In absence of a stabilisation clause, it is perfectly acceptable that the State amends the
relevant laws and regulations as appropriate. It is only if a change to the regulatory framework is made in
bad faith or with the intent to deprive the investor of the benefits of its investment that it could entail the
State’s international responsibility.”

fair and non-arbitrary manner.®®° In this respect, the Tribunal ultimately found that, although it
was entitled to relied on its own study, it had violated due process by (i) not providing reasons
for not using the distributor's study and (ii) that it did not abide to the principle that disagreement
between the distributor and the regulator would be resolved having regarded to the conclusions
of a neutral Expert Commission.5°°

4) The Claimants’ Legitimate Expectations at the Time of the Privatisation

606. The Tribunal consider it appropriate to recall that the legitimate expectations of an investor are
to be determined at the time the investment is made. This has been stated by several tribunals,
for example in Electrabel, both in the Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability and
the Award:

As regards the relevant point in time for the assessment of legitimate
and reasonable expectations, it is common ground in “investment
jurisprudence” and between the Parties that the assessment must refer
to the time at which the investment is made [...]®°' [Emphasis added]

Legitimate Expectations: As regards Electrabel’s submissions on
legitimate expectations under the ECT’s FET standard, the Tribunal
finds no evidence that Hungary represented to Electrabel, at the times
of its investments in Dunameniti, that it would ever act differently from
the way that it did act towards Dunamenti or Electrabel.°? [Emphasis
added]

607. This is acknowledged by Claimants themselves,®® citing Lemire:

The FET standard is thus closely tied to the notion of legitimate
expectations - actions or omissions by [the State] are contrary to the
FET standard if they frustrate legitimate and reasonable expectations

589 CL-110, TECO v Guatemala, ibid, {§621 and 622: “621. It is clear, in the eyes of the Arbitral Tribunal,
that any investor has the expectation that the relevant applicable legal framework will not be disregarded
or applied in an arbitrary manner. However, that kind of expectation is irrelevant to the assessment of
whether a State should be held liable for the arbitrary conduct of one of its organs. What matters is whether
the State’s conduct has objectively been arbitrary, not what the investor expected years before the facts. A
willful disregard of the law or an arbitrary application of the same by the regulator constitutes a breach of
the minimum standard, with no need to resort to the doctrine of legitimate expectations.

622. There is therefore no need to dwell any further on the Parties’ arguments on representations and
legitimate expectations. In particular, there is no need for the Tribunal to deal with the Parties’ arguments
as to whether the Claimant is entitled to rely on the alleged expectations of the entity that invested in EEGSA
in 1998.”

on which the investor relied at the time when he made the
investment.5% [Alteration in original]

The same position had been adopted earlier in Duke Energy v Ecuador.

To be protected, the investor's expectations must be legitimate and
reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment. The
assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into
account all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the
investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical
conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such expectations
must arise from the conditions that the State offered the investor and
the latter must have relied upon them when deciding to invest.
[Footnotes omitted]

The Tribunal turns now to an assessment of the facts of the present case, with particular
attention to the role of Respondent's organs and any statements or conduct attributable to the
State concerning the stability of the water tariff regime and the profits to be earned by
Claimants further to ASTV’s privatisation.

The Tribunal first considers the purpose and objectives of ASTV’s privatisation and the manner
in which those objectives were presented to potential foreign investors (a), as well as the
broader context within which the privatisation took place (b), before engaging in an analysis of
the relevant agreements (c) and their terms (d). Lastly, the Tribunal will address Respondent's
argument as to the alleged illegality of the Services Agreement (e).

a) The Purpose and Objectives of the Privatisation

The bidding documentation confirms unequivocally that the primary purpose of ASTV’s
privatisation was to obtain the hands-on managerial expertise and financial clout of a foreign
operator with a view to bringing ASTV into compliance with Estonian and European regulatory
standards. This notably appears from the Information Memorandum, which states:

The principal objective of the City of Tallinn from the Transaction is to
attract a Strategic Investor for the management and financing of the
Company in order to achieve the quality and service standards set by
National and European Union regulations.5%

612. The bidding process accordingly aimed at identifying, not a passive financial investor, but a
“Strategic Investor,” a partner committed to directing ASTV’s technical, operational and
financial development over the long term:

The City wishes to attract an Investor who is fully committed to the
development of the Company, and has the necessary technical,
operational and financial capability to meet the established levels of
service, as well as relevant international experience in the provision of
water and wastewater services. °°”

613. The Strategic Investor would bear responsibility for determining and implementing the means
and methods to meet the company’s required levels of services, and its performance would
be measured by reference to these service levels.5%°

614. The bidding criteria, reported above at paragraph 142, effectively excluded any domestic
operator from the bidding process.

615. The bidding documentation further identified “stable and transparent tariff regulation” among
the principal objectives of the privatisation, and expressly acknowledged the relationship
between the water tariffs charged by ASTV to consumers and the foreign investment needed
to improve and maintain ASTV’s service levels.5°° The Explanatory Memorandum made this
clear, expressly recognising that these tariffs must allow the Strategic Investor to earn “justified
profitability” on its investment:

One of the most important objectives of the City is to ensure the
stability of water tariffs in the future. The production of high-quality
drinking water and the treatment of wastewater in Tallinn require large
expenses due to the peculiarity of nature. One of the most important
reasons is the poor quality of the raw water — 90% of the water used in
Tallinn comes from Lake Ulemiste and only 10% from groundwater.
The water of Lake Ulemiste is muddy and contains a lot of seaweed.
The quality of water is also affected by human activities in the vicinity
of rivers and canals belonging to a water intake of 2,000 square
kilometres. Large expenses are to be incurred in order to achieve a
high quality in the water discharged from the treatment plant. In
addition to the purification of surface water, it is also necessary to
install treatment equipment on several groundwater wells. The
treatment of wastewater under the requirements of the agreements
concerning protection of the Finnish Gulf (HELCOM) is also expensive
and requires substantial investments in the wastewater treatment plant
in the near future — 313 million EEK within the next 3 years. [...]

Currently, Tallinn City approves the tariff on the basis of an application
of a water undertaking on a yearly basis. Such regulation does not
ensure certainty about the development of tariffs for the City or the

investor. The last change in tariffs was in January 1998; since then,
the actual tariff (adjusted with inflation) has continuously fallen — and
the company fails to perform all obligations assumed by the loan
agreement with EBRD, e.g. the obligation to increase tariffs with
inflation and to keep the debt service coverage ratio at the level of at
least 1.5. Neither does the applicable tariff ensure compliance with the
requirements for the tariff level arising from the Public Water Supply
and Sewerage Act (PWSSA). According to the PWSSA, the price of
the service must ensure: (i) coverage of the production expenses, (ii)
compliance with the quality and safety requirements, (iii) compliance
with the environmental protection requirements, and (iv) justified
profitability. [...]

 

Therefore, it is necessary to establish a longer-term, transparent tariff
mechanism that allows for compliance with the requirements
established by the laws and contracts and ensures the financing of
investments, while making AS Tallinna Vesi increase efficiency. The
tariff level is directly related to the required service level and the
resultant investment needs, and the tariff must also allow for achieving
justified profitability for the investor.6° [Emphasis added]

It is in light of these considerations that the City’s advisor, Suprema, suggested the formula for
setting water tariffs that would later be included in the Services Agreement.®! Bearing in mind
the financial and other commitment required from the investor and the long-term, strategic
nature of the investment, Suprema also warned the City of Tallinn that the investor's “main two
expectations” — a stable operating environment and the ability to earn “reasonable profitability”
— would have to be respected. Suprema posited that the interests of investor and the City’s
objectives would largely coincide in this respect:

For the success of the privatisation, it is also important to turn attention
to the expectation of the investor. Privatisation cannot be successfully
conducted without taking into consideration the expectation of the
investors. The more assured the investor is of the stability of the
operating environment of the company and the more precisely the
different aspects of co-operation between the City and investor are
defined, the larger is the interest of the Investor which in turn is
reflected in the higher offered price.

In the case of AS Tallinna Vesi, the investment horizon is long-term (at
least 15-20 years), as investments are of a long-term nature. The
investor undertakes to achieve the objectives set by the City and
expects to receive reasonable profitability in return. Through the
ownership of the share, the profitability comprises of paid dividends
and the development of goodwill.

618.

For the achievement of the main two expectations. the investors
assume certainty in the following aspects:

¢ Control over management and the ability to have a say in
developing the strategy of the company in order to secure the
achievement of the objectives set by the City.

¢ Ability to make investment decisions according to the earlier
agreed parameters.

e Clear and stable tariff regulation.
e Ability to decide over the profit distribution of AS Tallinna Vesi.

The above objectives largely coincide with the objectives of the City
(efficient management of the company, investments to improve the
service quality and stable tariff regulation). The regulation of the
relationship between the city and investor in the aforementioned areas
is discussed in Annexes 1 and 2.°? [Emphasis added]

The Tribunal thus finds that ASTV’s privatisation was conceived and represented to the
bidders as a long-term project demanding significant financial, strategic, managerial and
operational input from a foreign investor, whose investment would be recouped by means of
water tariffs to be set at levels that would allow the investor to earn “justified” or “reasonable”
profits over the anticipated term of the investment. The privatisation documentation did not
provide any further information on this point and, as the Explanatory Memorandum itself
warned that:

Currently, Tallinn City approves the tariff on the basis of an application
of a water undertaking on a yearly basis. Such requlation does not
ensure certainty about the development of tariffs for the City or the
investor.®°?

[Emphasis added]

The Tribunal also finds that these contextual factors cannot in and of themselves substantiate
Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations. Although they weighed heavily in the decision to
proceed with the investment, the terms of the privatisation agreements themselves bear
greater emphasis and are indeed determinative in delineating what Claimants could, and could
not reasonably expect since they crystallise the common intention of the parties at the time of
the privatisation.

b) The Broader Context of ASTV’s Privatisation

It is uncontested that ASTV’s privatisation was an initiative of the City of Tallinn. Claimants
have nonetheless stressed what they refer to as the national and international implications of
the privatisation, due to the alleged difficulties of ASTV under the 1994 EBRD Loan (i), the role
of the Central Government in the extension of the term of ASTV’s license (ii) and the
involvement of the EBRD through the 2000 and 2002 EBRD Loans (iii).®°* After considering
these, the Tribunal will set out its findings in point (iv).

(i) ASTV's Performance under the 1994 EBRD Loan

Claimants highlight the role of the Central Government as State guarantor of the 1994 EBRD
Loan and the various exchanges with the EBRD regarding compliance with the terms of this
loan.®°5 They argue that ASTV’s poor performance could have led to the calling of the State
Guarantee, which would have created an obstacle to ASTV’s privatisation. By way of
illustration, in a letter to the City’s mayor dated 24 August 1999, copied to the Estonian Finance
Ministry, the EBRD warned the City of the serious consequences of its planned decrease in
water tariffs, and requested that it abandon the plan. The EBRD stated that it was “seriously
concerned, not only by the breach of covenants [of the 1994 EBRD Loan] but also by the
adverse effect that a reduction in tariffs would have on any future privatisation or sale of shares
in Tallinn Water Limited.”

There is little doubt that ASTV was not in full compliance with the terms of the 1994 EBRD
Loan prior to the privatisation. As a matter of fact, ASTV’s failure to raise its tariffs in the period
prior to privatisation was represented to potential investors as being non-compliant with the
1994 EBRD Loan.®” Yet, Mr Péder, who acted as a Deputy Secretary General of the Ministry
of Finance at the time and who was later employed by the EBRD in 2000, testified in this
arbitration that the concern pertaining to ASTV's compliance, in particular the City’s insistence
on decreasing water tariffs for purely political reasons, was resolved further to the 1999
election. In fact, the City of Tallinn’s decision to decrease ASTV's tariffs was revoked in
November 1999, some months before the issuance of the Tender Notice in June 2000.°°
Furthermore, according to Mr Péder, the EBRD’s concerns were all resolved by the time the
1994 EBRD Loan was refinanced in 2000.

The Tribunal further notes, as pointed out by Respondent,®'° that UUTBV itself remarked at
the time of its investment in ASTV that the EBRD had “no complaints” about the latter's
performance.®"!

(ii) The Extension of the Term of ASTV’s License

In order to demonstrate the involvement of the Central Government in the privatisation,
Claimants also highlight the Government's role in the required extension of the term of ASTV's
license. As discussed above,*'? in aid of the privatisation, in view of the long-term nature of
the investment and the expectations of the sort of long-term investor required, the City of
Tallinn sought a derogation from the applicable national regulation so as to extend the duration
of ASTV’s license from five (5) to twenty (20) years.

In the course of this process, which took place over the spring of 2000, the Ministry of Finance
and the ECA, as well as the Prime Minister himself, gained knowledge of ASTV’s privatisation
(if they had not previously been aware of the circumstances) and became at least tangentially
involved. The City of Tallinn informed the Minister of Finance of the long-term nature of the
investment required and alluded to the expectations of the “entrepreneurs” from whom it hoped
to secure such an investment:

In the current situation it is not rational or reasoned to appoint a water
undertaking in the City of Tallinn for a period of 5 (five) years. This
results from the fact that development of water business
(reconstruction of the existing network for the purpose of improving
water quality, construction of new networks to new areas) requires the
development of long-term investment programmes from the water
undertaking and the implementation thereof. The payback period for
networks and equipment is significantly longer than a 5-year period.
Resulting from the abovementioned a frequent change in water
undertakings would not have a positive impact of [sic] the development
of the water business as a whole in the City of Tallinn. [...]

In order to ensure the fact that entrepreneurs would have economic
interest for providing the services of water supply and_wastewater
discharge and that in the future the obligations set for the water
undertaking to be established by the Development Plan would actually
be carried out, the term of the exclusive right to be granted to the water
undertakings should be set as the time period equivalent to the terms
of the validity of four permits for special use of water (also the “TKT”
i.e. 20 (twenty) years.®'? [Emphasis added]

This being said, there is no question that the relevant license could only be held by the water
undertaking, i.e. ASTV, not the investor in the undertaking. And although the Ministry of

Finance took into consideration the capital-intensive nature of the sector in extending ASTV's
license term, there is no evidence that it also took into consideration the specific interests of
ASTV's future investor.®'* Nor is there any evidence that the Central Government was
provided with a copy of the Services Agreement or that it considered either the particular return
expected by the investor or the share price.

(iii) The EBRD’s Role in the Privatisation: the 2000 and 2002 EBRD Loans

In Claimants’ view, further evidence of the national and international implications of the
privatisation can be gleaned from the 2000 and 2002 EBRD Loans.®'®

The 2000 EBRD Loan was conditional upon the execution of agreements with the investor
“acceptable to the Bank providing for a basis on which [ASTV] will, in the opinion of the Bank,
be able to function as a profitable commercial enterprise and fulfil its obligation under this
Agreement, including, a service agreement and a share purchase agreement.”°'” Mr Péder
testified that had there been concern with the privatisation agreements, the EBRD’s board
would have been consulted."

As for the 2002 EBRD Loan, its terms required compliance with the Services Agreement®'9
and provided the EBRD with the right to review any amendments to the Services Agreement
or to the Business Plan appended to the Shareholders’ Agreement.®° The EBRD also
appeared content with the regulatory mechanism referenced in the 2002 EBRD Loan, by
lauding the “strong environmental impact [of the 2002 EBRD Loan] and [...] the improved
regulatory mechanism it promoted through the loan covenants.”®' On this point, Mr Péder
testified that, during the approval process, the general tariff mechanism was discussed at the
EBRD with reference to an agreement for the first five (5) years.®°? Claimants also note that
the EBRD welcomed the proposed financing “particularly for its strong environmental
impact.”

(iv) Findings of the Tribunal regarding the Broader Context of ASTV’s
Privatisation

The evidence concerning the interest and involvement of the Estonian Government and the
EBRD in ASTV’s privatisation confirms that the privatisation indeed resonated at both the
national and international levels. In line with Claimants’ submissions, the Tribunal considers
that this may have provided to potential foreign investors, including UUTBV, some comfort as
to the seriousness and legitimacy of the City’s endeavours. It may even have informed
UUTBV's views and conduct at the time of the privatisation (and the entry of the 2002 EBRD
Loan). However, these aspects of the privatisation, such as they are, cannot by themselves
be said to amount to any sort of assurance by Estonia, explicit or implied, capable of creating
legitimate expectations as a matter of international law. Indeed, in the overall context of the
privatisation, especially in the dealings between the relevant authorities and potential
investors, the involvement of the national and international institutions in question was
relatively minimal and, on the facts at hand, does not assist in substantiating the legitimate
expectations alleged by Claimants.

c) The Nature of the Privatisation Agreements and the Capacity in which the
City of Tallinn Intervened in these Acts

In assessing the nature of the representations made by the City through the privatisation
agreements, and whether or how they may have given rise to legitimate expectations on the
part of Claimants, the Tribunal will first consider the capacity in which the City of Tallinn
intervened in ASTV’s privatisation. After summarising the positions of the parties on this point
(i), the Tribunal will consider the Estonian law expert evidence filed by the Parties (ii) and then
state its findings (iii).

(i) The Positions of the Parties

Claimants submit that the City of Tallinn negotiated and executed the Services Agreement and
approved the 2001 Business Plan in its capacity as a State authority.°°*

Their argument focuses on the (undisputed) characterisation of the tariff part of the Services
Agreement as a public law agreement pursuant to Estonian law. Hence, they say, the
negotiation and execution of the Services Agreement must be considered as an exercise of
public power and, to be consistent, the same must hold true for its five (5) amendments.
Claimants further argue that the 2001 Business Plan forms part of this public law relationship
since the Services Agreement refers to it for the purpose of determining water tariffs.°5

Respondent argues that the privatisation agreements are purely commercial acts of the City
of Tallinn, save for the tariff component of the Services Agreement.®6

634. Concerning the Services Agreement, Respondent relies on its Clause 34(3), which explicitly
states that the Services Agreement is to be considered as a private and commercial contract:
“(3) The City irrevocably and unconditionally acknowledges that the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement constitute private and commercial (and not public) acts of the
City.”®” According to Estonia, this clause reflects the common and subjective understanding
of the parties at the time of the execution of the Services Agreement and undermines any
relevance of the public law nature of the tariff provisions of the document. Estonia submits
that UUTBV’s subjective understanding of the objectives and purpose of the Services
Agreement and the Shareholders’ Agreement are also evidenced by its comments in the
course of the negotiation of the agreements, during which UUTBV took care to emphasise
among other things the different purposes of the Services Agreement and the Shareholders’
Agreement by notably suggesting that the Shareholders’ Agreement would deal with
management issues.*° In addition, Respondent submits that the inclusion of a dispute
resolution clause at Art. 37 of the Services Agreement confirms its commercial and private
nature, and that it cannot be enforced against Estonia through an ICSID arbitration.®°°

635. Concerning the Shareholders’ Agreement, Respondent reiterates that the City did not
intervene therein in the exercise of its regulatory function and refers to the various statements
in the Agreement to the effect that it in no way hinders the exercise of the City’s governmental
authority.°°' By way of example, Art. 5.1 of said agreement provides that:

Unless the Shareholders shall otherwise agree, [...] the City of Tallinn
shall not use the powers available to it as a shareholder of the
Company (without anyhow limiting the rights and obligations of the City

of Tallinn as a local government) to prevent [...] the conduct the
Company's business [...] °° [Emphasis added]

The Parties’ Estonian law experts — Mr Rask, Respondent’ expert; and Mr Pikamae, Claimants’
expert — agree that the tariff part of the Services Agreement constitutes a public law act,
entered into by the City of Tallinn in its regulatory capacity.

But for that, the respective characterisation of the various privatisation agreements by the
Parties’ experts differ insofar as Mr Rask insists on the distinction between the different roles
assumed by the City of Tallinn (as a government and public regulator on the one hand, and as
a commercial party to a sale and a shareholder on the other hand), whereas Mr Pikamae
approaches the privatisation agreements as interconnected parts of a unified transaction that,
in his opinion, concerns the performance of the City’s administrative function. We summarise
below their respective opinions.

¢ The Services Agreement

According to Mr Rask, only the tariff component of the Services Agreement (Annex E) and
related provisions directly pertaining to public law powers (Mr Rask refers to the assignment
by the City to ASTV of the obligation to provide public water and sewerage services) constitute
an administrative act.6°° Mr Rask considers the remainder of the Services Agreement as a
private, civil law contract.

According to Mr Pikamae, the Services Agreement, as a whole, is an administrative act issued
by way of agreement. According to Claimants’ expert, this agreement comprises “essentially
the permission, i.e. right and obligation granted by the City of Tallinn to ASTV to provide the
services of supplying water in the specified area [...]."°°*

The District Court of Tallinn’s decision aligns with Mr Rask’s opinion®® and the reasons of both
the Circuit Court®6 and the Supreme Court seem to support this position.6°” In the Tribunal’s
view, the key point is that the Parties’ experts and the Estonian courts all agree that the tariff
component of the Services Agreement is of a public, administrative law nature. The differences
between the experts on the other elements of the Agreement have less bearing.

¢ The Shareholders Agreement (including the 2001 Business Plan)

Mr Rask opines that the Shareholders’ Agreement is a civil law contract because: (1) its
purpose is to regulate the decision-making as to ASTV’s strategic business activities and (2)
it sets out the rights and obligations of the City of Tallinn in its capacity as a shareholder of
ASTV.®8

646.

Mr Rask acknowledges that the 2001 Business Plan addresses the determination of water
tariffs. He nonetheless considers the document to be a civil instrument as it lacks any
independent tariff-setting mechanism and because the City did not mention the 2001 Business
Plan as a basis for the determination of the water tariffs, whereas it did refer to the applicable
legislation and the 1999 PWSSA in adopting tariffs.®° He further takes the view that the 2001
Business Plan contradicts the tariff-setting mechanism of the Services Agreement insofar as
the Services Agreement provides that tariffs must be determined over a 5-year period while
the 2001 Business Plan contains projections covering the entire duration of ASTV’s license.®#°

During the Hearing, when shown the reference in the Services Agreement to the 2001
Business Plan as a criterion for determining justified profitability,°*' Mr Rask conceded that the
Business Plan may form part of the public law relationship.°“2 He went on to opine that because
the criteria to establish justified profitability had to be adopted by the Council of the City of
Tallinn, which was not the case, the Services Agreement in its entirety was illegal®* (this
question is addressed below at paragraphs 717 and following).

Mr Pikamae disagrees and considers that the 2001 Business Plan forms part of the
administrative relationship arising out of the Services Agreement. As mentioned, he considers
the privatisation agreements to be interrelated. Mr Pikamae relies in particular on the reference
in Schedule E of the Services Agreement to ASTV’s tariff proposals being based on a Business
Plan® as well as on various references in the privatisation agreements and in the Information
Memorandum in support of his opinion that the 2001 Business Plan was clearly intended to
complement the Services Agreement with regards to the setting of tariffs. In the course of his
cross-examination at the Hearing, he nonetheless acknowledged that he does not consider
the Shareholders’ Agreement per se, that is, in isolation from the other privatisation
agreements, to be an administrative agreement.®45

e¢ The Closing Memorandum and the Memorandum of
Understanding

Mr Rask considers that neither of these agreements are public contracts.

Mr Pikamae considers the Closing Memorandum and the Memorandum of Understanding
attached thereto (or at least the provisions relating to the 2001 Business Plan) to form part of
the administrative relationship arising out of the Services Agreement and the privatisation
agreements as a whole, based on the same reasoning developed for the 2001 Business Plan.

Similarly, he acknowledges that the Closing Memorandum on its own does not directly pertain
to the performance of a public function.**

e The Contract for the Sale and Subscription of Shares

According to Mr Rask, share sales contracts are typically considered as civil law contracts,
even where a public authority is one of the signatories.”

Mr Pikamae, for his part, asserts that this agreement also forms part of the contractual
arrangement setting out the terms of the privatisation on the basis that the conclusion of the
Services Agreement was a condition precedent to the entry force of the Contract for Sale and
Subscription.™® Findings of the Tribunal on the Nature of the Privatisation Agreements and the
City’s Status

In view of the consensus on the public law nature of the tariff component of the Services
Agreement, with which the Tribunal agrees, it is clear that the Services Agreement cannot be
said to consist of a purely commercial agreement of a private law nature, creating a purely
private commercial relationship between the parties. At least part — the Tribunal would say, an
essential part — of the Services Agreement concerns the exercise of an important public
function. In entering into the Services Agreement the City cannot be considered a “normal
contractual partner.” On the contrary, the negotiation and execution of the Services Agreement
by the City directly implicated its sovereign prerogative, and at least in respect of this essential
element of ASTV's privatisation the Tribunal finds that City of Tallinn acted in a public,
regulatory capacity. The Tribunal has no doubt that the Service Agreement has been entered
into by the City of Tallinn as a public law entity and ASTV.

This has been even acknowledged in the Shareholders Agreement's definitions:

“Service Agreement” means the written service agreement [....]
entered into between the Company and the City of Tallinn on or before
the date of this Agreement to regulate and specify the Company's
obligations towards the City of Tallinn as a legal person in public law,
with respect to the Company's activities.°° [Emphasis added]

The same is not true for the Shareholders’ Agreement, which has been entered into by the
City of Tallinn as a shareholder, and recognises in numerous articles that the contractual
commitments entered into do not infringe on the city of Tallinn regulatory power, of which a
few examples can be given here:

Article 5.1 Principal Covenants
[...] Unless the Shareholders shall otherwise agree, the Investor shall

use all the power available to it to cause the company to the City of
Tallinn shall not use the powers available to it as a shareholder of the

Article 5.2 Negative Covenants Related to the Company

Unless the Shareholders shall otherwise agree and as long the City of
Tallinn is a shareholder of the Company, the Shareholders acting in
their capacity as shareholders of the Company Company (without

shall not [...];

Ll

Article 5.5.9. The covenants of the City of Tallinn specified in Sections
5.5.1-5.5.8 (inclusive) shall not Company anyhow limit the rights and
obligations of the City of Tallinn as a local government.

Yet, it is readily apparent from the privatisation agreements themselves, even if they are of a
different legal nature, that they are interrelated and intended to form a unified whole. The
Services Agreement refers to both the Shareholders’ Agreement®° and the Share Sale and
Subscription Agreement,®' and the execution of these latter instruments was a condition
precedent to the entry into force of the Services Agreement.®®? The Shareholders’ Agreement
and the other privatisation contracts were necessary components of the legal relationship to
be established between the investor and the City of Tallinn. This arrangement was deliberately
conceived by the City of Tallinn and its advisors and represented to prospective investors in
the Explanatory Memorandum and the Information Memorandum.*®® Nothing in the evidence
adduced or submissions made in the arbitration reasonably assails this assessment.

Having found that the privatisation agreements form integral parts of a single transaction, the
Tribunal does not consider it necessary or particularly fruitful to assess the legal nature of each
agreement, on its own, in isolation from the other components of the privatisation. Rather, to

address Claimants’ claim of legitimate expectations, what is called for is an examination of the
actual terms of the privatisation as manifested in the agreements.

d) The Terms of the Privatisation Agreements and the Status of the 2001
Business Plan

Two elements bear particular relevance for the purpose of assessing Claimants’ claim of
legitimate expectations as of the time of the privatisation: the mechanism for setting water
tariffs (i), and the potential for a change of regulator and change in the law (ii). The Tribunal’s
overall determinations on the terms of the privatisation agreements are set out in sub-section
(iii) below.

(i) The Mechanism for Determining Water Tariffs
« Parties’ positions

It is not disputed that the provisions of the Services Agreement require that tariffs be re-set for
every five-year operating period (i.e., after 2005 and after 2010).654 As discussed above,
Claimants have clarified that they do not construe the Services Agreement as determining the
water tariffs for the entire license period.®°

The crux of the Parties’ disagreement concerns the method for setting tariffs agreed at the
time of the privatisation and, more specifically, the relevance if any of the 2001 Business Plan.

It is Claimants’ case that UUTBV specifically negotiated a definition of justified profitability in
the Services Agreement which included a reference to the 2001 Business Plan, and that this
definition informed their legitimate expectations.© In their Skeleton Argument, they describe
these expectations as follows:

The Business Plan submitted with UUTBV’s bid projected K factors of
zero for years 6 to 15. Given the background to the privatisation, the
heavily negotiated approach to justified profitability, and the terms of
the Services Agreement, ASTV and UUTBV’'s legitimate expectations
at the time of the privatisation were that the K factors for the second
and third Operating Periods (years 6 to 15) would be set by reference
to this Business Plan, and therefore any departure from zero for the K
factors would be informed by departures from that Business Plan. For
example, and as explained at Reply/59:

654 This was recognised by Claimants’ Estonian law expert, Mr Pikamae (Tr. Day 6 Mr Pikamae 45:16-21)
and by Mr Meaney, Claimants’ economic expert (Tr. Day 7 Mr Meaney 25:18-21). Mr Pikamae also
recognised that a detailed business plan would have to be presented to the regulator.

655 Claimants explained in their post-hearing submission that instead of claiming a guaranteed return, they
“had a legitimate expectation that the contracts entered into on privatisation would be respected, and that
when the K factors were being set for the second and third Operating Periods, they would be set by
reference to the tariff path in the Business Plan, with any departure from that justified by variations from
that Business Plan.” (Cl. PHB, 4117).

1) If the City of Tallinn was requiring substantial and costly further
service level improvements over and above those set by the
privatisation, that might justify a positive K coefficient; and

2) Conversely, if ASTV was proving substantially more profitable than
envisaged in the Business Plan, then a negative K coefficient may be
justified.°°” [Emphasis in original omitted; Emphasis added]

Respondent replies that the Services Agreement intentionally did not fix (as the City of Tallinn
did not wish to fix it) the justified profitability to be earned by ASTV over the entire mandate
period.®°* Relatedly, Respondent submits that UUTBV knew, when it submitted its bid, that the
2001 Business Plan would not form part of the City’s evaluation of its bid,®°° and therefore they
could not have expected the City of Tallinn to implement the profitability projections included
Business Plan.°©°

«= The facts

The negotiating history of the privatisation agreements shows that the City had no intention
that the Services Agreement would set in stone the income or profitability to be earned by
ASTV over the license period. The City’s advisors voiced this position expressly and clearly
during the November 2000 Meeting:

The Advisors were unwilling to consider any definition of “Justified
Profitability” that specified a number (or range of numbers) or made
explicit reference to the Investor's Business Plan. They specifically
noted that they do not wish to create a “fixed income instrument” and
that they wish to maintain incentives for the Investor.®°'

This is corroborated by the testimony of Mr Falko Sellner, a former employee of SevernTrent
who participated in the drafting of the privatisation agreements.®® Mr Sellner explains that the
City rejected the first internal drafts of the agreement providing for a “guaranteed
compensation scheme.”®® This is not really in dispute: as noted several times, Claimants
disclaim any entitlement to a fixed income stream or a risk-free investment.

665.

What is at issue is the legal relationship between the 2001 Business Plan appended to the
Shareholders’ Agreement, and the Services Agreement, and the implication if any for
determining tariffs beyond the five-year Initial Period.

The bidding documentation clearly shows that the City of Tallinn did not consider that the
business plan would be a separate criterion in its evaluation of bids received from prospective
investors.®> As appears from the Information Memorandum, the City requested that bidders
bid specifically on (i) the K-coefficients for the 2001-2005 period, and (ii) the price of the shares
to be issued to UUTBV.® The City further required that the business plan to be submitted
with the bids cover only the 2001-2005 period.°°”

This would explain why the Information Memorandum suggests that tariffs beyond 2005 would
be determined based on a business plan to be submitted later on, focusing on the period in
question, and not the one included in the initial bid:

A price review will take place in the fifth year of operation which will
determine the K coefficient of the tariffs for the subsequent five years.
The Company will submit its business plan for the period in sufficient
detail to enable the Regulator to fulfill his duties.®°° [Emphasis added]

 

According to Mr Sellner, the City required a business plan from the bidders in order to
substantiate each bidder's planning, and to verify how the bidder supported the tariffs for the
first five (5) years of the mandate. The business plan was not, in his view, intended to be
referred to for the determination of tariffs beyond 2005.°° Respondent thus argues that it is
fallacious for Claimants to connect UUTBV's offer to the tariff increases beyond 2005 provided
for in the 2001 Business Plan.°7°

Claimants, for their part, contend that the City of Tallinn effectively represented to prospective
investors that a tariff increase of up to 75% would not necessarily be considered
unreasonable.®”' They refer to a 27 October 2000 letter from the Privatisation Committee
which, in response to requests for clarification, informed the qualified bidders that there would
be a maximum escalation of K-coefficients for the first five (5) years after the closing of the
privatisation transaction:

664 There does not appear to be any debate that the tariffs for the Initial Period were to be calculated
pursuant to the K-coefficients included in the successful bid.

The Privatisation Committee has resolved at the meeting on October

deemed to be an unreasonable level of profit.

667. _ It is noted that the draft privatisation agreements evolved throughout the parties’ negotiations.
In particular for present purposes, it is noted that further to the November 2000 Meeting, and
thus, after the issuance of the Information Memorandum, the City of Tallinn agreed to include
the “vision presented in the business plan” among the criteria for establishing justified
profitability after 2005.°”

668. This development was given effect in Schedule E to the Services Agreement, on which
Claimants place great emphasis:°”

The Parties proposing Justified Profitability shall select 5 suitable
market comparables and establish an appropriate level of Justified
Profitability and further taking into account

(i) generally accepted commercial principles for water and wastewater
utilities

(ii) the specific economic situation in Tallinn and Estonia and

669. Claimants construe the phrase “Business Plan” as meaning specifically the 2001 Business
Plan submitted with UUTBV’s bid.°’° However, as pointed out by Respondent, the Services
Agreement does not define the phrase “business plan” and the use of capital letters throughout
this agreement appears inconsistent.*’? Respondent further argues that the consideration of

670. |The 2000 November Meeting also led Suprema, one of the City’s advisors, to recommend that
the business plan submitted by the winning bidder be appended to the Shareholders’
Agreement, and that the signatories of the Shareholders’ Agreement should undertake to carry
out that business plan.°’? This recommendation was eventually implemented in the
Shareholders’ Agreement by means of the parties’ agreed commitment to make reasonable
efforts to ensure the fulfilment of the 2001 Business Plan.%°

671. The Letter of Understanding similarly records the parties’ comprehension of the purpose of the
2001 Business Plan attached to the Shareholders’ Agreement:

Whereas, in connection with its bid for the acquisition of the majority
shareholding in AS Tallinna Vesi (the “Company”) the Investor has
submitted a business plan (“Business Plan”) to the City;

Whereas, the City has reviewed the Business Plan and has approved
it and accepted it;

Whereas, the City has asked the Investor to clarify certain issues
addressed in the Business Plan and related to management of the
Company and has received an explanation from the Investor that the
City deems satisfactory. Now therefore, the Parties have executed this
Letter with the purpose to describe their mutual understanding about
the interpretation of the Business Plan. [...]

1.4 It is the intention of the Parties to co-operate in good faith and to
make their best efforts in order to ensure implementation of the
Business Plan (as it may be amended from time to time) and to

672. As stated in the excerpt immediately above, before signing the Letter, the City of Tallinn
“carefully reviewed” the 2001 Business Plan, which embraced the entire license period, and
found it to be “acceptable to the City.” The City approved it after the Privatisation Committee
had determined, on 6 December 2000, that UUTBV’s bid was the best of the bids received. *!
On 12 December 2000, Suprema requested UUTBV particulars on the 2001 Business Plan
and mentioned that SevernTrent had already examined it from a “technical perspective.”®°* On
18 December 2000, UUTBV responded to Suprema’s requests®? and, three (3) days later,
the Tallinn City Government passed a resolution declaring UUTBV’s bid to be the best.®*4

673. | Respondent underlines that the Letter of Understanding only addresses management matters,
as opposed to commercial matters, and does not relate to “justified profitability.”
Respondent also relies on Clause 2.1 of the Closing Memorandum, which provides that the
Articles of Association and the applicable law take precedence over the 2001 Business
Plan. 6

674. For their part, Claimants place special reliance on both the “front-loaded” investment structure
of UUTBV’s bid and the implied return of 14.2% projected by the financial model appended to
the 2001 Business Plan (the “Financial Model”).®°”

85 The most closely related matter to the tariffs commented in the Letter of Understanding is the definition
of “Reasonable Costs” (see s. 7.3.3 of the 2001 Business Plan, C-20, Shareholders’ Agreement
(12 January 2001)).

derived from the K-coefficients for the first five (5) years and the assumption that ASTV'’s tariff would remain
unchanged in real terms for the remainder of the mandate. It also included projected distributions to ASTV’s
shareholders.

154

675. First, UUTBV claims that its bid was conceived specifically to address the City’s stated desire
to avoid drastic tariff increases during the initial years after privatisation, as confirmed by
Mr Sellner during the Hearing.®®° In fact, UUTBV’s bid provided for zero tariff increases until
year 4, even though the required capital investment could not wait and so was “front-loaded”
in the first years of the mandate.®° By contrast, the 2001-2005 K-coefficients put forward by
the other qualified bidder, CLIG 4 would have seen significant tariffs increase immediately
upon privatisation.®°°

676. Second, UUTBV's 2001 Business Plan itself indicates that ASTV’s profitability would be
considered over the entire mandate period, as opposed to shorter periods of time, and that the
determination of tariffs for the two (2) last Operating Periods (beyond 2005) were integral to
the profitability analysis and projections, which fundamentally shaped Claimants’
expectations. °°!

677. For example, although it covers in detail only the years 2001-2005, the Shareholders’
Agreement states that the 2001 Business Plan establishes the basis on which subsequent
Operating Periods, and the business plans covering those periods, will be defined:

This Business Plan covers in detail the period 2001-2005 inclusive,
and provides the commercial, financial, operational and technical basis
upon which the period from 2006 onwards will be defined. This
Business Plan will therefore be used as the basis for the drafting of
future Company Business Plans.*9?

678. As well, the 2001 Business Plan explicitly states the investor's expectation that justified
profitability for the second and third Operating Periods will be determined in accordance with
its Appendix 4:

We note that Schedule E of the Services Agreement provides for the selection
of 5 suitable market comparables and establishment of an appropriate level of
Justified Profitability by further taking into account:

* generally accepted commercial principles for water and wastewater utilities

688 Tr. Day 4 Mr Sellner 19:3-12: “Look, | tell you what | recall, okay? | don't want to speculate here. The
City of Tallinn didn't want any increases, at least not in the beginning. Now, there wasn't really a system in
place that could predict the tariffs beyond the first five years. So at the time of the transaction, there wasn't
a tariff development system there. So what the City really wanted beyond this five years in terms of tariff
policy would be a compromise between ‘I want you to invest into or connect et cetera’ and an appropriate
tariff against it.”

This assessment can also include the performance of the Company in the
immediately preceding year of operation. IWUU envisages the mechanism for
setting the Justifiable Profit will be in accordance with the calculation exhibit in
Appendix 4 of this Business Plan.®?

Moreover, the 2001 Business Plan reiterated that UUTBV’s offer was linked to the specific
increases in tariffs set out in its financial model:

IWUU's offer is linked to specific increases in tariffs defined in the
financial model included in this Business Plan and the formula linking
the offered price per share and the tariff increases is included in the
financial model. IWUU is prepared to reallocate the tariff increases to
better suit the objectives of the City if it would be felt by the City to
beneficial.°4

Finally, Claimants refer to the bid of the only other qualified bidder, CLIG 4. As did UUTBV,
CLIG 4 also included with its bid a business plan laying out financial projections covering the
entire mandate period and expressed the reasonable expectation that justified profitability
would be considered over this whole period.®°>

By way of reply, Respondent submits that Claimants could not have expected that the City of
Tallinn would implement the projections included in the 2001 Business Plan.®* It notes that
Section of 7 of the 2001 Business Plan, reproduced above at paragraph 678, merely states
that the investor “envisages that the mechanism for setting the Justifiable Profitability will be
in accordance with the calculation exhibit in Appendix 4 of the Business Plan” [emphasis
added].®°” Furthermore, Appendix 4, which lays out the method for calculating tariffs and
“justified profits,” does not refer to the Financial Model. The “Justifiable Profit” section of
Appendix 4 rather expands on the selection of the comparables for establishing justified
profitability, as contemplated by Schedule E of the Services Agreement.®°

In any event, Respondent argues that it would not have been possible to set the post-2005
tariffs on the basis of the 2001 Business Plan since Schedule E of the Services Agreement
refers to a future business plan pertaining to “the period to be regulated.”®°° Relying on a pre-

set level profitability would further be impossible since some data could not be forecast, such
as ASTV’s sales, production costs and investments and sources of funding over the entire
mandate period, which could not have been known in 2001.7 In addition, the 2001 Business
Plan did not contain the required level of detail for the years after 2005.70!

Finally, Respondent argues that the 14.2% profitability implied by the 2001 Business Plan
cannot in any case be considered justifiable.’°* First, Schedule E of the Services Agreement
provided that justified profitability would be determined primarily on the basis of a comparative
analysis of five (5) contemporaneous market proxies, which could not have been conducted
in 2001.75 Second, the 14.2% profitability benchmark is not stated expressly in the 2001
Business Plan; it is the product of an analysis by Mr Meaney, who admitted that this calculation
required that he exercise certain judgment the basis of which is not specified in the 2001
Business Plan.7°*

«The Tribunals findings on the mechanism for determining water
tariffs

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the parties to the Services Agreement considered the
meaning of justifiable profitability during their negotiation. This was motivated by the investor's
concern regarding the open-ended nature of the 1999 PWSSA and its desire to curtail
uncertainty in that respect. What is at issue, however, is whether these negotiations resulted
in a commitment by the City, the only State entity involved, regarding the tariff-setting
mechanism and, more generally, ASTV’s profitability.

Notwithstanding that the Services Agreement does not define the phrase “Business Plan,” the
Tribunal accepts that Schedule E likely refers to the 2001 Business Plan, though it considers
the scope and significance of this reference to be far narrower than Claimants contend. In the
Tribunal’s opinion, reference to the 2001 Business Plan in this context merely provides
particulars on the application of the mechanism already set out in the Services Agreement.

Indeed, the reference to the 2001 Business Plan at Schedule E cannot extend to the Financial
Model, or to the investor's anticipated returns. On a plain reading of Schedule E, the mention
of the 2001 Business Plan primarily relates to the sub-section of the 2001 Business Plan on
“Justified Profitability.” This section as well as the appendix to which it refers do not mention
the Financial Model. They rather define the expected return with reference to the selected
proxies, as also foreshadowed by Schedule E of the Services Agreement:

Comparison will be made with Estonian companies in business areas
such as waste disposal, electricity production, and other utility type

businesses. The minimum return to the Company will always be in line
with these proxies.’°> [Emphasis added]

Even if it could be said that Schedule E referred to the entirety of the 2001 Business Plan,
which the Tribunal does not accept, the Tribunal would still find that this reference is of limited
importance considering that Schedule E ascribes greater weight to several other elements
factors for the purpose of fixing the K-coefficients (and thus the water tariffs), including an
analysis with 5 “suitable market comparables.” This is consistent with the evidence of both
Mr Pikamae, who testified that all of the specific factors listed in Schedule E were intended to
be subsidiary to the analysis of the selected comparables, as well as Mr Gallienne, who agreed
that the five (5) comparables was the starting point of the analysis.”°°

As aconsequence, the reference to the 2001 Business Plan at Schedule E cannot substantiate
a legitimate expectation that a departure from zero (0) for the K-coefficient would be informed
by the 2001 Business Plan’°” or, more generally, that the investor could legitimately expect to
earn any return implied therein. The situation thus significantly differs from that in Walter Bau
v Thailand, commented above at paragraph 602, where the parties, including State entities,
explicitly considered and addressed the level of expected return.

The undertaking of the City to use reasonable efforts to implement the 2001 Business Plan,
as recorded in the Letter of Understanding, does not affect this finding. The Letter of
Understanding merely consists of a best-effort undertaking in this regard, which can hardly be
assimilated to a specific commitment towards the investor concerning the determination of
tariffs. The general nature of this undertaking cannot displace, or supplement, the terms of the
Services Agreement pertaining to the mechanism for setting tariffs or, more precisely, the
meaning of justified profitability.

(ii) The Stability of the Regulatory Framework

The second element pertinent to the analysis of Claimants’ expectations consists in the various
clauses of the privatisation agreements regarding changes in the law and the identity of the
regulator.

* Positions of the Parties and relevant facts
Respondent submits that, in the Service Agreements, ASTV expressly accepted that the

regulatory framework might change over the license period, and that ASTV undertook to
comply with such changes. 7°

692. First, the definition of ASTV’s mandate refers to the “right to charge Tariff pursuant to the
Statutory Requirements,””°° which are defined as comprising changes to the applicable law
and regulations over time:

[A]ll applicable laws, regulations and legal requirements and Directives

having the force of law from time to time during the Mandate Period
and the requirements of all Required Consents [...]’"° [Emphasis
added]

693. Second, Clause 7, which specifically governs the setting of tariffs, also refers to the “Statutory
Requirements”:

The Tariffs which the Company may charge to Clients shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and
Statutory Requirements and as provided in this Clause 7.711

694. The same clause further provides that the tariff shall reflect the K-coefficient “to the extent
consistent with the Tariff Criteria,”’'? which are similarly defined as “the criteria for determining
the Rates of Tariffs as set out in Part | of Schedule E as the same may be amended or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with the Statutory Requirements””'’. Similarly,
Schedule E: Part 1 refers to the setting of tariff “in accordance with the PWSSA,””"4 which is
also defined as including its amendments.’15

695. Third, Respondent emphasises that Clause 10(1)(a) of the Services Agreement provides that
the Statutory Requirements prevail over the terms of the agreement in case of conflict:

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company
shall at its own cost carry out its obligations under this Agreement and
shall comply at all times with all Statutory Requirements and Required
Consents (including those introduced after the date of this
Agreement).7"6

Mr Rask, Respondent's Estonian law expert, opines that under Estonian law these provisions
make clear that ASTV recognised and agreed that it would be bound by changes to the
regulatory framework, including changes to the 1999 PWSSA.71®

Respondent also submits that Clause 5(4)a) of the Services Agreement anticipated a change
of regulator:

It is acknowledged by the parties that under Statutory Requirements to
be enacted in the future, certain of the functions of the Mandate
Monitoring Unit may be transferred to an independent water utilities
regulator (the “Regulator”) pursuant to a regulatory framework to be
established in accordance with Statutory Requirements. To the extent
that such functions are so transferred, the Mandate Monitoring Unit
shall cease to exercise such functions.”'9 [Emphasis added]

As noted above at paragraph 180, the Services Agreement defines the Regulator as including
an entity to be appointed pursuant to the framework for the establishment of the MMU, the
purpose of which purpose was to monitor ASTV’s compliance with the Levels of Services.”2°

Respondent draws support, in a similar way, from the undertaking by ASTV to comply with any
orders and directives issued by “any Competent Authority” pursuant to Clause 10(1)(b) of the
Services Agreement, whereas the definition of “Competent Authority” was open-ended:721

“Competent Authority” includes any court of competent jurisdiction and
any local, national or supranational agency, inspectorate, department,
local city, minister, ministry, official or public or statutory person
(whether autonomous or not) acting within their competence and
authority in or of the Government and includes (without limitation) the
Regulator, the Tallinn Environmental Agency and the Tallinn Health
Protection Authority [...].722

Mr Sellner, a member of the team advising the City of Tallinn on the privatisation, offered
relevant evidence on this point. He confirmed that the identity of the regulator, as well as the
regulatory regime remained unknown throughout the privatisation process: “there was no
regulator, there was no regulatory regime.”’? Questioned on the discussion of the same
subject between the City, its advisors and the bidders, he explained that, notwithstanding the

lack of written record on this point, it was obvious that the City of Tallinn could not bind any
future regulator by way of the privatisation agreements.724

According to Mr Sellner, it also was also clear to every stakeholder that the City of Tallinn, also
an owner of ASTV, was not a regulator in the usual sense. The expectation was thus that the
regulatory functions assumed by the City at the time would be transferred to an independent
State authority, referred to as the “Regulator” in the draft agreements. Until this transfer, the
City’s advisors had suggested that the MMU assume ASTV’s regulatory matters, including
tariffs.’ Mr Sellner explained that, whenever bidders raised the issue of tariff setting for the
years after 2005, they were told that there could be “no guarantees, especially given that the
MMU was yet to be established, and even that would in turn be replaced by a new regulator
further in the future, whom the City of Tallinn could not bind by the contracts signed upon the
privatisation.”726

For their part, Claimants argue that references in the Services Agreement to “Statutory
Requirements” and the like cannot displace the parties’ intentions and expectations that the
tariffs were to be set according to parameters determined in the Services Agreement:

The Services Agreement was the solution adopted by the City of
Tallinn, to provide sufficient clarity of the regulatory and tariff regime
that would apply to provide bidders with the confidence to bid in the
knowledge they would be able to obtain a return over the period of the
Services Agreement. It should be borne in mind that while each of the
bidders could comment on and propose changes to the Services
Agreement, it was ultimately the City of Tallinn, as regulator, that
determined what was in the final version offered to all of the Qualified
Bidders.’2”

Therefore, changes in the applicable legal framework could not have been, and were not,
intended or expected to annihilate completely the tariff framework established by the Services
Agreement on the basis of which the privatisation proceeded.’° This understanding would be
consistent with and further demonstrated by the fact that the privatisation agreements do not

724 Tr. Day 4 Mr Sellner 52:11-25: “Q. [...] The question was: was there any discussion that the City of
Tallinn could not bind any future regulator by the contracts signed at the time of privatisation? A. There was
discussion, of course, yes, because there was no regulatory regime. Q. Do you recall seeing any document
where this was recorded? A. Where what was recorded? Q. That the City of Tallinn could not bind any
future regulatory regime? A. Well, that goes without saying. How could it possibly be done by a regime that
we don't know how it will be?” [Emphasis added]

725 Sellner WS, 9914 and 15. He further explained that an MMU does not generally replace the regulator,
since regulatory functions lie solely with sovereign entities. Rather, the MMU was seen as an advisor to the
actual regulator, the City of Tallinn.

set out a general applicable tariff regime, but apply specifically and solely to the privatised
ASTV.728

Regarding the possibility of a change of regulator, Claimants do not dispute that the Services
Agreement foreshadowed the appointment of a new regulator.”°° In their submission, however,
such a change was not intended to divorce the determination of tariffs from the monitoring of
the quality of ASTV’s services, the task to be entrusted to the MMU. This can be inferred for
example from Clause 5(4)(d) of the Services Agreement, which states that:

I]n addition to exercising the functions of the Mandate Monitoring Unit,
the Regulator may also be the person responsible under the Statutory
Requirements for the setting of Tariffs and the provisions of Clause
7(4) and Clause 9 shall apply accordingly.’°' [Emphasis added]

In this respect, it is also to be noted that, pursuant to Clause 7(4), the City undertook that it,
the “Regulator” or any other person responsible for the setting of tariffs shall determine these
tariffs according to Clause 7 of the Services Agreement, which lays out the method for
determining tariffs. It is also indicated in this Article 7(4) that the Rates can be modified as a
consequence of a change of law.

In the same vein, Mr Gallienne testified that he was aware that a change of regulator could
occur, but understood that any new regulator would “regulate [ASTV]'s contract.””°2

« Findings of the Tribunal regarding the stability of the regulatory
framework

The Tribunal agrees with the interpretation offered by Respondent. The Services Agreement
terms plainly disclosed to Claimants that the regulatory framework was not static and, what is
more, that change was indeed likely. There is no stabilisation clause here; the relevant
provisions could even be said to comprise anti-stabilisation clauses.

These elements must also be considered against the legal environment prevailing in 2001. At
that time, the PWSSA was a newly enacted law within a newly independent State and the
evidence establishes that this yielded uncertainty (which, as commented in the previous
section, provoked discussion among other things on the meaning of justified profitability).
Moreover, the City of Tallinn, the sole State entity involved in the privatisation and which made
any representations whatsoever to the bidders, did not have authority under Estonian law to
guarantee the maintenance of the 1999 PWSSA or the stability of any element of the Estonian
legal order. In the light as well of Mr Sellner’s evidence, it simply cannot be sustained that an

investor as sophisticated as UUTBV”® could have formed the expectation that the regulatory
regime prevailing at the time of the investment would apply throughout the Mandate Period.

This is so irrespective of the specificity of the tariff regime that the parties to the privatisation
agreements may have set out to craft. The City of Tallinn and the investors may have
negotiated an interpretation of “justified profitability” and a mechanism for setting tariffs under
the 1999 PWSSA. They could not, however, and it could not have been reasonably
understood, that in doing so they would bind the Central Government and the Estonian
Parliament to a legislative or regulatory freeze or to a commitment to respect that mechanism
notwithstanding legislative change. The current matter is not analogous to Perenco v Ecuador,
commented above at paragraphs 598-600, insofar that, here, the privatisation agreements
were not “anchored in a legislative framework duly considered and enacted by the [Estonian
Parliament].””4

e) Conclusions of the Tribunal on Claimants’ Legitimate Expectations at the
time of the Privatisation

In the light of the foregoing, the Tribunal is not satisfied that, in entering into the privatisation
agreements, Claimants formed legitimate expectations protected under the Treaty.

That the privatisation was aimed at attracting a foreign investor and its expertise, that the
investment was understood to be a long-term project, and that the investor structured its bid
in a “front-loaded” manner may all be so. These do not, however, substantiate either the
legitimacy of the Claimants’ expectations under international law or the far-reaching
obligations of Respondent that Claimants allege and seek to vindicate here.

As mentioned above, the commitment on which the investors claim to have relied in making
their investment must be assessed by reference among other things to the terms of the
relevant contracts. Context is certainly significant. However, the privatisation agreements at
issue here themselves belie Claimants’ claims.

As noted above, the Tribunal does not find that the privatisation agreements or other
manifestations of the will of the City contained or constituted a commitment to any type of
implied return or specific level of profitability.

Moreover, not only do the privatisation agreements lack any stabilisation clause, but their
terms plainly exclude any expectation of legal or regulatory stability, or any specific
commitment to shield the privatisation from future legal or regulatory change — which is
perhaps not surprising given the lack of involvement in the privatisation by the Central
Government, the State entity with jurisdiction to adopt and amend the PWSSA.

733 Ancillary, the Tribunal notes that the Information Memorandum advised the prospective bidders to seek
their own legal advice regarding the legal statement made there which included general explanation on the
PWSSA and the applicable regulations, C-10, ASTV Information Memorandum (3 July 2000), p 158.

In the circumstances, Claimants could not legitimately expect that what they refer to as the
“key principles” of the privatisation agreements would be maintained throughout the Mandate
Period.

f) The Legality of the Services Agreement and the 2002 and 2007
Amendments

Estonia claims that the Services Agreement, the 2002 Amendment as well as the 2007
Amendment were unlawful. Although it is not strictly necessary to do so, the Tribunal will briefly
address these issues for the sake of completeness.

Mr Rask, Respondent's legal expert, posits that the Services Agreement and its amendments
were formally unlawful because they were entered into by the Tallinn City Government rather
than the City Council.”%° According to him, the City Council wrongly delegated the
establishment of a mechanism for setting ASTV’s tariffs to the Tallinn City Government in
adopting the 22 December 1999 Resolution and then contravened to the 1999 PWSSA, which
required that such a mechanism be established by the Council itself.”5°

Mr Rask also opines that the Services Agreement, the 2002 and the 2007 Amendments were
substantially unlawful for they would not prescribe the determination of tariffs based on costs.
This unlawfulness would be heightened for the 2002 and 2007 Amendments, since they would
both fix tariffs over an improperly long period.”°”

Mr Rask goes on to explain that, as a matter of Estonian law, an administrative act (or
administrative contract) will be deemed retroactively void where its illegality was obvious (or if
declared as such by a court or the parties to the agreement). In the case at hand, he concludes
that it is “debatable” whether the Services Agreement was null ab initio, and defers to the
Estonian courts on this point. Yet, the 2002 and 2007 Amendments’ unlawfulness would be
obvious, thereby warranting a finding of retrospective nullity.’°°

With regards to the formal unlawfulness, both the Tallinn District Court and the Supreme Court
of Estonia have ruled that it is inappropriate for Estonia to raise the formal unlawfulness of the
Services Agreement. The Tallinn Circuit Court found that the Services Agreement (and its
amendments) could be performed until 31 October 2010 (i.e. up to the entry into force of the
AMB) and that Estonia may not “retrospectively raise” the question.”°° The Supreme Court of
Estonia reached a similar conclusion but added that, upon the entry into force of the 2010

PWSSA, the Services Agreement was no longer capable of performance because this new
legislation had modified the principles for calculating justified profitability.”4°

In the light of these findings, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to address Mr Rask’s
somewhat qualified suggestion concerning the formal unlawfulness of the Services Agreement
and its 2002 and 2007 Amendments.

With regards to the substantive unlawfulness, the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court both
stated interpreted the 1999 PWSSA as precluding the fixing of tariffs over an extensive period
of time, but both refrained from making any finding as to the illegality of the agreements at
hand and the obvious character of such illegality.”4"

In the Tribunal’s opinion, Respondent has failed to establish that the 2002 and 2007
Amendments, as well as the Services Agreement, must be found null due to their alleged
substantive unlawfulness. Such unlawfulness, if any, could hardly have been considered as
obvious considering that industry practice may diverge, as discussed below at paragraphs 849
and following, and the absence of legislative guidance, let alone any obvious limitation under
applicable Estonian law at the time.

5) The Impact of Post-Privatisation Events on Claimants’ Legitimate
Expectations

The Parties have also made detailed submissions commented on certain post-privatisation
events that, in their view, either confirmed or undermined any legitimate expectations that
Claimants might have held. The Tribunal addresses these briefly below, notwithstanding that
their bearing is limited in view of the finding of absence of legitimate expectations at the time
of the privatisation.

a) The Payment of Management Fees and Dividends to UUTBV, and the
Restructuring of ASTV

As to the payment of management fees and dividends to UUTBV, Respondent argues that
UUTBV recouped 83% of its investment over the first years of the privatisation, in particular by
means of ongoing management fees charged to ASTV and the payment of dividends and the
restructuring of ASTV's capital, referred above at paragraphs 193-195.742

740 Decision of the Supreme Court of Estonia of 12 December 2017, 24. It is noted that the Supreme Court
then refers to the exclusion of the privatisation value as a basis for calculating justified profitability under
the 2010 PWSSA: “Unlike the Circuit Court, the Chamber still admits that the new version of the PWSSA
created a legal situation, in which it was not any more possible to follow the Services Agreement not only
due to the change in the regulator's competence, but also due to the issue with the size of tariffs. The
PWSSA’s new version specifies the term justified profitability by prescribing the ‘justified profitability on the
capital invested by the water undertaking’ to serve as a basis for the tariffs. In the Chamber's view, the
amendment has made it impossible to take the privatisation value as a basis for calculating the justified
profitability.”

Decision of 26 January 2017, 421.

727. Regarding the management fees, Respondent obliquely criticises UUTBV for having entered
into a Technical Services Agreement with ASTV, pursuant to which ASTV agreed to pay
UUTBV management fees in return for certain management services.’ It is noted that
Dr Hern, Respondent's economic expert, did not consider this element of Estonia's claims in
view of what he considered a lack of relevant data.”44

728. For their part, Claimants explain that UUTBV always envisaged the possibility that as part of
the privatisation it might be necessary to bring into ASTV certain of its experts to stabilise and
improve ASTV’s operations and efficiency.”“° The 2001 Business Plan provided that ASTV
would enter into two (2) agreements, one with an affiliate of United Utilities International and
one with an affiliate of International Water, and detailed the fees to be paid pursuant to these
agreements.’4° On 12 December 2000, Suprema requested particulars on these aspects of
the Business Plan’? and on 18 December 2000, UUTBV agreed to merge the two (2)
agreements and provided the requested information on the fees to be charged.’#® These
letters were later annexed to the Closing Memorandum.”4°

729. Respondent also claims that, by November 2001, UUTBV had recovered the total sum of
EUR 36.5 million from its EUR 44 million investment by way of two (2) transactions: (i) the
payment of dividends by ASTV for a total amount of EUR 11.6 million in 2001, which resulted
in a EUR 5.9 million dividend to UUTBV7®° and which was made from an investment reserve
accumulated by ASTV prior to the privatisation’! and (ii) a reduction of ASTV’s share capital
of ASTV by 80%,” from EUR 71.3 million to EUR 12.8 million, corresponding to a EUR 30.6
million payout for UUTBV.753

730. Claimants do not appear to have engaged with Respondent as to the payment of dividends.
As to the restructuration of ASTV’s capital, Claimants submit that, as with the management
fees, the 2001 Business Plan specifically envisaged this restructuring in order to optimise
ASTV’'s capital structure and align it with those of other water undertakings. They nonetheless

acknowledge that, pursuant to the 2001 Business Plan, the modification of ASTV's capital was
to be achieved only at the end of the first Operating Period.’

The Tribunal finds that the transactions criticized by the Respondent were, for the most part,
planned before the execution of the privatisation agreements. As a result, they have no bearing
on any alleged expectations of the Claimants.

b) The 2002 Amendment to the Services Agreement

As noted above at paragraph 196 the Services Agreement was amended in 2002 to address
two (2) matters: a review of the K-coefficients for the years of 2003 to 2005, and the
determination of the K-coefficients for the years of 2006 to 2010; and the establishment of the
MMU.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the 2002 Amendment was entered into at the request of the City
of Tallinn, which, in the context of the rising cost of living in Estonia generally, was concerned
by the impact on the City’s residents of the agreed tariff increases for the 2001-2005 period
laid out in the 2001 Business Plan. The City asked, and ASTV agreed, that these increases
instead be spread out over a longer period, specifically, until 2010.75°

The Tribunal is further satisfied that, as submitted by Claimants,’5” the common intention of
the parties was not to increase the profitability of ASTV.75*

c) The Replacement of the 2000 EBRD Loan by the 2002 EBRD Loan

As stated above at paragraphs 203-206 and 626-628, the 2002 EBRD Loan replaced the 2000
EBRD Loan, which was never drawn.”®° The new facility sought to finance the NEP and other
investments required under the Services Agreement, to refinance the 1994 EBRD Loan, to
finance the costs of the 2000 EBRD Loan as well as to restructure ASTV’s balance sheet
through share capital reduction. In the context of this transaction, ASTV pledged all of its
material assets, present and future, and UUTBV pledged its shares.

Claimants submit that the 2002 EBRD Loan was beneficial to the Central Government’® since
it led to the release of the State Guarantee, as contemplated by the Information

Memorandum’*' (and thereby reinforced their legitimate expectations).’”°* Regarding the
pledging of ASTV’s assets, they underline that the 2000 EBRD Loan, which terms had been
penned before UUTBV’s bid, also provided for the entry into a share and retention agreement
as a condition precedent for the disbursements of the funds’® and that the 2001 Business
Plan had planned a rebalancing of the capital structure of ASTV by notably increasing debt
funding.76*

737. Respondent submits for its part that the 2002 EBRD Loan led ASTV to assume a riskier facility
and became necessary as a result of ASTV’s share capital reduction.’*° Considering that
UUTBV initiated the change in ASTV’s capital structure and that it had promised to carry out
the works over the 2001-2005 period, it would have been more proper, says Estonia, for
UUTBV to assume the risk associated with these actions.”

738. As regards ASTV’s capital restructuring and the 2001 dividend payment, the Tribunal has
already stated its opinion that the capital reduction achieved through the 2002 EBRD Loan
could not have undermined Claimants’ legitimate expectations, if such expectations had been
established, considering that it had been included in the 2001 Business Plan.

739. As for the impact of the 2002 EBRD Loan on the Central Government, the Tribunal merely
notes that these developments are elements of context but, on the facts at hands, they bear
minimal relevance for the establishing of any legitimate expectations alleged by Claimants.

762 They rely on s. 5.1 of the Loan, pursuant to which ASTV undertook to carry out the works according to
the Services Agreement and the “Shareholder Agreement Business Plan” (C-23, 2002 Loan Agreement
between ASTV and EBRD (8 November 2002), s. 5.01) as well as on the letter of support issued by the
City on 5 September 2002. In this letter, which was a condition precedent to the Loan disbursement, the
City represented that the privatisation agreements, including the Services Agreement, constitute “valid and
binding obligation of the City” (Cl. Reply, 4108; C-305, City Support Letter (5 September 2002)). Prior to
the issuance of the letters, the City’s external advisors had also confirmed the validity of the Services
Agreement (C-302, Legal opinion from Paul Varul to the City of Tallinn (3 July 2002)).

privatisation: according to the Explanatory Memorandum, the drawing of additional loans would be for the
fulfilment of ASTV's investment plans. Resp. Rej., 4137, referring to C-9, Minutes of the meeting of the City

d) The Involvement of the EBRD as an Indirect Equity Investor from 2003 to
2010

740. As referred to above at paragraphs 207 and 208, the EBRD purchased a 25% stake in ASTV
in 2003 and exited its investment in 2010.76”

741. Claimants argue that the involvement of the EBRD constituted a further assurance as to both
the legitimacy of the privatisation agreements and the fact that ASTV would follow the 2001
Business Plan.76°

742. On this point, the Tribunal reiterates its comments regarding the impact of the involvement of
the EBRD in ASTV's privatisation above and at paragraph 629. The involvement of the EBRD
forms part of the relevant context and may have reinforced to some degree Claimants’
understanding of the legitimacy of the privatisation agreements. It does not constitute a
separate assurance giving rise to legally cognisable legitimate expectations.

e) The 2005 IPO

743. Claimants assert that the 2005 IPO reaffirmed the legitimacy of their expectations as to the
privatisation agreements,”°° notably because the IPO, an initiative of the mayor of Tallinn,
triggered considerable local attention. ASTV’s representatives would have, in turn made
presentations to international investors, with representatives of the City in attendance, on the
quality of the contractual arrangements and the stability of the tariff mechanism.””°

744. Respondent argues that the Prospectus actually demonstrates that Claimants anticipated
regulatory changes for it contained disclosures of risks associated with the tariff regime and
the regulatory framework’”! and implied that the 2011-2015 tariffs were not guaranteed.””2

745. By way of rebuttal, Claimants call for a contextual reading of the Prospectus’ disclosure of
risks by considering the special nature of this type of legal document. To the contrary, the IPO
constituted another instance where the tariff methodology of the Services Agreement was
restated, thereby reinforcing their expectations as to the legitimacy of this regime.””° They

770 Gallienne 1% WS, 9959-63. Claimants further submit that the stability of the contractual arrangement
was reflected in analysts’ reports that portrayed ASTV as a low-risk investment thanks to the tariff
arrangement prevailing until 2015 (C-116, Carnegie report on ASTV IPO, “A Pure Water Play” (4 May 2005);

Business Plan. Similarly, although the Prospectus mentions that the setting of the K coefficients until 2010
provides ASTV with “a stable platform for conducting its operations until 2010,” the Prospectus does not
make any equivalent statement with respect to 2011-2015 tariffs, C-113, Prospectus for ASTV 2005 IPO
(2005), pp 1944 and 1945.

773 Claimants’ Skeleton Argument, 948.

recognise that the Prospectus did not represent that the 2011-2015 tariffs were fixed. Yet, they
claim, the Prospectus made clear that, should the City of Tallinn impose levels of services
more onerous than contemplated, the associated increase in costs would be offset by a
corresponding increase in the K-coefficients.’”

746. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the caveats contained in the Prospectus confirm that it was clearly
understood that a change in the identity of ASTV’s regulator was foreseen and that its tariffs
were not entirely immune to intervention by the City acting in its regulatory capacity.

f) The 2007 Amendment

747. As mentioned above at paragraphs 221-224, in executing the 2007 Amendment, the City of
Tallinn and ASTV agreed to set the K-coefficients at zero (0) for the 2011-2020 period, that is,
extending beyond the term of ASTV’s license in 2015.75 This amendment has given rise to
several points of contention between the Parties, including the Respondent's claim of illegality
addressed above at paragraphs 717-724, the purpose of the 2007 Amendment and whether
this instrument can ground any legitimate expectation. The Tribunal will review these two (2)
last elements below.

(i) The Purpose of the 2007 Amendment

748. Claimants argue that, as with the 2002 Amendment, the 2007 Amendment was entered into
at the request of the City of Tallinn, in connection with the repayment of the NEP. The parties
to the Services Agreement would have agreed on K-coefficients for the period 2010-2020 to
offset the financial risks associated with the extension of the repayment of the NEP and the

749. According to Respondent, Claimants’ real motive in setting the K-coefficients until 2020 was
to mitigate the risks arising out of a potential change of regulator, which they believed would
impose a negative K-coefficient on ASTV.’8 Respondent submits that the 2007 Amendment
was executed in the wake of widespread discussion of impending regulatory changes and was

of the deferral of payments by the City of Tallinn because such costs were offset by 11% interest on the
City's deferred payments, Resp. PHB, 159. However, Respondent does not appear to directly engage with
Claimants’ argument that the 2007 Amendment sought to offset the financial risks (as opposed to costs)

specifically designed to address ASTV’s concern that starting in 2010 its tariffs would be
impacted by a negative K-coefficient.’”? Respondent then places particular reliance on a
September 2006 strategy note authored by Roch Cheroux, who was ASTV’s CEO at the time
and who conducted the negotiations leading to the 2007 Amendment.’®° In this note,
Mr Cheroux stated:

Fixing the k coefficient at a positive or 0 value is the first objective
because, considering the level of profitability of the company, it's most
probable that the 2010 price review will end up with a negative k
coefficient.’* [Emphasis added]

 

750. Mr Gallienne, who held various positions at for ASTV from April 2002 to October 2014,7%
testified at length on these issues. His testimony supports Claimants’ position regarding the
rationale for the 2007 Amendment and the fixing of tariffs beyond the License Period.’
ASTV's express and overriding objective was then to reassure the market about the stability
of ASTV7& and the 2007 Amendment would have thus further reinforced Claimants’
confidence in the stability in the tariff mechanism.78

751. At the Hearing, Mr Gallienne referred to this setting of the K-coefficient as a “baseline
agreement,” which could be departed from by the regulator in certain circumstances and could
not provide investment certainty.”°° He conceded that the financial models elaborated for the
purposes of the 2007 Amendment did consider the consequences of a negative K-

coefficient”®” and that avoiding negative K-coefficients in every year from 2011 would translate
into a gain of “tens of millions.”78°

752. As for ASTV's knowledge of the forthcoming change of regulator, Respondent highlights that
Mr Gallienne confirmed during the Hearing that ASTV became aware of the Chancellor of
Justice’s report of 2005, regarding the potential abuse of dominance in the water industry, at
the time of its publication.”°° He also acknowledged that ASTV was aware of the criticism
directed at ASTV’s tariffs at the time.”°° It is of note, however that, at this juncture, the reforms
of the Ministry of Environment focused on the failure of some municipalities to set water tariffs
at a sufficiently high level to cover needed works and that the endeavours which eventually
led to the creation of the AMB had not begun yet.

753. The Tribunal is content that the 2007 Amendment had not for primary purpose to mitigate the
risk of a change of regulator. This does, however, affect the Tribunal’s finding made above
that Claimants could not have expected that their regulatory regime, including the identity of
the regulator, would remain unchanged.

(ii) The Impact of the Alleged Illegality of the 2007 Amendment

 

754. As addressed above, Respondent alleges that the 2007 Amendments was unlawful in an
obvious manner.”*' As a result, the 2007 Amendment could not ground any of Claimants’
alleged legitimate expectations as a matter of international law. They refer to Mamidoil v
Albania, in which the tribunal held that the investor could not claim any rights relating to the
continuation of activities considered illegal under domestic law.7°?

755. By way of rebuttal, Claimants submit that Respondent is barred altogether from relying on the
alleged illegality of the 2002 and 2007 Amendments pursuant to the doctrine of estoppel,’
which applies here due to Estonia's involvement in these instruments.

claims, given that Respondent had shown its willingness to consider a legalization once the respective
applications were made. Absent such legalization, however, Claimant could not legitimately expect that it
could continue its activities in Albania despite their illegality.”

Respondent challenges the application of this doctrine and, alternatively, submits that it cannot
be construed as preventing the host State from exercising its regulatory power.’°* According
to Respondent, Estonia has not created any reliance since it was not involved in either the
creation or the approval of the 2002 and 2007 Amendments. Should estoppel nonetheless
apply, it would only defeat its case as to the illegality of the 2002 and 2007 Amendments, but
would not prevent Estonia from exercising its regulatory powers in respect of the
amendments.7°>

Considering the Tribunal’s findings regarding the alleged illegality of the 2007 Amendmert, it
is not necessary to assess whether the doctrine of estoppel finds application. That being said,
and as suggested by Respondent, this issue is distinct from the question of Estonia's use of
its regulatory powers.

It is also unnecessary to consider whether Claimants can derive any legitimate expectations
from the 2007 Amendment notwithstanding that it was entered into after the investment.
Indeed, since Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they had gained any legitimate
expectations at the time of privatisation, the impact of the 2007 Amendment on these alleged
expectations does not bear relevance. Furthermore, one can hardly conceive that the 2007
Amendment could, alone, suffice to substantiate legitimate expectations since terms of the
Services Agreement that disclosed a potential change in the law and of the regulator were not
amended by this instrument.

g) The 2009 Amendment and the Foregoing of a 2% K-coefficient

Claimants contend that the execution of the 2009 Amendment provides further confirmation of
their expectation arising from the privatisation agreements. This final amendment to the
Services Agreement did not affect the determination of water tariffs. It too was entered into at
the request of the City,’°° specifically to decrease (as opposed to extend over time) the City’s
payments to ASTV for the NEP so as to reflect the significant decrease in construction costs
in Estonia.7°”

In October 2009, ASTV further agreed to decrease the 2010 K-coefficient from +2 to 0 (i.e., to
forego the previously agreed tariff increase for 2010),’°* specifically to take account of the
impact of the ongoing recession in Estonia.’9°

based on Post-Privatisation Events

761. In sum, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they could held any
legitimate expectations based on post-privatisation events protected under the Treaty.

6) Claim of Breach of the FET Independently of the Existence of Legitimate
Expectations

762. The Tribunal turns here to Claimants’ claims of a breach of the FET standard that, they submit,
go beyond and are separate from their legitimate expectations claim.

763. Claimants advance that Respondent breached the FET standard through a process that
started in 2009. The crux of their claim lies in the rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application by the
ECA on 2 May 2011 and the adoption by the ECA of the ECA Prescription on 10 October 2011
by which ASTV was ordered to re-apply for tariffs 29% lower than its 2010 tariffs. Both of these
decisions were taken by the ECA on the basis of the recently- enacted 2010 PWSSA
(introduced by the AMB) and its Methodology.

764. The Tribunal will first address Respondent's legal argument regarding the application of the
police powers doctrine and the impact, if any, of the good faith or bad faith of Respondent's
organs. It will next review the factual evidence regarding the purpose of the AMB and its the
adoption, and the basis of the 2011 Tariff Application and its rejection by the ECA. The Tribunal
will then assess the expert evidence regarding the legal status of the Services Agreement
upon the entry into force of the AMB and regarding the adoption of the Methodology.

a) The Relevance of the Doctrine of Police Powers and of the Good Faith of
Respondent

765. Respondent alleges that the adoption of the AMB was a bona fide exercise of its regulatory
powers consistent with the police powers doctrine: Estonia acted in good faith and the
impugned measures consist of non-discriminatory regulatory acts.®°° Respondent
acknowledges that tribunals have typically applied the police powers doctrine in the context of
expropriation claims but contends that the doctrine applies equally in FET cases.®'

800 Resp. C-M, 1400-406.

801 Respondent relies on Spyridon Roussalis v Romania, where the tribunal found that the updating of food
and safety regulations upon Romania's accession to the EU and the application of the new regulations to
the investment at issue did not breach any legitimate expectations of the claimant. The claimant had argued
that the revocation of a permit was unjustifiable and discriminatory and that Romania had failed to protect
its legitimate expectations by conducting several inspections and imposing severe penalties for failure to
comply with the updated regulations (it being unchallenged that the operator was not in compliance with
those regulations). The tribunal found that Romania did not violate international law because the impugned
actions were taken pursuant to regulations which reflected “a clear and legitimate public purpose” and
explained: In the Tribunal’s view, “Claimant may not have expected that the State would refrain from
adopting regulations in the public interest, nor may Claimant have expected that the Romanian authorities
would refrain from implementing those regulations,” RL-151, Spyridon Roussalis v Romania, |CSID Case
No. ARB/06/1, Award (7 December 2011), 4691.

174

766. Claimants submit that the doctrine does not apply as separate, affirmative defence to FET
claims. They refer to Suez v Argentina in which the tribunal found that it is unnecessary and
inappropriate to apply the police powers doctrine to a FET claim because the police powers
analysis is effectively subsumed in the FET analysis. That is, a breach of the FET standard
necessarily entails a finding that the State has exceeded its reasonable right to regulate.
Claimants also point out that it is well-established that a breach of the FET standard does not
require evidence of bad faith on the part of the State®°° and submit that, should it be
established that the AMB was specifically targeted at ASTV, Respondent's burden to
demonstrate that its conduct was fair and equitable would be heightened.®4

767. The Tribunal tends to agree with Claimants — and with the approach adopted by the tribunal
in Suez v Argentina. The essence of the FET standard is to assess and balance, in the
circumstances and on the facts of a given case, the State's right to regulate (which entails the
right to interfere to some degree with investors’ rights) and the legitimate expectations of
foreign investors. A finding of a violation of the FET standard necessarily entails a
determination that the State exceeded its reasonable right to regulate, and to interfere with
investors’ rights. There is no need for a separate, “duplicative” assessment of the State’s right
to regulate under the police powers doctrine. Additionally, because bad faith is not essential,
the absence of clear targeting of the investment in question would not necessarily preclude a
violation of the FET standard. Evidence of bad faith may nonetheless indicate elements of
arbitrariness in the State conduct, which should also be weighed in the analysis.

b) The Purpose of the AMB and its Adoption

768. Claimants allege that the AMB provisions concerning profitability in the Estonian water sector
targeted ASTV with the objective of curtailing its profits. They do not dispute that the AMB may
have embraced other objectives, including addressing what the Parties have referred to as the

802 Cl. Reply, 9219-226, referring to CL-104, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and
Interagua Servicios Integrales de Agua, S.A. v Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision
on Liability (30 July 2010), 4148: “The police powers doctrine is a recognition that States have a reasonable
right to regulate foreign investments in their territories even if such regulation affects investor property
rights. In effect. the doctrine seeks to strike a balance between a State's right to requlate and the property
rights of foreign investors in their territory. However, the application of the police powers doctrine as_an
explicit, affirmative defense to treaty claims other than for expropriation is inappropriate, because in judging
those claims and applying such principles as full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment,
both of which are considered in subsequent sections of this Decision, a tribunal must take account of a
State’s reasonable right to regulate. Thus, if a tribunal finds that a State has violated treaty standards of fair
and equitable treatment and full protection and security, it must of necessity have determined that such
State has exceeded its reasonable right to requlate. Consequently, for that same tribunal to make a
subsequent inquiry as to whether that same State has exceeded its legitimate police powers would require
that tribunal to engage in an inquiry it has already made. In short, a decision on the application of the police
powers doctrine in such circumstance would be duplicative and therefore inappropriate.”

“Low Tariff Problem,” that is, the deliberate pricing of water and sewerage services below
levels required to finance the necessary infrastructure works.®°5

According to Respondent, the AMB sought to depoliticise the determination of water tariffs and
to ensure the application of fair and sustainable tariffs by introducing a central, independent
regulator.® It notes that, in dismissing ASTV’s complaint, the European Commission found
that the AMB was motivated by public interest, and underlines that prior to the enactment of
the AMB, various State entities and stakeholders had suggested such a transfer of authority.
More specifically, it notes that, in its pre-closure letter, the European Commission stated:

It is within a Member State’s discretion to decide to change a legal
regime seeking to attain justified legitimate objectives. As argued by
the Estonian authorities, there was a need to change the existing
regulatory regime of the water sector in Estonia in order to prevent
situations of conflicts of interest (where the price setting authority is at
the same time a shareholder at the undertaking) and to ensure a fair
price for consumers. For that, an independent control mechanism had
to be established. Moreover, the new regime ensures increased
transparency and better regulation for setting tariffs for water services.
Hence one could consider that the objective of the change in the
regulatory regime in the water sector is justified on the grounds of
public interest.

Ll

It is true that the legat and contractual framework of the privatisation of
the Company provides for certain guarantees for investors and creates
certain legal expectations. However, the principle of legal expectations
does not mean that restrictions on persons’ rights or a cessation of
benefits are impermissible as such. As it was mentioned earlier, it is at
the Member State's discretion to change a legal regime if it considers
that this is a proportionate way to achieve a legitimate objective.°”

The following review of the evidence is divided into three (3) sections: the 2005-2009 reform
proposals (i), the development of the AMB (ii) and the introduction of the AMB (iii).

(i) 2005-2009 Regulatory Proposals

Respondent refers to the work and statements of various actors, beginning in 2005, concerning
the reform of water tariff regulation. These, it says, ultimately led to proposals for the creation
of a national regulator. More specifically, Respondent mentions the three (3) reform proposals
referred above at paragraphs 211 and following:

«The reform proposal of the Ministry of Environment;
© The reform proposal of the Chancellor of Justice;
© The reform proposal of the State Audit Office.

Unlike the Chancellor of Justice’s proposal, which they contend was directly targeted at ASTV
(their position in this regard forms part of their due process claim), Claimants contend that the
Ministry of Environment and the State Audit Office initiatives aimed at redressing the Low Tariff
Problem specifically, which was no longer an issue with ASTV after its privatisation. According
to Claimants, the AMB as adopted contained provisions directed at ASTV unrelated to and
which did not originate from the Ministry of Environment's or State Audit Office’s proposals.®°

Ms Kroon acknowledged during the Hearing that the focal point of the Ministry of Environment
proposed reform was indeed the Low Tariff Problem, and that the State Audit Office was
concerned with the same issue.®° That being said, she also explained that the Ministry of
Environment, in developing a control mechanism for tariffs, had also considered the issue of
having tariffs set at a fair level, as appears from a 2009 draft authored by the Ministry of
Environment.®1°

Similarly, Respondent notes that, in his 2009 Q4 report to UUTBV, Mr Plenderleith recognised
that the Ministry of Environment's draft bill, just as the AMB, sought to transfer authority over
water tariffs from the City to the ECA and stated that ASTV intended to work closely with the
relevant institutions to influence the outcome.®"'

The Tribunal is satisfied that the evidence does indeed show that the Ministry of Environment
intended to propose the transfer of authority over water tariffs from municipalities to a national
authority, and that this fact was known to Claimants. In any event, the extent to which the
Ministry of Environment and the State Audit Office may have been concerned with ASTV’s
tariffs does not bear significantly on the issue to be determined since, as discussed below, it
is clear that the provisions of the AMB that predominantly affected ASTV were not of their
initiative.

(ii) The Motivation behind the AMB and the Alleged Lack of Investigation and
Analysis by its Sponsors
Claimants contend that Mr Vaher and Mr Reinsalu, the two (2) members of the Estonian

Parliament who formally sponsored the AMB, acted irresponsibly by introducing the AMB in
order to force a decrease in ASTV’s tariffs without having duly investigated and analysed the

matter.°? This, Claimants say, forms part of what they refer to as a concerted campaign
against ASTV that began in 2009.°'3

777. — Firstly, Claimants contend that Messrs. Vaher and Reinsalu wrongly focused on ASTV’s profit
margin,®"* and they attribute the EOKL’s various pronouncements in this regard to Mr Vaher
and Mr Reinsalu, both of whom were members of EOKL’s board during the relevant period.°"5

778. According to Claimants, ASTV’s profit margin is not a proper proxy for assessing their
compliance with the 1999 PWSSA, as confirmed by the fact that none of the economic experts
who testified in this arbitration has relied on this metric. Claimants contend that the EOKL’s
and Messrs. Vaher’s and Reinsalu’s statements were further misleading since they were
restricted to yearly profit margins or tariff increases in certain years which did not reflect the
overall economic framework of the privatisation.®"®

779.  Inresponse, Estonia reminds the Tribunal that other stakeholders had made statements critical
of ASTV, and that the EOKL itself had taken a position on the issue,®"” before Mr Vaher joined
the EOKL board in 2009.88 According to Mr Vaher, the EOKL would have started to look into
Tallinn’s water tariff in 2008.®" It published a first article critical of ASTV on 1 August 2008
and, in a January 2009 press release it expressly called for the reduction of ASTV's tariffs.6°
Other public statements by the EOKL followed in May 2009, September 2009 and October
2009.81 Mr Vaher also disputes that he and Mr Reinsalu had any decisive influence over the

780. Second, Claimants also claim that the fact that Messrs. Vaher and Reinsalu decided to
introduce the AMB in April 2009 demonstrates that they acted on an ill-informed basis.®°

781. Mr Vaher in fact confirmed that he and Mr Reinsalu took the decision to introduce the AMB
before the release of the ECA Analysis of ASTV’s tariffs in November 2009. According to
Mr Vaher, he and Mr Reinsalu nonetheless gathered information from multiple sources,
including the ECA, the Chancellor of Justice, the EOKL and the media.®#4

782. Claimants submit that none of these sources could have actually informed their decision to go
forward with the introduction of the AMB. Reference to the works of the Chancellor of Justice
would be irrelevant considering that the latter first took interest in ASTV in June 2009.®5 Nor
could Messrs. Reinsalu and Vaher’s purported consultation with the EOKL be germane due to
their involvement in the organisation. Similarly, any reference to the media would be misplaced
because most of the media coverage in fact resulted from the EOKL’s activity.®6

783. As far as the contacts between the ECA and Messrs. Vaher and Reinsalu are concerned, it is
established that they met in June 2009 and that Mr Ots shared with them the ECA's preliminary
findings regarding ASTV’s tariffs. This included the ECA’s estimate that ASTV’s profitability
was 19.6%, the figure that Mr Vaher and Mr Reinsalu would later include in the AMB Letter
that was in turn appended to the AMB draft as introduced in Parliament in October 2009.°27
The Tribunal notes that, according to Claimants, it was inappropriate for Mr Ots to share this
preliminary information with Messrs. Vaher and Reinsalu, including because the ECA
ultimately concluded that ASTV’s profitability was of 18.1% and that its so-called investigation
was deficient and lacked due process.®°

784. Third, Mr Vaher confirms that he and Mr Reinsalu did not consult with either ASTV or the City
of Tallinn.8° Mr Vaher testified that he became aware of the existence of the Services

Agreement through the media and that he had no knowledge of its 15-year term or its tariff
mechanism.®° He explained that, considering that the AMB’s primary objective lay in the
centralisation of authority over the regulation of tariffs (as opposed to the principles for
determining tariffs), it was simply not necessary to consider the impact of the AMB’s on the
arrangements in force.®%1

Simply put, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to engage in an analysis of or in any
way to rule on the conduct and motives of the AMB’s sponsors for the purpose of deciding
Claimant's claim for breach of their legitimate expectations. It is obvious from the evidence
that Messrs. Vaher and Reinsalu and the EOKL dedicated significant effort to attracting the
public’s and the Central Government's attention to what they considered to be ASTV’'s
excessive tariffs and profitability; and that this effort was successful and likely played a role in
the initiation and drafting of the AMB. However, this alleged “targeting” of ASTV by the persons
in question, even if it were found to be such, cannot in itself be considered wrongful, still less
as constituting internationally wrongful conduct of the Estonian State. The proper focus is
rather the precise basis on which the Estonian authorities ordered the decrease of ASTV's
tariffs.

(iii) The Introduction of the AMB in October 2009

As discussed above at paragraphs 257 and following, the draft AMB was introduced in the
Estonian Parliament on 15 October 2009.

Claimants posit that the purpose of AMB, from its introduction to its adoption and entry into
force, was to lower ASTV’s tariffs. They rely on the fact that the AMB Letter accompanying
and explaining the draft bill expressly refers to ASTV and the need to lower its tariff by 24%.
They also rely on the absence of any mention in the bill of the politicisation of water tariffs, the
alleged purpose of the AMB;° and indeed none of the provisions of the October 2009 AMB
expressly address the Low Tariff Problem.®*° Claimants similarly note that, when the Ministry
of Environment notified the authors of the AMB of the Ministry's own draft bill in October 2009,
it stated that the most important difference between the two (2) drafts was the section of the
draft AMB imposing a cap on justified profitability.°4

Respondent challenges this interpretation by arguing first that the AMB sought to address the
nation-wide problem of the failure by municipal water regulators to implement the 1999

PWSSA properly.8%5 According to Mr Vaher, the AMB sought both to protect consumers and
to redress the failure of local authorities to set proper tariffs. Mr Vaher further emphasised that
the fundamental purpose of the AMB was to ensure compliance with the principles already in
existence, not to introduce new principles, governing the actual setting of tariffs.

Respondent also asserts, based on Mr Vaher's evidence that the purpose of the AMB was not
to interfere with the contractual arrangements between the City of Tallinn and ASTV.®7 It is
noted that Mr Vaher nonetheless conceded that ASTV was in his view the prime example of a
water utility charging excessive tariffs.®°

As above, the Tribunal does not consider that the early history and evolution of the draft AMB
discloses conduct by the State that can be considered wrongful in itself. That history does,
however, confirm that at least one focus of the draft AMB at the time was the profitability of
ASTV.

(iv) The Parliamentary Works after the Introduction of the Draft AMB, and the
Introduction of the Phrase “of the capital invested by the water undertaking’

The evidence pertaining to the elaboration of the AMB with arguably the most direct potential
bearing on Claimants’ claims are the exchanges between the ECA and the sponsors of the
AMB.

Claimants focus particularly on the inclusion in the bill, between its introduction in October
2009 and its adoption by Parliament, of the key phrase “of the capital invested by the water
undertaking” to qualify the concept of “justified profitability."°°° According to Claimants, the
AMB Explanatory Letter having committed to a 24% decrease in ASTV’s tariffs, the draft bill
was amended specifically to achieve this purpose.®#°

On the face of the proposal to amend the draft, this modification was aimed at clarifying that
non-refundable aid would not be included in the asset base to be used for calculating justified
profitability.6*" According to Mr Vaher, “the exact method for the calculation of the regulated
asset base for the purpose of determining ‘justified profitability’ was neither the reason for this
amendment nor was this ever discussed in connection with the ECA’s proposal.”®4? But this
does not seem to be the case.

Claimants argue forcefully that this amendment was targeted directly at ASTV. They refer to
an email from Mr Ots to Messrs. Vaher and Reinsalu of April 2010, in which Mr Ots commented
on the introduction of this new wording:

The way to solve the problem that was raised yesterday (how to avoid
a monopoly pumping up the value of its assets) is by supporting the
proposals made by the Competition Authority (which are included in
our official letter):

PWSSA §14 (2) (5): justified profitability of the capital invested by the
water undertaking.

PWSSA §141 (3) The justified profitability rate forecasted by the water
undertaking may not exceed 10 per cent of the capital invested by the
waier undertaking, on the basis of the weighted average cost of capital.

Our correction is marked in red. These corrections are underlining that
the calculation of profitability is made by applying the capital invested
by the undertaking, i.e. the company, eliminating the possibility of
applying the capital invested by the shareholders via stock exchange,
instead.®43

[Red font in the original; underlining added]

Mr Ots confirmed at the Hearing that by “the company” he was in fact referring specifically to
ASTYV in this exchange.®44

Claimants draw further support from the fact that, in its March 2010 comments on the
November 2009 ECA Analysis, ASTV very clearly stated that the ECA mistakenly failed to
make any allowance for the capital invested during the privatisation.*“5 Moreover, they say,
the ECA set out to align the conclusions of the Analysis with the stated goal of the AMB’s
sponsors — to achieve a 24% reduction of ASTV’s tariffs — by itself concluding that ASTV
should reduce its tariff by an even greater amount of 25%.®46

Both Mr Ots and Mr Vaher testified at the Hearing that the inclusion of the phrase “of the capital
invested by the water undertaking’ had as its objective to exclude from the determination of
justified profitability any non-refundable aid granted by the European Union.

Yet, when questioned on the impact that this change would have on ASTV, Mr Vaher conceded
that ASTV was in fact the only Estonian water undertaking listed on a stock exchange:

THE PRESIDENT: | am asking you a different question, which is
whether you knew or you were aware that that change of wording
would affect ASTV, the effect of this law would be to have an impact
on ASTV?

A. As | said also that this wording would clarify the main principle of
justified profitability which was already in the law, so the answer is that
if there would be any confusion of justified profitability, then this
wording

would clarify in a much better fashion any confusion about the justified
profitability in the future, and in that sense you can say that it would
affect any utility which the ECA would then scrutinise or start
controlling.

THE PRESIDENT: | understand that, thank you. Did you consider that
ASTV had been pumping up the value of its assets at the time?

A. No, we didn't.

THE PRESIDENT: Were ASTV's shares listed on the stock exchange?
A. Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Were other Estonian water undertakings listed on
the stock exchange at the time?

A. No.®47

799. Respondent argues that the new wording would not have changed Claimants’ position
because the 1999 PWSSA already excluded the use of the privatisation value for the
calculation of the RAB: since the 1999 PWSSA refers to justified profitability of the “water
undertaking,” and not of its shareholders’, the share price paid by the buyer is irrelevant to the
calculation in any event.248

800. Claimants reply that Respondent's position is disingenuous in the extreme given that, in the
course of preparing for the European Commission proceedings, Estonia's representatives
themselves implied that the two (2) texts had different meanings.®49

801. In the light of this evidence, the Tribunal is persuaded that the phrase “capital invested by the
water undertaking” sought to exclude privatisation value from the calculation of tariffs. Although
this might not have been the sole purpose of this amendment to the draft AMB, the evidence
nonetheless indicates that this was an important reason for the amendment, and was directed
specifically at ASTV. As to Respondent's argument that such modification did not alter the
state of Estonian law, the Tribunal rejects that proposition and agrees in this respect with the
Estonian Supreme Court.®°

802. That being said, the Tribunal does not find that this legislative change is indicative of a breach
of the FET standard. This modification to the PWSSA falls within the scope of the changes
that an investor should have foreseen, especially when considering the clauses of the Services
Agreement disclosing potential change in the law. It cannot either be sustained that the fact
that some aspects of the AMB were directed to ASTV means that its adoption necessarily

amounts to a breach to international law. In this respect, even if not directly pertinent to the
FET standard, the Tribunal is mindful that at least one international tribunal has concluded that
the curtailing of perceived luxury profits constitutes a proper policy motivation.®°' What is more,
it is fair to understand, upon review of the evidence, a concern with ASTV in particular was
legitimate considering its especially significant position among water utilities in Estonia.

c) The Basis of the 2011 Application and Its Rejection

On 2 May 2011, the ECA dismissed the 2011 Application. Respondent acknowledges that the
principal ground for the ECA’s decision was the assimilation of ASTV's RAB to the privatisation
value.*°? Nor is it disputed that in reaching this decision the ECA did not consider the
privatisation agreements. ®?

Respondent submits that the ECA's decision was correct because ASTV’s 2011 Application
lacked a clear legal basis (i) and was economically flawed (ii). It is Respondent's case that,
because Claimants’ claim rests entirely on the 2011 Application, should the Tribunal find that
the ECA was justified in rejecting the Application, Claimants’ case falls.°5+

(i) The Alleged Lack of Clear Legal Basis of the 2011 Tariff Application

Respondent first alleges that the 2011 Tariff Application lacks a clear legal basis as it is
impossible to ascertain from the Application whether ASTV asks the ECA to enforce the K-
coefficients set in the 2007 Amendment (at a zero value), to conduct a price review pursuant
to Schedule E, Part | of the Services Agreement, and/or to apply the so-called Ofwat
methodology laid out in the “Tariff Application 2011-2015” section of the Application.

Estonia acknowledges that the 2011 Tariff Application refers several times to the Services
Agreement, but it submits that these are intended only to refer to ASTV’s past performance,
as illustrated by the fact that the “Tariff Application 2011-2015” section does not engage in an
application of the privatisation agreements.®°>

Claimants counter that Respondent misconstrues the 2011 Tariff Application. The Application
not only refers to the Services Agreement but specifies that it is “made on the basis of the
Services Agreement” and clearly seeks to preserve the tariff structure of the Services
Agreement as amended. They explain that the economic analysis enclosed with the

853 In its letter informing ASTV of the rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application, the ECA stated that it was not
possible to consider the agreements executed with the City of Tallinn, R-173, Letter from the ECA to ASTV

184

Application was intended only as a “cross-check” of the consequences of applying that tariff
structure.®56

808. The Tribunal considers that the 2011 Tariff Application and related evidence shows that ASTV
clearly specified to the ECA that it considered itself entitled to submit tariffs for 2011 and the
following four years pursuant to its existing contractual arrangement with the City of Tallinn:

Under the terms and conditions of our Services Agreement with the
City of Tallinn signed in 2001 ASTV has a contractual right to a tariff
change from 1 January 2011. In order to ensure compliance with this
Services Agreement, we are making our tariff application for 2011 and
the following four years.®5”

809. The body of the 2011 Tariff Application indeed contains significant references to the Services
Agreement, including statements to the effect that ASTV applies for lower tariffs than those
that could be enforced under the Services Agreement. A close reading of the evidence,
however, suggests that ASTV used the Services Agreement as a point of reference not only
with regards to its tariffs but as well, if not principally, its Levels of Services:

This tariff application is made on the basis of the Services Agreement
supplemented by any improvements that the company has delivered
over the period since privatisation. A selection of the key performance
indicators taken from the Services Agreement and custom and practice
are detailed in the table below. This tariff application is based upon the
continued consistent achievement of these standards throughout the
five year period with no detriment to our customers. °°

810. With regards to the financial calculation of tariffs, ASTV explains that the Tariff Application
relies on a “building block” model inspired by the Ofwat methodology:

This financial and economic tariff application is made by using
many of the factors contained in the building block approach that
is used by Ofwat, the regulator for water and sewerage services
in England and Wales. We feel this methodology is the most
appropriate as it is the oldest regulatory model for the water sector in
the world which has been continually refined and improved over the
last 20 years, and is recognised as the world leading water regulatory
regime. Moreover this regime which regulates privatised water
companies, similar to ASTV, is clearly recognised as by [sic] the
Competition Authority (CA) as exemplifying best practice as it has been
continually referenced by the CA in their comments and analysis of
ASTV.®° [Emphasis in original]

Although the 2011 Tariff Application does clearly refer to the methodology set out in the
Services Agreement,®® it nonetheless seems that for the purpose of establishing its 2011-
2015 tariffs ASTV chose to rely principally, not on the Services Agreement, but on the Ofwat
principles.

(ii) The Alleged Economic Flaws of the 2011 Tariff Application

Independently of the foregoing, Respondent submits that the ECA was correct in rejecting the
2011 Tariff Application for the following reasons:®*'

First, the 2011 Tariff Application equated ASTV’s RAB with the privatisation value, which was
prohibited under the 2010 PWSSA.

Second, the Application was premised on a miscalculation of ASTV's RAB by double-counting
the amount invested in ASTV at the time of the privatisation. In fact Mr Meaney admitted that
the Application mistakenly overstated ASTV's RAB by EUR 80 million on this basis;®® for his
part Dr Hern considers the error to be equivalent to EUR 98 million.?

Third, the 2011 Tariff Application sough an increase for a period of five (5) consecutive years,
which was inconsistent with the 1999 PWSSA, the 2010 PWSSA and the Methodology.

Fourth, the 2011 Tariff Application suffered from other deficiencies, such as the inclusions of
pollution charges paid by ASTV for breaches to the environmental regulation and the cost of
bad debts, as also noted by the Supreme Court of Estonia.®%

These arguments will be assessed when reviewing the economic expert evidence filed by the
Parties. Before doing so the Tribunal will address the important question of the impact of the
entry into force of the 2010 PWSSA on the privatisation agreements.

d) The Legal Impact of the Entry into Force of the AMB/2010 PWSSA on the
Lawfulness and Enforceability of the Tariff part of the Services
Agreement

The entry into force of the 2010 PWSSA, which was introduced into Estonian law by the
adoption of the AMB, raises, first, the issue of the status of the Services Agreement under
Estonian law, and second, the question whether the ECA correctly exercised its discretion in
adopting the Methodology.

821.

Respondent argues that the ECA was not bound by the Services Agreement.®> Claimants
disagree. They allege that with the entry into force of the AMB the ECA succeeded to the City
of Tallinn as a party to the Services Agreement; alternatively, the Services Agreement was
binding on the ECA as a public law contract entered into in lieu of an administrative act.8°

« Did the ECA succeed to the City of Tallinn as a Party to the
Services Agreement?

Mr Rask, Respondent's expert on Estonian law, opines that the ECA could not have
succeeded to the City of Tallinn because the two (2) authorities played different roles: the
responsibility of the City was to set water tariffs; the responsibility of the ECA was to approve
(or not) these tariffs.°°” Mr Rask also submits that legal succession only operates where the
law clearly provides for it, which the AMB does not. He states that the AMB prescribes neither
the legal succession of the ECA, nor any obligation for the ECA to abide by earlier agreements
or relationships.®®° He further notes that the Supreme Court of Estonia has held that the civil
law rule of legal succession does not operate in case of transfer of administrative functions,
such as between the City and the ECA, which among other things means that it is inappropriate
to rely on civil law principles to address the AMB's silence in respect of succession.**

According to Mr Pikamae, the question of legal succession and the transfer of responsibility
for the Services Agreement from the City to the ECA depends on whether the new authority is
in fact assigned functions within the competence of the previous authority — the absence of
statutory provisions explicitly providing for succession is not determinative.°”° In Mr Pikamae’s
opinion, the ECA succeeded to the City of Tallinn as a party to the Services Agreement given
that, by virtue of the AMB, it assumed the responsibilities of the City, and thus replaced the
City, for all matters concerning the setting of ASTV’s water tariffs and related supervision.°”!
He acknowledges that under the 1999 PWSSA, and as explicitly agreed in Section E and
clause 7 of the Services Agreement, the City “sets” ASTV’s tariffs, whereas under the AMB
and the 2010 PWSSA the ECA “approves” or refuses to approve tariffs proposed by ASTV.
According to Mr Pikamae, the simple fact is that with the entry into force of the AMB all authority
with respect to the level and supervision of ASTV's tariffs under the Services Agreement was
transferred from the City to the ECA. Mr Pikamae acknowledges that no Estonian decision
confirms this approach.872

822. The absence of legal succession as between the City of Tallinn and the ECA was confirmed
by the 12 October 2015 decision of the Tallinn Administrative Court.87? On appeal, the
Supreme Court maintained this conclusion and explained that the ECA could not have legally
succeeded to the City of Tallinn because the 2010 PWSSA did not grant the ECA the power
to enter into such an agreement and because the new law changed the duties of the regulator:

In order for the CA to be the legal successor of the City of Tallinn with
regard to the performance of the tariffs part of the services agreement,
the CA should have the right, under the currently applicable law, to
enter into a contract of similar content. The Chamber is of the opinion
that the PWSSA does not grant such rights, the duties of the regulator
have significantly changed compared to the earlier version of the
PWSSA. If the earlier version of the PWSSA § 14 (2) prescribed for the
establishing of the tariff regulation procedure to fall within the
competence of the local government council and the establishing of
water tariffs to fall within the competence of the city- or rural
municipality government, then the PWSSA § 14 (9) effective since
1.11.2010 grants the CA only the competence to develop the
recommended principles for calculating the water tariffs and § 141 (1)
grants the competence to determine the water tariff to the water
undertaking itself, and leaves the CA as the regulator only with the
competence to approve the tariffs (PWSSA § 142 (1)). If earlier the
local government authority had the competence to determine in a
legally binding manner the tariff regulation procedure and the other
local government authority had the competence to unilaterally
establish the water tariffs, then in the new legal situation, the CA’s
guidelines for calculating the water tariffs are solely of
recommendatory nature, and usually the CA does not determine the
price itself, but can only approve or not approve the price applied for
by the water undertaking. The situation is not changed by the CA’s right
to establish temporary water tariffs in exceptional circumstances
(PWSSA § 16 (9)), because the services agreement regulates a
general case. Moreover, the agreement also contained numerous
other provisions besides the tariffs, incl. for instance the city
compensating for certain costs to the water undertaking, which clearly
cannot be deemed as something transferred to the CA. Neither does it
constitute the situation specified in the APA § 9 (3).8”

823. The Tribunal is not minded to disagree with the Supreme Court, and does not consider that it
has any basis to do so in any event. The Tribunal in fact views the matter similarly. Considering
all of the evidence, authorities and legal opinions before it — especially as concerns the
transformation of the role and responsibility of the regulator under the new law and the
consequent change in the relationship between regulator and regulated undertakings — the
Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the ECA did not legally succeed to the City of Tallinn as
a party to the Services Agreement.

« Was the ECA bound by the tariff part of the Services Agreement
on the basis that it was a public law contract entered into in lieu of
an administrative act?

Claimants submit, on the basis of Mr Pikamae’s expert evidence, that even if the ECA did not
legally succeed to the City of Tallinn, the ECA was nonetheless obliged to respect the Services
Agreement on the basis that it is a public law contract entered into by the City in lieu of an
administrative act pursuant to Art. 98 of the Estonian Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)
and, as such, binding on all administrative authorities and courts pursuant to Art. 60(2) APA.”

Mr Rask, on the other hand, considers that the Services Agreement cannot be considered as
a valid public contract given that it was entered into by the Tallinn City government without the
Tallinn City Council having formally adopted the Agreement's tariff-setting mechanism
beforehand, as required by the 1999 PWSSA.

Mr Rask further opines that, even if the Services Agreement fell within the ambit of Art. 98 APA
as suggested by Mr Pikamae, it would still not be governed by public law. As a matter of
Estonian law, he says, public law contracts are governed by civil law in all respects save as
regards their lawfulness.°’° The binding effect of public law contracts are not governed by
Art. 60(2) APA but by Art. 8 of the Law of Obligations Act (“LOA”), which lays down the
principle of privity of contract in civil law.8””7 He also suggests that Mr Pikamae errs by
extending the binding effect of administrative act to the courts: in fact, both a public law contract
and an administrative act may be annulled by an administrative court, though not by a civil
court.8’8 Lastly, Mr Rask opines that the price formation agreement contained in the Services
Agreement related agreements could not bind third parties for their failure to comply with
publicity requirements.°79

In its December 2017 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with ASTV that the Services
Agreement constituted a public law contract that had been entered into in lieu of an
administrative act. It specified that the Services Agreement possessed the characteristics of a
preliminary administrative act aimed at regulating an individual case.*®° However, it dismissed
ASTV's Art. 60(2) APA argument and refused to consider the Services Agreement as
“mandatory for everyone”:

In addition to the above, the complainant has stated that even if the
ECA cannot be regarded as the legal successor of the City of Tallinn
with regard to the performance of the Services Agreement, the
Services Agreement is still binding on the ECA, because the resolution
contained in an administrative act is mandatory for everyone (APA §
60 (2)). The Chamber disagrees with that position. As stated in the

clause 17.3 of this decision, the tariffs part of the Services Agreement
basically has the characteristics of a preliminary administrative act.
This sets the terms and conditions only on the Tallinn City
Government's decisions to establish prices for particular years. The
tariff _criteria_stipulated in the contract have no effect beyond those
decisions.**' [Emphasis added]

 

The Tribunal is not persuaded otherwise, and considers it appropriate to defer to the Supreme
Court of Estonia courts on this point of Estonian administrative law. Having considered the
Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Services Agreement could not have
bound the ECA as regulator.

¢ The Legality and Enforceability of the Services Agreement after the
Entry into Force of the 2010 PWSSA

The Parties concede that, upon the transfer of responsibility over tariffs from the City to the
ECA, the status of the Services Agreement under Estonian law became unclear.®®?

The Tallinn District Court has found that the Services Agreement could be performed at least
until the entry into force of the 2010 PWSSA.®* The District Court found that ASTV could not
demand performance of the Services Agreement from the ECA and that, by rejecting the 2011
Tariff Application, the ECA effectively terminated the Services Agreement.®*+

Respondent argues that, if interpreted literally, the 2007 Amendment would also have been
null and void because Art. 14 PWSSA forbids the fixing of a tariff over a 13-year period without
reviewing the undertaking’s costs.®° It relies on Mr Rask’s opinion that, although it was
“debatable” whether the nullity of Services Agreement was “obvious,” the nullity of the 2007
Amendment (and of the 2002 Amendment) “appears [...] closer to being obvious.”®°° Mr Rask
in turn relies partly on the opinion of Dr Hern, according to whom setting tariffs over a 13-year
period is unprecedented.®°”

Claimants submit that the Tallinn District Court erred in finding that the ECA was not bound to
comply with the terms of the Services Agreement. First, they note that the District Court did
not assess the compliance of the tariff part of the Services Agreement with the 2010 PWSSA,
but rather engaged in a comparison between the mechanisms required by the Services

Agreement and by the Methodology.*** According to Claimants, the ECA should have attached
greater significance to the methodology used by the City of Tallinn:

However, the reason why the ECA should have attached greater
significance to the methodology used by the City of Tallinn with respect
to ASTV was that it was enshrined in a fixed term contract, entered into
as a result of a model, EBRD-sponsored privatisation, in reliance on
which UUTBV was encouraged to invest substantial sums and
expertise into ASTV. It is not appropriate, and is a breach of the BIT,
for Estonia, through its courts, to conclude that in order to be consistent
with regulation in other sectors that contract — and the sums invested
by UUTBV — should simply be ignored. There are a number of other
options the ECA could have adopted to implement its methodology
while respecting the ASTV's contract until the end of its term [...].°®°

Claimants further submit that the District Court was wrong to conclude that the Services
Agreement need not be taken into account by the ECA on the ground that it was incompatible
with the Methodology, because the ECA’s discretion to develop the Methodology cannot
override its obligation to consider the Services Agreement.®°°

Second, according to Claimants, the District Court failed to apply the principle of Estonian law
that a public law agreement remains valid and binding, even if it is unlawful, in the absence of
nullity and knowledge of unlawfulness.®*' Claimants point out that the District Court did not
identify a precise basis on which the Services Agreement could be considered void and that
any finding of nullity would be contradictory to the Court’s statement that, pursuant to the APA,
“voidness of an administrative act (or a public law contract entered into instead) [...] cannot
emerge at a later stage.”®°? Furthermore, the District Court was mistaken in holding that the
ECA had terminated the contract through the rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application.*°°

On appeal, the Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion to that of the District Court in
holding that the Services Agreement was no longer capable of performance under the 2010
PWSSA. As discussed above, the Supreme Court found that this result arises from both the
change in the nature of the regulator's duties and the changes regarding the calculation of
tariffs introduced by the 2010 PWSSA.®*

The Tribunal considers the reasoning and conclusions of the Supreme Court persuasive, and
does not find it necessary to comment further on this issue. In view of this decision, Claimants’

Estonian constitutional law (425).

191

argument regarding the enforceability of the Services Agreement bears less relevance and
rather goes to the obligations of the ECA's in establishing the Methodology, which are
discussed below.

(ii) The Obligations of the ECA regarding the Adoption of a Tariff Methodology
under Estonian Law

837. According to Respondent, the ECA had no choice but to dismiss the 2011 Tariff Application
because it contravened the law to the extent that the tariffs proposed by ASTV were not “cost-
based.” In other words, the ECA did not have the discretion to apply the Services Agreement's
methodology.®> Rather, the ECA had the authority to determine and apply the methodology
of its choice as long as that methodology complied with the existing regulatory framework.®9%

838. Claimants argue that the language of the 2010 PWSSA afforded sufficient discretion to the
ECA to consider the tariff methodology set out in the Services Agreement because the 2010
PWSSA neither defines the phrase “capital invested,” nor prescribes a specific methodology
for setting tariffs.®97

839. Furthermore, as explained above, Claimants argue that the Services Agreement remained
enforceable after the entry into force of the 2010 PWSSA and that the ECA was bound to apply
the Services Agreement’s methodology.®* Alternatively, the ECA should have at least
considered the Services Agreement and given due regard to the established practice of the
former regulator.®°° They rely on Art. 3 and 4 of the APA, which notably provide that an
administrative authority must consider the legitimate interests at play.9°°

vagueness of its wording.” Cl. PHB, 484 and 485 and Pikamae 2™ ER, 419.

845.

The Tallinn District Court confirmed that the terms for determining prices under the 2010
PWSSA remain undefined. The District Court also found that the AMB/2010 PWSSA granted
the ECA the appropriate administrative discretion to stipulate the principles according to which
tariffs must be determined. The District Court specified that in establishing its methodology,
the ECA was not bound by the mechanism applied earlier by the municipalities and
characterised the Methodology as an administrative regulation.

The Supreme Court confirmed the Tallinn District Court decision regarding the discretion
accorded to the ECA and further agreed that the Methodology constituted an administrative
regulation. The Supreme Court further found that the choices made by the ECA in establishing
the Methodology were among the options reasonably available to it, and emphasised that the
evidence failed to demonstrate the existence of a prevailing method for determining water
tariffs in Europe or elsewhere.2°2

It thus appears, and the Tribunal is satisfied that, as a matter of domestic Estonian law, the
ECA properly exercised its discretion to elaborate the Methodology.

This does not, of course, dispose of the question whether Estonia breached Claimants’
legitimate expectations under international investment law.

e) The Economic Evidence relied on by the Parties

The Parties rely on their respective economic experts: Mr Andrew Meaney, for Claimants; and
Dr Richard Hern, for Respondent.

Before engaging in an analysis of this evidence, it is worth recalling at the outset Claimants’
own comments on this point. Claimants allege that the majority of the economic evidence is
not relevant to their claims. According to Claimants’ primary case, the Tribunal need not and
should not engage in an analysis of ASTV’s profitability since they had for legitimate
expectations that the tariffs would be set in accordance with the Services Agreement and its
amendments:

It is important that the economic evidence in this case is placed in its
proper context. Much of the economic evidence is irrelevant to the
Claimants’ primary claim, which is that they had a legitimate
expectation that the privatisation agreements on the basis of which
their investment was made, as amended, would be respected, and
ASTV’'s tariffs set in line with the tariff methodology in the Services
Agreement. The K factors having been set for the period 2011 to 2020
by the 2007 Amendment, there was no requirement to carry out a
further justified profitability analysis when setting ASTV’s tariffs for

authorisation, the purpose of discretion and the general principles of justice, taking into account relevant
facts and considering legitimate interests.” [Emphasis added]

2011. ASTV’s tariffs should simply have been changed by reference to
CPI only (the K factor having been set at zero).°°? [Emphasis added]

 

According to Claimants, to the extent that the Tribunal deems it necessary to measure ASTV’s
profitability, that profitability should be assessed by way of an internal rate of return (the “IRR”)
analysis using the 2001 Business Plan as a benchmark.

In a majority of the Tribunal’s view, this position goes to the heart of the question of Claimants’
legitimate expectations regarding the method for setting tariffs.

In what follows the Tribunal will briefly describe the Parties’ positions as to the role of
international best practices in the assessment of ASTV’s profitability and the main points of
disagreements between the Parties in order to direct the discussion of the experts’ opinions.

(i) The ECA's Obligations in Adopting the Methodology and Consideration of
the Industry Standard

The Parties were asked to comment, in their post-hearing submissions, on whether the ECA
had the obligation, under Art. 3(1) of the Treaty, to consider international best practice and
international water management principles when considering ASTV’s tariffs.

According to Respondent, the BIT does not require Estonia to consider international water
management principles and related international best practices. It nonetheless submits that
the ECA's conduct complied with these standards, as crystallised in the Methodology.®° This
is further discussed below.

Claimants submit that, at the time of the ASTV’s privatisation, the regulatory regime was
underdeveloped and out of phase with international best practices, and that a primary purpose
of the privatisation was to correct this situation. As a consequence, the privatisation
agreements entrusted UUTBV, as the chosen international operator and investor, with the duty
to introduce and maintain proper industry standards. Claimants thus infer that the ECA was
obliged to consider international practices including as incorporated into the privatisation
agreements.9°

(ii) The Two (2) Types of Methodologies at Stake

The first element of disagreement between the Parties’ concerns the type of methodology for
determining tariffs: on the one hand, the “rate of return” model, as implemented in the ECA's
Methodology, and, on the other hand, the Ofwat model, which is the inspiration for the Services
Agreement's tariff mechanism.

856.

According to Respondent, the rate of return model allows a utility to earn a fair level of return
after having recovered its costs. This type of regime is applied in the United States, as well as
in Portugal, the Czech Republic and Lithuania.°°” This assessment is made on the analysis of
historic and projected costs. The regulator includes justified projected costs in the tariff and
adds a profit component which is a multiple of WACC and the RAB. Tariffs are next reviewed
from time to time when the utility's costs or the WACC change substantially.°°

By way of reminder, the ECA’s Methodology stipulates that the undertaking’s RAB ought to be
compared to nominal WACC, which serves as point of reference for determining justified
profitability.°°° RAB is to be calculated according to the formula:

RAB = RABr + WC,

Where

RAB - regulated asset base;

RAB r — residual book value of RAB in the end of a regulation period;

WC - working capital.°°
The Methodology specifies that the ECA ought to assess physical assets according to their
NBV,°"" and that the working capital of a water utility company be set at 5% of the value of the
regulated assets.°'? Importantly, the regulator determines the appropriate level of costs and
profit based on data for the preceding 12-month period.°'?
The Ofwat model, which is the model developed by the United Kingdom water regulator,
requires the setting of a performance target and tariff reviews at the end of a pre-defined

regulatory period (ranging from two (2) to five (5) years). If the utility outperforms the target, it
earns the profit derived from this outperformance. At the beginning of each period, profitability

and tariffs are reassessed and adjustments are made to account for current market
circumstances.°"

It is uncontested that the Ofwat model was used as the reference by the City of Tallinn for the
purposes of the privatisation, as confirmed by Mr Sellner.°16

It is also of note that Mr Andres Jukham, the court-mandated expert in the Estonian
proceedings, explained that, when applied consistently and correctly, the two (2)
methodologies lead to similar results for the owner of the undertaking. They would, though,
yield different water tariffs as well as dynamics and timing of free cash flow and revenue.°'®
In the Tribunal’s view, and indeed as found by the Estonian courts, it cannot be said that one
regulatory regime necessarily prevails as a matter of international good practice. Considering
that Claimants did not hold legitimate expectations, the adoption of such regime did not run
afoul of their rights. It cannot either be stated to amount to bad faith or made with an intent to
deprive Claimants of the benefits of their investment.

The Tribunal thus conclude that Estonia did not breach the FET standard, whether by violating
any protected expectations or otherwise.

B) CLAIMS OF BREACHES OF DUE PROCESS, DISCRIMINATION AND UNREASONABLE
MEASURES

In addition to a violation of their legitimate expectations, Claimants argue that Estonia has also
committed various other breaches of Art. 3(1) of the BIT.

In their post-hearing submissions, Claimants divide these claims into three (3) categories:

Estonia's failure to afford due process to Claimants by rejecting the 2011 Tariff Application and
issuing the Prescription;9"”

Estonia’s liability for the public campaign against ASTV;9"®
Estonia’s unreasonable and discriminatory measures against ASTV.9'9

The first two (2) categories concern breaches of the FET standard, while the third concerns
claims related to the non-impairment standard of Art. 3(1), which provides:

1) The Alleged Breaches of Due Process

Claimants assert that Respondent breached due process in multiple manners. Again, the
thrust of their claim lies in the disregard by the ECA of the tariff scheme set out at ASTV’s
privatisation.

More specifically, they submit that they were not availed due process in:
The elaboration of the Analysis by the ECA and its publication;

The elaboration of the Methodology by the ECA;

The Chancellor of Justice’s investigation;

The rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application.

The Tribunal will first review the international investment case law regarding breaches of due
process and how those breaches may trigger international liability. It will next review the
various breaches alleged by Claimants set out above.

a) Due Process in International Investment Law

There is no significant difference between the Parties’ respective understandings of the
relevant standard.

The FET standard imposes on a State the obligation to grant due process to investors with
respect to their investment.°2°

The authorities referred to by the Parties establish that the FET standard does not protect
against each and any breach of due process. As noted in Waste Management v Mexico:

[T]he minimum standard of FET under Article 10.5 of CAFTA-DR is
infringed by conduct attributed to the State and harmful to the investor
if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, is
discriminatory or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome
which offends judicial propriety.92*

A breach of due process as understood under domestic law does not necessarily entail a
breach of international law; an international investment tribunal does not sit as a reviewing

body of a domestic decision.°** Furthermore, where a breach has been remedied, a tribunal
will not normally find a violation of the FET standard.°*° The standard of review of the State
measure will also vary according to the nature of the decision-making process at issue:
administrative proceedings trigger less stringent due process obligations than judicial
proceedings.°*4 On this latter point, the Tribunal has considered the evidence offered by Mr
Mart Rask, one of Respondent's Estonian law experts, who testified that the ECA did not
breach Estonian administrative procedure and commented on the Chancellor of Justice's
investigation as well as the 2015 decision of the Tallinn Administrative Court.25

b) The Due Process Breaches pertaining to the Analysis

As discussed above at paragraphs 230 and following, the ECA initiated a market analysis of
water tariffs at the end of December 2008. Over 2009, the ECA requested information from
several undertakings, including ASTV. Representatives of the ECA and ASTV met, and ASTV
shared confidential information with the ECA in its response to the ECA questionnaire. On
30 November 2009, the ECA transmitted the Analysis to ASTV. The day after, Mr Ots publicly
stated that ASTV's tariffs should be decreased by 25%.

Claimants identify several instances in which Respondent's conduct breached due process in
this context, namely:

The ECA used a market investigation to target ASTV and to obtain confidential information
from ASTV;926

The ECA deliberately ignored the privatisation agreements for purposes of the Analysis;92”
The Analysis is economically flawed;9?6

Having claimed to rely only on public information, as it pretends, the ECA failed to consider
accurate and complete data;%°9

The ECA failed to provide a meaningful opportunity to ASTV to comment and/or react prior to
the public release of the Analysis;9°°

The day after the issuance of the Analysis, Mr Ots held a press conference during which he
stated that ASTV's tariffs should be reduced by 25% and made other denigrating comments.°°"

(i) The Use of the Market Investigation to Target ASTV

Claimants argue that the ECA used its 2008-2009 market investigation to conduct a targeted
analysis of ASTV’s tariffs, which was improper.°52

Respondent submits that the market investigation was triggered by real and extensive
evidence of regulatory problems prevailing in the Estonian water industry. Far from targeting
ASTV, the study encompassed twelve undertakings.°°° Mr Ots explained, and the Tribunal
accepts, that the Competition Act entrusted the ECA with the power to conduct such
investigation and that the ECA had previously investigated and issued recommendations in
connection with industries that it did not regulate.

Mr Ots testified that the ECA’s market investigation was not intended to focus on ASTV.
However, as it turned out, the investigation suggested that — in the ECA’s opinion — ASTV was
the only water undertaking charging such excessive tariffs. This situation warranted further
scrutiny, considering among other things that ASTV services one-third of the population of
Estonia.°°

The Tribunal does not consider that Mr Ots’ testimony on these matters was seriously
contradicted, or that there exists any compelling evidence that the market investigation was a
pretext to target ASTV or obtain its confidential information. The Tribunal finds that the launch
of the market investigation by the ECA was not in itself wrongful.

(ii) The ECA's Failure to Consider the Privatisation Agreements

From the Tribunal’s perspective, the most significant and serious criticism of the ECA's
conduct concerns its alleged disregard of the privatisation agreements and, more generally, of
ASTV’'s privatisation scheme.

Respondent does not squarely deny that the ECA did not consider the privatisation
agreements in elaborating the Analysis. It submits, however, that Claimants’ claim wrongly
focuses on the result of the Analysis, as opposed to the process which led to it.99° Respondent

states that the Analysis constitutes merely a non-binding assessment of ASTV’s tariffs, which
did not carry with any direct legal effect.°°” It contends that, in any event, the findings of the
Analysis were correct.°8

The Tribunal partly shares Respondent's view on this point. To the extent that Claimants’
allegations pertain to the outcome of the Analysis, and the calculations it derives, in isolation,
no breach of due process may be found.

However, the Tribunal does not believe that this fully or faithfully reflects Claimants’ claim,
which includes the allegedly unreceptive attitude of the ECA in assessing ASTV's tariffs. More
specifically, the thrust of the claim concerns the ECA’s purported knowledge — and wilful
disregard — of the privatisation agreements and their tariff mechanism.

It cannot be reasonably argued that the ECA had no knowledge of the existence of the
privatisation agreements or the mechanism by which ASTV’s tariffs were set. Indeed, the
Analysis itself provides an overview of the legislation applicable to ASTV’s tariffs and of the
relevance of the privatisation agreements in this respect, based on information available on
ASTV's website. The ECA notably restates the formula agreed between ASTV and the City
of Tallinn under the 2002 Amendment and expresses concerns as to whether this regime is
cost-based.*° The ECA also commented on the fundamental differences between that
methodology and its own:

The CA deems it necessary to note in the first place that, leaving aside
the actual justifiability of ASTV’s prices, barely the manner used by
Tallinn City Government for regulating the prices is not appropriate to
a proper price regulation. For the purpose of an effective price
formation, the assessment of the extent ASTV’s prices are based on
the costs, should be done in line with the law and the price regulation
procedure, but Tallinn City Government is following the agreement
signed upon the privatisation of ASTV in establishing the water supply
and sewerage prices (CPI. K-coefficient) instead. The CA notes that
due to the fundamental differences of the tariff formation mechanisms
included in the procedure and the agreement, it is actually not possible
to apply them in a parallel way and the two mechanisms would lead to
the same tariff rates only in case of an unlikely coincidence. As Tallinn
City Government has decided to proceed namely from the agreement
signed upon the privatisation of ASTV, then inevitably it has not been

983 “The following overview treats the price regulation from two different aspects. In clause 2.1 the general
bases of the price regulation are characterised. In clauses 2.2-2.4 an overview is provided about the bases
of the price regulation established by Tallinn City Government and Tallinn City Council — which on the basis
of the valid legislation should constitute the price regulation — and in connection with that the impact of the
agreement concluded at the privatisation of ASTV on the price formation is studied” (C-38, ECA Analysis,

sufficiently analysed to what extent the prices of ASTV are based on
the costs.%' [Emphasis added]

The ECA expressed the opinion that the City of Tallinn had “inevitably” failed to assess the
costs in setting tariff waters since it had relied on contractual commitments, as appears from
the citation above.

These excerpts of the Analysis indicate that the ECA was well aware of, yet had had no
inclination to consider, let alone apply, the tariff scheme set out in the privatisation agreements.

At the Hearing, Mr Ots recognised that he did not review the Services Agreement and the other
privatisation contracts for the purposes of the Analysis. Members of his team merely gathered
information regarding these agreements from ASTV’s website and confirmed to him that ASTV
had not communicated copy of the contracts to the ECA. Mr Ots further testified that in his
opinion the ECA could not have considered these documents because they were not public.%4?

Mr Ots also testified that, in any event, the ECA did not need to review the privatisation
agreements? and that they were irrelevant.%4 Furthermore, he stated that there was “no
possibility” that a more detailed analysis could have affected the ECA's conclusions:

MR WEINIGER: Just before we took that break, | showed you
paragraph 8 of your second statement, where you said that the detailed
analysis of ASTV's water tariffs was a consequence of your market
investigation, not its original purpose.

Then | was going to take you to paragraph 36 of your first statement,
and see if you would agree that based on your initial investigation, you
had already concluded that ASTV was charging excessive tariffs?

A. Yes.

Q. If we look at paragraph 36 again of your first witness statement, was
this a preliminary conclusion that ASTV was charging excessive
tariffs?

A. Exactly, there was a preliminary conclusion.

Q. Was there a possibility that a more detailed analysis would have led
to a conclusion that ASTV was not in fact excessively profitable?

A. No.

Q. So there was no possibility that your detailed analysis would have
changed your mind in any way?

A. No.°45 [Emphasis added]

886. This evidence indicates a firm unreceptiveness by the ECA to consider the privatisation
agreements and the tariff mechanism they set out, which, it was fully aware, formed the basis
on which ASTV operated.

887. Although ASTV did not communicate the contracts to the ECA, there is no indication that the
ECA ever sought to obtain a copy of them. It is of note that the ECA’s questionnaire did not
require that such information on the undertaking and its tariff methodology be provided to the
ECA.946 Yet, this did not prevent the ECA from discussing the privatisation agreements and
ASTV’'s existing tariff mechanism in the Analysis, as noted above, nor did it prevent Mr Ots
from complaining about the alleged lack of information available to him about ASTV.947 In the
Tribunal’s view, there is no basis to believe that, had the ECA wished to consider the
privatisation agreements or other documents explaining the basis for ASTV’s tariffs, such
documents would not have been provided to it.

888. With respect to Mr Ots’ comments that the Analysis could only refer to public information,
Mr Ots himself suggested that this in no way prevented the ECA from considering, though not
disclosing, confidential information.%8 Nor is the Tribunal convinced that, had the ECA wished
to consider and comment on the documents substantiating ASTV’s tariffs, the Analysis could
not have been released without disclosing confidential information contained in those
documents.

889. This generally unreceptive attitude on the part of Mr Ots and the ECA does not, however,
mean that due process was breached. As stated above, not every procedural unfairness
amounts to a violation of international law. In the situation at hand, notwithstanding the refusal
of the ECA to consider the privatisation agreements, it is not at all evident that the outcome
would necessarily have been different had the ECA acted otherwise. Although a legitimate
expectation is clearly not a condition precedent to a finding of breach of due process, as
discussed above the privatisation agreements themselves confirm that they were subject to
changes to the legal and regulatory regime governing water undertakings and that future tariffs
would be set in accordance with the regime in force at the relevant time.

947 Tr. Day 4 Mr Ots 139:17-140:11: “THE PRESIDENT: That helps clarify matters in my mind, thank you.
Just before lunch, if | understood you — again, | am going to look at my notes, bear with me for a second —
you were discussing with Mr Weiniger the extent to which in your analysis, and in your work in the
2009/2010 period, you tried to understand the previous regulatory regime.

A. (In English) Yes, we have tried to understand, but of course when we have conducted our analysis by
2009, then we got very, very little information about this regulation made by the City of Tallinn, because we
just got the letter from the City of Tallinn, this was by my mind two pages, and the rest of the information
we got from the publicly available sources, like the webpage of Tallinna Vesi or the webpage of the City of
Tallinn. And based on that, we have studied the regulatory regime implemented by the City of Tallinn, but
honestly to say there was not too much information, but based on that information what we got, we made
our results.” [Emphasis added]

948 Ots 1st WS, 947: “ASTV had asked us to treat the non-public data we received from them confidential.
We respected their request and based the Analysis only on publicly available data, including ASTV’s
detailed financial statements. However, the confidential data that we had also analyzed led to the same
material conclusions. We explicitly pointed this fact out in the Analysis.” [Emphasis added]

(iii) The Economic Flaws of the Analysis

Claimants contend that the economic flaws in the Analysis consist in another breach of due
process because they flow from the application of an incorrect methodology. They submit that,
even if it were appropriate for the ECA not to consider the Services Agreement, the Analysis
compounds errors insofar that: (i) it only considers one year of data (2007-2008), which is
inconsistent with the long-term nature of the privatisation, (ii) it took a period from the return
phase of the investment out of context, and (ii) it based the RAB on the NBV, in lieu of the
privatisation value.

Again, as stated above at paragraphs 878 and 879, these allegations, even if true, cannot in
themselves lead to a breach of due process. A breach, if any, would rather lie in the failure to
hear ASTV’s representatives on this matter. The Tribunal will therefore not engage with them.

(iv) The Public Release of the Analysis

Claimants also impugn the ECA’s conduct surrounding the release of the Analysis, in
particular: the refusal to allow ASTV more than 24 hours to prepare for the release; the fact
that the Analysis was drafted in Estonian; the fact that ASTV had not previously expected that
the ECA would call into question the tariff methodology set out in the Services Agreement.

According to Claimants, Mr Ots declined Mr Plenderleith’s request to delay the publication of
the Analysis so as to allow for time to translate the Analysis into English and for ASTV’s
management to read it and issue a stock exchange announcement.°%° Mr Plenderleith further
testified that in their previous meeting, in November 2009, it was never suggested that the
ECA might challenge ASTV’s tariff methodology.°!

Claimants also criticise the public statements made by Mr Ots in the wake of the publication
of the Analysis:

“In such a way that a long-term agreement is concluded, where the
price of water shall be increased each year, like that is done perhaps
only in Africa,” added Ots. According to him in developed countries the
price of water is based purely on how much has been invested into the
provision of the service. [...]

According to Ots the CA has not interfered in the formation of the price
policy of water service. “The main regulator is Tallinn City
Government,” he added. “It is wrong to look for the guilty one, but the
final outcome should be that the water price reduces by up to 25%,
confirmed Mr Ots.°52

Respondent points out that it was not required under Estonian law to obtain approval from the
subject of an investigation prior to the publication of its findings. It relies in this regard on the

expert opinion of Mr. Rask, who as mentioned above, explains that due process requirements
are relaxed with respect to a non-binding decision:

In addition, it must be taken into account that an administrative
procedure is subject to requirements that are as stringent as the extent
of the procedure’s effect on a person. Thus, for example, the general
right to be heard does not apply in every kind of administrative
procedure, but hearing the subject of an administrative act is
mandatory where a decision is being made to the detriment of a person
(APL § 40(3)(3)). Likewise, according to § 56(1) of the APL, justifying
an administrative act in writing is mandatory only in the case where the
administrative act is issued in writing or if the issuance of a beneficial
administrative act is refused. Also, according to § 56(4) of the APL, the
reasoning of an administrative act does not have to contain a
description of the factual circumstances giving basis to the
administrative act, if the application of the subject of the administrative
act is being granted, and rights and freedoms of third parties are not
restricted.

Therefore, in the cases where the administrative procedure is directed
towards a non-binding result (as e.g. in the case of the Competition
Authority's market survey) or where no decision is_made to the
detriment of any party or restricting anyone's rights or freedoms, the
principles applicable to the form of the administrative procedure are
more relaxed. In the Expert's opinion, the Competition Authority did not
breach any principles of administrative procedure when conducting the
non-binding market survey of the water sector, and it had the express
legal basis to conduct it (§ 55(2) of the Competition Act).9°° [Emphasis
added]

 

896. In any event, Respondent emphasises that the ECA nonetheless provided ASTV with advance
notice of the public release of the Analysis.°°* According to Respondent, it was also entirely
appropriate for the ECA to communicate with ASTV in Estonian.

897. Respondent claims that during their 3 November 2009 meeting, Mr Ots in fact explained to
Mr Plenderleith the ECA's findings regarding ASTV’s excessive profits.°° Mr Ots testified in
writing®* and at the Hearing that further comments from ASTV after the Analysis was
completed but before it was published could not have affected those findings:

Q. If we look at paragraph 12 of your second witness statement, we
see in the second sentence: “I am also certain that ASTV's comments
on the analysis would not have affected our results.” That's your belief,
isn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. In the second sentence of paragraph 13, you say: “The Competition
Authority did not fail to engage with ASTV's points as alleged by
Claimants.” Do you see that in paragraph 13?

A. Exactly.

Q. What | would like to put to you is that if you are certain, as you say
in paragraph 12, that nothing ASTV would have said could have
changed your mind or affected the results, it doesn't seem to me that
you were really

open to a discussion with ASTV about the analysis.

A. No, what do you mean, in what way? | do not agree.

Q. ASTV wanted to discuss the analysis with you before it was
published, and you didn't give them an opportunity, did you?

A. lagree.

Q. You say that's because you didn't think that their comments would
have affected your findings?

A. Exactly.957

Regarding the public comments made by Mr Ots, Respondent submits that Mr Ots only
provided a short television interview, which he felt compelled to give due to the wide public
interest and concern over ASTV' tariffs, and that it was not the first time that the ECA would
have publicly commented on some of its findings.9°

The Tribunal finds that Claimants have failed to demonstrate any breach of due process in
relation to the release of the Analysis.

Certainly there is conflicting evidence as to the nature of the exchanges that occurred between
ASTV and the ECA’s representatives prior to the release of the Analysis. But in any event, the
Tribunal can find no breach of Estonian law, let alone international law, in the circumstances
surrounding the public release of the Analysis.

(v) Conclusion on the Alleged Breaches of Due Process pertaining to the
Analysis

For the reasons explained above, the Tribunal concludes that Estonia did not, under
international law, fail to afford due process to Claimants. This is so whether one considers the
breaches alleged by Claimants in isolation or cumulatively.

c) The Chancellor of Justice’s Investigation
Claimants also allege that they were not afforded due process in the context of the

investigation conducted by the Chancellor of Justice, discussed above at paragraphs 246 and
following.

987 Tr. Day 3 Mr Ots 181:1-24.
958 Ots 2° WS, 9921 and 22.

205

903. Claimants’ most significant criticism lies in particular in their claim that the Chancellor of Justice
pursued legal action without conducting an independent analysis, which, they assert, had a
detrimental impact on the value of ASTV’s shares.

904. Respondent contends that the Chancellor of Justice complied with the due process applicable
to constitutional reviews and points out that the Chancellor effectively had no choice but to
conclude that the City’s regulation of ASTV did not comply with the law since it failed to provide
an explanation to him.9°

905. The Supreme Court of Estonia dismissed the Chancellor of Justice’s application to enforce his
recommendation to decrease ASTV’s tariffs. The Court noted that the City of Tallinn’s
regulation may be challenged before the Administrative Court. The Chancellor subsequently
terminated his investigation but in statements to the media invited consumers to commence
legal proceedings against ASTV.°2

906. The Tribunal does not find any breach of due process here. In particular, the Tribunal does not
consider that the Chancellor's reliance on the Analysis prepared by the ECA, a specialised
agency, to be inappropriate. In any event, there is no evidence that the Chancellor's actions
caused damage to Claimants. Even if these events may have negatively influenced ASTV's
stocks, no evidence has been offered as to how this loss actually crystallised.

d) The Due Process Failure in the Development of the Methodology

907. Claimants argue that the ECA did not comply with due process in developing the
Methodology.®® In particular, they say, the ECA failed to consider ASTV’s comments and
those of the EVEL, which raised similar concerns than ASTV’s.9°4

908. Respondent argues that the ECA duly considered Claimants’ and the EVEL’s submissions in
the elaboration of the Methodology. They cite the following excerpt of Mr Ots’ testimony:

the methodology did not contain any responses to the points and

A. No, | do not agree with that.

Q. Did you include ASTV's comments?

A. We asked ASTV to send in their comments, and to the extent it was
possible, in accordance with the Estonian legislation, so as | said, we
are following the legal framework, and as much as possible we
included them.°®5

Respondent also underlines that the Tallinn Circuit Court ruled that ASTV had the opportunity
to express its views regarding the Methodology.** Furthermore, it is noted that the Supreme
Court found that the ECA benefits from wide discretion in preparing an administrative act such
as the Methodology.°°”

The Tribunal also takes note, once again, of certain elements of Mr Ots’ evidence which, in its
view, suggests a relatively closed-minded approach to the work of the ECA:

Mr Ots testified that he did not agree that a regulatory system is best implemented with the
involvement of all industry participants.°°°

Mr Ots recognised that the AMB does not mandate a one-year regulatory period and that no
other country takes this approach, as per Dr Hern’s expert report.°°

Mr Ots was highly critical of the Ofwat approach but accepted that the ECA is required to
monitor and be aware of the international situation.97°

Mr Ots explained that he sought to instigate a change in regulatory approach, and that he did
not deem it necessary to ensure a certain consistency with the previous regime.®”!

As indicated above, the Supreme Court of Estonia has found that the directives set out in the
Methodology fall within the options available to the ECA in the reasonable exercise of its
discretion under Estonian law. The Tribunal having been presented with no compelling factual
or legal evidence sufficient to demonstrate otherwise, it can hardly find that the ECA committed
a wrong in adopting the Methodology.

Furthermore, the Tribunal acknowledges the ECA's efforts to gather comments from
stakeholders, including ASTV and the EVEL, during the process leading to adoption of the
Methodology. Similarly, the ECA may not have had the obligation to tailor its directives, which
would apply nationwide, to ASTV’s particular situation.

e) The Due Process Failure in the Rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application

In their Memorial Claimants again argue that the ECA failed to consider the Services
Agreement and, more generally, ASTV’s privatisation — but this time, with respect to the
rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application.°”

Respondent argues that the ECA's rejection of the 2011 Tariff Application was subject to
several remedial mechanisms.°7° More specifically, upon receipt of the Tariff Application, the
ECA requested that ASTV complete the questionnaire and provide additional information, and
allowed ASTV to revise its application.°’4 Respondent stresses that the ECA met with ASTV
on several occasion to discuss the application. The ECA even engaged proactively with ASTV,
to ensure that it understood the scope of additional information needed for the ECA’s
assessment and an opportunity to update its application.” In any event, ASTV’s application
on its face required its rejection, inter alia for its failure to comply with the directive to eliminate
price discrimination between private and commercial customers. Respondent also refers to
the mistake included in the Tariff Application, included the EUR 98 million overstatement, and
the fact that ASTV did not provide the pro forma projections to the ECA.°”6

Again, the Tribunal does not identify any breach of due process. Rather, the criticisms made
by Claimants largely recoup their claim of breach of the FET standard, which have already
been dismissed.

2) The Alleged Negative Publicity Campaign against Claimants

Claimants assert that members of the ECA and key figures of the Estonia Central Government,
including the sponsors of the AMB in the Estonian Parliament, the EOKL, the Chancellor of
Justice and Mr Ots, engaged in a publicity campaign against ASTV. They attribute these
actions to the State and argue that they breached the FET standard®”’ and negatively affected
the value of ASTV’s shares.°78

According to Respondent, the conduct of private entities and individuals, such as the EOKL
and its members (even if those members are also members of parliament), is not attributable
to the Estonian State. With regards to the statements of the Chancellor of Justice, Respondent
considers them to be objective criticism of the facts that will prompt the regulation of ASTV's
tariffs. More generally, Respondent underlines that these statements, stemming from private
entities and officials, form part of a legitimate debate, albeit critical of ASTV, that does not
breach the FET standard.97°

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent. ASTV’s tariffs undoubtedly attracted great criticism in
Estonia. However, the Tribunal does not consider that these actions may be attributed to the
State (with the possible exception of the conduct of the Chancellor), or, in any event, that
Claimants have demonstrated that they give rise to a violation of international law or caused
any quantified damage to Claimants.

3) The Alleged Unreasonable and Discriminatory Measures

In addition to their claims for breach of legitimate expectations and due process, Claimants
submit that Respondent contravened the non-impairment standard of Art. 3(1) of the BIT
through unreasonable and discriminatory measures.

This claim focuses on the targeting of ASTV in the course of the legislative reform of the water
tariffs regime, as laid out at paragraphs 768 and following, above.

According to Claimants, Respondent further discriminated against ASTV, primarily in the
application of the AMB to ASTV and by failing to consider ASTV’s specific circumstances.

In both instances, Claimants place particular emphasis on the objective sought by Estonia in
adopting and implementing the AMB with respect to ASTV, that is, to lower ASTV’s tariffs.°°
This conduct, they say, would have impaired Claimants’ enjoyment of their investment by
preventing them to earn the return anticipated at the time of the privatisation.°*' The damages
complained of by Claimants under these claims thus correspond to those complained of in
relation to their FET claims.°®2

The Tribunal considers that Claimants’ claims of impairment of the investment are redundant,
and it does not believe it necessary to address them here: Claimants allege that Estonia's
conduct was unreasonable because (i) it was not justified by the so-called Low Tariff Problem,
and (ii) the Estonian authorities’ allegations of excessive tariffs are based on a miscalculation
of ASTV's tariffs®° — both of which allegations have already been considered and addressed
by the Tribunal.

C) CLAIM OF BREACH OF THE UMBRELLA CLAUSE
Claimants also bring a claim under the “umbrella clause” contained at Art. 3(4) of the Treaty,

by which Estonia undertook “to observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to
investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party.”°4

880 Cl. PHB, 469.

Claimants principally allege that Respondent violated this obligation by its failure to implement
the tariff mechanism of the Services Agreement and to apply the K-coefficients determined in
the 2007 Amendment.%® As with their FET claim, they rely on the suite of privatisation
agreements, but place special emphasis on two (2) provisions of the 2007 Amendment: (i)
Article 4.1.2, which sets the K factors to zero (0) until 2020, and (ii) Article 6.2, by which the
Parties undertook to ensure that the amendment is complied with in a manner that “will not
reduce the shareholder value of the Company.”

Respondent argues that (i) Claimants cannot rely on an agreement with the City of Tallinn for
purposes of their umbrella clause claim, (ii) the City’s contractual undertakings were in any
event subject to modifications and future requirements of Estonian law, (iii) the City of Tallinn’s
commitments cannot bind the ECA, (iv) UUTBV cannot benefit from the umbrella clause
because it is not a signatory of the Services Agreement and (v) the tariff formula set out at
Article 7 of the Services Agreement is invalid under Estonian law.°°7

The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to explore this claim, which, as framed, is
effectively duplicative of Claimants’ claim for violation of their legitimate expectations. The
claim advanced by Claimants is premised on the non-respect or the disregard of the
privatisation agreements and, more particularly, the determination of the K-factors. However,
the non-respect of these agreements does not at heart arise from a failure to abide by a
contract, but rather from a change in the legislative and regulatory framework under which the
privatisation agreements were executed. This is most notably illustrated by the finding of the
Estonian courts®® that, upon the entry into force of the AMB, the ECA did not become bound
by the privatisation agreements. The umbrella clause does not then capture the essence of
Claimants’ claim, which is better considered through the lens of a purported breach of the FET
standard. In any event, in view of the finding that the privatisation agreements themselves
undermine the legitimate expectations claims, there is no need to further address this issue.

Costs

It is trite to state that a tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention is accorded broad
discretion in awarding costs (including fees and expenses), as provided at Art. 61(2) of the
ICSID Convention and Rule 47 of the Arbitration Rules.

In their submissions, both Parties argue that the Tribunal’s discretion should be guided by the
so-called “costs follow the event” approach, that is, the winning party should be awarded its

In view of the agreements of the Parties on this point, the Tribunal will take into consideration
the overall outcome of these arbitral proceedings, in which Respondent has prevailed on the
merits despite having lost on the issue of jurisdiction.

The Parties further agree that in awarding costs the Tribunal is entitled and should take into
consideration specific aspects of the procedure and of the parties’ conduct. According to
Claimants, two (2) aspects of Respondent's conduct in particular should be sanctioned in any
award of costs: (i) Respondent’s unreasonable arguments in the arbitration, including as to the
legality of the Services Agreement; and (ii) Estonia's “negative campaign against ASTV."°°"

Respondent, for its part, criticises Claimants for making their case a “moving target” especially
with the filing of their Reply. Estonia recalls that, in its Counter-Memorial, it demonstrated that
Claimants’ economic expert, Mr. Meaney, had overstated ASTV’s RAB in his first report by
including the purchase price, in response to which Claimants revamped their case by
alleging that they had expectations regarding a 15-year tariff path, in lieu of alleging that the
modification to the PWSSA was per se a breach of the FET standard. Respondent further
criticises Claimants’ submissions for their lack of clarity as to the alleged basis of their
legitimate expectations and the contractual rights they were seeking to enforce.

By way of reply, Claimants recall that the error of their expert only related to a “cross-check”
calculation, and did not affect their principal case. They also dispute that they changed their
case accordingly.°°

In the Tribunal’s opinion, it is fair to say that Claimants appear to have adjusted their pleadings
between the first and second rounds of submissions. In any event, the Tribunal considers that
Claimants’ case was characterised to a noticeable extent by a lack of consistency and
precision in respect of certain key elements of both liability (in particular the nature of the
alleged legitimate expectations) and quantum.

The Tribunal nonetheless agrees with Claimants that Respondent's arguments as to the
legality of the Services Agreement, on which it did not prevail (and on which it arguably had
limited chances of success in view of the findings of the Estonia courts), consumed significant
time and effort. Moreover, Estonia’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, including its several
requests to brief certain aspects of the issue — notably in regard to Achmea — also added
significantly to the time and costs of the arbitration.

The costs incurred by the Parties in relation to these proceedings may be broken down as
follows:

992 Respondent's Statement of Costs, 93, referring to Resp. Rej., {2-5 and Resp. C-M, 9231 and 232.
