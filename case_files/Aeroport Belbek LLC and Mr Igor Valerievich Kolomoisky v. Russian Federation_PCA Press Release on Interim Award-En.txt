PCA PRESS RELEASE

 

ARBITRATION BETWEEN AEROPORT BELBEK LLC AND MR. IGOR VALERIEVICH KOLOMOISKY
AS CLAIMANTS AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION

THE HAGUE, 9 MARCH 2017
The Tribunal Issues Its Interim Award

As reported previously (Press Release dated 15 August 2016), after the hearing on jurisdiction and
admissibility was held in this matter from 12 to 14 July 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file
post-hearing submissions by 14 October 2016. The Claimants filed their post-hearing submissions on
14 October 2016. The Russian Federation did not file any post-hearing submissions.

On 24 February 2017, having deliberated, the Tribunal issued its unanimous Interim Award addressing
certain issues of jurisdiction and admissibility.

Background: The arbitration was commenced by the Claimants against the Russian Federation pursuant
to the Ukraine-Russia BIT and in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976 on
13 January 2015. The Claimants submit that the Russian Federation breached its obligations under the
Ukraine-Russia BIT by taking, as of February 2014, measures that deprived the Claimants of their
property, contractual and other rights to operate a passenger terminal for commercial flights at the
Belbek Airport in Crimea.

The Tribunal is comprised of Professor Pierre Marie-Dupuy (Presiding Arbitrator), Sir Daniel
Bethlehem, KCMG, QC (appointed by the Claimants), and Dr. Vaclav Mikulka (appointed by the former
appointing authority, Judge Bruno Simma, on behalf of the Russian Federation).

Under the instructions of the Tribunal, the PCA will from time to time issue press releases containing
information on the procedural steps taken by the Tribunal. Basic information about the proceedings is

available on the PCA Case Repository http://www.pcacases.com.
