Introduction

The subject of this dispute is the Claimants’ claim for compensation for damage
they incurred as a result of actions and omissions of the Polish governmental
authorities, namely the Minister of the Environment (the Department of Geology
and Geological Concessions) (the “Ministry”) and regional mining offices, which
prevented the Claimants from carrying out a significant investment in the Polish
energy sector (together the “Authorities”).”+

The Claimants initiated a network of modern, high efficiency and low carbon mines
combined heat and power plants (“CHP”) to be developed and operated on the basis
of recognized but untapped natural gas deposits in Poland (the “Investment”).?>

The Investment was made through Blue Gas N’R’G Holding sp. z 0.0. (“Blue Gas
Holding”), a limited liability company organized and registered under the laws of
Poland, in which the Claimants hold 100% of shares. Blue Gas Holding was the
sole shareholder of four SPVs responsible for particular investment projects in
different locations, namely:

. Blue Gas N’R’G sp. z 0.0. (“Blue Gas Unikéw);

. Blue Gas N’R’G’ Stanowice sp. z 0.0. (“Blue Gas Stanowice);

. Blue Gas N’R’G Wrzosowo sp z 0.0. (“Blue Gas Wrzosowo); and
. Blue Gas N’R’G’ Zakrzewo sp z 0.0. (“Blue Gas Zakrzewo”);

collectively referred to as the “SPVs” and, together with Blue Gas Holding, the
“Blue Gas Group.””°

The Blue Gas Group started developing six investment projects (Unikéw,
Wrzosowo, Stanowice, Miedzyzdroje, Zakrzewo and Lelikow) on as many as nine
gas fields (reservoirs). The development of the Investment was halted due to the
actions and omissions of the Authorities, which conducted relevant administrative
proceedings in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, resulting in an inability to
continue with the planned projects. These proceedings consisted of granting,
converting and modifying licenses for the recognition, exploration and mining of
natural gas, approving planned geological works (“PRG Documentation”) and
investment and geological documentation (“DGI Documentation”). During the
proceedings, the Authorities repeatedly exceeded statutory deadlines and imposed

56.

unjustified formal requirements which were used to conceal systematic delays
within said proceedings, and to even extend such delays.’

The Claimants assumed a certain, reasonably calculated budget for the Investment
to become operational and self-financing. Protracted administrative proceedings,
however, lasted for more than three years (2014-2017) and effectively prevented
the completion of the Blue Gas Group’s first six investment projects. As a result,
the SPVs generated significant operational costs while failing to earn the expected
sufficient capital gains which were then to be reinvested. Accordingly, Claimants
eventually had to stop financing the Investment in order to minimize losses.
Ultimately, Blue Gas Unikéw was forced to declare bankruptcy and the other SPV’s
had to be wound up.”*

1. Business Concept

The Claimants wanted Blue Gas Group to fill a niche on the Polish energy market
comprising unexplored but well-recognized deposits of nitrogen-rich natural gas.
This would be done without interfering in the businesses of other entities already
operating in the gas sector.”

The deposits were discovered in various parts of Poland but were too small for large
upstream companies to be interested in them. In addition, extracting the gas from
these deposits would be too costly for gas trading as it would require the nitrogen
to be removed first and then the “purified” gas to be transported over long distances
via transmission pipelines. Therefore, for years the deposits remained untapped.*°

The Blue Gas Group planned on producing gas from existing wells (instead of
drilling new ones) and burning it in CHP facilities located near the wells to produce
heat and electricity in cogeneration. Such “products” would then be sold to local
off-takers (e.g. industrial customers), technically and ecologically. In addition,
SPVs — where applicable — were to sell condensate and other substances produced
together with the gas (“accompanying minerals”).*!

Furthermore, the Investment was expected to benefit from the Act of 10 April 1997
— Energy Law (OJ 1997 No. 54 item 348 as amended) (the “Energy Law”) in the
form of “yellow certificates” (one certificate corresponded to 1 MWh of energy).
Yellow certificates were to be able to be sold on the Polish Power Exchange
(“TGE”) or directly to other energy producers who were obliged to show a certain
percentage of energy as being produced from environment friendly sources.*”

On 25 January 2019, the system of yellow certificates was replaced with a new
support system introduced by the Act of 14 December 2018 on Promoting
Electricity from High-Efficiency Cogeneration (OJ 2018, item 42) (the
“Cogeneration Act”). In this new system, the CHP facilities operated by the SPVs
would have been qualified as existing or modernized cogeneration units with an
installed capacity of at least 1 MW and not more than 50 MW, which would have
made the SPVs eligible for a “guaranteed premium” to be paid in cash regarding
the produced, transmitted and sold energy. This guaranteed additional stable
sources of proceeds that would have ensured the Investment’s profitability.**

The Blue Gas Group identified approximately 40 gas fields on which the
Investment was to be based. The idea was to construct a number of smaller CHP
facilities which would not raise any CO2-related obligations. Then, the Blue Gas
Group would expand, using the proceeds from the first facilities, to finance projects
with the total capacity of at least 100 MWe. At the same time, Blue Gas Holding
held talks with various business partners to increasing the Investment’s potential
and the number of projects that were taken into account.**

The managers at Blue Gas Holding were aware that large upstream gas producers,
including the largest state-controlled Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe I Gazownictwo
S.A. (“PGNiG”), did not have any interest in the gas deposits which Blue Gas
Group was considering. However, Claimants believed this might have changed
once the Investment had a significant production capacity. Therefore, one of the
key elements of the Blue Gas Group’s strategy was to acquire the most attractive
deposits and to secure rights to mine gas, i.e., to obtain relevant licenses. This was
done either by applying for a new license (wherever the gas field had not been
subject to licensing before or when an existing license had expired) or through the
acquisition of valid licenses held by third parties.*°

It was assumed that by 2021, the Blue Gas Group would have reached a capacity of
around 100 MWe with 25 MWe coming from the CHP facilities fully developed in
2015-2017, and the remaining ca. 75 MWe from such facilities to be built
successively in subsequent years.*°

2. The Location
The six investment projects were located in western and north-western Poland.*”

The locations are part of a large belt-like terrain going across the country from
North-West to South-East that comprises the vast majority of oil and gas deposits
in Poland.*®

3. Development Process

The development and implementation process was the same for each of the projects.
It was divided into two phases:*?

Phase 1, estimated two years for completion:

(i)

(ii)

Initial analysis of the deposits, including:

e Identification of deposits;
e Verification of the existing infrastructure and commercial
potential (e.g., sales opportunities, cost effectiveness).

Development of the wells and CHP facilities, including:

e acquiring legal title to the land in question (e.g., entering into lease
e agreements containing purchase call options and subsequent
acquisition of the plots);
e obtaining a license for recognition and exploration of mineral
deposits;
e accessing the local grid (applying for connection terms and
entering into a connection agreement);
e obtaining environmental permits, when applicable;
e obtaining a promise of a license for power generation to be issued
by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (URE);
e obtaining building permits;
e  financing—in addition to the funds supplied by the Claimants, the
SPVs entered into loan agreements with banks;
e concluding long-term contracts with third-party off-takers:
© power purchase agreements;
o. thermal energy supply agreements;
© agreements on the delivery of condensate;
© construction works:
oO reconstructing existing wells or drilling new wells;
o. installing pipelines and gas mining devices;
o building CHP facilities;
e staffing the mines and CHP facilities by entering into operation
and maintenance agreements with external operators;
e launching the CHP facilities.

Phase 2 — production, with an estimated span of 8 up to 30 years following the
launch of a given CHP facility. The actual periods varied from one project to
another and depended a great deal on the productivity of particular reservoirs.
However, one of the characteristics of cogeneration is its flexibility. If necessary,

operation periods could have been shortened or extended to adjust to the actual
business circumstances. It is also not uncommon to construct or reconstruct
additional boreholes nearby the existing CHP facility and thereby increasing its
overall capacity.

The first project in the Investment was the Unik6éw Project and was started by Blue
Gas Unik6w in 2011. It was treated as a “prototype” and point of reference for other
projects. The next was the Wrzosowo Project, which was initiated by Blue Gas
Unik6w at the beginning of 2012 and transferred to Blue Gas Wrzosowo in 2014.
The rest of the projects began in 2014. They consisted of the Lelikow Project and
the Miedzyzdroje Project (Blue Gas Unik6éw), the Zakrzewo Project (Blue Gas
Zakrzewo) and the Stanowice Project (Blue Gas Stanowice).*°

Blue Gas Holding and the SPVs underwent a series of changes regarding their
corporate structures and names. Such changes are reflected in the publicly-available
registrar or entrepreneurs of the National Court Register.*! Until 2014, Blue Gas
Holding was known as Zegar Entrerprise sp. z 0.0. Blue Gas Unikéw’s name was
Blue Energy sp z 0.0, also until 2014. In the same year, Degra Enterprise sp. z 0.0.
became Blue Gas Stanowice. Before 2015, Blue Gas Wrzosowo was known as
Kalisja Enterprise sp. z 0.0. (then briefly renamed Blue Gas N’R’G?’ Silesia sp. z
0.0.), and Blue Gas Zakrzewo was named Vesantia Enterprise sp. z 0.0.4?

Investment, the shares of the companies implementing it belonged directly or
indirectly to the Claimants for the whole period of the Investment. In the initial
years of its development, these were the following companies: Fosontal Ltd. and
Festorino Invest Ltd. (Cyprus). In August 2013 the owners of these companies were
joined by Petra Salesny (Austria), Petr Rojicek (Czech Republic) and Peter
Derendinger (Switzerland).**

4. Unikéw Project

72. Initially, the “Unikéw” deposits were covered by license No. 19/2009/p of 31
March 2009 granted to P.L. Energia S.A. with its registered seat in Krzywoploty
(“PL Energia”). On 31 March 2011, Blue Gas Unikéw and PL Energia jointly
applied to the Ministry to transfer the license to Blue Gas Unikéw and to consent
to have the right of mining usufruct assigned to Blue Gas Unikéw in order to
recognize the deposits covered by the scope of that license.*®

73. Meanwhile, Blue Gas Unikéw concluded several agreements with third parties
specializing in preparing management and design documentation for investments

related to the construction of natural gas mines. It also applied to the Mayor of
Lututéw for an environmental permit, which was issued on 20 April 2011.7

On 16 June 2011, the Ministry issued a decision on transferring license No.
19/2009/p to Blue Gas Unik6w and approved the assignment of the right of mining
usufruct.*8

In August and September 2011, Blue Gas Unikéw concluded further investment
agreements related to the execution of the Unikéw Project and acquired ownership
of the plot of land on which the project was located. On 6 September 2011, the
Mayor of Lututéw issued a location decision for the Unikéw mine and CHP facility,
and on 14 November 2011 the Foreman of Wierusz6w issued a building permit.”

During 2012-2013 the following components of the CHP facility were installed:
technological set-up, including borehole utilities, gas separators, formation water
tank, condensate tanks, measuring systems, formation water and condensate
tanking station, tubing and heat exchangers, pressure reduction and measurement
station, gas output and power generators. Interconnection infrastructure was also
built, linking the CHP facility with the local power and heat grids.*°

The management and operations of the CHP facility were entrusted to Trias sp. z
0.0. The operator prepared the launch and testing of the CHP facility, which
included initial gas mining. The operator’s activities comprised:

e preparing and applying to the Regional Mining Office in Kielce for approval
of a mining plan for the reconstruction of the well (plan ruchu zaktadu
gorniczego),;

© preparing a mining rescue plan and the initial gas mining;

e testing the gas and condensate;

e obtaining a permit for the CHP facility to be launched;

© securing the agreement on the provision of mining rescue services.*!

At the same time, Blue Gas Unikéw signed relevant connection and distribution
agreements with PGE Dystrybucja S.A., the distribution power grid operator. It also

concluded contracts on:

e the delivery of condensate;

e the sale of heat;

e the sale of electricity after the President of the URE granted Blue Gas Uniké6w
the license for the production of energy from the “Unikéw” cogeneration
block.

The CHP facility started operating in December 2013. After 25.5 million m3 of gas
had been extracted in 2016, the wellhead pressure dropped significantly as the well
started producing brine. Eventually, a mixture of sediments from the reservoir, clots
of crystalized salt and debris from reconstruction works blocked the well and
extraction had to stop for servicing.**

As cleaning the borehole with pressurized hot water did not provide sufficient
results, at the end of 2016 Blue Gas Unikéw and associates worked out a method
of streamlining the borehole (slickline and coiled tubing). A new plan to extract gas
was also developed.**

In the meantime, on 10 July 2015, Blue Gas Unikéw applied to the Ministry to
convert license No. 19/2009/p into a unified license for exploration of the “Unikéw”
natural gas deposit and mining the gas from the “Unikéw” natural gas deposit.>°
This was made possible by the Amendment to the Geological and Mining Law,
which came into effect on 1 January 2015, according to which, within 2 yaears from
the date of its entry into force, companies like Blue Gas Unikéw, which had been
granted a concession for the prospection and exploration of hydrocarbon deposits,
could convert the concession into one for the exploration, recognition and
extraction of hydrocarbons from those deposits”

The Ministry claimed to examine the application for 13 months (including 8 months
after informing Blue Gas Unik6w that the investigative phase of the proceedings
had been finished). Finally, on 9 August 2016, the Ministry converted the license
which received the new number 19/2009/L.57

Together with the application of 10 July 2015, Blue Gas Unikéw filed the PRG
Documentation for the Unikéw deposit. The delay of the proceedings conducted by
the Ministry made the PRG Documentation (or parts of it at least) obsolete.**

Initially, it was assumed that production tests on the Unikéw-2 borehole would have
been finished by 31 December 2016. Immediately after this date, Blue Gas Unik6w
was to proceed with regular operations. This required approval of the new DGI
Documentation for the Unikéw deposit, which could not have been expected to

have taken 13 months. Therefore, to meet the deadline, Blue Gas Unikéw took the
following actions:

e by letter of 24 August 2016, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted the additional PRG
Documentation for the Ministry to approve (later it was supplemented to
incorporate the slickline and coiled tubing method to streamline the borehole
together with a subsequent production test as an alternative way to resume
production);

e on 8 September 2016, it submitted the DGI Documentation for the Unikéw
deposit for approval.*°

During the proceedings leading to the approval of the DGI Documentation, there
were periods when the Ministry failed to make progress for periods lasting up to 5
months. The Ministry failed to ask Blue Gas Unikéw for any changes to the DGI
Documentation even though on 15 December 2016 the SPV was informed that there
were issues which needed clarification (e.g., a more precise description of the
boundaries of the gas deposit). The Ministry failed to react to any of the requests to
expedite the process that it received. Only in the letter of 23 January 2017 did the
Ministry inform Blue Gas Unikow that the date on which the proceedings were to
be finalized had been pushed back until 31 March 2017.

In response to this letter, on 7 February 2017 Blue Gas Unik6w asked the Ministry
for information regarding requirements to be met to resume operations at the
Unik6w CHP facility which had been interrupted by the technical problems
described above. Blue Gas Unikéw’s request was additionally justified by the fact
that according to license No. 19/2009/L, the borehole testing period expired on 31
December 2016. The Ministry again failed to respond. Therefore, on 23 February
2017 Blue Gas Unikow sent another letter in which it requested urgent approval of
the DGI Documentation for the Unikéw deposit, detailing the problems that such a
delay was causing.*! Again, there was no response from the Ministry.

Eventually, Mr Jacek Strzelecki, the chairman of the management boards of Blue
Gas Holding and the SPVs, called the relevant Ministry’s official responsible for
conducting the proceedings in question, Ms. Joanna Potega. During that
conversation, Ms Potega proposed that Blue Gas Unikdéw revise the DGI
Documentation in accordance with the vague and informal suggestion of 15
December 2016. Blue Gas Unikéw complied with this proposition in the letter of
16 March 2017.

During the following months, the Ministry remained silent. Meanwhile, on 26-27
April 2017, the Regional Mining Office in Kielce carried out an inspection of the
Unik6w mine. Even though the inspectors had not determined any shortcomings in

Blue Gas Unik6éw’s activities, they stated: “(in) the light of the requirements set
forth in the license and mining plan for the borehole, the recognition of the Unikéw
deposit through Unikéw-2 could have been carried out by 31 December 2016.
Currently, there is no legal basis under the aforementioned documents to continue
recognizing the Unikéw deposit through Unikéw-2.”

The reason for these observations was to delay the administrative proceedings
during which time the Ministry was supposed to issue the following administrative
decisions:

e the decision on approval of the revised PRG Documentation submitted with
the letter of 24 August 2016;

e the decision on approval of the revised DGI Documentation submitted with
the letter of 8 September 2016; and

e the investment decision determining the requirements for extracting gas from
the Unikow deposit.®

The Ministry extended the proceedings and communicated additional questionable
formalities, i.e., it undertook a number of sham actions to justify the delay of the
proceedings. As a result, no repairs or mining could be done on the Unikéw-2
borehole, which meant no CHP production and thus no gains.®

While Respondent claims that ultimately Blue Gas Unikéw would not have been
able to restore production of that well, it had done so before in October 2016 by
removing salt deposits from the well with cold tubing, which was essentially what
Blue Gas Unik6w was looking to repeat. This would have allowed the Unikéw-2
well to be cleaned out and would have prevented future blockage.”

Importantly, if the Ministry had approved the DGI Documentation submitted in
September 2016 within the 2 months required by statute, the company would have
been able to apply this method for restoring production.

Even though Blue Gas Unik6w took all possible measures to save the Unikéw
Project (it renegotiated a bank loan, obtained additional financing from the
Claimants, and changed the borehole operator lowering the costs of drilling by as
much as 60%), the Ministry’s inaction stalled the Investment as a whole. Not only
did it make it impossible to resume the operations of the CHP facility within the
timeframe prescribed by the license, but it prevented Blue Gas Unikéw from any
reasonable planning. Claimants could not have assumed that the whole

administrative procedure would last more than two years without a prospect for an
end date, i.e. at least 12 times longer than envisaged by law.”

Depriving Blue Gas Unik6w of its revenues forced the Claimants to forego the
Investment as a whole, even though they had invested approximately PLN 32,142
million in that SPV alone. As a result, on 31 October 2017 the management board
of Blue Gas Unik6w had to file for bankruptcy, which was declared by the District
Court for the capital city of Warsaw three months later.”!

5. | Wrzosowo Project

After analysing the Wrzosowo deposits, Blue Gas Holding identified two
possibilities for commercializing the gas that it had planned to extract. The first of
these was the sale of natural gas in the immediate vicinity of Wrzosowo, and the
second—more economically attractive—was the use of gas for the production of
electricity and heat in a CHP facility.”

Blue Gas Unik6w was initially responsible for the implementation of the Wrzosowo
Project. As with the Unikéw Project, the Wrzosowo deposit was covered by a
license granted to PL Energia (license No. 16/2008/p dated 10 April 2008)
concerning the area of Rybice. Therefore, on 28 October 2011, Blue Gas Unikéw
and PL Energia jointly applied to the Ministry to transfer the license to Blue Gas
Unik6w and to consent to the assignment of the right of mining usufruct.”?

On 30 January 2012, Blue Gas Unikéw concluded an agreement with Blue Line
Engineering sp. z 0.0. for the transfer of rights to the project concerning the
exploration, recognition and mining of oil and gas deposits in the area of Rybice.
Immediately afterwards, the Ministry issued a decision dated 23 February 2012,
pursuant to which it decided to transfer license No. 16/2008/p to Blue Gas Unik6éw,
and at the same time agreeing to the assignment of the mining usufruct.”*

In May 2012, Blue Gas Unikéw acquired ownership of the property on which the
‘Wrzosowo Project was to be implemented. It then commissioned the development
of design and construction documentation, as well as the obtaining of relevant
approvals related to its implementation. In the following months, Blue Gas Unikéw
commissioned the reconstruction of the Wrzosowo-1 well. On 20 February 2013,
the building permit regarding the Wrzosowo CHP facility was issued.’°

In December 2013, after license No. 16/2008/p had expired, Blue Gas Unikéw
commissioned Trias sp. z 0.0. to prepare an application to the Ministry for a license
to recognise the Wrzosowo natural gas deposit. This application was submitted on
22 January 2014 and Blue Gas Unik6éw obtained the requested license over a year

later, on 16 February 2015.76 On the same day, Blue Gas Unik6w entered into an
agreement for the establishment mining usufruct with the Ministry.””

In the meantime, Blue Gas Wrzosowo was incorporated and, on 3 July 2015, Blue
Gas Unik6w and Blue Gas Wrzosowo signed an assignment transferring the right
of mining usufruct to Blue Gas Wrzosowo. Both SPVs then jointly applied to the
Ministry for the transfer to Blue Gas Wrzosowo of license No. 1/2015/p.”* On 22
June 2015, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted an application for the amendment of the
Wrzosowo Exploration License regarding the territorial scope of the license and the
geological works schedule indicated in it.”? Blue Gas Unikéw provided a
comprehensive explanation of the reasoning behind these changes.*”

Pending the decision of the Ministry regarding the transfer of the license, Blue Gas
Unik6w and Blue Gas Wrzosowo took steps to prepare an investment process
related to the reconstruction of wells and the CHP facility. For this purpose:

e these SPVs commissioned the preparation of relevant project documentation,
including applications for an environmental decision, location decision and
building permit;

e they also commissioned the preparation of mining plan for a reconstruction of
the Wrzosowo-1 well; and

e they acquired a heat discharge installation.*!

On 9 November 2015, after approximately four months after submitting the
application, the Ministry issued a decision, pursuant to which it transferred license
No. 1/2015/p to Blue Gas Wrzosowo. On the same date, the Ministry, Blue Gas
Unik6w and Blue Gas Wrzosowo concluded the assignment agreement regarding
the mining usufruct rights. On 30 December 2015, Blue Gas Wrzosowo acquired
from Blue Gas Unik6w the rights to expenditures incurred in the implementation of
the Wrzosowo project.®?

In the first half of 2016, additional administrative decisions were obtained,
including the location decision for the project involving the construction of a gas
pipeline from the Wrzosowo CHP facility to Kamien Pomorski, together with the
cogeneration power unit and technical infrastructure. In addition, the rights and
obligations under the 20 February 2013 building permit dated were transferred to
Blue Gas Wrzosowo.*?

At the same time, Blue Gas Unik6w secured access by the planned CHP facility to
the distribution network by signing the connection agreement and by planning to
conclude an agreement with Enea Operator sp. z.o.0 to provide electricity
distribution services. Blue Gas Unikéw also secured heat collection by signing a
letter of intent with a neighbouring health resort.**

Additionally, analysis was carried out regarding the deposit geology, following
which Blue Gas Wrzosowo prepared a concept for the development of the
‘Wrzosowo gas deposit. On 15 September 2015. based on this concept, Blue Gas
‘Wrzosowo applied for the amendment of its license to allow the execution of a 3D
seismic survey which would replace physical drilling tests of the Wrzosowo wells.
Eight months later, Blue Gas Wrzosowo learned that this concept had no chance of
being approved by the Ministry. Because of the Ministry’s late response there was
a risk that the proceedings regarding the 3D testing would prolong beyond 31
December 2017, which was the deadline to file for conversion of the license, and
thus Blue Gas Wrzosowo’s plans had to be revised. Therefore, on 4 July 2016, Blue
Gas Wrzosowo filed an application to convert license No. 1/2015/p into a unified
license for the exploration and recognition of hydrocarbons and mining
hydrocarbons from the “Wrzosowo” natural gas deposit.*>

As with the Unikéw Project, the Ministry extended the deadline for the conversion
of the license several times, taking sham actions to justify the delay of the
proceedings. This situation persisted for almost 18 months, which prevented Blue
Gas Wrzosowo from continuing the Wrzosowo project. The management board of
Blue Gas Holding was forced to stop financing the activities of Blue Gas
‘Wrzosowo, as there was no realistic prospect of having the Wrzosowo project
operating and generating proceeds. Hence, even though the Claimants invested
approximately PLN 4 million in this project, Blue Gas Wrzosowo had to be wound
up.

6. Stanowice Project

The plan for the Stanowice Project included three main steps: (1) the construction
of a gas mine, and within its framework, the reconstruction of the existing
boreholes; (2) the construction of a CHP facility; (3) the construction of new wells
to increase the facility’s production capacity.*”

Two options were considered. In the first, Blue Gas Group envisaged industrial
dryers of timer, sewage sludge and segregated municipal waste in the area of the
gas plant, which would produce alternative fuel and electricity in the organic
Rankine cycle (ORC). In the other option, heat would be provided to customers in
the nearby Kostrzyn-Stubice Special Economic Zone (SEZ).**

In any event, most of the electricity produced in the Stanowice Project was to be
sold to external customers, in particular trading companies, hence the negotiations
with Alpiq Energy SE and Axpo Polska sp. z 0.0. In addition, direct sales to
companies in the SEZ were also considered. The Blue Gas Group also considered
the provision of system services by providing electricity at peak demand times to
Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne S.A. It could have been done by the Blue Gas
Group alone or in cooperation with PGE Energia Odnawialna S.A.*?

The Stanowice natural gas deposit also contained condensate. So, in addition, Blue
Gas Holding envisaged the possibility of selling it to three large recipients,
including Grupa Lotos S.A., ZPRE “JEDLICZE” sp. z 0.0. and Rafineria Trzebinia
S.A., with which it negotiated in this matter.°°

Initially, Blue Gas Unikéw was responsible for the Stanowice Project. In this
capacity, on 10 February 2014 it commissioned the development of the PRG
Documentation for the Stanowice natural gas deposit, and in addition, on 24 April
2014 it concluded a lease agreement for the plot of land on which the Stanowice-2
borehole was located. Next, after Blue Gas Stanowice became responsible for the
implementation of the Stanowice Project, on 10 September 2014 the rights and
obligations under this agreement were transferred to Blue Gas Stanowice. On 15
September 2014, Blue Gas Stanowice submitted an application to the Ministry for
a license for the recognition of the Stanowice natural gas deposit.?!

On 22 October 2015, Blue Gas Stanowice applied to the Regional Director of
Environmental Protection in Gorz6w Wielkopolski for an environmental decision
for this project. During the administrative proceedings, Blue Gas Stanowice had to
carry out an environmental impact report. When the work on preparing the report
was under way, Blue Gas Stanowice acquired the right from Blue Gas Holding to
expenditures incurred in the implementation of the Stanowice Project.””

In November 2017, the environmental decision was obtained, but the Ministry was
in default in issuing the license in accordance with the applicable statutory
deadlines. This persisted for almost three years, and this was experienced with
respect to Uniké6w and Wrzosowo as well. The management board of Blue Gas
Holding had to stop financing the activities of Blue Gas Stanowice and wind up this
SPV despite having invested around PLN 1.1 million in its activities.”

7. Miedzyzdroje Project

The Miedzyzdroje Project concentrated primarily on the recognition and
exploitation of the resources accumulated in the Rotliegend deposits located in the
furthest part of north-western Poland. For this purpose, the plan was to first
reinterpret the available seismic profiles. After the reinterpretation results, the plan

was, optionally, to make additional seismic profiles and to reconstruct two or three
wells (Miedzyzdroje-3, Miedzyzdroje-5 and Przetér-2) or, alternatively, drill new
wells if need be. Commercial development would involve selling heat to local
holiday resorts, residential estates and other recipients in Miedzyzdroje.*

Blue Gas Unikéw was responsible for the implementation of the Miedzyzdroje
Project. On 10 February 2014, it commissioned the development of the PRG
Documentation for the Miedzyzdroje deposit. On 5 September 2014, in order to
secure the rights to the land where this project was to be implemented, Blue Gas
Unik6w entered into a lease agreement for the relevant plot of land. Following the
same business strategy, on 26 September 2014 Blue Gas Unik6w filed an
application with the Ministry for a license for the recognition of the Miedzyzdroje
natural gas deposit.”

The Ministry extended the proceedings and articulated illegitimate formalities and
obligations to justify delay. An example being an obligation to ask the Regional
Director of Environmental Protection in Szczecin whether there was any need for
an environmental impact report even though there was no legal basis for such a
request.”°

This situation persisted for almost three years. The management board of Blue Gas
Holding had to halt financing the project and Blue Gas Unik6éw had to file for
bankruptcy. All of the works regarding the Miedzyzdroje Project cost around PLN
270,000.”

8. Zakrzewo Project

The plan for this project was the same as in the case of the Stanowice Project. It
also included three main steps: (1) the construction of a gas mine, and within its
framework, the reconstruction the existing Zakrzewo-1 or Zakrzewo-5 boreholes;
(2) the construction of a CHP facility, (3) expansion of the CHP facility provided
that there was enough gas available to supply additional CHP engines.”*

On 10 February 2014, Blue Gas Unik6w, which was responsible for the project at
its origins, commissioned the preparation of the PRG Documentation. On 16
September 2014 it concluded a lease agreement with the Roman Catholic Parish of
St. Klemens in Zakrzewo for the plot of land on which the project was to be
implemented. Shortly afterwards, the rights and obligations under this agreement
were transferred to Blue Gas Zakrzewo and on 29 September 2014, Blue Gas
Zakrzewo submitted an application to the Ministry for a license for the recognition
of the Zakrzewo natural gas deposit.”

in the issuance of a ruling of 23 September 2016 obligating Blue Gas
Zakrzewo to prepare an environmental impact report.!°

At the same time, Blue Gas Zakrzewo took steps to contract heat off-takers.
Additionally, from 2015-2016, it engaged in negotiations with potential contractors
that were to supply this SPV with the equipment for exploring, stimulating,
servicing and mining the natural gas. Finally, as with all of the other SPVs, Blue
Gas Zakrzewo acquired the right from Blue Gas Holding to expenditures incurred
in the implementation of the Zakrzewo project.!°!

The administrative proceedings regarding the license did not go smoothly. Only on
24 June 2016, i.e., more than 21 months after submitting the license application, did
the Ministry inform Blue Gas Zakrzewo that the proceedings had been initiated.
The license itself was granted to this SPV on 12 May 2017, after another 11 months
of inactivity. On the same day, an agreement for the establishment of a mining
usufruct for the purpose of recognizing the Zakrzewo natural gas deposit was
concluded.'°?

The two-and-a-half-year timespan of the licensing procedure, combined with the
other numerous problems regarding the SPVs, led Blue Gas Holding to stop
financing the Investment. Despite having invested about PLN 845,000 in the
Zakrzewo project, the Claimants had to withdraw from the project, Blue Gas
Zakrzewo had to renounce license No. 3/2015/p, and the SPV itself needed to be
wound up.!%

9. Lelikow Project

The concept of the Lelikow project was not unique. It was almost the same as the
Stanowice and Zakrzewo Projects. And again, Blue Gas Unikéw was responsible
for its implementation!

On 30 September 2014, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted an application to the Ministry
for a license for the recognition of the Lelikow natural gas deposit. Unfortunately,

as in the other projects, this application remained unprocessed for almost one year.
This time, however, on 30 December 2015 the Ministry refused to grant Blue Gas
Unik6w the requested license. The Ministry justified its decision by the lack of
submitting an environmental decision. As the Ministry had no grounds to dismiss
Blue Gas Unik6éw’s motion, on 28 January 2016 the SPV challenged it by filing a
request to have the case re-examined.!°

Blue Gas Unik6w waited for the Ministry’s decision for almost two years and never
received it. This stalled the Lelikow Project and, at the same time, contributed to
the situation in which Blue Gas Holding’s management decided to refuse further
financing of the SPVs’ activities. It was also yet another reason for Blue Gas
Unik6w to file for bankruptcy. The aggregate cost of this project amounted to
approximately PLN 184,000.!°°

Irregularities in the Administrative Proceedings

The implementation and development of the entire Investment was prevented as a
result of the acts and omissions of the Authorities that lasted for more than three
years (2014-2017). These acts and omissions included illegal, discretionary,
discriminatory, protracted and sluggish conducting of the licensing proceedings that
effectively paralyzed the functioning of the SPVs.!°7

One of the key elements of the Blue Gas Group’s strategy and, at the same time, a
necessary condition for the Investment, was obtaining licenses for the exploration
and recognition of selected natural gas deposits and, subsequently, transforming
them into licenses for the exploration and recognition of natural gas deposits and
extracting gas from these deposits.!°*

Under Polish law, hydrocarbon deposits, including natural gas, are subject to
mining ownership, with the exclusive rights belonging to the State, i.e. the
Respondent. In accordance with the Geological Law, conducting activities in the
field of exploration, recognition and mining of hydrocarbons from deposits requires
a license, which is granted by the Ministry.!°

Currently, the only way to obtain a gas license is through a public tender. However,
before 1 January 2015, Art. 46 of the Geological Law provided an exception,
according to which the Ministry was able to grant a license in the “application
comparison” procedure if the applicant had filed its application on or before 30
September 2014. This procedure was also called the “open-door” method.!!°

Once an application is filed, the Ministry has to inform the public. The Ministry’s
announcement contains information on the submission of a license application and

the type of activity and area for which the license is to be granted. In addition, the
Ministry also indicates a deadline for submitting competing applications by other
entities interested in obtaining the license in question, with the term not lasting less
than 90 days. After the necessary time elapses, the Ministry performs a comparison
of all submitted applications. For the application which received the highest rating,
the licensing proceedings are then initiated.'!!

All but one license for which the SPVs applied were to be issued in open-door
procedures. One license regarding the Unikéw gas deposit was acquired from a
third party.!!?

1. Unikéw Proceedings

One year after license No. 19/2009/p was transferred to Blue Gas Unikow, the SPV
received the Ministry’s decision of 12 July 2012 in which the Ministry requested
that the SPV refrain from violating the terms of the license by submitting a report
on the works carried out under the license in 2011.13

In response, on 24 July 2012 Blue Gas Unik6w sent a letter by which it submitted
the report requested by the Ministry, as well as other relevant documents. In the
same letter it explained the actions it had taken. Subsequently, in a letter dated 26
July 2012, Blue Gas Unik6w further explained the details of the reconstruction of
the Unikéw-2 borehole, described the equipment already installed in the facility,
and described the works that had already been scheduled between October 2012
and February 2013.!!*

Despite this, on 9 November 2012 the Ministry announced the initiation of
proceedings on non-compliance with the terms specified in license No. 19/2009/p.
Then, in a letter on 28 November 2012, the Ministry asked Blue Gas Unikéw to
provide detailed information on the planned implementation of 3D seismic works
and borehole drilling to a depth of 2,000m, and to provide clarifications regarding
the compliance with the license obligations covering the total duration of the
license.!!5

Once again, Blue Gas Unikéw complied with the Ministry’s demands. In a letter on
10 December 2012, Blue Gas Unikéw indicated, among other things, that
immediately after the transfer of the license, it had selected a contractor for the
reconstruction works for the Unikéw-2 well, secured the right to the site, developed
an operating plan for reconstruction and applied to the Regional Mining Office in
Kielce for approval of a mining plan for the reconstruction of the well. At the same
time, BGN indicated that the well had been reconstructed between 6 December

2011 and 19 February 2012, leading to the construction of a gas mine, the launch
of which was scheduled for 21 December 2012.!!°

In that same letter, Blue Gas Unikéw confronted the Ministry’s allegations. It
pointed out that license 19/2009/p was granted for five years, and in section 4 only
the ranges and stages of works were established, while section 9 contained the total
duration of individual stages. The provisions of section 4 of the license did not give
specific deadlines for the completion of particular stages of works, but only their
duration. Such an approach, as emphasized by Blue Gas Unik6w, allows for the
implementation of individual stages of works in periods not longer than specified
in the license (five years), in periods not longer than specified for individual stages,
and in the order described in the license, as the decision to start the next stage
depends on the results obtained at an earlier stage. At the same time, BGN
emphasized that the provisions of section 4 and section 9 of the licenses
demonstrate that the total duration of stage I and stage II planned for the trial
exploitation of the Unikéw-2 well was to be 36 months.!!”

Further, Blue Gas Unikéw explained that in the light of the provisions of section
10, the license holder should start the works specified in section 4 no later than one
month from the date of the license being granted. The former license holder (PL
Energia) did not commence the implementation of these works, which was the
reason for the transfer of the license to Blue Gas Holding, which without undue
delay complied with the license provisions. In addition, Blue Gas Unikéw noted
that the Ministry did not respond to the implementation schedule of the various
stages of the license activity when transferring the license.!'®

The Ministry did not accept Blue Gas Unikéw’s explanations and issued a decision
of 22 February 2013 calling on Blue Gas Unikéw to immediately stop the alleged
violations.!!°

The Ministry stated that although the license did not specify the completion dates
of individual stages of works, but rather only their duration, the exact schedule of
implementing works was specified in the PRG Documentation. In the Ministry’s
opinion, the reconstruction of the Unikéw-2 well and the 3D seismic work were not
carried out in line with the schedule. It estimated that all of the works referred to in
section 4 of the license were obligatory, and Blue Gas Unikéw, after completing
the previous stage, had the opportunity to decide on the next stage. In the event of
unsatisfactory results in earlier stages, Blue Gas Unikéw could withdraw from the
next stage and renounce the license. The Ministry threatened that if 3D seismic
works did not commence by 30 April 2013, in accordance with Art. 37 (2) of the
Geological Law, it might revoke the license without compensation.!”°

Therefore, in its letter of 12 March 2013, Blue Gas Unikéw asked Respondent’s
Chief Geologist for a meeting to discuss issues related to the license. In a letter of
12 March 2013, the Ministry indicated that organizing a meeting with the Chief
Geologist would not be possible in the near future. Instead, the Ministry requested
that all explanations related to the license be sent in writing.!7!

In the meantime, on 21 March 2013, Blue Gas Unik6éw challenged the Ministry’s
decision of 22 February 2013. Blue Gas Unik6w repeated its argument that license
19/2009/p did not give specific deadlines for the completion of particular stages of
works, but only their duration. Moreover, the SPV noted that the work schedule
specified in the PRG Documentation was not an integral part of the license.'??These
arguments were in line with Art. 43 sec. 2 of the Geological Law-,

Ifthe Ministry had disagreed and dismissed Blue Gas Unikow’s appeal of 21 March
2013, this would have given Blue Gas Unik6w the right to appeal the dismissal in
court. Instead, however, the Ministry delayed the proceedings and, on 14 August
2013, called on Blue Gas Unik6w to supplement and submit explanations to its 21
March 2013 challenging of the Ministry’s initial decision.'”*

On 29 October 2013, Blue Gas Unik6w sent a letter in which it provided the
Ministry with the requested explanations. At the same time, Blue Gas Unikéw
undertook to immediately submit to the Ministry the documentation and studies
created in the process of designing 3D seismic works, which required the Ministry’s
approval or consent.!*4

On 18 September 2013, Blue Gas Unikéw applied to the Ministry for an extension
of the validity of license No. 19/2009/p until 30 September 2015. This application
was subsequently supplemented with a letter dated 30 October 2013.'25

Afterwards, in a letter of 23 December 2013, supplemented with letters of 31
January and 11 February 2014, Blue Gas Unik6w applied for an amendment to the
license for the recognition works it planned to carry out by 30 September 2015 by
removing phase III from the license, including the construction of an additional
borehole with a maximum depth of 2,100m, and limiting stage II to carrying out a
trial operation of the Unikéw-2 borehole.!?°

Blue Gas Unik6éw argued that to have the Unikéw natural gas deposit properly
documented, which was the purpose of license No. 19/2009/p, it was not necessary
to drill an additional borehole or perform 3D seismic surveys, which due to the
small area being investigated were unnecessary because they would not give

reliable results. At the same time, it argued that further utilization of the deposit
would allow a detailed recognition of its capacity and structure.'2”

As a result, on 23 January 2014 the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unikéw of the
initiation of proceedings to amend license No. 19/2009/p. In addition, in another
letter on the same date, the Ministry asked Blue Gas Unikéw for an urgent
explanation of the doubts regarding the commencement date of the trial exploitation
of the Unikow-2 well.!”8

On 28 January 2014, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unik6w of the first extension
of the proceedings to amend the license, this time until 10 March 2014. After two
months of inactivity, in a letter on 7 March 2014, the Ministry extended the
proceedings again, this time until 31 March 2014. On each occasion, the Ministry
referred to an unspecified need to supplement the evidence, including obtaining
further clarifications from Blue Gas Unik6w regarding the proposed amendment to
the license.'?°

On 13 March 2014, Blue Gas Unikéw informed the Ministry that according to a
statement from the Regional Mining Office, the approval of the updated mining
plan for the mine (plan ruchu kopaini), adjusted to the new license, would take
approximately 14 days. However, the failure to obtain approval of this document
by 31 March 2014 resulted in the mine being shut down, which exposed the
company to financial losses. Therefore, Blue Gas Unikéw asked for an urgent
decision regarding the amendment to the license.'*°

On 26 March 2014, the Ministry issued a decision amending license No. 19/2009/p.
In doing so, it agreed with Blue Gas Unikéw that performing works unnecessary
for recognizing the deposit would in turn unnecessarily extend the time for having
it documented, which would then delay the commencement of gas mining. As a
result, the Ministry accepted the scope of the recognition of works proposed by
Blue Gas Unikéw.'*!

On 10 July 2015, Blue Gas Unikéw applied to the Ministry to convert license No.
19/2009/p into a unified license to explore the Unikéw natural gas deposit and to
mine the gas from it.!*?

Four days later, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unik6w to prove its experience in
the exploration and recognition of hydrocarbon deposits, the exploitation of
hydrocarbons from deposits, and to submit documents confirming the geological
documentation of the hydrocarbons deposit, as well as other equivalent
documentation confirming that the activity of mining hydrocarbons from deposits
had been continued for at least three years. Blue Gas Unikéw responded in a letter

of 27 July 2015, arguing that the obligation to prove experience in the field of
exploration and recognition of deposits, as well as the inclusion of documents
approving the geological documentation of hydrocarbons deposits only applied to
entities applying for a license under the new provisions of the Geological Law,
which did not apply to Blue Gas Unikéw’s application.'**

In a letter of 20 August 2015, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unikéw to submit
additional documents concerning the motion of 10 July 2015, despite the fact that
Blue Gas Unik6w had already submitted such documents, which the Ministry had
admitted. However, the Ministry contended that in each administrative proceeding,
the evidence was collected separately, meaning that Blue Gas Unik6w had to file
the same documents again. This position of the Ministry conflicted with Art. 77,
section 4 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, which states that “universally
accepted facts and facts known to the administrative body ex officio do not require
proof. Parties to proceedings should be informed of facts that are known to the
administrative body.” This language means that once the Ministry obtained certain
documents, it should have used them wherever and whenever they were needed. 134

Blue Gas Unik6w did not want to extend the proceedings further and therefore did
not argue with the Ministry’s demands, despite the fact it considered them to be
unfounded. Instead, it submitted the following documents:

e financial statement of Blue Gas Unik6éw for 2014;

e declaration by Blue Gas Holding on the readiness to finance the activity
covered by Blue Gas Unik6éw’s application for the conversion of the license;

e description of geological works, including geological works previously
performed under license No. 19/2009/p with a description of their results;

e a statement that all relevant documents submitted to the Ministry should be
taken into account in the proceedings regarding the conversion of the
license.'*°

On 4 September 2015, Blue Gas Unik6w issued a letter by which it submitted a
revised application for the conversion of the license and, in addition, applied for the
conclusion of an annex extending the term of the agreement of 31 March 2009 for
the establishment of a mining usufruct for the period until the new unified license
was granted.!°°

On 11 September 2015, i-e., more than 14 months after the application had been
filed, the Ministry sent Blue Gas Unik6w a letter informing it of the commencement

of the proceedings regarding the conversion of the license.!'*’ In a letter of 15
October 2015, it set the end date at 31 December 2015.'°8

After two months of inactivity, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unik6éw that
because other administrative authorities were also in delay with their respective
decisions, the relevant proceedings could not complete before the deadline of the
trial exploitation of the Unikéw-2 well. Therefore, Blue Gas Unikéw’s application
of 10 July 2015 became partially obsolete. The Ministry suggested modifications
to the application and the accompanying PRG Documentation.!*°

Blue Gas Unik6w had no other choice than to amend the application in accordance
with the Ministry’s suggestions, which it did on 22 December 2015.'4°

In a letter of 5 January 2016, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unik6éw that the
proceedings on the conversion of the license had been completed, but the Ministry
withheld the issuance of the decision for 8 months.'#! Respondent has provided
reasons for this delay, such as the Claimants’ alleged noncompliance with the terms
of the Unikéw Exploration Licence as amended on 26 March 2014, and the lack of
the Ministry’s experience in handling proceedings for the conversion, but such
allegations are factually inaccurate.'”

Being aware of the delay of administrative proceedings concerning all SPVs, on 15
April 2016 Blue Gas Holding sent a letter to the Ministry requesting the positive
consideration of all applications as soon as possible. Blue Gas Holding emphasized
that it found itself in an extremely difficult situation because of the duration of the
proceedings that had triggered a risk of losing its bank. At the same time, Blue Gas
Holding referred to one of the fundamental rights of a party to the proceedings: the
right to examine the case without unreasonable delay.'*7

Blue Gas Holding claimed that the excessive length of ongoing proceedings
prevented the SPVs from taking full advantage of their rights destabilizing their
business operations and generally manifesting uncertainty as to future actions. To
exemplify this, Blue Gas Holding noted that the Ministry had still not issued the
decision on the conversion of license No. 19/2009/p, despite Blue Gas Unikéw's
compliance with every demand the Ministry had made. '*4

The Ministry ignored the 15 April 2016 letter. Instead, after four months of silence,
on 9 August 2016 the Ministry converted the license. On the same day, the Ministry

entered into the previously mentioned agreement for the establishment of a mining
usufruct.!4

On 24 August 2016, following the receipt of license No. 19/2009/L, Blue Gas
Unik6w submitted the new PRG Documentation for the Ministry to approve.'#° In
doing so, Claimants noted that that 3D seismic surveys would be optional, as
explicitly started by the Ministry when it approved the Unik6w PRG
Documentation within its decision on the conversion of the Unikéw exploration
license.!47

Immediately afterwards, in a letter of 29 August 2016, Blue Gas Unikéw notified
the Ministry of the commencement of works covered by the newly converted
license.'48A few days later, Blue Gas Unikéw applied for approval of the DGI
Documentation for the Unikéw natural gas deposit.'"”

However, on 22 September 2016 the Ministry objected to the PRG Documentation
and four days later informed Blue Gas Unik6w of the extension until 30 November
2016 of the deadline for approval of the DGI Documentation. In its 26 September
letter, the Ministry justified the extension by referring to “the necessity of gaining
opinions of all of the cooperating authorities,” yet the applicable law indicated that
the decision only required an opinion from one authority, the head of the Lututow
commune, and the deadline for issuing such an opinion would have passed well
before the new deadline.'*° This caused further delays and jeopardized the
Investment.!*!

Blue Gas Unik6w appealed against the decision regarding the PRG Documentation
on 10 October 2016, arguing that the PRG Documentation was created after an in-
depth analysis taking into account the current situation in the area. It also argued
that the decision conflicted with the practice which the Ministry had previously
accepted.'>? Further, it explained that the dates at the beginning and completion of
the 3D seismic survey had been clearly specified in the PRG Documentation
concerning the 3D seismic survey as dependent on the date at the beginning of the
3D seismic survey planned in Supplement No. 1 to the Unikéw PRG
Documentation, which was unknown as it had yet to be approved.!* It took another
three months for the Ministry to issue a decision in which it upheld the appealed
decision of 22 September 2016.!%*

In the meantime, Blue Gas Unik6éw received a letter of 4 November 2016 in which
the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unikéw that the DGI Documentation had been

handed over to the Mineral Resources Commission, a subsidiary body of the
Minister of the Environment, in order to obtain opinions on its substantive and
formal legal correctness.'*> The Unik6w DGI Documentation had also been sent to
the Polish Geological Institute, although this had not been mentioned in the
Ministry’s letter.!°

The opinion of the Polish Geological Institute, which was asked to verify the
coordinates of the territory in the Unik6w DGI Documentation was issued on 23
November 2017, although this opinion was never sent to Blue Gas Unikow.!*” The
Mineral Resources Commission shared the view that the Unikéw DGI
Documentation had been prepared correctly but, to be approved, the title of the
documentation would need to be changed and certain revisions would have to be
made.!>8 However, the Mineral Resources Commission reported in its letter to the
Ministry of 20 December 2016 something quite different, but such letter was never
communicated to Blue Gas Unikow.!*?

Instead, the Ministry was silent for 1 month after which it informed Blue Gas
Unik6w that the deadline for the completion of the proceedings for the approval of
the Unikéw DGI Documentation had been extended until 31 March 2017. This
meant that the proceedings would at the earliest end seven months after their
commencement.!°

In a letter of 7 February 2017, Blue Gas Unik6éw requested guidance on how to
resume business because according to the provisions of license No. 19/2009/L, the
production test of the Unikéw-2 well should have been carried out by 31 December
2016. The SPV reminded the Ministry that in order to be able to continue mining it
had applied to the Ministry for the approval of the DGI documentation on 8
September 2016. In turn, a verbal statement by the Chairman of the Commission
on Mineral Resources, before which Blue Gas Unik6w’s representatives appeared
on 15 December 2016, indicated that the DGI Documentation should only specify
the area of the deposit, and that after its urgent approval, Blue Gas Unikéw would
obtain an investment decision and be able to continue mining.'°!

On 23 February 2017, Blue Gas Unikéw applied for the urgent approval of the DGI
Documentation for the Unikéw natural gas deposit.!©

Blue Gas Unik6éw argued that pursuant to Art. 35 of the Code of Administrative
Procedure, administrative proceedings should be completed without undue delay
and in any event no later than in one month from the date of their commencement.

In particularly complex cases, the maximum duration of the proceedings cannot
exceed two months. Blue Gas Unik6w pointed out that while the Ministry could
have considered the basis of the facts and evidence known to it ex officio, the
applicable statutory deadlines had long since lapsed.'®

Blue Gas Unikéw accused the Licensing Authority of inactivity committed in
flagrant breach of the law, arguing that the Ministry’s failure to act in accordance
with the law:

e made it impossible to obtain an investment decision enabling further
utilization and rational management of the Unikéw deposit;

e led to a deterioration in the well and the operational equipment, including
corrosion, and consequently to a reduction in the technical efficiency (Blue
Gas Unik6w incurred significant expenditures to maintain unused engines in
working order, and increased the risk of their malfunctioning due to being
restarted after an extended period of disuse);

e prevented Blue Gas Unikéw from carrying out condensate, heat and electricity
sales activities that in turn jeopardized the SPV’s financial standing. '*

On 2 March 2017, the Ministry reacted by issuing a letter in which it informed Blue
Gas Unik6w of the extension of the proceedings until 30 April 2017.'°

On March 13, 2017, after a telephone conversation Mr. Jacek Strzelecki (Blue Gas
Holding) and Ms. Joanna Potega (the Ministry), in which Ms. Potega suggested
submitting a new, supplemented application, Blue Gas Unikéw once again asked
the Ministry for urgent approval of the DGI Documentation, at the same time
submitting the modified application.

The Ministry used the modification as a means to delay the proceedings further, on
12 May 2017 issuing another letter in which it informed Blue Gas Unikéw of the
postponement of the deadline for the proceedings to be concluded until 30 June
2017.'%7 In the meantime, on 26-27 April 2017, the Regional Mining Office in
Kielce carried out the inspection of the Unikow deposit.'®

On 4 May 2017, Blue Gas Unikéw filed reservations to the report issued in
conclusion of the inspection. The SPV stated that in its opinion, the Director of the
Regional Mining Office in Kielce sought to limit Blue Gas Unik6éw’s rights under
the license and that he exceeded his authority by trying to interpret the scope of the
license. In the letters of 22 May 2017 and 27 June 2017, the Director of the Regional
Mining Office in Kielce did not specify any reservations, indicating that further

operations of the Unikéw-2 well were possible, provided that the Ministry approved
the amended PRG Documentation.'®

Eventually, in a letter of 24 May 2017, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unik6w that
the application for the approval of the DGI Documentation had been dropped as
unexamined, which effectively meant the discontinuation of the proceedings.'””
Blue Gas Unikéw had two options: i) either try to file a complaint with the
Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and extend the proceedings even
further; or ii) to withdraw its original application and file a new one as suggested
by the Ministry’s officials, hoping that this time it would be dealt with in a timely
fashion. Blue Gas Unikéw chose to file a new application'”!

On 4 July 2017, Blue Gas Unik6w set a meeting with the Ministry during which the
parties discussed the modification of Supplement No. | to the Unik6w PRG
Documentation, as well as the status of the proceedings for the approval of the
Unik6w DGI Documentation. Regarding the status of the proceedings, the
Ministry’s representatives informed the company that in order for the proceedings
to be completed, (1) Blue Gas Unik6éw needed to withdraw its application for
restitution of the seven-day time limit for supplementing its application for the
approval of the Unik6w DGI Documentation; (2) the Ministry needed to prepare a
letter summarizing its position and, if needed, indicating everything that needed to
be changed or supplemented; (3) Blue Gas Unik6w needed to revise the Unikow
DGI Documentation in accordance with the Ministry’s comments and submit it to
the Ministry; (4) Blue Gas Unik6éw needed to prepare a letter explaining its position
on the issue of holding a right to use the geological information; and (5) the Ministry
needed to ask for the opinion of the Mineral Resources Commission so it could
approve the revised Unik6w DGI Documentation. !77

On 17 July 2017, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unik6w of a third extension to
the deadline for settling the proceedings regarding the PRG Documentation, this
time until 31 August 2017. Meanwhile, the Ministry demanded additional
explanations.'7>

On 4 September 2017, the company submitted he corrected, revised Supplement
No. | to the Uniké6w PRG Documentation as requested by the Ministry.'”*

On 11 September 2017, the Ministry communicated a fourth extension, pushing the
end of the proceedings to 31 October 2017. With this extension the Ministry again

Unik6w submitted the requested clarifications. !7°

184. On 13 November 2017, the Ministry issued a letter to which the draft decision on
the approval of the PRG Documentation was attached. The letter was addressed to
the municipalities in the areas of which the Unik6éw Project was located.!””

185. This was issued more than 14 months after the submission of the application
regarding the approval of the PRG Documentation, and after Blue Gas Unikéw had
filed for bankruptcy. The Ministry was well aware that Blue Gas Unik6w had filed
for bankruptcy, as the management board of Blue Gas Unik6éw informed the
Ministry’s subordinates immediately after submitting the bankruptcy motion.
Almost instantly, it was confirmed in writing in Blue Gas Unik6éw’s letter of 13
November 2017.'8

2. | Wrzosowo Proceedings

186. On 22 January 2014, Blue Gas Unik6éw filed the application for a license for the
recognition of the Wrzosowo natural gas deposit.'””

187. On 28 February 2014, the Ministry issued the first call to remove “formal defects”
in the application. In addition, the Ministry requested Blue Gas Unikéw to modify
the coordinates and redefine the area to be covered by the license. In response, Blue
Gas Unik6éw submitted a revised application and PRG Documentation.'*°

188. The Ministry did not react to this submission. Blue Gas Unik6w thus sent a letter
on 25 April 2014 asking the Authority for information on the status of the
proceedings.!*!

189. Eventually, on 21 May 2014, the Ministry confirmed that it would promptly publish
information in the EU Official Journal about Blue Gas Unikéw’s application (the
open-door procedure). The Ministry explained, however, that it had no influence on
the timing of the publication, which could take up to two months, after which
potential competing applicants would have at least 90 days to file for the license.
The Ministry stated that naming the “winner” of the open-door procedure “should
be completed within two months.”!**

On 4 June 2014, Blue Gas Unikéw provided its extensive explanations to all of the
issues the Ministry had raised. The letter was accompanied mostly by financial
documents the Ministry required.!*°

Although the Ministry accepted these explanations, in a letter dated 3 July 2014 it
requested Blue Gas Unik6w to submit statements by the Claimants regarding their
financing. By letter of 11 July 2014, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted the documents
the Ministry requested.'*+

Shortly afterwards, on 15 July 2014, Blue Gas Unik6w sent a letter to the Ministry
asking about the status of the proceedings and the date of their conclusion. The SPV
also requested the Ministry to provide information regarding the “open-door”
procedure and when it would start.'*5

In response, the Ministry asked for an additional copy of the PRG Documentation,
which led to a further unnecessary extension of the proceedings. Three weeks later,
the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unikéw that it had initiated publication which
commenced the “open-door” procedure.!*°

On 10 December 2014 the Ministry finally notified Blue Gas Unikéw of the
commencement of proceedings on the basis of the application filed almost 11
months earlier.'*”

The proceedings were completed in January 2015. While this date indicated that the
proceedings had not been unduly lengthy, the Ministry had only informed Blue Gas
Unik6w of the commencement of the proceedings when it was ready to complete
them. This was an improper manipulation of the commencement date in order for
the Ministry to appear to meet the statutory deadlines. '**

Less than a month later, on 16 February 2015, the Ministry granted Blue Gas
Unik6w license No. 1/2015/p. On the same day, Blue Gas Unik6w and the Ministry
entered into an agreement for the establishment of a mining usufruct for the
Wrzosowo natural gas deposit.!*

On 3 July 2015, Blue Gas Unik6w and Blue Gas Wrzosowo jointly applied to the
Ministry for the transfer of license No. 1/2015/p. to Blue Gas Wrzosowo. In
parallel, Blue Gas Unikow and the Ministry conducted extensive correspondence
regarding amending the license and the PRG Documentation for the Wrzosowo
natural gas deposit. This, however, did not impact the transfer of the license to Blue
Gas Wrzosowo.'”

In a letter on 4 September 2015, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unikéw and Blue
Gas Wrzosowo to submit:

e financial statements of both Blue Gas Unikéw and Blue Gas Wrzosowo for
2014 or other documents allowing the financial condition of these SPVs to be
established; and

e Blue Gas Holding’s declaration on its readiness to finance the operations of
Blue Gas Wrzosowo.!*!

Blue Gas Unikéw provided the requested documents on 14 September 2014.!°

Not until 26 October 2015 did the Ministry notify Blue Gas Unikéw and Blue Gas
‘Wrzosowo of the commencement of the proceedings regarding the transfer of
license No. 1/2015/p. to Blue Gas Wrzosowo. On the same day, the Ministry
consented to the assignment of the right of a mining usufruct to Blue Gas
Wrzosowo.!

On 9 November 2015, the Minister transferred the license to Blue Gas Wrzosowo.
On the same day, a tripartite assignment agreement regarding the mining usufruct
rights was concluded.!*

For the next three months, the Ministry remained silent. On 29 January 2016, Blue
Gas Wrzosowo got summoned to supplement the information required for the
approval of the PRG Documentation.!*>

In addition, in a letter of 5 February 2016, the Ministry called on Blue Gas
‘Wrzosowo to eliminate alleged breaches of the terms of the license which had just
been transferred. The Ministry claimed that:

e reports on the activities covered by the license for quarters II, IIT and IV of
2015, which had been submitted, did not meet the requirements of sec. 10 of
the license:

© presentation in the required tabular form, the template of which could

specified in the license had been provided.!*°

Blue Gas Group sent an explanatory letter indicating, among other things, that the
confirmation of payment had been sent to the Ministry on 4 March 2015.!97

On 16 February 2016, Blue Gas Wrzosowo provided the requested documents and
information regarding the approval of the PRG Documentation.!°*

The Ministry commenced the proceedings regarding the approval of the PRG
Documentation on 9 May 2016, nearly eight months after Blue Gas Wrzosowo had
applied for it. On the same day, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Wrzosowo to
rectify the alleged deficiencies in the application. This occurred eight months after
it had been filed.'”

Concurrently, Blue Gas Wrzosowo prepared a thorough plan for the development
of the Wrzosowo deposit. As a result, on 4 July 2016 it filed the application (dated
30 June 2016) for the conversion of license No. 1/2015/p into a unified license. This
led to the withdrawal of the motion to change the original license and the PRG
Documentation.”

The Ministry subsequently extended the deadline for concluding the proceedings
on the conversion of license No. 1/2015/p five times, which in total resulted in 15
months of delay: (i) in the letter of 31 August 2016, until 31 October 2016; (ii) in
the letter of 14 November 2016, until 31 December 2016; (iii) in the letter of 3
March 2017, until 30 April 2017; (iv) in the letter of 17 July 2017, until 31 August
2017; and (v) in the letter of 11 September 2017, until 31 October 2017.20!

On 10 August 2017, Blue Gas Unikéw, Blue Gas Wrzosowo and Blue Gas
Stanowice sent a letter to the Ministry demanding that it stopped breaching the law
by extending the proceedings regarding:

e the conversion of license No. 1/2015/p regarding the Wrzosowo deposit;

e granting a license for the recognition of the Stanowice deposit;

e granting a license for the recognition of the Miedzyzdroje deposit; and

The SPVs indicated in the letter that the Ministry’s unlawful behavior jeopardized
the operations of the entire Blue Gas Group. The SPVs reminded the Ministry that
under the provisions applicable in the pending proceedings, those SPVs which
already had recognition licenses had the right to convert them into unified licenses
only until 1 January 2015. The chronicity of the administrative proceedings
conducted by the Ministry deprived them of this opportunity.?°?

The SPVs pointed out that because of the Ministry’s inaction for almost two years,
they could not conduct the economic activities covered by the scope of the licenses
for which they had applied.?°*

In a letter of 18 September 2017, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Wrzosowo to
remove non-existent formal deficiencies in the application for the conversion of the
license. Blue Gas Wrzosowo responded with a letter of 2 October 2017, explaining
that, contrary to the Ministry’s allegations, two copies of the application had been
submitted correctly together with a description of the geological works, including
geological works previously performed under license No. 1/2015. Blue Gas
‘Wrzosowo also submitted a supplement to the previously submitted description of
geological works."

Only on 16 November 2017 did the Ministry inform Blue Gas Wrzosowo that the
proceedings regarding the conversion of the license had been commenced (16
months from the date of the application). This commencement of the proceedings
took place after Blue Gas Unik6w had filed for bankruptcy and after the other SPVs
had to initiate winding up procedures.?°°

For this reason, on 28 December 2017 Blue Gas Wrzosowo issued a letter in which
it waived license No. 1/2015/p. The SPV explained that the excessive length of
administrative proceedings conducted by the Ministry made it impossible to reach
the economic goal for which Blue Gas Wrzosowo had been established. Since the
SPV was not able to continue the activities covered by the license, all of the
prerequisites for the expiration of the license referred to in Art. 38 § 2 of the

Geological Law had been met.?°”

On 1 April 2019, Blue Gas Wrzosowo received a letter from the Ministry informing
it that the proceedings regarding the expiration of license No. 1/2015/p were about
to end. This was 14 months after the relevant waiver.7°*

3. Stanowice Proceedings

On 15 September 2014, Blue Gas Stanowice submitted an application to the
Ministry for a license for the recognition of the Stanowice natural gas deposit.?”

Despite consistent requests for status updates concerning the proceedings, the
Ministry did not act for almost ten months. On 8 July 2015, Blue Gas Stanowice
demanded that the Ministry stop breaching the law by extending the proceedings.”!”

Specifically, Blue Gas Wrzosowo demanded that the Ministry:
e specify the final deadline to conclude the proceedings;
e explain the reasons for not settling the matter on time; and

e take measures to prevent a future breach of the statutory provisions providing
time limits in administrative proceedings.?!!

The Ministry responded by calling on Blue Gas Stanowice to eliminate the alleged
deficiencies in the 15 September 2014 application. To save time, Blue Gas
Stanowice complied with the Ministry’s demands. Despite this, in a letter on 7
August 2015, the Ministry requested further explanations.?!?

In response to this letter, on 28 August 2015, Blue Gas Stanowice provided the
Ministry with a uniform version of the 15 September 2014 license application, with
attachments, and then submitted that letter, in which it provided detailed
explanations of the application for the second time.”!?

On 14 July 2015, the Ministry sent a letter requesting the company to modify its
application and to provide additional explanations regarding some of the
substantive issues.7!

On 23 July 2015, Blue Gas Stanowice submitted a letter asking for a seven-day
extension to the deadline to submit the requested documents and explanations.”!°

On 29 July 2015, Blue Gas Stanowice sent the corrected application, providing all
of the requested information.?!°

On 31 August 2015, the Ministry issued a ruling in which it admitted that the
proceedings in question had been excessively lengthy. However, the Ministry

conclude that the delays did not constitute a material breach of the law and therefore
the deadline for the conclusion of the proceedings could be extended until 31 May
2016.7!7

On 26 October 2015, the Ministry again called on Blue Gas Stanowice to provide
explanations to the license application.7!* The Ministry discussed the rationality of
Blue Gas Stanowice’s plans and suggested dividing the term of the license into two
stages:

e stage I, including mandatory reconstruction of the Stanowice-2 borehole,
mandatory trial exploitation of the deposit, and optional reconstruction of the
Stanowice-3 borehole, which should not take longer than four and a half years;
and

e stage II, covering the remaining optional works, taking no longer than eighteen
months.”

Blue Gas Stanowice responded in a letter of 10 November 2015 in which it followed
the Ministry’s suggestions.?”°

On 11 April 2016, the Ministry issued a fourth letter asking for further explanations
and changes to the work schedule.?”!

On 27 April 2016, Blue Gas Stanowice issued a letter in which it provided yet
another package of documents required by the Ministry. Blue Gas Stanowice firmly
stated that there were no grounds for introducing changes to the license application
and the PRG Documentation in accordance with the Ministry’s arbitrary

Fons 222
suggestions.

The Ministry again went silent, this time almost ten months until on 12 January
2017, when the Ministry informed Blue Gas Stanowice of the absence of any
competing applications filed during the “open-door” procedure. On the same day,
the Ministry issued another notification on the commencement of proceedings on
granting the license (two and a half years from the date of Blue Gas Stanowice’s
application).

The Ministry again subsequently announced three further delays to the proceedings,
amounting to an additional nine months of delay: (i) in the letter of 2 March 2017,

in the letter of 17 July 2017, until 30 August 2017.74

On 10 August 2017, together with Blue Gas Unik6éw and Blue Gas Wrzosowo, Blue
Gas Stanowice sent a letter in which it demanded that the Ministry stopped
breaching the law by extending the proceedings.?7>

The Ministry’s first reaction was to extend the proceedings yet again, this time until
31 October 2017. The Ministry then issued a ruling admitting that the proceedings
were excessively lengthy. The Ministry again claimed, however, that the delays did
not constitute a material breach of the law, and extended the proceedings a fifth
time, until 31 December 2017.726

Less than a month after receiving this ruling, Blue Gas Stanowice received the
Ministry’s letter of 12 October 2017 in which it requested, for the fifth time, further
explanations. The Ministry’s inquiry concerned the maximum depth of the
Stanowice-1, Stanowice-2 and Stanowice-3 boreholes. Blue Gas Stanowice
complied with the Ministry’s demands.”?”

On 16 November 2017, Ms. Joanna Potega accidentally encountered Mr. Jacek
Strzelecki, CEO of Blue Gas Stanowice, and had indicated that the license would
be found to still contain deficiencies.””8

Finally, in a letter of 21 November 2017, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Stanowice
that the proceedings regarding the license for the recognition of the Stanowice
natural gas deposit had been completed. This letter came in more than 38 months
after the date of Blue Gas Stanowice’s license application, which included 10
months of having the license application unexamined followed by 26 months of
analysis which included intermittent months of silence.??? Blue Gas Unikéw had
already filed for bankruptcy and Blue Gas Holding had to begin winding up the
other SPVs.7°°

4. Miedzyzdroje Proceedings

Blue Gas Unik6w filed the application for a license for the recognition of the
Miedzyzdroje natural gas deposit on 26 September 2014. Despite repeat requests
for information on the progress on the application, the Ministry failed to act for ten
months.77!

237. As with the Stanowice project, this resulted in a letter of 8 July 2015 in which Blue
Gas Unikéw demanded that the Ministry stopped breaching the law by extending
the proceedings regarding:

e the application of 26 September 2014 concerning the Miedzyzdroje project;
and
the application of 30 September 2014 concerning the Lelikow project.?**

238. Because this letter was sent almost nine months after the dates of the applications,
Blue Gas Unikéw demanded that the Ministry:

e specify a final deadline to conclude the proceedings;
e explain the reasons for not settling the matter on time; and

e take measures to prevent future breaches of the statutory provisions by
providing time limits in administrative proceedings.?*?

239. On 14 July 2015, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unik6w of alleged deficiencies in
the license application that needed to be remedied and asked for explanatory
information. Blue Gas Unikéw responded with a letter on 23 July 2015.24

240. On 9 September 2015, Blue Gas Unikow decided to amend the license application
by deleting from the scope of optional works the additional drilling of one to two
new boreholes.?*°

241. On 18 August 2016, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unikéw of the commencement
of administrative proceedings regarding the license, almost a year after the
application.”*°

242. Two weeks later, the Ministry issued a ruling admitting that these proceedings were
also excessively lengthy but again declared they did not constitute a “material
breach” of the law. The Ministry also added an extension to the duration of the
proceedings, setting the end date at 31 May 2016.7*”

243. Expecting delays in the proceedings, Blue Gas Unikéw amended the license
application by deleting from the scope of optional works the additional drilling of
one to two new boreholes.”**

The Ministry continued with additional demands for alleged deficiencies, and
additional information was provided.?*°

In light of the issues with the administrative proceedings, on 15 April 2016 Blue
Gas Holding sent the previously-mentioned letter to the Ministry in which it
requested the positive consideration of all of the applications filed by the SPVs as
soon as possible.?4°

The Ministry failed to act for almost seven months after receiving the letter. On 12
January 2017, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Stanowice of the absence of any
competing applications filed during the “open-door” procedure. On the same day,
Blue Gas Unikéw was informed of the commencement of the administrative
proceedings which under law should have been initiated with the license application
of 26 September 2014.74!

In a letter of 2 March 2017, the Ministry pushed back the deadline for concluding
the proceedings to 30 April 2017.77

On 27 April 2017, four months from the commencement of the proceedings, the
Ministry issued a ruling in which it obliged Blue Gas Unik6éw to request the
Regional Director of Environmental Protection in Szczecin to obtain “a decision on
the confirmation of a possible obligation to carry out an environmental impact
report for the project.” This occurred 18 months after the first notification in which
the Ministry mentioned environmental issues.“

In the ruling, the Ministry agreed that Blue Gas Unik6w did not have any obligation
to obtain an environmental decision for the Miedzyzdroje Project but at the same
time that it potentially might have. Despite no legal grounds for the allegations, this
was used to delay the proceedings further.7** On 10 May 2017, the Ministry
suspended the administrative proceedings

On 23 May 2017, Blue Gas Unik6w challenged the rulings by filing a request to
have the case re-examined.”*°

On 10 August 2017, together with Blue Gas Stanowice and Blue Gas Wrzosowo,
Blue Gas Unik6w sent the letter in which it demanded that the Ministry stopped
breaching the law by extending the proceedings.?*°

As before, on 14 September 2017, the Ministry issued a ruling admitting that the
proceedings were excessively lengthy. And as before, the Ministry claimed that
Blue Gas Unikéw’s complaints were, nonetheless, unjustified. The Ministry

claimed that while the proceedings were lengthy, their duration did not result from
the Ministry’s misconduct, but from their specificity.?*”

5. | Zakrzewo Proceedings

On 28 March 2014, Blue Gas Unik6w sent a letter to the Ministry stating that it was
interested in developing the Zakrzewo. It also asked about the legal status of the
deposit and whether the deposit was covered by a license. The Ministry did not
respond, and Blue Gas Unik6w reiterated its request on 25 April 2014.78

The Ministry replied in a letter of 21 May 2014, confirming that the deposit in
question was not covered by a license. As a result, on 29 September 2014, Blue Gas
Zakrzewo applied for a license to recognize the Zakrzewo natural gas deposit.”

As with the Stanowice and Miedzyzdroje projects, this license application was also
put aside for almost ten months, even though Blue Gas Zakrzewo repeatedly
requested information on the subject.?*’ Such requests took place on 12 November
2014, 4 February 2015 and 29 May 2015, all of which received no response.”*!

Eventually, on 8 July 2015, Blue Gas Zakrzewo sent a letter in which it demanded
that the Ministry stopped breaching the law by extending the proceedings beyond
statutory deadlines.?>*

Therefore, exactly as with the Stanowice and Miedzyzdroje projects, Blue Gas
Zakrzewo demanded that the Ministry:

e specify a final deadline to conclude the proceedings;
e explain the reasons for not settling the matter on time; and

e take measures to prevent future breaches of statutory provisions by providing
time limits in administrative proceedings.”

On 16 July 2015 the Minister issued a ruling, refusing to commence administrative
proceedings on the basis of Blue Gas Zakrzewo’s license application because such
proceedings had already been initiated on an application by another entity (Green
Gas Polska sp. z 0.0.).7°*

On 5 August 2015, Blue Gas Zakrzewo expressed its surprise, indicating it had

learned of the third-party application almost ten months after it had been filed,
despite the fact that in accordance with Art. 46 of the Geological Law, the Ministry

should have announced this application publicly without undue delay. The
Ministry’s failure to perform its duties on time caused Blue Gas Zakrzewo to incur
significant costs without taking into account the third-party application, the
knowledge of which would have assuredly affected the SPV’s business strategy.>°°

On 31 August 2015 the Ministry issued a ruling admitting that these proceedings
were also excessively lengthy. And again, in the Ministry’s opinion this situation
did not constitute a material breach of the law.?*°

Nevertheless, as the license was to be granted during the “open-door” procedure,
Blue Gas Zakrzewo awaited the mandatory publication of information regarding
the third-party application. This was released on 15 September 2017.7°’On 7
December 2015, Blue Gas Zakrzewo submitted an appropriate competitive license
application.”**

On 5 April 2016, the Ministry issued a letter asking for additional documents and
information.?*” Blue Gas Zakrzewo complied with the Ministry’s demands in a
letter of 20 April 2016.7?

Green Gas Polska sp. z 0.0. ultimately withdrew its license application on 18 May
2016.76 Therefore, on 23 June 2016, the Ministry discontinued the proceedings
regarding that application. The application of Blue Gas Zakrzewo was now the only
one for the Ministry to rule on, but it still took significant time.?°!

Eventually, on 24 June 2016, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Zakrzewo of the
commencement of proceedings regarding granting the license.” On 31 August
2016, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Zakrzewo that the proceedings would be
concluded by 31 October 2016.7

After being asked about the status of the proceedings again on 2 November 2016,
the Ministry once again pushed back the end date of the proceedings, this time until
30 June 2017.2

Finally, on 11 January 2017, (27 months from the submission of the initial license
application and 13 months after the submission of the second license application),
the Ministry notified Blue Gas Zakrzewo of the completion of the proceedings.”
However, Blue Gas Zakrzewo had to wait an additional four months until the
Ministry granted the SPV license No. 3/2017/p. on 12 May 2017. On the same day,

Blue Gas entered into an agreement with the Ministry for the establishment of a
266
t.

mining usufruct.
Notwithstanding this, Blue Gas Zakrzewo did not operate in a vacuum. It was a part
of the Blue Gas Group which, in turn, was a vehicle for the Investment. Hence, once
the other components of the vehicle broke down, Blue Gas Zakrzewo had to be
scrapped along with them. Therefore, on 28 December 2017, it waived license No.
3/2017/p. Blue Gas Zakrzewo explained that as the licensee it was not able to
continue the activities covered by the license (due to the lack of financing from
Blue Gas Holding), and therefore all of the prerequisites for the expiration of the
license referred to in Art. 38 § 2 of the Geological Law had been met.?°”

On 8 April 2018, more than a year from the date of the waiver, the Ministry officials
sent a letter to the Roman Catholic Parish of St. Klemens in Zakrzewo stating that
the Ministry had just learned that Blue Gas Zakrzewo had not commenced any
geological works on the “Zakrzewo” gas deposit.?°*

On the same day, the Ministry issued a letter addressed to Blue Gas Zakrzewo in
which it informed the company of the completion of the proceedings regarding the
expiration of license No. 3/2017/p.?

6.  Lelikow Proceedings

On 30 September 2014, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted an application to the Ministry
for a license for the recognition of the Lelikow natural gas deposit.?”°

As with the Stanowice, Miedzyzdroje and Zakrzewo projects, this license
application was also put aside for almost ten months even though Blue Gas Unikéw
repeatedly requested information on the subject.?”!

Consequently, on 8 July 2015 Blue Gas Unik6w sent a letter in which it demanded
that the Ministry stopped breaching the law by extending the proceedings beyond
statutory deadlines. As with the other projects, on 31 August 2015 the Ministry
issued a ruling admitting that the proceedings regarding the Lelikow project were
also excessively lengthy. The Ministry stated that even though it breached the
applicable law governing the timeframe, it was not a material breach.?””

As with the Miedzyzdroje Project, on 14 July 2015 the Ministry notified Blue Gas
Unik6w of alleged deficiencies in the license application that needed to be
remedied, and it requested explanatory information. Blue Gas Unikéw responded

in a letter of 23 July 2015, in which it complied with almost all of the Ministry’s
requests.?”3

On 18 August 2015, a little less than a year after the date of the license application,
the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unik6éw of the commencement of the administrative
proceedings regarding granting the license. On 7 September 2015, the Ministry
informed Blue Gas Unik6w of the completion of the administrative proceedings.””*

On 11 November 2015, two months after it had communicated the completion of
the administrative proceedings, the Ministry oddly again informed Blue Gas
Unik6w of the completion of the same proceedings. Although the Ministry did not
provide any new information, it did gain additional weeks.?”°

On 30 December 2015, the Ministry issued a decision refusing to grant the license
that Blue Gas Unik6w had applied for within the framework of the Lelikow Project.
In its reasoning, the Ministry stated that Blue Gas Unikéw had not submitted an
environmental decision.?”°

In response, on 28 January 2016 Blue Gas Unik6w sent a letter in which it
demanded that the Ministry overturn its decision entirely and issue a decision on
granting the license for the recognition of the Lelikéw natural gas deposit. In
support of this motion, Blue Gas Unikéw amended the license application so there
would be no doubt that applying for the environmental decision, as described in the
Ministry’s decision of 30 December 2015, would be redundant.?””

Despite no legal basis for doing so, on 23 February 2016, the Ministry informed
Blue Gas Unik6w of the commencement of new proceedings regarding the license
application, as amended by the 28 January 2016 letter.?”*

A new application meant new deadlines, which would be extended even further:
first, until 30 May 2016 and then until 31 July 2016. This was one of the reasons
for Blue Gas Holding’s letter of 15 April 2016.7”

On 30 June 2016, the Ministry asked Blue Gas Unik6w for additional documents
and explanations. Blue Gas Unik6w responded with a letter of 3 August 2016.78”
The Ministry did not respond to the supplementation and explanations for more
than ten months. Instead, it extended the deadline for the proceedings to be
completed until 31 May 2017.78!

After this new deadline lapsed, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unik6w to provide
more explanations. Blue Gas Unikéw responded to the Ministry’s demands on 27
June 2017, limiting its comments to the minimum necessary as, considering past
experiences, Blue Gas Unikéw assumed more elaborate responses would not
accomplish anything and could give the Ministry a reason for extending the
proceedings further.” In this letter, the company attached a license application
with a revised title indicating a “prospection and exploration (exploration and
recognition) license” as the type of license being applied for with respect to the
Lelikow deposit.?*?

On 10 August 2017, together with Blue Gas Stanowice and Blue Gas Wrzosowo,
Blue Gas Unik6w sent the letter in which it demanded that the Ministry stop
breaching the law by extending the proceedings. This time, however, the Ministry
did not issue a ruling regarding the Lelikow Project, but instead ignored the
demand.78+

7. Reports by the Supreme Audit Office

The Supreme Audit Office (the “NIK”) is the top independent state audit authority
whose mission is to safeguard public spending. For over 90 years, NIK has looked
into the way the Polish state operates and how it spends public funds. NIK
investigates all areas of state activity where public money or state assets are
involved. NIK also checks whether public institutions meet their objectives
effectively, efficiently and economically. Every year, NIK audits several thousand
entities, and on this basis, it develops a report that describes the overall picture of
how well the Polish state is functioning. Pronouncements on audit results are
submitted to the Sejm (the lower chamber of the Polish Parliament) and to the
institutions responsible for the proper functioning of the audited entities.?*>

One of the institutions NIK audits is the Ministry. One of the areas of the Ministry’s
activities which NIK audited is licensing proceedings.**°The NIK’s findings in this
respect can be found in NIK’s report of August 2017, entitled “Granting a license
for the exploration and recognition of copper and hydrocarbon deposits, including
shale gas” (the “NIK Report”). It covered the years 2008-2016 for licenses
regarding copper and hydrocarbons from conventional deposits including natural
gas, and the years 2013-2016 regarding licenses for the exploration and recognition
of shale gas deposits.?°”

One of the fundamental weaknesses NIK identified with the Ministry was the lack
of an appropriate licensing policy. NIK suggested that a long-term strategy of the

State’s activities in the exploration and mining sector would increase the
operational confidence of business entities.?°*

The NIK Report also drew attention to the fact that the criteria for assessing
applications for licenses was unclear and ambiguous. It indicated that the Ministry
should have developed uniform, objective and non-discriminatory criteria.
Meanwhile, it characterized the Ministry’s decisions as arbitrary.?°°

In addition, NIK considered the Ministry’s internal procedures to be inadequate,
unreliable and to carry a significant risk of irregularities which led to a lack of
transparency in administrative proceedings. It stated that such procedures should
serve to develop a uniform and transparent methodology for processing applications
and indicate the order in which they are to be processed. They should also help the
Ministry establish appropriate and effective controlling mechanisms. NIK firmly
stated that such internal rules are an important element of implementing the
principles of the proper and efficient conducting of administrative proceedings,
included in the Administrative Procedure Code.”

Another problem NIK observed was the faulty organization of work at the Ministry
which prevented the timely and reliable meeting of its objectives. Primarily, this
issue manifested itself in insufficient staffing. As NIK noted, the Ministry did not
carry out an analysis of the optimal level of employment, nor the potential effects
of staff shortages, and as a consequence it was not prepared for a sudden increase
in applications. Thus, as NIK emphasized, “the ill-fitting organization of work and
staff shortages” “in the period when entrepreneurs expressed increased interest in
obtaining licenses” led to an accumulation of “cases pending settlement and, in
result, the deadlines imposed by the principles of administrative procedure not
being observed.”?*!

As a consequence, the process of examining license applications was lengthy and
inconsistent. In matters related to applications for granting or amending a license
for the exploration and recognition of hydrocarbon deposits, including natural gas,
the processing time ranged from 17 up to as many as 719 days, and thus the
difference exceeded two years.?°

NIK’s observations also included breaches of law, including the provisions of the
Administrative Procedure Code and the Geological Law. Breaches were found in
47 out of 57 administrative proceedings, a ratio of 82%, regarding granting and
changing licenses for the exploration and recognition of copper and hydrocarbon
deposits. The violations concerned regulations on: (i) settling administrative
matters without delay; (ii) informing the parties of the commencement of
proceedings; (iii) statutory deadlines; (iv) informing the parties of a matter not

being settled on time, reasons for delays and setting new deadlines for a case to be
settled; and (v) summoning the parties to supplement their applications.?%*

NIK is an independent state institution. Its reports are one of the most reliable
sources of information about the activities of administrative authorities, both
governmental and municipal, organizations utilizing public funds as well as
commercial entities owned or controlled by those authorities. At the same time, it
is a statio fisci. It has no legal personality separate from the Respondent. It
represents the Respondent.?*+

Accordingly, it must be acknowledged that for the purposes of this arbitration the
NIK Report serves as both “an indictment and confession.” One representative of
the Respondent (NIK) accused the other (the Ministry) of systematically breaching
its legal obligations towards entrepreneurs who applied for licenses for the
exploration and recognition of copper and hydrocarbon deposits. At the same time,
by determining these facts, NIK confirmed that the Respondent is liable for the
breaches of law described in the NIK Report.?°>

FACTUAL SUMMARY PROVIDED BY THE RESPONDENT

Unikéw Project

1. Proceedings for non-compliance by Blue Gas Unikéw exploration license

By letter of 9 November 2012, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unikéw of its
decision to initiate proceedings for non-compliance with the Unikéw exploration
licence of 31 March 2009. The Ministry took the decision after having reviewed the
explanatory reports submitted by Blue Gas Unik6w, which brought about doubts as
to whether Blue Gas Unikéw had complied with the terms and conditions of the
license. The Ministry explained that under the licence, Blue Gas Unik6éw was to (i)
reconstruct the Unikéw-2 well (between March 2009 and March 2010); (ii) perform
10 km2 of 3D seismic works (between March 2010 and March 2012); and (iii) drill
a well to the depth of 2,000 m (between March 2012 and March 2014). The Ministry
pointed out in letters of 24 July 2012 and 26 July 2012 that Blue Gas Unikéw had
only confirmed to have completed the first requirement.””°

Blue Gas Unik6éw provided additional explanations, but the Ministry remained
concerned and on 22 February 2013 instructed Blue Gas Unikéw to immediately
stop its infringement of the 31 March 2019 license by commencing the 3D seismic
works by 30 April 2013. The Ministry’s decision indicated that 3D seismic works
at the Unikéw location had not been commenced, and had not been finished by 31

March 2012, meaning that Blue Gas Unikéw had failed to comply with the
license.?””

On 12 March 2013, Blue Gas Unikéw asked the Chief National Geologist for a
meeting to discuss the issues related to the performance of the licence by Blue Gas
Unikow in connection with the Ministry’s 22 February 2013 decision. The Ministry
requested Blue Gas Unik6éw to provide all communications be submitted in
writing.”

On 21 March 2013, Blue Gas Unikéw challenged the Ministry’s 22 February 2013
decision by filing for the reconsideration of the case. After Blue Gas Unikéw
provided the Ministry with additional explanation, the Ministry issued its decision
on 14 August 2013.7

In its decision, the Ministry upheld its 22 February 2013 and provided a a new
deadline 30 October 2015 by which Blue Gas Unikéw was to commence 3D seismic
works. The change of the deadline was of purely formal character, as the previous
deadline had already expired by the time the Ministry had issued its decision on
reconsideration.*”” The Ministry explained to Blue Gas Unikéw that it did not
comply with the licence by failing to commence 3D seismic works by 31 March
2012.7?! This decision could have been challenged by Blue Gas Unikéw before the
Polish Administrative Court, but Blue Gas Unik6éw chose not to.°°?

2. Proceedings for modification of the Unikéw exploration license of 31
March 2009

On 19 September 2013, Blue Gas Unikéw filed an application for modification of
the Unikow exploration licence of 31 March 2009 by (i) extending the validity of
the licence to 30 September 2015 and (ii) changing the scope of the works in stage
IIL, increasing the drilling depth to approx. 2,100 m.*%

As the proceedings for the modification were instigated, Blue Gas Unikéw
submitted several related applications, including (i) the application of 18 September
2013 for modification of the licence; (ii) letter of 30 October 2013 supplementing
the modification application; (iii) letter of 7 November 2013 supplementing the
modification application; (iv) letter of 9 December 2013 amending the original
licence modification application; and (v) letter of 23 December 2013
modifying/supplementing the application for modification*°* Only after such

letters were submitted and analyzed could the Ministry have formally commence
the proceedings.*°

Consequently, on 23 January 2014 the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unik6w that the
proceedings for the modification of the Unikéw exploration licence of 31 March
2009 had been instigated. On that same day, the Ministry requested explanations to
resolve confusion that had been created by Blue Gas Unikow’s numerous letters
supplementing or modifying the original 18 September 2013 application. The
Ministry requested Blue Gas Unik6w (i) to explain when the trial exploitation of
the Unikéw-2 well was commenced and (ii) to modify Blue Gas Unikow’s licence
modification application appropriately, taking into account that “/.../ the works
planned by you [Blue Gas Unikéw] in between May and September 2015, consisting
in the preparation and submission of an application for a concession for the
extraction of natural gas from a deposit in the area of "Unikéw" are not included
in the scope of exploratory works covered by the concession No. 19/2009/p and
therefore cannot be entered as one of the conditions of this concession.”

In its letter of 28 January 2014, the Ministry explained that: “/...] the extension of
the deadline for settling this matter [i.e. modifying the licence] is caused by the
necessity to supplement the evidence, including obtaining further explanations from
the Applicant concerning the application submitted to the concession authority.”°°"

It was after this 28 January 2014 letter that Blue Gas Unikéw submitted additional
explanations in letters of 31 January 2014 and 11 February 2014. In doing so, Blue
Gas Unik6éw submitted a series of explanations, which caused additional confusion
and disrupted the progress of the proceedings.

The Ministry processed Blue Gas Unikow’s explanations and changes to the
application for amendment of the 31 March 2009 Unik6w exploration license.*”
Pursuant to the applicable law, the Ministry prepared a draft decision on this
amendment application and on 13 February transmitted it to the relevant authorities
for consultation. Those authorities then issued the decisions and delivered them to
the Ministry.>!°

On 6 March 2014, the Ministry requested Blue Gas Unik6w to provide explanations
concerning the financing of the activity to be performed in accordance with Blue
Gas Unikow’s application for amendment of the 31 March 2009 Unikéw
exploration licence. These explanations were necessary as the same loans were
planned for Blue Gas Unik6éw to finance the activities under the Wrzosowo
exploration licence for which Blue Gas Unikéw had applied.*!!

Blue Gas Unikéw provided its explanations on 14 March 2014. After obtaining
Blue Gas Unikow’s statement of 19 March 2014 that it would not submit any
additional comments or pleadings related to the proceedings, on 26 March 2014 the
Ministry issued its decision on amendment of the 31 March 2009 licence.*!” The
decision reflected the fact that Blue Gas Unikow’s application had been modified
in a series of pleadings throughout the proceedings.*!*

The main amendments to the 31 March 2009 included: (i) removing the requirement
of performing the 3D seismic works in accordance with Blue Gas Unikéw’s
request; (ii) extending the second phase of the exploration works, i.e., the trial
exploitation of the Unikéw-2 well until 30 September 2015; and (iii) removing the
third phase of the exploration works, i.e. Blue Gas Unikéw was no longer required
or allowed to drill additional wells. This meant that Blue Gas Unikéw was only
allowed to exploit the reconstructed Unikéw-2 well.*'*

3. Proceedings for conversion of the Unikéw exploration license of 31
March 2009 into a unified license for prospection, exploration and
mining of the Unikéw deposit, i.e. the Unikéw unified license

On 10 July 2015, Blue Gas Unik6w applied to the Ministry for conversion of the
31 March 2009 Unikéw exploration licence into a Unikéw unified licence.*!°

In this application, Blue Gas Unikéw generally sought to reintroduce into the
unified licence the works that earlier had been removed from the 31 March 2009
Unik6éw exploration licence pursuant to Blue Gas Unikow’s application for
amendment of that licence.*!° Blue Gas Unik6éw requested that the unified licence
include two phases: (i) the prospection and exploration phase of 5 years and (ii) the
mining phase of 30 years.*!7

On 14 July 2015, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unik6w to (i) submit information
on Blue Gas Unikow’s “experience in performing activities related to prospecting
and exploration of hydrocarbon deposits or extraction of hydrocarbons from
deposits (item 6 of the application), or providing information that the Applicant
does not intend to apply for a concession independently or as an operator jointly
with other entities,” and (ii) submit “a document or documents approving
geological documentation of a hydrocarbon deposit or any other equivalent
document or document confirming that for a period of at least 3 years the activity
consisting in the extraction of hydrocarbons from a deposit has been continuously
conducted, unless the Applicant does not intend to apply for a concession
independently or as an operator jointly with other entities.” The Ministry explained
that the request for information was a response “to the submission by Blue Gas
N'RG Sp. z 0.0. of the application for the qualification procedure, prepared on the

basis of the annex to the Decree of the Council of Ministers of 20 April 2015 on the
application for the qualification procedure (O. J. of 22 May 2015, item 708) [...]”
which was filed by Blue Gas Unik6ow on 3 July 2015, and not as a response to Blue
Gas Unikow’s application of 10 July 2015 for conversion of the 31 March 2009
Unikow exploration licence into a unified licence.*!*

On 27 July 2015, Blue Gas Unik6éw explained to the Ministry that a separate
comprehensive procedure, which required fulfilment of the restrictive conditions as
listed in the Ministry’s letter of 14 July 2015, should not be applied to the 10 July
2015 application for conversion of the 331 March 2009 licence into a unified
licence. Blue Gas Unikéw explained that the precondition of the procedure for
conversion of the 31 March 2009 licence into the unified licence was the
qualification procedure. These communications complicated the matter and
required clarification attempts on the part of the Ministry.7!

Having reviewed Blue Gas Unikow’s (i) 10 July 2015 application for conversion of
the 31 March 2009 licence into a unified licence and (ii) explanations of 27 July
2015, the Ministry, by the letter of 20 August 2015, requested Blue Gas Unikéw
to remedy the formal defects of the application for the conversion by providing:
“(1) the financial statements of the Company for 2014 and the statement of Blue
Gas N'R'G Holding Sp. z 0.0. on its readiness to finance the activities covered by
your application [...]; (2) information on the technologies of the work to be carried
out in order to achieve the planned objective; (3) two copies of the geological works
design prepared in accordance with the requirements specified in the Regulation of
the Minister of Environment of 20 December 2011 on detailed requirements
concerning geological works designs, including works the performance of which
requires obtaining a concession (O.J. of 2011, No. 288, item 1696), as amended by
the Regulation of the Minister for the Environment of I July 2015 amending the
Regulation on detailed requirements concerning geological works designs,
including works the performance of which requires obtaining a concession (O. J.
of 2015, item 964); (4) description of geological surveys, including geological
works, performed so far under concession No. 19/2009/p for the exploration of the
Unik6éw natural gas deposits with the presentation of their results; (5) application
to carry out an investigation into the assessment of whether the company is under
the corporate control of a third country, entity or a national of a third country, and
in the case of such control, whether this control may threaten the security of the
state [the qualification procedure ].”?”°

  

 

With respect to the qualification procedure as a precondition to the procedure for
conversion of the licence, the Ministry, in its letter of 20 August 2015, explained
that: “Jt should be noted that the application for the qualification procedure dated
3 July 2015 [...] was received by the Minister of the Environment on 6 July 2015,
i.e. a few days before the application for the transformation [conversion of the
licence] was submitted to the Ministry of the Environment and even before the

320 [d., 83 (citing Exhibit C-110).

w

application for the transformation was drawn up. Due to purely chronological
reasons, it was therefore impossible to consider the application of 3 July 2015 as
submitted pursuant to Article 9, sec. 4 of the Act of 11 July 2014 on amending the
Act - Geological and Mining Law and certain other acts as Annex to the application
of 10 July 2015 [application for conversion of the licence]. As a result, your request
for the qualification procedure is currently being processed on its own, without any
connection with the subsequent proposal for the transformation of concession No
19/2009/p. If it is your intention that the application for conducting the qualification
procedure of 3 July 2015 should be treated by the concession authority as an
application submitted pursuant to Article 9(4)(1) of the Act of 11 July 2014
amending the Act - Geological and Mining Law and certain other acts under the
procedure for the change of concession No. 19/2009/p, please submit the relevant
statement in this matter.”>7!

Additionally, in its letter of 20 August 2015, the Ministry asked Blue Gas Unikéw
for further explanation regarding the following issues:

e Blue Gas Unik6w attached to its 10 July 2015 application of for
conversion of the licence Addendum No. | to the PRG Documentation of
the Unik6éw deposit — the Ministry indicated that the relevant law did not
require that an application for conversion of a licence be accompanied by
such documentation. The Ministry also indicated that “simultaneous
submission by the company [Blue Gas Unikéw] of an application for the
change of concession No. 19/2009/p pursuant to the procedure provided
for in Article 9 of the Act amending the Act - Geological and Mining Law
and certain other acts, as well as the geological documentation of the
deposit is a contradictory action. If the company has documented the
Unik6w cold gas deposit in a sufficient manner to prepare its geological
and investment project documentation, it is not justified to submit an
application for the change of concession No. 19/2009/p, providing for a
five-year prospecting and exploration stage. However, if Blue Gas N'R'G
Sp. 2 0.0. is of the opinion that it is necessary and justified to continue
exploration of the Unikéw natural gas deposit, then it is unreasonable
and premature to submit an annex to the geological documentation for
approval by the authority, summarizing the work performed under
concession No. 19/2009/p and documenting the Unikéw deposit.”

e The documentation submitted by Blue Gas Unikéw was inconsistent as
to the date on which the trial extraction of the Unikéw natural gas deposit
by the reconstructed Unikéw-2 well started, which required Blue Gas
Unikow’s explanations.

e Joint duration of (i) the prospection and exploration phase as well as (ii)
the exploration phase, could not exceed 30 years. The relevant
adjustment of Blue Gas Unikow’s 10 July 2015 application of for
conversion of the licence was therefore required.*7?

Blue Gas Unik6w indicated to the Ministry that some of the information and
documentation the Ministry requested could not have been produced because
geologist engaged by Blue Gas Unikéw was not available at that time.*?*
Consequently, on 4 September 2015 Blue Gas Unikéw submitted its modified
application for conversion of the 31 March 2009 licence. At the same, Blue Gas
Unik6w requested that the unified licence include two phases: (i) the prospection
and exploration phase of 5 years, consisting of the compulsory subphase and the
optional phase; and (ii) the mining phase of 30 years.

On 11 September 2015, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unik6w that the proceedings
for conversion of the licence had commenced.**4 Such letter only confirmed that
the proceedings had commenced, meaning that the formal deficiencies had been
remedied. The gathering of evidence to evaluate the application and delivering an
opinion were separate stages.*7>

The qualification procedure related to Blue Gas Unikéw’s modified application for
conversion of the licence was conducted as follows: 1) On 17 September 2015 the
Ministry requested the relevant authorities (i.e. the Head of the National
Intelligence, the General Inspector of Financial Information, the Head of the
National Security Agency and the Financial Supervision Agency) to conduct the
qualification procedure; (2) on 16 October 2015, the relevant decision was issued
by the Head of the National Intelligence; (3) on 22 October 2015, the relevant
decision was issued by the General Inspector of Financial Information; (4) on 27
October 2015, the relevant decision was issued by the Head of the National Security
Agency; and (5) on 27 November 2015, the relevant decision was issued by the
Financial Supervision Agency.*”°

On 15 December 2015, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unik6w that its modified
application of 4 September 2015 positively passed the qualification procedure and
moved on to the next stage of the proceedings.*””

By the same letter of 15 December 2015, the Ministry indicated that, as the
qualification procedure had been concluded only recently, it was impossible to
conclude the proceedings for conversion of the licence before 13 December 2015,
i.e. before the end of the trial exploitation of the Unikéw deposit via the
reconstructed Unik6w-2 well. The Ministry suggested that Blue Gas Unik6w amend
its 4 September 2009 modified application by removing the trial exploitation. This

would require amendments to (i) Blue Gas Unikow’s 4 September 2015 modified
application for conversion and (ii) the PRG Documentation attached to the same
application.*7*

In the same 15 December 2015 letter, the Ministry also requested Blue Gas Unikéw
to supplement its 3 September 2015 modified application for conversion of the 31
March 2009 licence by: (1) providing information on the technologies planned to
be applied by Blue Gas Unikéw in order to achieve the relevant aims under the
unified licence; (2) amending the description of the geological works performed
under the 31 March 2009 Unikéw exploration licence; and (3) paying the
outstanding stamp duty for considering Blue Gas Unikow’s 4 September 2015
modified application for conversion.*”?

In a letter of 18 December 2015, Blue Gas Unikéw did not question the
reasonableness or lawfulness of the Ministry’s requests. Blue Gas Unikow simply
made the relevant amendments/completions to its 4 September 2015 modified
application for conversion, as requested by the Ministry.**°

On 5 January 2016, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unik6w that the proceedings for
conversion of the licence had been completed and that Blue Gas Unikéw could
access the files of the proceedings and present its statements on the collected
evidence and materials.**!

On 19 January 2016, the Ministry received from Blue Gas Unik6w a letter in which
the Blue Gas Unik6w stated that it did not intend to make use of its right to access
the files of the proceedings and present its statements on the collected evidence and
materials.*°?

On 11 February 2016, Blue Gas Unikéw provided the Ministry with a signed
agreement on the establishment of a mining usufruct of the Unikéw natural gas
deposit and extraction of the Unikéw natural gas deposit, which was necessary for
Blue Gas Unik6w to perform its activities under the unified licence requested by
Blue Gas Uniké6w in its 4 September 2015 modified application.**7

The Ministry’s Department of Geology and Geological Licences, responsible for
managing the proceedings for conversion of the 31 March 2009 licence into a
unified licence, was notified by the Ministry’s Department of Geological
Supervision of the lack of compliance by Blue Gas Unikéw with respect to the
terms of the 31 March 2009 Unikéw exploration licence.**4

On 9 August 2016, after engaging in works that went beyond standard Ministry
activities, thus necessitating additional time, the Ministry issued its decision
converting the 31 March 2009 Unik6w exploration licence into a unified Unikéw
licence.* The 9 August 2016 unified Unikéw licence was granted for 30 years (5
years for the prospection and exploration phases and 25 years for the mining phase,
which started to run from the date on which the investment decision was issued).
The prospection and exploration phases included: (i) obligatory performance of the
Unik6w deposit production test using the reconstructed Unikéw-2 well performed
until 31 December 2016; (ii) optional performance, from 1 January 2017 to 9
August 2021, of the 3D seismic analysis, 2D seismic analysis, reconstruction of the
Unik6éw-1, 4, 8, 9 wells, performance of a well up to a maximum depth of 2,300 m
and trial exploitation of the Unikéw deposit using a reconstructed or newly created
well.336

The 9 August 2016 unified licence set forth that: (i) the scope of geological works
was determined in the PRG Documentation attached to Blue Gas Unikow’s
application for conversion of the 31 March 2009 licence into a unified licence and
that (ii) information on the detailed location of geological sites, including
geological works, would be presented to the Ministry before the commencement of
on-site works in Addendums to the PRG Documentation, in accordance with Article
80a of the Geological and Mining Law.**7

On the same date, the agreement on the establishment of a mining usufruct was
entered into by the Ministry.***

4. Two proceedings for approval of the PRG Documentation in the
territorial area of Unikéw as well as outside

On 24 August 2016, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted two groups of documentation for
the Ministry’s approval: (1) PRG Documentation - 3D seismic analyses: (i) only
outside of the area of Unikéw unified license, i.e., the area covered by licence no.
31/2011/p granted to ORLEN Upstream Sp. z 0.0.; and (ii) some additional area not
covered by licences; and (2) Addendum No. | to the PRG Documentation for for
the 3D seismic investigations within the area covered by the Unik6w license. **°

Concerning the first group of documentation, on 22 September 2016 the Ministry
issued a decision, raising an objection under Article 85a of the Geological and
Mining Law by indicating that the PRG Documentation failed to comply with the
requirements set forth under the Regulation on specific requirements for projects of
geological works, including works which may be performed without a licence.**°

By letter on 10 October 2016, Blue Gas Unik6w filed with the Ministry its motion
for reconsideration of the case. The Ministry’s respective decision with a detailed
reasoning was issued on 18 January 2017, upholding its decision of 22 September
2016.34!

Concerning the second group of documentation, the Ministry considered certain
factors when deciding on how to proceed: (1) the significant workload of the
Ministry’s staff who supervised and/or conducted the administrative proceedings
concerning natural gas and oil, and the grade of urgency of the remaining
administrative proceedings which required setting priorities; (2) the low urgency of
Blue Gas Unikéw’s 24 August 2016 application, with Blue Gas Unikéw reserving
the right to decide whether to perform the geological works in proposed Addendum
No. 1 to the PRG Documentation and failing to indicate it would perform such
works; (3) After the 24 August 2016 application was submitted by Blue Gas
Unik6w, subsequent acts seemed to confirm the lack of certainty regarding whether
Blue Gas Unikéw would perform the optional geological works; and (4) similar,
obligatory geological works had already been removed from the scope of the
Unikéw 31 March 2009 exploration licence, upon Blue Gas Unikéow’s own
application.*47

On 10 August 2017, after having reviewed the 18 July 2017 modified application
for approval of Addendum No. | to the PRG Documentation, the Ministry called
on Blue Gas Unikéw to remedy several formal deficiencies. Namely, the Ministry
relied on the relevant provisions of Polish law and requested Blue Gas Unikéw to
comply with several standard legal requirements which should have been known to
a professional entity acting in the area of prospection, exploration and mining of
natural gas deposits, i.e.: (1) to submit information on Blue Gas Unikow’s rights to
the real estate on which it intended to perform geological works; (2) to submit a
schedule of the intended geological works, including deadlines for commencement
of the particular geological works and for completing them; (3) to submit graphic
attachments prepared in accordance with § 1(3) and (4) as well as § 2 of the
Regulation on specific requirements for projects of geological works, including
works which may be performed without licence; and (4) to have Addendum No. 1
signed by a person legally authorized to perform, supervise and direct geological
works, including prospection and exploration of hydrocarbons.*

In addition, the Ministry drew Blue Gas Unikéw’s attention to some obvious errors
in the coordinates determining the territory on which the 3D investigations were to
be performed according to Addendum No. 1 to the PRG Documentation. The
territory determined according to those coordinates was situated outside the
Unikow territory under the 9 August 2016 unified Unikow licence.*4

A chain of events ultimately led to the Ministry’s 21 December 2017 decision on
approval of Addendum No. | to the PRG Documentation. These events were as
follows: (1) by a letter of 15 September 2017, the Ministry informed Blue Gas
Unik6w that, after the formal deficiencies of the application for approval of
Addendum No. | to the PRG Documentation had been remedied, the administrative
proceedings for the approval were instigated; (2) by another letter of 15 September
2017, after having reviewed the corrected Addendum No. 1 to the PRG
Documentation submitted by Blue Gas Unik6éw with its 4 September 2017 letter,
the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unikéw to provide explanations in relation to the
corrected Addendum No. | submitted by Blue Gas Unik6éw; (3) on 5 October 2017,
Blue Gas Unikow submitted its explanations in response to the Ministry’s letter of
15 September 2017; (4) on 13 November 2017, the Ministry forwarded a draft of
the decision on approval of Addendum No. | to the PRG Documentation to the
relevant authorities and requested those authorities for their opinion on the draft;
and (5) on 21 December 2017, the Ministry issued a decision on approval of
Addendum No. | to the PRG Documentation.*4°

5. Proceedings for approval of the DGI documentation

On 8 September 2016, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted to the Ministry its application
for approval of the DGI Documentation.

By three letters of 4 November 2016, the Ministry: (1) transmitted the DGI
Documentation to the Mineral Resources Commission for it to verify the
substantive and legal correctness; (2) transmitted the DGI Documentation to the
Polish Geological Institute for it to verify whether the corners’ coordinates of the
territory, which the DGI Documentation related to, were correctly established; (3)
informed Blue Gas Unik6w that the DGI Documentation was transmitted to (i) the
Mineral Resources Commission for consultation and (ii) the Ministry, which was
was reviewing and verifying the correctness of the DGI Documentation as well as
the corners’ coordinates of the territory.**°

On 23 November 2016, the Polish Geological Institute submitted its opinion, as
requested by the Ministry, in which some deficiencies of the DGI Documentation
were identified.

On 5 December 2016, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unikéw of the Mineral
Resources Commission’s session concerning the DGI Documentation that was to

On 15 December 2016, the session of the Mineral Resources Commission was held.
In addition to the Members of the Mineral Resources Commission, both Blue Gas
Unikow’s as well as the Ministry’s representatives participated in the session and
the deficiencies identified by the Commission were subject to the discussion.
According to the Minutes prepared by the Mineral Resources Commission on 15
December 2016, the Commission held that Mr. Artur Marcinkowski’s opinion on
the DGI Documentation, submitted by Blue Gas Unikéw, was correct and that it
shared Mr. Marcinkowski’s position as expressed in his 5 December 2016
opinion.*4*

On 20 December 2016, the Mineral Resources Commission transmitted its opinion
on the DGI Documentation. The Commission expressed its opinion that the
Documentation could not be approved due to the identified errors. The Commission
stated that Blue Gas Unik6ow should attach to the DGI Documentation a proof of
holding a right to using the geological information on the basis of which the
Documentation had been prepared.*4?

On 23 January 2017, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unikéw that the proceedings
concerning approval of the DGI Documentation were extended until 31 March
2017. The complicated nature of the proceedings for approval of the DGI
Documentation is also reflected in the Ministry’s statistics, which show that the
average duration of such proceedings was 245.11 days (for the proceedings which
ended in 2016 with a decision on approval of the DGI Documentation), and 220.67
days (for the proceedings which ended in 2017 with a decision on approval of the
DGI Documentation).**°

The Ministry performed its own analysis of the DGI Documentation, including the
opinion delivered by the Mineral Resources Commission. By a letter of 16 March
2017, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted the modified DGI Documentation and requested
the Ministry to approve it. As a result of these additional submissions, the Ministry
required extra time reviewing and analyzing the relevant documents.**!

On 15 May 2017, the Ministry, after having duly reviewed the modified DGI
Documentation, called on Blue Gas Unikéw to remedy the deficiencies of the
Documentation. The deficiencies included: (i) lack of a document proving that Blue
Gas Unik6w paid the stamp duty for the issuance of a decision on approval of the
DGI Documentation by the Ministry; and (ii) lack of a proof that Blue Gas Unikéw
held a right to use the geological information on the basis of which the
Documentation had been prepared.*>*

In that same letter, the Ministry indicated that Blue Gas Unikéw was required to
remedy formal deficiencies in the DGI Documentation within 7 days following the
receipt of the letter. The Ministry also indicated if Blue Gas Unik6éw failed to

remedy the deficiencies, the application for approval of the DGI Documentation
would be left unprocessed.*°?

On 18 May 2017, Blue Gas Unik6w (i) submitted a proof that the stamp duty for
issuing a decision on approval of the DGI Documentation was paid; and (ii)
requested that the proceedings for approval of the DGI documentation to be
suspended. Blue Gas Unikéw claimed that it required about 2 weeks to adjust the
DGI Documentation in accordance with the Ministry’s 15 May 2017 letter.***

On 24 May 2017, the Ministry dismissed Blue Gas Unikow’s motion for suspension
of the proceedings. The Ministry indicated that the proceedings for approval of the
DGI Documentation had not been validly instigated, as Blue Gas Unikéw was
called on to remedy the formal deficiencies in the DGI Documentation and failed
to remedy those deficiencies within the statutory time limit of 7 days.>*>

As Blue Gas Unik6w did not remedy the deficiencies in the DGI Documentation
within the statutory time limit, the Ministry notified Blue Gas Unik6w that it left its
application for approval of the DGI Documentation unprocessed.*°°

On 26 May 2017, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted (i) its motion to reinstate the time
limit to remedy the deficiencies in the DGI Documentation; and (ii) withdrew its
motion for the proceedings for approval of the DGI Documentation to be
suspended, and if the Ministry had already decided to suspend the proceedings,
Blue Gas Unik6w applied for the proceedings to be resumed. In addition, Blue Gas
Unik6éw submitted a new version of the DGI Documentation. Blue Gas Unikéw
admitted that the old geological documentation of 1973, containing an estimation
of gas volumes in the Unikéw deposit, was unreliable and that the much more
reliable investigation, performed by Blue Gas Unikéw during the trial exploitation
of the Unik6éw deposit, showed that the same was over 4 times overestimated.°°7

On 4 July 2017 Blue Gas Unik6w withdrew its motion to reinstate the time limit to
remedy the deficiencies in the DGI Documentation.>**

On 7 July 2017 Blue Gas Unik6w presented its explanation concerning Blue Gas
Unikow’s alleged right to use the geological information on the basis of which the
DGI Documentation had been prepared. In that letter, Blue Gas Unik6w indicated
that the gas volumes in the Unikéw deposit were over 4 times overestimated due
the unreliable estimation methodology applied by authors of the original geological
documentation of 1973. In addition, Blue Gas Unik6w admitted that,
“[iJrrespective of the unreliability of the estimated gas deposits shown in the
documentation of 1973, the geological information also contained false information

on how the Unikéw-2 borehole was sealed which led to major complications and
extension of reconstruction works at the Unikéw-2 borehole.”*?

On 27 July 2017, the Ministry again explained to Blue Gas Unik6w that the
proceedings for approval of the DGI Documentation were left unprocessed due to
Blue Gas Unikow’s failure to remedy the formal deficiencies of the DGI
Documentation within the statutory time limit. The Ministry stated that the new
proceedings for approval of the DGI Documentation could be instigated based on a
new and complete application. The Ministry noted that the new DGI
Documentation, submitted with Blue Gas Unikow’s letter of 26 May 2017, could
be included in the files of the new administrative proceedings.*°

On 4 August 2017, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted a new application for approval of
the DGI Documentation. Blue Gas Unikéw indicated that the new DGI
Documentation, attached to Blue Gas Unikéw’s 26 May 2017 letter, should be
subject to the Ministry’s approval.*°!

After several procedural steps, the Commission presented its position on the DGI
Documentation. It stated that the DGI Documentation was generally adjusted in
accordance with the observations made by the Commission in its opinion of 5
December 2017.3

Due to the instigation of bankruptcy proceedings against Blue Gas Unik6w, the new
proceedings for approval of the DGI Documentation were not further continued.*

Wrzosowo Proceedings

1. Proceedings for granting the Wrzosowo exploration license and
transferring the license from Blue Gas Unikéw to Blue Gas Wrzosowo

On 22 January 2014, Blue Energy Unikéw submitted its application for granting
the licence for exploration of the Wrzosowo deposit.* The requested licence was
later issued by the Ministry of Environment in form of the 16 February 2015
Wrzosowo Exploration Licence.*°

On 28 February 2014, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unikéw to remedy formal
deficiencies in its application for the licence. In response, Blue Gas Unikéw, by a
letter on 11 March 2014, submitted its revised application, including the revised
PRG Documentation.*

By letters of 11 March 2014 and 5 May 2014, Blue Gas Unikéw supplemented its
revised application for a licence by submitting its financial statement, as requested
by the Ministry in its letter of 28 February 2014 and notified the Ministry of the
change to Blue Gas Unik6w’s business name.**”

On 25 April 2014, Blue Gas Unik6w requested the Ministry to provide information
on the status of the proceedings.**

On 20 May 2014, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unikéw to remedy the formal
deficiencies of its 11 March 2014 revised application and requested some
explanations related to the same application.*

On 21 May 2014, in response to Blue Gas Unikow’s letter of 25 April 2014, the
Ministry informed Blue Gas Unik6w of the specifics of the procedure, i.e. “/...]
once Blue Gas N'R'G Sp. z 0.0. [Blue Gas Unikéw] has supplemented the
deficiencies identified in the summons of 20 May 2014, ref. No. DGK-IV-4770-
104/20469/14/JP, the Ministry of the Environment will immediately forward a
notice on the application lodged for publication in Official Journal of the European
Union. The waiting time for the publication of the notice is independent of the
Ministry of the Environment and is approximately 2 months. Upon publication of
the notice, other operators will have at least 90 days to submit competing
applications (see: Article 46 section I point 4 of the Act of 9 June 2011 Geological
and Mining Law). The winner of the comparison procedure will then be subject to
a standard concession award procedure in accordance with the requirements of the
Code of Administrative Procedure, which should be completed within two
months.”37°

On 4 June 2014, Blue Gas Unikéw provided explanations in response to the
Ministry’s 20 May 2014 letter. Blue Gas Unikow assured the Ministry that it had
the necessary financing for performing the obligatory part of the works under the
‘Wrzosowo exploration licence and that those works would start within 6 months
from the date of the Ministry’s decision on granting the licence.*”!

On 3 July 2014, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unikéw to submit additional
explanations/supplements to Blue Gas Unikéw’ licence application. Once again,
the nature of the requested explanations/supplements showed that Blue Gas Unikéw
had failed to perform the necessary due diligence of Respondent’s legal
environment and had failed to comply with the Ministry’s 20 May 2014 request to
provide the relevant explanations/supplements to Blue Gas Unikow’s 11 March
2014 revised licence application.*””

As a result, the Ministry highlighted the following issues concerning the revised
licence application: (1) the relevant statement regarding securing financing of the
activities under the licence had not been submitted by Blue Gas Unik6w in its
original or in a properly certified copy; (2) The relevant law, as expressly indicated
by the Ministry, required that‘ [...] the PRG Documentation attached to the
application for the licence should be signed by a person who holds confirmed,
relevant qualifications to perform, supervise and direct geological works, together
with a number of a certificate confirming qualifications, or a person who holds
recognised appropriate qualifications to perform regulated professions in the field
of geology, together with a number of a decision on recognition of qualifications.
This requirement also includes changes to the PRG Documentation. Therefore,
kindly sign the most recent changes introduced in the PRG Documentation by the
author of the project, provided together with your application for granting the
concession. For the sake of readability of the document, it would be advisable to
submit to the concession authority a consolidated text of the PRG Documentation,
taking into consideration any changes that were necessary during the present
procedure.”; (3) “With regard to the modification of the concession application in
terms of the duration of the concession (page 3 of your letter of 4.06.2014), let me
point out that the requested duration of the concession (5 years) is shorter than the
total duration of both planned stages (5 years, 5 months). This issue needs to be
clarified, as it is not possible to introduce a provision in the text of the concession
in the version suggested by you.”; 4) the Ministry repeated its request concerning
the schedule of the plan of geological works and indicated that: “/aJccording to
your application [application for the licence], the first stage of the concession,
covering the mandatory scope of works, is to last three years, followed by launch
of stage II, covering the optional scope of works. Meanwhile, in the geological
works schedule, you forecast the launch of optional 3D seismic survey in the 31st
month from the date of granting the concession, that is in the three-year period for
mandatory scope of works. Therefore, kindly modify this provision in a manner
which makes it compatible with your application.”>”

On letter of 11 July 2014, Blue Gas Unikéw complied with the Ministry’s requests

from the 3 July 2014 letter.>”*

On 15 July 2014, Blue Gas Unik6w asked the Ministry whether the application for
the licence submitted by Blue Gas Unikow was completed and when the “open
door” procedure would start.*”>

On 15 July 2014, the Ministry requested Blue Gas Unik6w to submit an additional
copy of the PRG Documentation.*”° On 18 July 2014, Blue Gas Unikéw complied
with the request.*””

On 8 August 2014, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unikow that: “. .. on 7 August

2014, the Department of Geology and Geological Concessions of the Ministry of

the Environment submitted for publication in Official Journal of the European
Union the Announcement of the Government of the Republic of Poland on granting
a concession for prospecting or exploration the “Wrzosowo” natural gas deposit
located in Strzezewo area. The waiting time for the publication of the notice is
independent of the Ministry of the Environment and is approximately 2 months.”°7*

On 5 September 2014, the announcement regarding the Wrzosowo deposit was
placed in the Official Journal of the European Union.*””

On 10 December 2014, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unik6w that proceedings
for granting the Wrzosowo exploration licence had been commenced. Potential
competitive applications for the Wrzosowo exploration licence could have been
submitted within 90 days from the announcement in the Official Journal of the
European Union, so almost immediately after the lapse of a 90-day time limit, the
Ministry commenced the proceedings in relation to Blue Gas Unikow’s licence
application.*®°

On 17 December 2014, the Ministry submitted a draft decision regarding the
‘Wrzosowo gas deposit exploration licence to the relevant authority, asking for its
opinion.**!

On 19 January 2015, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unikow that the proceedings
were closed and that Blue Gas Unik6éw was entitled to review the files of the
proceedings and express its opinion on the collected evidence and materials.**?

On 16 February 2015, the Ministry issued the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence. On
the same day, the agreement on establishment of the mining usufruct related to the
‘Wrzosowo Exploration Licence was entered into by and between the Ministry and
Blue Gas Unikow.**

The 16 February 2015 Wrzosowo Exploration Licence was transferred to Blue Gas
Wrzosowo on 9 November 2015, and the respective assignment agreement
regarding the mining usufruct related to the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence was
entered into by and between the Ministry, Blue Gas Unikéw and Blue Gas
Wrzosowo on the same date.>*+

The Ministry’s decision was preceded by (i) the respective application of 3 July
2015 for the transfer of the licence filed with the Ministry by Blue Gas Unikéw and
Blue Gas Wrzosowo; (ii) the Ministry’s letter of 4 September 2015 calling on Blue

Gas Unikéw to remedy formal deficiencies in its application; (iii) Blue Gas
Unikow’s letter of 14 September 2015 by which the formal deficiencies were
remedied; and (iv) the Ministry’s notification of 26 October 2015 that the
proceedings for the transfer of the 16 February 2014 Wrzosowo Exploration
Licence were commenced after the formal deficiencies of the application for the
transfer had been remedied.**

2. Proceedings (i) for amendment of the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence of
16 February 2015 and (ii) for approval of the modified Addendum No. 1
to the PRG Documentation

On 22 June 2015, Blue Gas Unik6w applied for the Wrzosowo 16 February 2015
Exploration Licence to be substantially amended.**°

The requested changes would completely change both (i) the territorial scope of the
Wrzosowo Exploration Licence and (ii) the scope and nature of the geological
works as foreseen under the licence.**”

The scope and nature of the changes caused concern at the Ministry. Due to the
specific wording of Blue Gas Unikow’s 22 June 2015 application for amendment
of the licence, almost all the geological works would become optional.
Additionally, the deadlines for commencing the works would be significantly
extended. Blue Gas Unik6w also sought to increase twice the territorial scope of
the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence, which was not allowed under the Polish legal
framework.2**

On 21 August 2015, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Unik6éw to remedy the formal
deficiencies in Blue Gas Unik6w’s application for amendment of the licence.**?

On 31 August 2015, Blue Gas Unikéw withdrew its application of 22 June 2015
relating to the increase in the territorial scope of the 16 February 2015 Wrzosowo
Exploration Licence. In addition, Blue Gas Unik6w also explained that it would
prepare and provide the Ministry with the Addendum to the PRG Documentation
at a later date.”

On 15 September 2015, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted its corrected application for
amendment of the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence and two copies of the Addendum
to the PRG Documentation.*”!

After having reviewed the corrected application for amendment of the Wrzosowo
Exploration Licence on 29 January 2016 the Ministry summoned Blue Gas

‘Wrzosowo to remedy the formal deficiencies of the application and to remove an
error identified by the Ministry in the Addendum to the PRG Documentation.*””

On 15 February 2016, Blue Gas Wrzosowo provided the Ministry with the corrected
application for amendment of the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence, two copies of
the corrected Addendum to the PRG Documentation and a proof of payment for the
stamp duty. Nowhere in the letter did Blue Gas Wrzosowo question the lawfulness
of the Ministry’s requests.*?

3. Proceedings for conversion of the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence into a
unified license

After the discontinuation of the proceedings for amendment of the Wrzosowo
Exploration Licence and the approval of the Addendum to the PRG Documentation,
Blue Gas Wrzosowo filed for conversion of the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence.
The respective application was submitted in Blue Gas Wrzosowo’s letter of 30 June
2016.34

The long period of processing Blue Gas Wrzosowo’s application for conversion of
the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence into a unified licence resulted from objective
obstacles and, at the same time, the Ministry, faced with many pending
administrative proceedings and other matters requiring engagement of its officials,
decided to set priorities in a reasonable and objective manner.*°

Stanowice Project and Proceedings

The application for the Stanowice prospection and exploration licence was
submitted on 15 September 2014.°°° The Ministry responded to the licence
application on 14 July 2015. The delay resulted from the unusual workload at the
Ministry at that time, which required it to establish priorities on the basis of
objective and non-discriminatory criteria.*°”

On 14 July 2015, the Ministry called on Blue Gas Stanowice to remedy a number
of deficiencies of the licence application. The Ministry found that the application
was incomplete, and in some instances important and obligatory documents were
missing.*°*

On 23 July 2015, Blue Gas Stanowice requested an extension of the deadline to
submit additional documents and clarifications. Blue Gas Stanowice responded to
the Ministry’s 14 July 2015 letter on 29 July 2015.°

The Ministry’s review of Blue Gas Stanowice’s 29 July 2015 letter of 29 July 2015
showed that it had not entirely complied with the Ministry’s requests. In its letter
of 7 August 2015, the Ministry observed that Blue Gas Stanowice failed to remove
the discrepancies between the licence area presented in the application and the
licence area presented in the graphical annexes to it. Moreover, one of the planned
boreholes - Stanowice-3 - was still outside the licence boundaries specified in the
licence application. In addition, the licence area still did not cover the entire
Stanowice deposit, and Blue Gas Stanowice still did not provide geological
justification for such a design of the licence area.*°°

In the meantime, on 14 July 2015, Blue Gas Stanowice sent to the Ministry a letter
of 8 July 2015 in which it called on the Ministry to stop breaching the applicable
deadlines.4°!

The Ministry addressed Blue Gas Stanowice’s letter by issuing a decision on 31
August 2015 in which it clarified that on 1 January 2015, a material amendment to
the Geological and Mining Law entered into force. This amendment introduced a
new obligatory tender procedure for granting licences for hydrocarbon deposits.
Subsequently, 30 September 2014 was the final date by which a hydrocarbon
deposit exploration licence application could have been effectively submitted on
the existing terms and conditions. As a result of this exceptional situation, the
Ministry experienced a great number of applications for prospection and
exploration licences by the end of September 2014. These applications were
consequently reviewed in the order of their submission.*

After additional correspondence, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Stanowice on 21
November 2017 that the proceedings regarding the Stanowice prospection and
exploration licence had been completed. This notification was issued after ten
months of administrative proceedings (formally commenced on 12 January 2017).
The proceedings were completed within the time limit set up by the Ministry itself
in its decision of 14 September 2017.4

In November 2017, the licence was ready to be issued to Blue Gas Stanowice. On
22 November 2017, the Ministry sent to Blue Gas Stanowice an agreement on the
establishment of a mining usufruct to sign and return to the Ministry.*”' If the
agreement on the establishment of a mining usufruct had been signed, the licence
would have been issued to Blue Gas Stanowice. It was Blue Gas Stanowice’s
decision to withdraw from the licence proceedings.*™

Miedzyzdroje Project and Proceedings

the delays resulted from: (i) Blue Gas Unikow’s lack of familiarity with Polish law;
(ii) submitting an incorrect and incomplete licence application; (iii) resistance to
rectifying the licence application despite the Ministry’s remarks, phone calls and
in-person meetings; and (iv) an increased number of licence applications due to the
deadline of 30 September 2014 for submitting applications for hydrocarbon
licences pursuant to the old and more beneficial legal provisions of the Geological
and Mining Law.*°°

The Miedzyzdroje exploration licence application was submitted on 26 September
2014 and was subsequently amended on 14 December 2015 and 10 May 2016.4
The application contained numerous errors, forcing the Ministry to verify the
submitted application and to notify Blue Gas Unik6w of the identified irregularities
and deficiencies in order to make the licence application ready for proceedings.*””

Blue Gas Unik6w sent three letters to the Ministry on 12 November 2014, 4
February 2015 and 29 May 2015, requesting the Ministry to provide Blue Gas
Unik6éw with the progress of the proceedings. The delay in the Miedzyzdroje
proceedings did not resulted from the unusual workload at the Ministry at that time,
which required it to establish priorities on the basis of objective and non-
discriminatory criteria.*°*

On 8 July 2015, Blue Gas Unikéw submitted a letter in which it demanded that the
Ministry stop breaching the law by extending the proceedings. By its letter of 14
July 2015, the Ministry requested Blue Gas Unikéw to remedy a number of
deficiencies of the licence application.*”

In a decision of 31 August 2015, the Ministry provided Blue Gas Unikéw with a
calendar of the proceedings, setting a new deadline to complete the proceedings by
31 May 2016.4"

After continued correspondence concerning various deficiencies, on 7 April 2016
the Chief National Geologist issued a joint decision for the Stanowice and
Miedzyzdroje Projects, according to which scheduling only optional works was
associated with a risk of non-performing any geological works at all through the
whole licence period.*!!

Over the next several months, the Parties continued to exchange correspondence
concerning various issues, with the Ministry indicating that: “its duration [of the
proceedings] has not resulted from overly long conducting of the matter by the
authority, but from the specific features of the open-door procedure, complexity of

the matter, causing the attorney for the Company himself twice requesting
extending of the deadlines for supplementing the application.”*'

After delivering a decision on 14 September 2017 to Blue Gas Unikéw mandating
that Blue Gas Unikéw produce a decision of the Regional Director for
Environmental Protection, the Ministry expected that Blue Gas Unikéw would be
persuaded and would produce it. In this 14 September 2017 decision, the Ministry
expressly pointed out that that: “presently this deadline [for the proceedings to be
completed] is dependent primarily on the Company. It is up to the Company to
adhere to the last procedural decision of the concession authority dated 27 April
2017 and to apply to RDOS Szczecin to obtain a decision as to stating the possible
duty to assess the influence of the venture provided for in the Company’s
application upon the Nature 2000 areas; what will reopen the suspended
procedure” and that “the Ministry would take all efforts and activities to complete
the proceedings for granting the license for exploration of the Miedzyzdroje natural
gas deposit within 2 months of the date when the reasons for suspending the
proceedings cease to exist.”4'>

Blue Gas Unikéw, however, failed to request the relevant decision from the
Regional Director for Environmental Protection in Szczecin. On 30 January 2018,
the Ministry received Blue Gas Holding’s letter, informing it about the liquidation
proceedings concerning Blue Gas Wrzosowo, Blue Gas Stanowice and Blue Gas
Zakrzewo. This letter, however, did not mention Blue Gas Unikéw. A month later,
Blue Gas Unikow’s bankruptcy trustee served the Ministry with a letter stating that
on | February 2018, bankruptcy proceedings regarding Blue Gas Unikéw had been
instigated.*!*

Zakrzewo Project and Proceedings

Even though Blue Gas Zakrzewo obtained the 12 May 2017 Zakrzewo Exploration
Licence, no geological works aimed at proper exploration of the Zakrzewo deposit
had ever been performed.*!> The primary reason for any administrative delays were
primarily due to Blue Gas Zakrzewo’s poor conduct during the license proceedings
and failure to properly navigate the applicable law.*!®

On 29 September 2014, Blue Gas Zakrzewo applied for the Zakrzewo exploration
licence.4"”

By letters of 12 November 2014, 4 February 2015 and 29 May 2015, Blue Gas
Zakrzewo requested the Ministry for information about the progress of the

Zakrzewo proceedings. The Ministry replied on 16 July 2015, the earliest such day
it could have replied.*!

On 26 September 2014, Green Gas Polska sp. z 0. 0. (“Green Gas”) submitted a
Zakrzewo exploration licence application. As Blue Gas Zakrzewo’s licence
application was submitted on 29 September 2014, Green Gas’s application was
considered and proceeded first.4!? The Ministry was obliged to instigate the
proceedings following Green Gas’s licence application, provided that it was
complete and complied with the relevant legal requirements. The Ministry analysed
Green Gas’s application and summoned Green Gas to correct it in its letters of 10
March 2015, 25 May 2015, and 16 June 2015. In response, Green Gas complied
with the Ministry’s requests and delivered to the Ministry its letters of 20 March
2015, 10 June 2015 and 2 July 2015. Only after having assured that Green Gas’s
corrected licence application met the legal requirements and could be further
proceeded could the Ministry inform Blue Gas Zakrzewo about its refusal to
commence the proceedings following Blue Gas Zakrzewo’s licence application.
Consequently, in its decision of 16 July 2015, the Ministry informed Blue Gas
Zakrzewo that it was refusing to commence the proceedings for granting Blue Gas
Zakrzewo’s application for the Zakrzewo exploration licence because the
proceedings had already been commenced following Green Gas’s licence
application, which was submitted first.*7°

The Ministry’s decision of 16 July 2015 did not close the door for Blue Gas
Zakrzewo to obtain the Zakrzewo exploration licence. In its decision of 16 July
2015, the Ministry explained that: “At the same time, considering the wording of
Art. 9 APC, the party has to be informed that once a communication of the
Government of the Republic of Poland of an application being submitted for
granting a concession for exploration of the Zakrzewo natural gas deposit in
Official Journal of the European Union and on the Public Information Page of the
concession authority (www.mos.gov.pl), other interested entities, including also
Blue Gas N’R’G Zakrzewo Sp. z 0.0., will be able to submitted competitive
application within the deadline set forth in the referred to announcement. Once this
deadline lapses, the concession authority will compare the applications submitted
according to this procedure and will select the entity to which a concession would
be granted after conducting the administration procedure based on criteria set forth
in Art. 44.1 of the Geological and Mining Law before amendment in the wording
applicable on 31 December 2014.”*?!

There were no delays in the Zakrzewo proceedings between September 2014 and
July 2015. The nature of the “open door” procedure, as well as Green Gas’s
Zakrzewo licence application, made it necessary for the Ministry to undertake a

number of procedural steps before it could review and evaluate Blue Gas
Zakrzewo’s licence application.*?”

At the beginning of July 2015, Blue Gas Zakrzewo’s representative was informed
about the progress of the proceedings by the Ministry’s official, Ms. Potega. By a
letter of 8 July 2015, Blue Gas Zakrzewo: “demanded that the Ministry stopped
breaching the law by extending the proceedings beyond statutory deadlines.”*?

Blue Gas Zakrzewo sent another letter to the Ministrty on 5 August 2015.
According to Claimants, Blue Gas Zakrzewo “had learned of the third-party
application almost ten months after it had been filed, despite the fact that in
accordance with Art. 46 of the Geological Law, the Ministry should have
announced this application publicly without undue delay. The Ministry’s failure to
perform its duties on time made Blue Gas Zakrzewo incur significant costs without
taking into account the third-party application the knowledge of which would have
assuredly affected the SPV’s business strategy.”**

This demonstrates that Blue Gas Zakrzewo was unfamiliar with the legal
environment applicable to the licence proceedings and lacked experience in such
cases. The Ministry could not inform Blue Gas Zakrzewo about Green Gas’s
competitive licence application earlier than it ultimately did so. The Ministry had
to wait until Green Gas’s licence application would be completed and prepared for
the “open door” procedure to be started. Blue Gas Zakrzewo failed to notice that
Article 46 of the Geological and Mining Law, providing that the Ministry should
announce the licence application publicly without undue delay, referred to a
situation in which the relevant licence application was complete and could therefore
initiate the “open door” procedure. Once Green Gas’s application was completed,
the Ministry notified Blue Gas Zakrzewo, in a decision of 16 July 2015, of its
refusal to commence the administrative proceedings for granting the Blue Gas
Zakrzewo’s application for the Zakrzewo exploration licence due to the fact that
Green Gas’s licence application was submitted first.*?>

On 1 January 2015, the Ministry noted that a material amendment to the Geological
and Mining Law entered into force. This amendment introduced a new obligatory
tender procedure for granting licences for hydrocarbon deposits. According to this
amendment, 30 September 2014 was the final date by which a hydrocarbon deposit
exploration licence application could have been submitted in accordance with the
old legal framework, which was far more beneficial for applicants than the new
tender proceedings. As a result of this exceptional situation, by the end of
September 2014, the Ministry was flooded with exploration licence applications.
Those applications were reviewed by the Ministry in the order of date of their
submission,

The Ministry began to prepare for the “open door” procedure initiated by Green
Gas’s complete licence application. On 11 August 2015, the Ministry prepared a
draft communication from the Government of the Republic of Poland concerning
Directive 94/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the
conditions for granting and using authorizations for the prospection, exploration
and mining of hydrocarbons in the ‘Zakrzewo’ area. On 12 August 2015, this draft
communication was internally transferred to the Department of Sustainable
Development, Section of European Affairs of the Ministry with a request to publish
it in the Official Journal of the European Union. A month later, on 15 September
2015, the communication was published in the Official Journal of the European
Union. In that notice, the Ministry indicated a statutory deadline of 90 days to
submit competitive Zakrzewo exploration licence applications, which expired on
15 December 2015. The Ministry also indicated the criteria for application
evaluation as well as informed potential applicants that: “The application
evaluation procedure will be completed within a period of six months after the
deadline for submitting [competitive] applications expires.” Any investor must
have been thus aware that the best application would be selected by 15 June 2016.
It was the deadline for selecting the winner of the “open door” procedure with
whom the Ministry would formally continue the proceedings for granting the
Zakrzewo exploration licence.*?”

Blue Gas Zakrzewo submitted its competitive licence application on 7 December
2015, a few days before the expiry of the deadline for submitting competitive
applications.

On 5 April 2016, the Ministry requested Blue Gas Zakrzewo to correct the identified
irregularities and deficiencies of its 7 December 2015 licence application.*”?

On 18 May 2016, Green Gas unexpectedly withdrew its Zakrzewo licence
application. As a consequence, the Ministry was obliged to issue a decision of 23
June 2016 in which it discontinued the proceedings regarding Green Gas’s licence
application. As a result, Blue Gas Zakrzewo’s licence application was the only one
left for the Ministry’s consideration. As with the other potential deposits targeted
by the Blue Gas Group, no entity other than a Blue Gas Group’s company expressed
interest in the Zakrzewo area.”

Due to the changed situation, on 24 June 2016 the Ministry informed Blue Gas
Zakrzewo that its licence application had been selected and that the administrative
proceedings for the granting of the licence were to be commenced on the basis of
Blue Gas Zakrzewo’s 7 December 2015.7!

On 31 August 2016, the Ministry extended the proceedings until 31 October 2016
and, in a letter of 14 November 2016, until extended them until 31 December 2016.

The extension of the proceedings was necessary, and during this period the Ministry
was working on Blue Gas Zakrzewo’s application and preparing a draft decision on
granting the Zakrzewo exploration licence. At that time, the Ministry’s officials
responsible for the hydrocarbon licensing were overloaded with legislative work
and the audit performed by the Supreme Audit Office.**”

On 11 January 2017, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Zakrzewo that the licence
proceedings had been completed.**7

Ina letter of 11 April 2017, the Ministry sent the mining usufruct agreement to Blue
Gas Zakrzewo.‘**

On 24 April 2017, the Ministry received Blue Gas Zakrzewo’s letter with the signed
mining usufruct agreement. This agreement was then transmitted to the Chief
National Geologist, who on 12 May 2017 signed it on behalf of the Minister of
Environment. Thart same day, the Ministry issued the Zakrzewo exploration licence
for Blue Gas Zakrzewo.*>

Blue Gas Zakrzewo never commenced any geological works as foreseen under the
12 May 2017 Zakrzewo exploration licence, and waived the licence on 28
December 2017, 7 months after it had been awarded.**°

Lelikéw Project and Proceedings

Like in the case of the Stanowice and Zakrzewo Projects, the Lelikéw Project was
nothing more but an initial step aimed at prospection and/or exploration of the only
potential and unproven deposit. In its Lelik6w licence application of 30 September
2014, Blue Gas Unikéw stated: “The purpose of applicant’s activities is to
recognize the natural gas resources accumulated in basic limestone deposits within
the concession block Lelikéw as provided for in the Graphic Enclosure No. 1... .
Result of these works and interpretation of new seismic results will enable the
entrepreneur o p tional design and perform drilling works in a new location at
the Lelikéw site... The next stage of works will be to perform two-year long trial
exploitation of the drill which would define the prospective volume parameters for
the future deposit. Results obtained combined with analysis of geophysical
measurements will contribute to recognition of physical parameters of the basic
limestone deposit, and will also provide an answer as to whether presence of gas
in the sandstone deposit within the concession area is probable.”**

The delays in the relevant proceedings resulted from: (i) Blue Gas Unikow’s lack
of understanding of Polish law during the proceedings; (ii) Blue Gas Unikow’s
submission of an incorrect and incomplete licence application, which at the outset

lacked the necessary environmental decision; (iii) the fact that the territorial licence
area proposed by Blue Gas Unik6w overlapped with the area of the licence held by
PGNiG; (iv) the intended Lelikéw licence area overlapped with the licence area of
another company — Ostrzeszow Copper sp. z 0. 0.; (v) Blue Gas Unikow’s conduct,
including failing to respond to the the Ministry’s requests for many months; and
(vi) a great number of similar licence applications due to the deadline of 30
September 2014 for submitting licence applications under the previous, more
beneficial legal provisions.***

Blue Gas Unikéw submitted a Lelikéw licence application by its letter of 30
September 2014.47? The Lelikéw application, like the Stanowice, Miedzyzdroje and
Zakrzewo applications, was filed on the deadline date for applying for a
hydrocarbon licence under the old beneficial legal provisions.”

On 2 July 2015, the representatives of Blue Gas Unikéw had a phone call with the
Ministry’s official, Ms. Potega, who explained why the Ministry could not answer
Blue Gas Unikow’s licence application earlier and assured them that the Ministry
would notify Blue Gas Unikéw about the progress of the Lelikéw proceedings by
the end of July 2015.4!

On 14 July 2015, the Ministry sent to Blue Gas Unik6w a letter in which it requested
Blue Gas Unik6w to remedy a number of deficiencies of the licence application.442
In addition, the Ministry communicated its justification as to why an environmental
decision was necessary, with the reference made to the relevant legal provisions.443

The Ministry addressed Blue Gas Unikow’s letter by issuing a decision on 31
August 2015 in which it explained why the procedure had lasted so long, that is, the
effect of the material amendment to the Geological and Mining Law entering into
force and the increased number of number of applications filed by 30 September
2014 seen as a result. Those applications were reviewed by the Ministry on a first-
come, first-served basis.““4

Before issuing the 31 August 2015, the Ministry received Blue Gas Unikow’s letter
of 23 July 2015 (in response to the Ministry’s letter of 14 July 2015). In that letter,
Blue Gas Unikow admitted that the majority of the Ministry’s comments were
correct.*45

Blue Gas Unikéw ultimately refused to provide the necessary environmental
decision, even though an environmental decision was required and that without it
the Ministry was obliged to refuse to grant the licence. Consequently, by a letter of

18 August 2015, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unik6w of the commencement of
the Lelikéw proceedings and planned to complete the proceedings and issue a
decision on refusal to grant the Lelikéw licence.**°

In the meantime, on 28 August 2015, the Ministry received a letter from PGNiG, in
which PGNiG explained that its “Pakostaw-Krotoszyn” licence area overlapped
with the area covered by the Lelikéw licence requested by Blue Gas Unikéw. As a
consequence, PGNiG stated that there was an obstacle to granting Blue Gas Unikéw
the Lelikéw exploration licence. On 9 September 2015, PGNiG informed the
Ministry that it waived its “Pakostaw-Krotoszyn” licence. Even though this
eliminated one formal obstacle to granting the licence, the missing environmental
decision was still an issue.“4”

On 7 September 2015, the Ministry completed the proceedings. The Ministry
noticed, however, that another company should have been consulted as a participant
to those proceedings, i.e., Ostrzesz6w Copper sp. z 0. 0. (Ostrzesz6w Copper), as
Ostrzeszéw Copper had two licences (“Janowo” and “Sulmierzyce”), whose areas
overlapped with the Lelikéw deposit area. Ostrzesz6w Copper’s licences covered
the prospection and exploration of copper. Therefore, the Ministry was obliged to
inform Ostrzesz6w Copper about the Lelikéw proceedings. The Ministry did so in
a letter of 10 November 2015.48

In response, Ostrzesz6w Copper, in a letter of 20 November 2015, informed the
Ministry that it opined positively on granting the Lelikéw licence to Blue Gas
Unik6w, but requested the Ministry to impose on Blue Gas Unikéw an obligation
to inform Ostrzesz6w Copper on any geological works that Blue Gas Unikéw
planned to perform on the area covered by the Lelikéw licence which overlapped
with the “Janowo” and “Sulmierzyce” licence areas.”

After informing all participants about the Lelikéw proceedings, the Ministry could
formally conclude the proceedings with its notification of 19 November 2015.*°°

In its letter of 28 January 2016, Blue Gas Unikéw did not challenge the correctness
of the Ministry’s 30 December 2015 decision, but instead Blue Gas Unikéw
“exercise[d] its right to modify the application for issuing the administrative
decision up until the case has not ended with a final decision and hereby amend[ed]
its application for issue of the Concession in the manner specified in wording of the
application appended to this letter and of the enclosed appendices in particular by
waiving in the original application its intention to optionally perform the drilling
operation with a hole having depth of 1870 m.” To conclude, Blue Gas Unikow
submitted a modified licence application in order to eliminate the obligation to
obtain an environmental decision. Such a modified licence application was

submitted in the form of Blue Gas Unikow’s request for reconsideration of the

case.*5!

On 23 February 2016, the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unikéw of commencement
of the proceedings regarding the modified application of 28 January 2016. This
meant that the Ministry complied with Blue Gas Unik6éw’s request and decided that
it was admissible to modify the licence application at that stage.*>

Because those proceedings were instigated by an appeal (containing Blue Gas
Unikoéw’s modified licence application), the case files were transferred to a
different Ministry’s official who needed time to become acquainted with the case.
The former case administrator, Ms. Potega, was excluded from the appeal
proceedings by operation of the relevant procedural rules. At the same time, the
modification of the licence application meant that the application had to be fully
reviewed anew.**>

After issuing a decision on commencement of the proceedings, the Ministry started
to review Blue Gas Unikow’s modified application of 28 January 2016 for the
Lelikéw licence.*4

On 30 June 2016, the Ministry summoned Blue Gas Unikéw to remedy the
deficiencies in the 28 January 2016 modified licence application.** The Ministry
advised Blue Gas Unikéw on how to improve the licence application to remove
Ministry’s potential doubts and fasten the proceedings.**®

On 30 June 2016, the Ministry set up a deadline of 30 day for Blue Gas Unikéw to
respond. Blue Gas Unikéw did not comply with this deadline. On 27 July 2016,
Blue Gas Unikéw requested extension of this deadline until 31 August 2016.45”

Blue Gas Unikow’s inactivity lasted for additional months in 2017, where no
financial statements were provided. On 30 March 2017, the Ministry once again
reminded Blue Gas Unikéw about the missing financial statements of Blue Gas
Holding that had been due since 31 August 2016.°* Due to Blue Gas Unikow’s
inactivity, the Ministry had to extend the proceedings until 31 May 2017. The new
deadline could have been met if Blue Gas Unikow had complied with the Ministry’s
instructions and presented the requested financial statements*?

After additional correspondence concerning the requested financial statements, as
well as other deficiencies, the licence application was eventually complete, and the
Ministry could process it under the “open door” procedure. On 30 August 2017, the

Ministry’s official responsible for the Lelikow proceedings prepared a draft of the
Communication from the Government of the Republic of Poland concerning
Directive 94/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the
conditions for granting and using authorisations for the prospection, exploration
and production of hydrocarbons in the ‘Lelikow’ area, and transmitted it to the
Department of Sustainable Development, Section of European Affairs of the
Ministry for publication.4

The Communication from the Government of the Republic of Poland concerning
Directive 94/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the
conditions for granting and using authorisations for the prospection, exploration
and production of hydrocarbons in the ‘Lelikow’ was published in the Official
Journal of the European Union on 10 October 2017. The deadline of 91 days was
set forth for submitting competing licence applications and the Ministry indicated
that the procedure of competing applications’ evaluation would last an additional 6
months from the deadline to submit them.*°!

On 14 September 2017, in response to Blue Gas Unikow’s demand that the Ministry
stop extending the proceedings, the Ministry explained that the proceedings were
conducted as a result of Blue Gas Unikow’s 28 January 2016 application for
reconsideration of the case, which contained the modified licence application.
Therefore, proceedings concerned only the period between 28 January 2016 and 11
August 2017. During that period, Blue Gas Unik6w repeatedly exercised its right
to modify and supplement the licence application, which triggered the Ministry’s
verification process. The Ministry observed that it informed Blue Gas Unikéw a
number of times of necessary corrections to the Lelikéw application and in
September 2017 that the “open door” procedure had been instigated. Accordingly,
the Ministry had not remained inactive between 28 January 2016 and 11 August
2017.

This decision was not challenged by Blue Gas Unikéw. On 9 February 2018, in part
as a result of the Ministry learning of Blue Gas Unikow’s bankruptcy proceedings,
the Ministry informed Blue Gas Unikéw that no competitive application during the
“open door” procedure was submitted and requested information concerning
whether Blue Gas Unik6w upheld its licence application.

The Ministry never obtained Blue Gas Unikow’s response. The Ministry was

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY
EU Law Objection

1. European Commission’s Position

The Commission has a central role, as guardian of the European Union, in ensuring
the uniform interpretation and proper application of the rules relating to investment
protection within the Union and therefore has a particular interest in avoiding any
conflict between arbitration awards and EU law.*®°

Two elements of Union law are of crucial significance for the proceedings before
you:

e Articles 267 and 344 Treaty on Functioning of European Union
(“TFEU”): On 6 March 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union
(“CJEU”) held that those provisions “must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States [...] under which an investor from one of those Member States
may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other
Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before
an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken
to accept.

e Commission Communication of 19 July 2018 on the Protection of intra-
EU investment: in that document, the Commission stated that Article 26
of the Energy Charter Treaty “if interpreted correctly, does not provide
for an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between investors from
a Member State of the EU and another Member State of the EU.4°

In addition, an important element of context is now provided by the Declarations of
all 28 Member States of 15 and 16 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the
judgment of the CJEU in Achmea and on investment protection in the European
Union.*“”

In a statement accompanying the recent signing of the International Energy Charter,
and therefore in the context of the Energy Charter Treaty, the Union has affirmed
its position that intra-EU investor-State dispute resolution is contrary to Union law.
The Union has also unanimously authorised the tiling of submissions specifically
putting forward that view in the context of a number of actions for enforcement of
arbitration awards pending before US courts.**

Article 26 ECT does not apply in intra-EU relations; the case law of the CJEU
according to which Union law precludes any investor-State arbitration concerning
intra-EU disputes as contrary to Articles 267 and 344 TFEU and the fundamental
principles of autonomy, effectiveness and mutual trust; and Article 26 ECT should
- even if it were held to apply to intra-EU disputes - be set aside as infringing a
higher-ranking norm of Union law (i.e. the treaty provisions and fundamental
principles mentioned a moment ago).*©?

The Arbitral Tribunal should decline jurisdiction in the proceedings pending before
it 47

2. Respondent’s Position

Respondent contends that the Achmea Judgment is of decisive importance for
deciding the issue of jurisdiction in the present case. The incompatibility between
the EU law and ISDS clauses that the CJEU found in the Achmea case is easily
transferable to all intra-EU investment disputes, including ECT arbitration.47!

In the Achmea decision, the CJEU held that:

“Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision
in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as
Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of
investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and
Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those
Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in
the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State
before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has
undertaken to accept.”*”

In its reasoning, the CJEU recalled the fundamental pillars of the EU legal system,
in particular its primacy over the laws of the Member States, direct effect and
autonomy of EU law with respect both to the law of the Member States and to
international law combined with the principle of mutual trust. The CJEU further
noted that, in order to ensure that the specific characteristics and the autonomy of
the EU legal order are preserved, the EU Treaties have established a judicial system
intended to ensure consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of EU law. In
accordance with Article 19 TEU and Article 267 TFEU, it is for the national courts
and tribunals, as well as the CJEU, to ensure the full application of EU law.473

The CJEU indicated that EU law must be regarded both as forming part of the law
in force in every Member State and as deriving from an international agreement
between the Member States. On that basis, the CJEU concluded that an arbitral

tribunal constituted under an intra-EU BIT “may be called on to interpret or indeed
to apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the fundamental freedoms,
including freedom of establishment and free movement of capital.”*"*

456. At the same time, the CJEU found that an arbitral tribunal cannot be classified as
“a court or tribunal of a Member State” within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU
and, therefore, is not entitled to make a reference to the CJEU for a preliminary
ruling.4”°

457. The CJEU held that, by concluding an intra-EU BIT, the Member States established
a mechanism for settling disputes between an investor and a Member State “which
could prevent those disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full
effectiveness of EU law, even though they might concern the interpretation or
application of that law.*"°

458. According to the CJEU, the mere hypothetical possibility of submitting investment
disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU calls into
question “not only the principle of mutual trust between the Member States but also
the preservation of the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties .. .
and is not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation.”*”

459. In the light of the above arguments, the CJEU categorically held that ISDS
provisions “have an adverse effect on the autonomy of EU law.”47

3. Claimants’ Position

460. Comparing the relation between EU law and the national laws of the EU Member
States to the relation between EU law and international treaties is groundless when
considering treaties to which the EU is a party, and which are not limited to the EU
Member States and/or accessing countries. This has been confirmed on numerous
occasions by arbitral tribunals both before and after the Achmea
judgment.*”Concerning the reach of the Achmea judgment, the scope of the

preliminary questions submitted by the German Federal Court of Justice in that case
was limited strictly to intra-EU BITs, and not to BITs or to investment treaties
generally. Extending its impact would be unacceptable over-interpretation.**° This
has been explicitly confirmed by arbitral tribunals.**!

Article 26 of the ECT applies in this arbitration. The Achmea judgment does not
constitute grounds for denying jurisdiction.**”

4. Tribunal’s Decision

Article 26 of the ECT sets out the dispute settlement provisions pursuant to which
the Claimants’ application in this case has been filed:

Article 26
Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and a Contracting Party

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the
former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former
under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which
either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party
to the dispute;

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party
hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to
international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions
of this Article.

 

States, and thus the ECT binds all of them, “it cannot be upheld that, by ratifying the ECT, those non-EU
States have accepted EU law as prevailing over the ECT.”)

(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for
resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide
its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

(a)(i) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes,
established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for
signature at Washington, 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the
“ICSID Convention”), if the Contracting Party of the Investor and the
Contracting Party party to the dispute are both parties to the ICSID
Convention,

 

The first question is whether the dispute is, in the words of Article 26(1) of the ECT,
a dispute “between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting
Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern
an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III [of the ECT].” The
only question here is whether the Claimants are “Investors” of “another Contracting
Party.” If they are, the remaining requirements in Article 26(1) are plainly met.

It is argued that the Claimants are all “Investors” of the EU, of which Poland is a
Member State, and are therefore not “Investors” of ‘another Contracting Party’ to
the ECT. This is the “intra-EU” argument, according to which the ECT does not
operate in the context of intra-EU States but only in the context of a dispute
involving an EU State and a non-EU State.

The Tribunal is bound to interpret and apply the instruments to which it owes its
existence and its powers and, in the words of ECT Article, to do so “in accordance
with [the ECT] and applicable rules and principles of international law.”

The starting point is the rule of interpretation set out in VCLT Article 31(1): “7. A
treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning
to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object
and purpose.”

Austria, Czech Republic, Cyprus and Poland are ECT Contracting Parties. On the
face of it, and giving the terms of Article 26(1) their ordinary meaning, this is
plainly a dispute “between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party”. The question is whether this conclusion is vitiated by the fact
that the EU is also a Contracting Party to the ECT.

There is nothing in the wording of Article 26, or any other provision of the ECT,
that suggests that because the EU is itself a Contracting Party, Austria, Czech
Republic, Cyprus and Poland cease to be distinct Contracting Parties vis-a-vis one
another under the ECT. It would not have been difficult to make provision for that
eventuality in Article 26 or in another part of the ECT or by an additional
“Understanding” of the kind attached to many ECT Articles (including Article 26
itself). But no such step was taken.

84

Bilaga 1

469.

471.

The argument that the ECT cannot apply rests on the interpretation of general
provisions of EU Law, notably Article 3(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union (“TFEU”), which stipulates that the Union has “exclusive
competence for the conclusion of an international agreement when its conclusion
... may affect common rules or alter their scope”. Nothing in the TFEU, however,
addresses the question of the continuing validity of the ECT when it brought
investment under Union competence in 2007, after the ECT had been ratified and
entered into force for the EU, Austria, Czech Republic, Cyprus and Poland.

Whilst the ECT does not contain any provision concerning the relationship between
the ECT and the TFEU or EU more generally, the ECT does make provision for
circumstances where two treaties appear to be in conflict. ECT Article 16, together
with the Decision relating to its application, reads as follows:

Article 16
Relation to Other Agreements

[DECISION] With respect to the Treaty as a whole

In the event of a conflict between the treaty concerning Spitsbergen of 9
February 1920 (the Svalbard Treaty) and the Energy Charter Treaty, the
treaty concerning Spitsbergen shall prevail to the extent of the conflict,

without prejudice to the positions of the Contracting Parties in respect of

the Svalbard Treaty. In the event of such conflict or a dispute as to whether
there is such conflict or as to its extent, Article 16 and Part V of the Energy
Charter Treaty shall not apply.*

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior
international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international
agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of Part
III or V of this Treaty,

(1) nothing in Part II or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate
from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right
to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement; and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to
derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any
right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty,

where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.

*Decision n. 1 with respect to the Energy Charter Treaty (Annex 2 to the
Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference).

The ordinary meaning of these provisions applied in this context mean that nothing
in the ECT derogates from any provision of any of the EU treaties in relation to
investment promotion and protection (ECT Part III) or from any right to dispute
resolution; and nothing in the EU treaties derogates from any provision of any of

the ECT in relation to investment promotion and protection (ECT Part III) or from
any right to dispute resolution. The explicit reference to the Svalbard Treaty
highlights the silence of Article 16 in relation to the EU treaties. Article 16 clearly
rests on the understanding that the ECT and the EU treaties were intended by ECT
Contracting Parties (including the EU) to co-exist, with investors entitled to take
the benefit of the more favourable treaty provision in any particular case.

The foregoing analysis is confirmed by decisions of other tribunals. In Vattenfall
v. Germany, it was stated:

“Article 26 ECT and the above-cited provisions must be read in the
context of Article 16 ECT, which specifically and explicitly addresses this
situation. The plain language of Article 16 speaks against Respondent’s
and the EC’s proposed interpretation of the ECT. Article 16 provides as
follows (...) [Therefore], [w]hile the ordinary meaning of Article 26 was
already clear, Article 16 confirms beyond doubt that Respondent’s
proposed reading of the provisions of the ECT is untenable. In light of this
provision it is not possible to “read into” Article 26 an interpretation
whereby certain investors would be deprived of their right to dispute
resolution, whether against an EU Member State of otherwise.”**

The Tribunal dismisses the inter-EU objection to its jurisdiction.
Claimants’ Investor Status

1. Whether Festorino and Fosontal were incorporated in accordance with
the law of Cyprus

(a) Respondent's Position

It is well-established in investment case-law that the burden of proof with regard to
the nationality falls on Claimants.***

Claimants failed to prove that Festorino Invest Ltd and Fosontal Ltd are companies
organized in accordance with the law of the Republic of Cyprus.**>

The only evidence submitted in this respect by Claimants are two partially-illegible
printouts from an unspecified website. There is no indication of the entity which
certified the content of the website. There is also no indication (at least in English)
that the companies were registered in Cyprus. tAccordingly, the printouts are not
sufficient proof of the jurisdiction ratione personae of the Tribunal and jurisdiction
should be denied as to Festorino and Fosonal.**°

(c)  Tribunal’s Decision

While maintaining that the documents previously provided were sufficient,
Claimants in their Reply provided the additional documents referenced above. The
Tribunal is satisfied with these additional exhibits provided by Claimants to support
their position that Festorino Invest Ltd and Fosontal Ltd were incorporated in
accordance with the laws of Cyprus. The Tribunal notes that in its Rejoinder,
Respondents do not advance their contention as it related to Festorino Invest Ltd
and Fosontal Ltd.*88

2. Whether Ms. Salesny and Mr. Rojicek qualify as Swiss investors
(a) Respondent's Position

In the Statement of Claim, Claimants assert for the first time that Ms. Salesny and
Mr. Rojicek enjoy the protection of ECT as Swiss residents. This allegation
apparently is aimed at bypassing the EU law objection raised by Respondent.**?

This allegation is to no avail for the following reasons.

First, Claimants are not entitled to change the factual and legal basis of the
jurisdiction ratione personae in the course of the arbitration proceedings. Article
1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT envisages three alternative criteria for establishing a natural
person’s status as an investor of the Contracting Party: (i) citizenship, (ii)
nationality, and (iii) permanent residence in accordance with the law of the
Contracting Party.4”°

The tribunal in Uzan v. Turkey stated that “[oJnce an Investor asserts jurisdiction
based on either one of these three possible characteristics, the Investor may not
then rely on another.”*!

The present proceedings were instituted when Claimants filed their request for
arbitration. By the same document Claimants allegedly accepted Poland’s offer of
arbitration contained in the ECT. Ms. Salesny and Mr. Rojicek launched the
proceedings unequivocally invoking the fact that they are Austrian and Czech
nationals. Consequently, they lost the right to derive the tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione personae from their alleged place of permanent residence.*””

In the Request for Arbitration, Claimants expressly indicated that “the dispute is
between Poland and investors form Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, and
Switzerland.” They also stated that Ms. Salesny and Mr. Rojicek “qualify as
investors in the meaning of Article 1(7)(a)(ii) ECT” as nationals of Austria and the
Czech Republic, respectively. Similarly, in the trigger letter of 29 March 2018,
Claimants characterised Ms. Salesny simply as “the citizen of Austria” and Mr.
Rojicek as “citizen of Czechia.”?

Second, the ECT does not entitle Claimants to invoke in the same proceedings two
different characteristics (nationality and permanent residence) as a basis of the
jurisdiction ratione personae. As is apparent from the wording of Article 1(7)(a)(i)
of the ECT, there are three equally important, but alternative, criteria for
establishing the home state of the investor. The criterion of “permanent residence”
is aimed at granting the protection to those investors who are not nationals of any
Contracting State but nevertheless retain sufficiently close links with a Contracting
State as recognized by domestic legal order., Therefore, an investor who already
indicated that he/she is a national of the Contracting Party is not entitled to claim to
be an investor from another Contracting Party.*%*

The above reasoning was confirmed in the Stati v. Kazakhstan award, where the
arbitral tribunal held that “residence would only matter, as is clear from the wording
of the definition in Art. 1(7) ECT by the second alternative after the word “or”, if
they [the investors] would not have the nationality of a Contracting State.”*°>

Third, Claimants have not proven that Ms. Salesny and Mr. Rojicek were at any
time permanent residents of Switzerland, i.e., that they possessed the status of
permanent residents acknowledged by the relevant laws of Switzerland and that
they actually lived in Switzerland. Claimants have also failed to prove that Ms.
Salesny and Mr. Rojicek were permanent residents of Switzerland on all the dates
relevant to establishing the jurisdiction ratione personae.*°

488. Article 1(7) ECT defines an investor as a person who is permanently residing in a
Contracting Party “in accordance with its applicable law.” Therefore, in order to
establish whether a natural person meets the above characteristics it is necessary to
verify: 1) whether that person actually permanently lives in one of the Contracting
Parties and 2) whether the Contracting Party grants this person, on the basis of its
internal law, the status of a permanent resident. In the words of the Uzan tribunal:
“The use of “permanently residing” appears to require that a natural person should
be both permanently residing in the Contracting Party (a factual requirement), and
for such status to be recognised by local domestic law (a legal requirement).”*?"

489.

Oo

It should be uncontested that both the above-mentioned requirements of permanent
residence (legal and factual) must be met continuously from the date of the alleged
breach until the time the arbitral proceedings are commenced. In Respondent’s
view, the “permanent residence” criterion must also be satisfied on the date of the
making of investment and of the resolution of the claim.**

490. The only evidence submitted by Claimants with regard to the permanent residence
of Ms. Salesny and Mr. Rojicek in Switzerland are two tax certificates issued on 14
April 2015. The certificates are not sufficient proof of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione personae under Article 1(7)(a)(1) for the following reasons.

491.

First, the certificates do not confirm that Mr. Rojicek and Ms. Salesny were
considered by Switzerland as permanent residents and that they actually
permanently lived in Switzerland. Tax residence is not tantamount to permanent
residence. Moreover, under Swiss law, a relatively short stay in Switzerland is
sufficient to acquire a tax resident status. Pursuant to Article 3(3) of the Law on
Federal Direct Taxation, a person is deemed a tax resident if a stay of a minimum
of 30 days is combined with a gainful activity, or without such activity if the stay
lasts a minimum of 90 days. In other words, the only thing attested by the certificate
is that Mr. Rojicek and Ms. Salesny stayed and gained profit for at least a month in
Switzerland prior to its issuance.

492. Second, the certificate only establishes that Mr. Rojicek and Ms. Salesny were
deemed tax residents of Switzerland on 14 April 2015. Therefore, it was not
confirmed that they were residents of Switzerland (even within a narrow tax law
meaning) at the time when they allegedly invested in Poland (2013), when the
alleged ECT breach occurred (2014-2017) and when the dispute was submitted to
arbitration (2018).

493.

wo

Third, Claimants provided no evidence with regard to the prerequisites of obtaining
the permanent resident status under Swiss law. They also failed to prove that Mr.
Rojicek and Ms. Salesny, were not only entitled to live, but actually lived, in
Switzerland on the dates relevant to establishing jurisdiction ratione personae.

(b) Claimants’ Position

As the Respondent does not question that Austria and the Czech Republic are
parties to the ECT or that Ms. Salesny and Mr. Rojicek are nationals of Austria and
the Czech Republic, Claimants need not establish that they were permanent
residents of Switzerland.”

(c)  Tribunal’s Decision

In its Rejoinder, Respondent reiterates that its objections as they pertain to Ms.
Salesny and Mr. Rojicek are based on Respondent’s EU law objection (as Ms.
Salesny and Mr. Rojicek are citizens of Austria and the Czech Republic).>° As the
Tribunal rejects Respondent’s EU Law objection, it sees no need to address the
Swiss residency issue as Respondent’s objection is dependent upon the success of
its EU law objection.

3. Whether Claimants made their investments in accordance with the ECT
(a) Respondent's Position

Claimants’ legal argumentation that their alleged investment fulfils the criteria of
“the investment” under the ECT generally boils down to statements that: (i)
Claimants directly hold interest in Blue Gas Holding, and indirectly through this
company they hold interest in Blue Gas Unikéw, Blue Gas Wrzosowo, Blue Gas
Stanowice and Blue Gas Zakrzewo, and (ii) Claimants allegedly appointed the
board members of Blue Gas Holding which, in turn, appointed the board members
of the special purpose vehicles mentioned above.*°!

The term “investment,” as it is used in Article 1(6) of the ECT, has an inherent
meaning that requires that the assets must be the result of an act of actual investing.
They presuppose an investment in the sense of a commitment of resources. Without
such a commitment of resources, the interests held by Claimants in the Blue Gas
Group in Poland do not constitute investments under the ECT.>°

This is not only confirmed by the ordinary meaning of the term “investment” but,
inter alia, by the dispute resolution clause of Article 26(1) of the ECT, which
provides for resolution of disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of
another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the
former. Pursuant to the interpretative principles of the VCLT, which instruct that
treaty terms are to be read in their ordinary meaning in context, reference to the
investment “of” an investor must connote active contribution.*

The above approach taken by Respondent is supported by Article 31 (1) of VLCT
according to which: “/a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and
in the light of its object and purpose.”>™

It is widely recognized by investment arbitration tribunals that the word
“investment”, in its ordinary meaning, entails: (i) contribution of resources (ii)
duration and (iii) assumption of risk.>

Against this backdrop, Respondent submits that each Claimant has to prove that it
made its own investment in terms of the ECT by (i) committing its resources (ii)
for a longer period of time and (iii) under assumption of risk. Consequently, each
Claimant has to prove to have made its own contribution to establish its own
investment under the ECT.*°°

Contrary to the above, Claimants only claim to have made together some
contribution, without explaining which part of the alleged contribution was made
by each individual Claimant). In doing so, Claimants fail to provide sufficient
evidence to prove their contentions.*”

Respondent notes Exhibit C-65, i.e., Resolution No. 1/10/17 of the Management
Board of Blue Gas Holding of 30 October 2017, in which an allegation is made that
Blue Gas Unik6éw allegedly invested over 30 million in the Unikéw Project.
However, this Claimants’ allegation that Blue Gas Unikéw invested over 30 million
in the Unik6éw Project is unsupported by any source documents. Even assuming,
arguendo, that such expenditures were in fact made by Blue Gas Unik6w for the
purposes of the Unikéw Project, Claimants fail to explain why those alleged
expenditures should be treated as Claimants’ contributions. Claimants also fail to
establish which parts of the alleged contributions should be attributed to each
individual Claimant.>°

In its Reply, Respondent further stresses that Claimants cannot simply allege that
all Claimants together made an investment for the purpose of the ECT, but rather
that each individual Claimant must establish that it made a sufficient contribution
to be covered under the treaty.>

Respondent does not contend that each individual Claimant must prove that it spent
its “own” money in order to acquire shares in a Polish Company, but it maintains
that simply inheriting or being given shares in Blue Gas Holding is insufficient.*!”
In other words, Claimants cannot exclusively rely on a third party’s contribution
and the resulting benefits to establish the making of an investment under the

Treaty.°!! Specifically, there must be an economic link between the capital used t
make an investment and the purported investor that enables the Tribunal to find that
an investment is actually an investment of a particular investor.*!? Here, Claimants
failed to establish that they made any substantial contributions, either using their
own funds or using other types of contributions in acquiring the shares in Blue Gas
Holding.

The fact that ultimately some funds were spent on developing the Unikéw Project
or preparing applications in various license proceedings before the Ministry does
not sufficiently establish that each Claimant made a qualifying contribution.>!?

Claimants failed to prove that each individual Claimant made its required
contribution, necessary to establish the investment under the ECT. Accordingly, the
Tribunal should deny its jurisdictions over all Claimants’ claims.>!*

(b) Claimants’ Position

Pursuant to Article 1(6) of the ECT, an “Investment” means every kind of asset,
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes:

. tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any
property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;

. a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity
participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt
of a company or business enterprise;

. claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to a contract having an
economic value and associated with an Investment;

. Intellectual Property;

° Returns;

. any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and permits
granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy
Sector.>!5

Fosontal, Festorino, Ms. Salesny, Mr. Derendinger and Mr. Rojicek directly own

and control 100% (32.93% + 32.93% + 11.38% + 11.38% + 11.38% respectively)
of the shares in Blue Gas Holding. Blue Gas Holding is the parent company and the

sole owner of the SPVs. Accordingly, the Claimants’ indirect ownership of the
SPVs constitutes an Investment in Poland pursuant to Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT.*!®

Respondent cites Romak v. Uzbekistan in support of its argument that Claimants
have failed to make an investment under the ECT, but in paragraph 185 of that
award, the arbitral tribunal clearly stated that the meaning of the term “investment”
should be limited to preserve “the distinction between investments, on the one hand,
and purely commercial transactions, on the other.” That is why the tribunal stated,
“that the term »investments« under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective
of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings)
entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves
some risk.”>!7

The investment the Claimants made fulfils these requirements as it was not a
commercial transaction, it was not trade or rendering services, but it was a real
contribution of assets in Poland which extended over a long time and involved
ok 518

risk.

Claimants disagree that each of the individual Claimants must prove that she/he/it
made her/his/its own investment. There are three reasons for this.>!?

Firstly, the Claimants made a joint investment. They had different economic
interests in the Investment but this does not mean that each of them made a
“separate” investment which should be subject to separate examination by the
Tribunal. There is an important difference in holding a share in an investment and
the investment itself.>?°

Secondly, if what the Respondent has in mind refers specifically to Article 1(6)(b)
of the ECT, then the Claimants did specify their respective shareholdings in Blue
Gas Holding and, therefore, their interests in the SPVs, i.e., the Investment. The
Claimants provided evidence that Fosontal and Festorino each held 69,144 shares
in Blue Gas Holding (2 x 32.93%) whereas Ms. Salesny, Mr. Derendinger and Mr.
Rojicek each held 23,904 shares in Blue Gas Holding (3 x 11.38%). Holding shares
in a company incorporated, registered and operating in Poland is considered an
investment in the Area of this Contracting Party in the meaning of Article 1(10)(a)
of the ECT.*”!

Thirdly, if the Respondent means that each of the Claimants should prove that
she/he/it spent a specific amount of money to acquire the shares, then such
requirement has no basis in the ECT. On the contrary, Article 1(8) of the ECT states
that to “Make Investments” or “Making of Investments” means establishing new
Investments, acquiring all or part of existing Investments or moving into different

fields of Investment activity. In other words, it is enough for the Claimants to prove
that they acquired (bought, inherited, contributed for or were given) the shares in
Blue Gas Holding and, thus, they made the Investment.>22

The very essence of the dispute is the value of the Investment, which corresponds
to the damage the Claimants suffered because of the Respondent’s breach of the
ECT, which Claimants have established. The actual capital expenditures (CAPEX)
and operative expenditures (OPEX) have been described and analysed in CER-7.
These reports were based on evidence presented to the Tribunal. Moreover, the
evidence itself was verified by independent experts (see Xodus).*>

The Respondent seems to suggest that the expenditures made in the Investment
should be accounted for in the calculations of the damages sought, unless each of
the Claimants proves that the monies were paid “out of their pockets.” This position
has no merit from a business perspective and would require Claimants to prove the
unprovable.>”4

Any business may be funded both by its owners, out of their savings or estate, or
by external sources (banks, venture capitalists, trade credit, etc.). It does not matter
at all where the money comes from as it is never free: all debts must be paid and all
profits shared with partners. Respondent’s contention ignores basic business
principles.*”>

Another issue the Respondent indicates with the Investment is its structure
comprising of several different projects. In this context, the Respondent cites
Nordzucker v. Poland to suggest that Claimants’ projects do not constitute a single
investment. *7°

At the outset, it needs to be emphasised that there is a significant difference in the
structures of the Investment made by the Claimants and the “investment” described
in the Nordzucker arbitration. Nordzucker AG had no legal title to the sugar mills
it intended to acquire. Moreover, the process of privatisation very much depended
on the State (the Respondent) as the seller. The State decided which sugar mills and
under what conditions they would be privatised. Therefore, Nordzucker AG could
not have structured its “investment” on its own and could not have claimed that the
mills it did not acquire were part of the “investment.”°””

This is not the case here. The Claimants identified approximately 40 natural gas
fields to look into to pursue the Investment. Eventually, Blue Gas Group chose to
continue with the Unikéw Project and the Wrzosowo Project.>7

In addition, Blue Gas Group decided to develop the Stanowice Project, the
Miedzyzdroje Project, the Zakrzewo Project and the Lelikow Project. And, contrary
to what the Respondent has suggested, these projects were material. The Claimants
contributed material resources to develop these projects and the fact that they did

not obtain licences for them does not change anything.>”?

For the Stanowice Project, Blue Gas Group acquired legal title to a plot of land, it
commissioned the development of the PRG Documentation, applied to the Ministry
fora licence for the recognition of the “Stanowice” natural gas deposit, and obtained
an environmental decision for this project.

Similar actions were taken regarding the Miedzyzdroje Project, the Zakrzewo
Project and the Lelikow Project. Such material contributions and actions are easily
distinguishable from the investment plans Nordzucker AG had regarding certain
sugar mills it never acquired.>*°

One has to differentiate plans to invest (as in Nordzucker v. Poland) and real
contributions which should be qualified as investments in the meaning of Article
1(6) of the ECT (as in the case at hand). The stage of a real investment is another
issue which should not be dealt with in the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. In
other words, the fact that the Unikéw and Wrzosowo Projects were far more
advanced than the Miedzyzdroje, Zakrzewo and Lelikow Projects does not mean
the latter cannot be qualified as part of the Investment as a whole.*?!

(c)  Tribunal’s Decision

As Claimants note, “Fosontal, Festorino, Ms. Salesny, Mr. Derendinger and Mr.
Rojicek directly own and control 100% (32.93% + 32.93% + 11.38% + 11.38% +
11.38% respectively) of the shares in Blue Gas Holding. Blue Gas Holding is the
parent company and the sole owner of the SPVs. In consequence, the Claimants’
indirect ownership of the SPVs constitutes an Investment in Poland pursuant to
Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT.”

The essence of this particular objection stems from the necessary contribution in
acquiring shares in order to qualify as an investment. Respondent contends that
Claimants cannot rely on third party contributions in acquiring the shares that
makeup the Investment, while Claimants argue that it is enough for the Claimants
to prove that they acquired (bought, inherited, contributed for or were given) the
shares in Blue Gas Holding. Claimants primarily rely on the plain language of Art.
1(6) of the ECT, which defines an investment as, inter alia, an asset controlled
directly or indirectly by an Investor, which can include shares, stock or other forms
of equity participation.

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that there must be an economic link between
relevant capital and an investor for the purpose of characterizing such capital as an

investment of that particular investor. However, the scenario described by
Respondent, in which alleged investors have no connection to alleged investment,
is not the case in this dispute.

It is accepted that Claimants here directly own and control 100% of the shares in
Blue Gas Holding, which was the parent company and sole owner of the SPVs
responsible for the subsequent monetary investments in the projects at issue in this
case. Consequently, the relevant connection stressed by Respondent is present even
if Claimants have not established that the relevant shares were acquired with
personal funds of each Claimant, as here we have indirect ownership of SPVs
responsible for spending on the project at the heart of this dispute.

The Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that the spending of funds on aspects
of the project, including license proceedings, fails to establish that each specific
Claimant made its contribution (i.e., that some economic link between the capital
and the purported investor can enable the Tribunal to find that a given investment
is an investment of that particular investor). Through Claimants’ indirect ownership
of the SPVs, the subsequent spending of the SPVs, acknowledged by the
Respondent to have taken place, creates a direct economic link through that
ownership structure to each of the Claimants as indirect owners. Such a direct link
is sufficient to satisfy the burden articulated by the Respondent.

4, Whether Claimants continuously held an interest in the Polish Blue Gas
Group’s Companies from the moment they had their alleged investments
throughout the entire period of the alleged breaches of the ECT

(a) Respondent's Position

In order for each Claimant to establish Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this arbitration,
each of them, separately, must prove that it held interest (and, if so, which interest)
in their alleged investments starting from the date on which their alleged
investments were established and throughout the entire period of the alleged
breaches of the ECT.**? Such approach is consistent with investment case law.**

Claimants’ story on the changes to the corporate structure of their alleged
investments is unsupported by evidence.>**

Claimants’ failure to prove the necessary interests in the investment as well as
qualifying dates of such interests should lead to dismissal of Claimants’ entire case
at the jurisdictional stage.>*°

(b) Claimants’ Position

By referring to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis, the Respondent
suggests that the Claimants have not proved that they had held an interest in the
Investment when the Respondent breached the ECT. Again, the Claimants do not
wish to pursue unnecessary discussions, thus they simply refer to official
documents produced by the State (i.e., the Respondent), even though the whole
corporate history of the Investment was presented in the Statement of Claim.**°

The timeline of the Respondent’s breach of the ECT should be dated September
2015 onwards. Although there were serious delays in the administrative
proceedings before, those that affected the Investment the most began in September
2015.597

All Claimants acquired interests in the Investment long before July 2015. However,
given the changes in the Investment’s corporate structure and to simplify the issue,
it is enough to refer to the ultimate outline of the said structure.***

The ultimate structure of Blue Gas Holding with all the Claimants as shareholders
was registered in the National Court Register on 2 February 2015.>*°

Blue Gas Holding was registered as the sole shareholder of Blue Gas Unikéw on
24 June 2015.54

Blue Gas Holding was registered as the sole shareholder of Blue Gas Stanowice on
22 September 2014 (as Zeger Enterprise sp. z 0.0.) and, on 28 July 2015, the entry
was changed to update the name of the shareholder.*+!

Blue Gas Holding was registered as the sole shareholder of Blue Gas Zakrzewo on
16 February 2015.5

Blue Gas Holding was registered as the sole shareholder of Blue Gas Wrzosowo on
4 February 2015.°?

The corporate structure of Blue Gas Holding and the SPVs has not changed since.**#
In consequence, there can be no doubt that the Claimants had “made the

investment” (see Article 1(8) of the ECT) before the breach began and they could
not have taken into account any risk of the irregularities in the administrative

proceedings as described in Section III of the Statement of Claim and Section III
hereof.*4

(c)  Tribunal’s Decision

In its Reply, Claimants accept that for the purpose of establishing the alleged
breaches, the timeline should run from September 2015 onwards. In its Rejoinder,
Respondent accepts this position and merely confirms that acts prior to that date
should not be considered when analyzing the presence of a potential breach, but
that such acts may be considered to the extent they are relevant to understanding
the context behind the impugned conduct after September 2015.>4°

As both Parties are in agreement as to the extent of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione temporis, there is no objection for the Tribunal to decide.

5. Whether the Unikéw Project, Wrzosowo Project, Stanowice Project,
Miedzyzdroje Project, Zakrzewo Project and Lelikéw Project should be
viewed as separate economic ventures

(a) Respondent's Position

Respondent submits that each of the Blue Gas Group’s Projects in Poland, i.e. the
Unik6w Project, the Wrzosowo Project, the Stanowice Project, the Miedzyzdroje
Project, the Zakrzewo Project and the Lelikéw Project should be viewed as separate
economic ventures, which are independent of one another in economic terms. It is
thus Respondent’s submission that each Project separately has to qualify as “the
Investment” of each Claimant under the ECT in order for Tribunal’s jurisdiction to
be established in the present case.*4”

First, during the licence proceedings, Claimants and the Blue Gas Group issued
specific assurances to Respondent that they secured financing unconditionally for
the development of all the Projects. Such guarantee was a condition necessary for
Respondent to issue relevant licences, without which the Blue Gas Group could not
start to develop any CHP projects.*“*

Secondly, each Project concerned the development of other potential gas deposits.
Those potential deposits were geographically scattered all around Poland. The
characteristics of each deposit were crucial for the development of the respective
Project.”

Thirdly, each Project was to be developed as a self-contained venture with its own
planning, licences to be obtained from the Ministry, other decisions/approvals to be
sought (such as approval of the Mining Plans by competent Regional Mining

Offices), infrastructure to be established, including, but not limited to, mine and
CHP facilities.°°°

In addition, for each Project, Blue Gas Group had to establish its own network of
clients, in particular off-takers of electricity and heat. In conclusion, a hypothetical
economic failure or success of one of the Projects did not translate into
failure/success of any other Project.

Respondent submits that the above circumstances are strikingly similar to those
considered by the tribunal in Nordzucker vs. Poland. In that case, the tribunal found
that Nordzucker’s attempts to acquire (during several and separate privatization
proceedings) different sugar groups in Poland should not be viewed as a single
overall investment. The tribunal noted that some of Nordzucker’s acquisition
attempts failed with the consequence that some sugar groups targeted by
Nordzucker were acquired and some not. Then, the tribunal went on to consider
whether the particular failed acquisitions could be qualified as investments and it
concluded that they could not.>*!

Respondent submits that, save for the Unik6w and Wrzosowo Projects, no other
Project could fulfil the criteria of the investment under the ECT. Accordingly,
Claimants’ alleged claims related to Projects other than the Unikéw and Wrzosowo
Projects are beyond this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, irrespective of any other
jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent.*>?

The major difference between the Unikéw and Wrzosowo Projects on the one hand
and other Projects on the other are the licences granted by the Ministry. Without the
respective licences from the Ministry allowing exploration of the relevant deposit,
the Blue Gas Group’s projects are comparable to the acquisitions in Nordzucker vs.
Poland, which do not fulfil the criteria of the term “investment.”>>*

Without the necessary licences, the Stanowice, Zakrzewo, Miedzyzdroje and
Lelik6w Projects were just business concepts on paper. Without such licences from
the Ministry, the Blue Gas Group had no right to explore the relevant deposit, which
was a necessary condition for considering the development of any of the Blue Gas
Group’s CHP Projects, irrespective of whether they would prove viable or not.>*4

Respondent acknowledges that the Blue Gas Group obtained the Zakrzewo
exploration licence of 12 May 2017, but it is also clear that Claimants’ ECT
allegations concern events that preceded the granting of this 12 May 2017 licence,
therefore excluding the claims related to the Zakrzewo Project from the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. *°°

556. With respect to the Wrzosowo exploration licence of 16 February 2015,
Respondent, in accordance with the above reasoning, submits that Respondent’s all
measures, which took place prior to the granting of that Licence, are also outside
this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.°°°

(b) Claimants’ Position

557. All of these projects should be treated as one investment. Nordzucker v. Poland
could only be referred to in this arbitration if the Claimants sought compensation
for the five real projects and the remaining 35-or-so they considered developing in
the future. The Claimants made one Investment consisting of five projects. If they
had ever invested in more projects, it would have had to be treated as a simple
expansion of the Investment. It did not happen, and, unlike Nordzucker AG, the
Claimants never treated their investment plans as part of the Investment itself.*°”

558. The organizational structure of the Investment displays the general concept of a
single investment in Blue Gas Holding, with the business plan being that Blue Gas
Group would then control SPVs to carry out the various prongs of the overarching
investment. This structure was again displayed in Claimants’ Opening Statement
and is copied below:

In essence, the shares in Blue Gas Group constituted a single investment with one
business concept, the structure of which was designed to grow into a heightened
final energy capacity.>°*

(c)  Tribunal’s Decision

It is not uncommon in largescale energy projects that there exist different stages,
sub-projects, preliminary projects, etc., in a general sense. It is true that for some
projects it may be easy to articulate what appears to be a single, truly individual,
overarching plan, such as the construction of a particular nuclear power plant. In
such a case, it would be difficult to argue that the construction of certain parts of
the given plant should be considered different investments as opposed to
characterizing it all as a single investment in the construction of the plant.

The Tribunal notes that there is more difficulty in the case at hand, where the
investors are characterizing as a single investment the development, or attempted
development, of distinct, arguably independent projects located in different
locations of a given state. The projects admittedly involved independent license
procedures, which themselves entailed different analysis as the projects were not
identical in nature, and of course the lack of a single unifying task was displayed
by the mere fact that in this case there are several projects that have different names
because they were in fact different endeavours.

The Tribunal does not consider that the these differences between the projects
should be translated into the legal atomisation of what in an economic sense is
clearly a single investment. It would be equally artificial, for example, to postulate
that a golf course and a spa are separate investments as opposed to recognizing that
the overarching singular plan was the development of a resort.

Here, Respondent does not rely on an argument that Claimants lacked a singular
business plan which consisted of the development of the projects at issue through
the Blue Gas Group. Rather, Respondent relies more on the independent nature of
each project in arguing that they are fundamentally different investments.

However, the Tribunal is not convinced by the position that the investment here can
be severed merely because the various projects involved different licensing
procedures, infrastructure requirements and the like. To require such characteristics
to be identical would unreasonably constrain the ability to characterize any
largescale project as a single investment.

In the Nordzucker decision relied heavily upon by Respondent, the Claimant argued
that the acquisition of four Sugar Groups constituted a single investment, relying
on its strategic goal of acquiring 20% of the Polish market.**° The tribunal in that
case noted that the link between the various public sales procedures for the different
sugar groups which had been launched by Poland was the fact that they were

governed by the same Privitization Act and that it was the same Ministry of State
Treasury which was involved in the supervision of the sales process.*™ The tribunal
determined that such limited common aspects of the sales procedures for sugar
groups did not support the conclusion that the acquisition of more than one group
constituted a single investment.**!

The scenario here is not equivalent. Claimants have not premised their concept of
an investment on aspirational ideas as to how a state would choose to privatize a
given industry, with an arbitrary percentage of control articulated as the magic
number dictating which actions would be considered as falling under the given
investment, as was the case in Nordzucker.

Here, the business concept was to construct a number of smaller CHP facilities,
then using the proceeds from the first facilities to finance projects with a higher
capacity. Claimants entered the investment with this plan because it was this
complete, interrelated series of steps that was necessary to realize the business
opportunity that they had identified.

Further, Respondent implicitly acknowledged it was aware of the totality of the
Claimants’ plans (not plans merely contemplated but affirmatively attempted in the
relevant license proceedings). While Respondent does so in arguing that Claimants
either misled the State with respect to the dependence on certain projects for
financing or did not mislead the State and thus there was no economic connection
among any of the projects, this adds credibility to Claimants’ position that from the
outset these given projects constituted a single investment under a single business
plan. While it is true that in Nordzucker the State was also aware of the general goal
of the investors to acquire 20% of the sugar market, this can be distinguished from
the case at hand where Claimants had not merely communicated a general goal of
of X% of the market or X amount of power output, but instead a relatively unified
plan to ultimately tap into, in a profitable manner, the niche market of unexplored
but recognized deposits of nitrogen-rich natural gas.

The Tribunal recognizes that there lacks a clear test applicable in cases such as this
to determine whether arguably independent projects can be considered a unified
venture to the extent of qualifying as a single investment. In this case, the Tribunal
is satisfied that the interrelation of the SPV activities under the overarching Blue
Gas Group business concept is sufficient to constitute a single investment.

6. Clean Hands

(a) Respondent's Position

In their Statement of Claim, Claimants made the following admissions:

“Depriving Blue Gas Unikéw of its revenues forced the Claimants to
forego the Investment as a whole, even though they had invested
approximately PLN 32.1 million in the said SPV alone. In consequence,
on 31 October 2017 the management board of Blue Gas Unikéw had to
file for bankruptcy, which was declared by the District Court for the
capital city of Warsaw three months later.”

“Given the importance of the Unikéw project to the entire Investment (see
paragraphs 8, 16, 22 and 47 above), it is fair to say that the impairment of
this project resulted in the eradication of the Investment. As already
indicated, the proceeds gained from the Unikéw license were to be
reinvested in the other projects so that the entire network could operate as
one business entity. Destroying the Unikéw project caused a chain
reaction which could not be stopped or remedied with the development of
any other project.”*°

By making the above admissions, Claimants revealed that the financing of the
projects other than the Unikéw Project, i.e. (i) the Wrzosowo Project, (ii) the
Stanowice Project, (iii) the Mig¢dzyzdroje Project, (iv) Zakrzewo Project as well as
(v) the Lelikow Project, was dependent upon the Unikow Project’s success and the
other projects were to be financed from the proceeds gained from the Unikéw
Project.°

These admissions contradict the assurances made by the Blue Gas Group’s
companies during the administrative proceedings before the Ministry.°™

Namely, in relation to all the projects other than the Unikéw Project, the Blue Gas
Group’s companies assured the Ministry that the financing for performing the
works to be scheduled under the relevant licences was guaranteed and not
conditional upon the proceeds from the Unikéw Project.°°

The fact that Claimants made such assurances has been confirmed by Ms. Potega,
the Ministry’s official responsible for conducting the majority of the licence
proceedings related to the Blue Gas Group’s projects.

The Witness Statement of Ms. Potega makes clear that the Ministry would not have
granted any licences had the Blue Gas Group’s companies revealed at the stage of
the licence proceedings their true intention to conditionally finance the works under
the relevant licences.*®’ Ms. Potega demonstrated that the operation of the relevant
provisions of law, applicable to the administrative proceedings for granting licences
and licence conversion, would have resulted in the Ministry refusing to grant the

relevant licenses and such conversions. Moreover, Ms. Potega also shows that such
application of law was expressly acknowledged by the Polish administrative courts
as lawful.>%

Had the Blue Gas Group or Claimants not assured the Ministry during the licence
proceedings that the financing of Projects was to be unconditional, the Ministry
would have refused to grant licences or licence conversions.*

Jurisprudence of investment tribunals, including that under the ECT, widely
recognizes that an investment which was made in breach of the host state’s laws
either (i) sets the relevant claims outside the scope of arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction
or (ii) renders them inadmissible.>””

Respondent relies on Plama vs. Bulgaria case based on the ECT. In that case, the
tribunal clearly stated that:

Unlike a number of Bilateral Investment Treaties,3 the ECT does not
contain a provision requiring the conformity of the Investment with a
particular law.

This does not mean, however, that the protections provided for by the ECT
cover all kinds of investments, including those contrary to domestic or
international law. As noted by the Chairman's statement at the adoption
session of the ECT on 17 December 1994:

. the Treaty shall be applied and interpreted in accordance with
generally recognized rules and principles of observance, application and
interpretation of treaties as reflected in Part III

of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 25 May 1969... . The
Treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose.14

139. In accordance with the introductory note to the ECT "[t]he

fundamental aim of the Energy Charter Treaty is to strengthen the rule of

law on energy issues

..." Consequently, the ECT should be interpreted in a manner consistent
with the aim of encouraging respect for the rule of law. The Arbitral
Tribunal concludes that the substantive protections of the ECT cannot
apply to investments that are made contrary to law.”°”!

579. Further, Respondent relies on Hamester vs. Ghana which confirmed as follows:

“123. The Tribunal considers, as was stated for example in Phoenix v.
Czech Republic, that: “States cannot be deemed to offer access to the
ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments not made in good
faith.”

An investment will not be protected if it has been created in violation of

national or international principles of good faith; by way of corruption,

fraud, or deceitful conduct; or if its creation itself constitutes a misuse of

the system of international investment protection under the ICSID
Convention. It will also not be protected if it is made in violation of the
host State’s law (as elaborated, e.g., by the tribunal in Phoenix).

124. These are general principles that exist independently of specific
language to this effect in the Treaty.*”

580. In Phoenix vs. Czechia the tribunal stated that:

“In the Tribunal’s view, States cannot be deemed to offer access to the

ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments made in violation of

their laws. If a State, for example, restricts foreign investment in a sector
of its economy and a foreign investor disregards such restriction, the
investment concerned cannot be protected under the ICSID/BIT system.
These are illegal investments according to the national law of the host
State and cannot be protected through an ICSID arbitral process. And it
is the Tribunal’s view that this condition — the conformity of the
establishment of the investment with the national laws —

is implicit even when not expressly stated in the relevant BIT. This position
of the Tribunal has also been adopted in the case of Plama, where the
Tribunal was faced with the silence of the relevant treaty on the necessary
conformity of a protected investment with the laws of the host country.”°7°

581. During the licence proceedings, Claimants made assurances to the Ministry
concerning the unconditional nature of the financing of the Projects other than the
Unik6w Project. Such assurances resulted in the Ministry issuing positive decisions
with respect to those licenses. In particular, the Ministry issued the Wrzosowo
exploration licence on 16 February 2015 and the Zakrzewo exploration licence on
12 May 2017. In yet other cases, the Blue Gas Group, at the stage of the licence
proceedings, assured the Ministry that the financing for the works intended under
the requested licences was unconditionally secured.>”*

It is apparent that a significant part of Claimants’ alleged investment was made due
to the Blue Gas Group’s or Claimants’ false statements submitted to the Ministry.°”°

Had the Blue Gas Group informed the Ministry of its true intentions, the
consequence, under the applicable Polish law, would be that no licences for projects
other than the Unik6w Project would have been granted.>”°

By providing the Ministry with their misrepresentations as to the nature of the
financing, the Blue Gas Group and/or Claimants breached international law,
including the applicable principle of good faith. As recognized by the Plama vs.
Bulgaria tribunal: “[t]he principle of good faith encompasses, inter alia, the
obligation for the investor to provide the host State with relevant and material
information concerning the investor and the investment.”

A range of the international law principles have a role in the present case: (i) the
principle of good faith defined as the “absence of deceit and artifice during the
negotiation and execution of instruments that gave rise to the investment’; (ii) the
principle of nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans — which means that no
party can benefit from its own wrong — understood as the prohibition for an investor
to “benefit from an investment effectuated by means of one or several illegal acts’;
(iii) the principle of international public policy, according to which recognizing the
existence of rights arising from illegal acts would violate the "respect for the law";
and (iv) the principle on the prohibition on unlawful enrichment, according to which
“when the cause of the increase in the assets of a certain person is illegal, such
enrichment must be sanctioned by preventing its consummation.”>7*

The circumstances of this case confirm that Claimants made their investment in a
deceitful and fraudulent manner by providing the Ministry with false information
on the financing for the relevant projects. The Ministry relied on those
misrepresentations during the licence proceedings. Had it not been for such
misrepresentations, the Ministry, acting in accordance with relevant law, would
have refused to grant any licences or licence conversions save for the Unikéw
Project.>””

The documents on the record in this case show that the Ministry expressly advised
the Blue Gas Group as early as 20 May 2014 (during the licence proceedings
concerning other Projects than Unikéw Project), concerning the financing required
for securing performance of works under the licences the Blue Gas Group
requested, in particular:

“The revenues from the “Unikéw" investment project, which you intend to
use to finance the "Wrzosowo" project, are distant in future and uncertain,
it is not possible to estimate their amount at the moment and therefore

cannot be treated by the concession authority as a security for the
financing of the proposed activity.*°

In response, Blue Gas Unik6w, in its letter of 4 June 2014, assured the Ministry that
the necessary financing, was secured:

“We continue to uphold the commitment made by our shareholders to
provide financing for the investment projects carried out by the company,
in particular company’s concession commitments. At the same time, please
be advised that the additional funds declared by the shareholders have not
yet been made available due to the fact that this financing first required
optimum structuring. The work on structuring this financing is nearing
completion and the whole operation will be completed within one month.
To confirm these declarations, we submit a statement by our shareholders
as to the availability of funds to finance the company's operations under
the Wrzosowo concession, in particular by making available financing in
the amount of USD 3 million.”**!

The above excerpts from the correspondence between the Blue Gas Group and the
Ministry, juxtaposed with the admissions made by Claimants in their Statement of
Claim clearly show the Blue Gas Group’s bad faith when providing the Ministry
with its false statements on the financing. It was in May 2014, at the latest, that the
Blue Gas Group and their shareholders became acquainted with the Ministry’s
position on the financing required for obtaining licences. From that point forward,
the Blue Gas Group continuously assured the Ministry in all licence proceedings
that the financing was guaranteed and unconditional.***

The Tribunal should deny its jurisdiction in the present case in relation to any and
all claims advanced by Claimants in this arbitration. In case the Tribunal is of the
opinion that the issues discussed in this objection should be considered in terms of
admissibility or otherwise on the merits of the case, Respondent respectfully
requests that Tribunal dismiss Claimants’ all claims as inadmissible or otherwise
on the merits as Tribunal deems appropriate.***

This request is justified because Claimants’ alleged investment was based on the
assumption that the Unikéw Project was an indispensable element of the entire
scheme under which the Unikow Project’s aim was to finance the performance of
the other projects. Should, however, the Tribunal be of the opinion that the Unikéw
Project should be treated as a separate investment which is not tainted with
Claimants’ bad-faith misrepresentations as described above, Respondent hereby
respectfully requests that all Claimants’ claims, save for those resulting from the

Unik6w Project, be found to be (i) beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal or (ii)
inadmissible or otherwise be dismissed on the merits.***

Had the Ministry been properly informed that Claimants had intended for the works
under the relevant licences were conditional upon financing from the expected
proceeds of the Unikéw Project, the Ministy, pursuant to Polish law, would not
have granted any license to the Blue Gas Group Concerning the Wrzosowo,
Stanowice, Miedzyzdroje, Zakrzewo and Lelikéw Projects.**°

In essence, Claimants’ case requires one of two interpretations: (1) the works under
various licenses were conditional upon financing from the expected proceeds of the
Unik6w Project, in which case Claimants acted in bad faith in misleading the
Ministry and violated the clean hands doctrine as applied to all projects; or (2) the
Unik6w Project can be treated as a separate investment untainted by the bad faith
misrepresentations (as they applied to the license procedures for the other projects),
in which case jurisdiction should be denied as to all projects aside from the Unikéw
Project.**°

(b) Claimants’ Position

Not only is the applicability of the clean hands doctrine debatable in the sphere of
investment arbitration, but crucially the Respondent bears the burden of proof here.
In other words, even if the doctrine were to be applied in this arbitration, the
Respondent would have to prove that the Claimants acted in bad faith or illegally
when making the Investment. The Respondent failed to do so.”

The Respondent claims that the SPVs “assured the Ministry that the financing for
performing the works to be scheduled under the relevant licenses was guaranteed”
but this declaration, and thus the Investment, “was made in a deceitful and
fraudulent manner.” If this had been the case, however, the Ministry would have
refused to grant any of the SPVs relevant licences or their conversion. Except for
the Lelikow Project, the Ministry never refused Blue Gas Group a licence. (And in
the case of Lelikow, the reasoning of the Ministry’s decision did not mention
financing.)***

The Ministry’s decisions to grant such licenses and conversions were made despite
the fact that the Blue Gas Group and the Claimants were subject to scrutiny which
covered their financials. Importantly, the Ministry was in possession of the evidence
provided by the Blue Gas Group during the administrative proceedings and decided
not to question that evidence, confirming that the Claimants had, and demonstrated,
sufficient resources.**?

During this arbitration, the Respondent did not provide any evidence to the contrary
despite the rule of onus probandi. The only basis for the Respondent’s unfounded
allegations is its interpretation of the Investment and the fact that the Claimants did
not want to “burn money” without real prospects of profit due to the Respondent’s
misconduct.5”

The Respondent tries to find a link between the Claimants’ business decision to
wind up the Blue Gas Group and the alleged lack of financing for the Investment.
In other words, the Respondent wants this Tribunal to conclude that since the
Claimants refused to keep on financing the Investment regardless of the obstacles
the Ministry put in their way, they admitted that they did not have sufficient
financing to begin with. This contention is false.*?!

The “clean hands” doctrine can only be applied in situations where investors
launder money, commit fraud or breach strict laws regarding human rights or
investments in particular industries or areas. The investors’ actions must be
regarded as unethical, manifestly wrongful or undertaken in bad faith. Claimants
did not even approach such conduct.>”

Blue Gas Group did not breach the law, neither did they misrepresent their financial
situation. The Respondent deliberately mistakes declarations and evidence proving
that Blue Gas Holding and the SPVs had sufficient resources to run their businesses
with a promise never to go bankrupt even if the Ministry/the Respondent made these
activities non-operational and, therefore, unprofitable.°?*

Not only do the Claimants not deny that the activities and financials of the SPVs
were intertwined, they reaffirm it. That is what made them part of one business
concept: the Investment. However, providing sufficient resources to make a
business operational, and keeping it alive for an unspecified period in the face of
illegal obstacles are different concepts.**

The Claimants provided financing for all SPVs to start their operations. They did
not provide and they did not promise to provide revenue for the SPVs. The SPVs
were supposed to earn revenue on their own and the Respondent prevented them
from doing so. When it became obvious that Blue Gas Wrzosowo, Blue Gas
Stanowice and Blue Gas Zakrzewo would not start their operations as planned
because of the administrative hindrances, the Claimants decided that Blue Gas
Unik6w should help finance the other SPVs. This, in turn, depended on the
recommencement of Blue Gas Unikow’s operations but, unfortunately, this was
also blocked by the Respondent.**>

In summary, it was not the Claimants’ choice to make the entire Investment
dependent on Blue Gas Unik6éw. It was a necessity, which actually supports
Claimants’ contention that the SPVs were part of one investment and that they
cannot be treated separately. Describing the Claimants’ attempts to uphold the
Investment as “fraudulent and deceitful” is inaccurate.5°°

(c)  Tribunal’s Decision

There is no doubting the importance of the Unikéw Project in the grand scheme of
the Investment and the ultimate collapse that led to this arbitration. Claimants have
not avoided such a characterization and have extensively relied on the Unikéw
Project’s importance in describing what they allege was an illegal frustration of the
Investment as a whole, with the Unikow Project’s ultimate inability to provide
financing that they argued was necessary for the continuation of the business plan.

Respondent’s clean hands argument relies heavily on the extent to which Claimants
had always planned on the centrality of the Unikow Project to its financing structure
as compared to representations made to Respondent regarding the same.

In its Rejoinder, Respondent highlights language that Claimants used in their
Statement of Claim versus their Reply to argue that Claimants ultimately realized
their mistake in portraying the Unikow Project’s significant position in the financial
plans, and thus unconvincingly tried to walk back from their characterization of the
subsequent projects as conditional upon revenue expected from the Unikéw
Project.*°’ Respondent argues that this attempted twist of the narrative highlights
that Claimants are aware that they misled the Ministry with respect to this issue and
are now trying to change their story to avoid any issue under the cleans hands
doctrine.

The Tribunal acknowledges that the precise characterization of the Unikéw
Project’s expected role as a financer of sorts for the subsequent projects has been
less than perfectly consistent. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that
Claimants violated the cleans hands doctrine on that basis.

The crucial paragraph that Respondent points to as proof that Claimants had relied
on the Unikéw Project more than had represented to the Ministry reads as follows:

Given the importance of the Unikéw Project to the entire Investment (see
paragraphs 8, 16, 22 and 47 above) it is fair to say that the impairment of
this project resulted in the eradication of the Investment. As already
indicated, the proceeds gained from the Unikéw license were to be
reinvested in the other projects so that the entire network could operate as
one business entity. Destroying the Unikéw Project caused a chain

reaction which could not be stopped or remedied with the development of

any other projects

This quote, however, does not demonstrate that Claimants had planned to
necessarily rely on the Unikow Project’s projected revenue for financing of
subsequent projects. In fact, it arguably does the opposite. In Respondent’s
Rejoinder, it specifically emphasizes the “or remedied with the development of any
other project” language as establishing its point.*°? However, this language suggests
that whilst other projects could have theoretically been developed after the
“destruction” of the Unikow Project, the chain reaction that followed from the
failure of the Unikéw Project nonetheless undermined any real prospect of success
for the other projects and thus the overall Investment.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Claimant did not engage in fraudulent or
deceitful acts or acts in bad faith when portraying the financial plan for the
Investment. The Tribunal considers it likely that the success of the Unikéw Project
was always considered of crucial importance, and that its failure did indeed, on its
own, lead to the downfall of the Investment. However, the Tribunal does not find
that Claimants’ planned use of Unikow Project revenue was in direct conflict with
representations made to Respondent. The clean hands doctrine simply does not
apply.

The Tribunal also finds that Respondent has failed to establish a viable objection to
admissibility. Respondent had, in passing, indicated that its jurisdictional argument
could also be considered an admissibility argument. To the extent Respondent has
presented an admissibility objection based on the clean hands doctrine, it is also
rejected.

THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMS

As was the case with the factual summary, the following summaries of the Parties’
positions on the merits do not intend to be exhaustive summaries of each claim that
has been made.

Claimants’ Position

1. General
Art. 10(1) of ECT states the following:

“Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make
Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to
accord at all times to Investments by Investors of other Contracting Parties
fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most

599 Id.

constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any
way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall
such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required
by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party
shall observe any obligations it has entered into with with an Investor or
an Investment by an Investor of any other Contracting Party.”

It sets out the fundamental principles on which the ECT rests. All of the other
subsections of Art. 10 of the ECT are rooted in the above cited general norm. The
principles can be grouped under the following categories:

. the obligation to accord to investors fair and equitable treatment (FET);

. the obligation to protect investments against unreasonable or discriminatory
measures, including the guarantee of the national treatment and most
favoured nation treatment (MEN);

. the duty to observe obligations entered into with the investors or investments
(the Umbrella Clause).°°!

The Respondent infringed all of these principles. Each of them affected the
Investment. In fact, each infringement caused disruption for the Investment
concerned and caused the Claimants to suffer damage.°

2. Fair and Equitable Treatment

The right to fair and equitable treatment is perceived by arbitral tribunals as an
overriding principle that includes all other guarantees that arise from it. This view
was expressed in Petrobart vs. Kyrgyzstan. The arbitral tribunal stated that Art.
10(1) of the ECT “in its entirety is intended to ensure a fair and equitable treatment
of investments” and, therefore, “it is sufficient to conclude that the measures for
which the [the State] is responsible failed to accord [the investor] a fair and
equitable treatment of its investment to which it was entitled under Article 10(1).”

 

It is commonly accepted that the protection of the legitimate expectations of
investors is the dominant element of fair and just treatment. In this context,
determining a breach of treaty protection first requires examining the impact of the
applied measure (undertaking or discontinuing a given measure) on the investor’s
legitimate expectations, and whether the state failed in this way to meet the
investor’s expectations that the state created or reinforced through its own acts. In
Tecmed vs. Mexico, the arbitral tribunal concluded that it is the State’s obligation,
“to provide to international investment treatment that does not affect the basic

expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the
investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner,
free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign
investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will
govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and
administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply
with such regulations.”

The FET standard has not been precisely defined in the ECT or any other
international treaty. A breach of the FET standard must be determined on a case-
by-case basis. Nevertheless, some tribunals have attempted to define some basic
factors which constitute the FET standard, such as the tribunal in Lemire vs.
Ukraine (II). The tribunal concluded that: “/ijt requires an action or omission by
the State which breaches a certain threshold of propriety, causing harm to the
investor, and with a causal link between action or omission and harm. The
threshold must be defined by the Tribunal, on the basis of the wording of Article
11.3 of the BIT, and bearing in mind a number of factors, including the following:

e whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal framework;
e whether the State made specific representations to the investor;
e whether due process has been denied to the investor;

e whether there is an absence of transparency in the legal procedure or in the
actions of the State;

e whether there has been harassment, coercion, abuse of power or other bad
faith conduct by the host State;

e whether any of the actions of the State can be labelled as arbitrary,
discriminatory or inconsistent.

The evaluation of the State’s action cannot be performed in the abstract and only
with a view of protecting the investor’s rights. The Tribunal must also balance

other legally relevant interests, and take into consideration a number of

countervailing factors, before it can establish that a violation of the FET standard,
which merits compensation, has actually occurred:

e the State’s sovereign right to pass legislation and to adopt decisions for
the protection of its public interests, especially if they do not provoke a
disproportionate impact on foreign investors;

 

e the legitimate expectations of the investor, at the time he made his
investment;

Not all of the above criteria may be applied in this arbitration or necessarily fit

Article 10(1) of the ECT, but they provide non-binding guidelines for the Tribunal
in this case.°°

The Respondent unequivocally failed to ensure transparency in the administrative
proceedings regarding licenses for the exploration, recognition and mining of
hydrocarbon deposits. The absence of such transparency was not caused by the law.
It was caused by the Ministry’s actions. As confirmed by the NIK Report,
entrepreneurs who applied for such licenses never knew: (i) how long the procedure
would take; (ii) how many times and to what end would the Ministry would demand
additional documents and explanations; (iii) what criteria would be applied in one
case versus another; (iv) whether or when the Ministry would inform them of any
relevant issues, even if such information was mandatory; and (v) whether the
Ministry would respond to their submissions or inquiries at all.”

Respondent contends that the administrative proceedings initiated by the SPVs
were fair and transparent and points to the NIK Report of August 2017 to support
this contention.*® However, the NIK Report clearly indicates the faulty
organization of work and violations of law by the Ministry, which was apparent
from the documents produced in this arbitration.©

Importantly, Respondent did not contest the NIK Report’s findings that the relevant
statutory deadlines were strict and that they were not adhered to, meaning that
Respondent admitted to violating the applicable laws during these proceedings.
This amounts to a violation of the FET standard.°!°

Mr. Jacek Strzelecki confirmed in his witness statement that before pursuing the
Investment, the Claimants analysed the Polish upstream gas market. The analysis
showed that there were approximately nine thousand boreholes (the largest number
in Europe) and a great deal of geological documentation covering the entire country
which could serve as a perfect basis to assess the potential of any given project.°!!

Respondent argues that Claimants could not have relied on their analysis of the
upstream gas market in Poland because they failed to perform any due diligence,
but the market analysis is based on publicly-available data and thus the conclusions

do not result from due diligence. Importantly, Respondent does not question the
actual results of the market analysis completed by Claimants.°!*

Polish law provides certain privileges for small to medium gas producers using
environment friendly technology. The “yellow certificates” system (then replaced
by the “guaranteed premium” under the Cogeneration Act) ensured additional
stable sources of proceeds. In addition, most of the natural gas deposits that were
discovered in various parts of Poland were too small for large upstream companies
to be interested in them.°

Furthermore, the Administrative Procedure Code and the Geological Law set strict
deadlines for the Authorities to observe. Because of this, even knowing that there
would inevitably be some delays caused by unforeseen circumstances, the expected
timeframe of the license proceedings seemed acceptable from the Claimants’
business perspective.°'*

In summary, the Claimants had legitimate expectations towards the Respondent and
its administrative bodies which justified the business concept of the Investment.
The above-described acts and omissions do not meet the standards of good-
government conduct, thus, they constitute a perfect textbook case of a breach of the
FETS

In the end, Claimants summarize the conduct alleged to have violated the applicable
FET standard:

e the Ministry did not observe the statutory deadlines for the completion of
administrative proceedings, thus, complete undermining the Claimants’
reasonable expectations as to when the licenses and other necessary
approvals would be issued which, in turn, affected the Claimants’ economic
projections;

e the Ministry assured Blue Gas Unik6w that the Unikéw Unified License
would allow it to undertake the works on the Unikow-2 well designed to
clean up the borehole and secure the gas flows but refused to confirm this
assurance in writing for the Regional Mining Office in Kielce;

e the Ministry’s unpredictable and unreasonable behavior in the Unikow
Project made it impossible to assume that similar problems would not occur
in Stanowice, Wrzosowo, Zakrzewo, Miedzyzdroje or Lelikow. The
situation in Unikow made the whole investment unpredictable which, from
a financial standpoint, had to be regarded as a serious risk factor financial

even though the Ministry prioritized the examination of the applications
allowing the investors to continue their operations, none of the Blue Gas
Group’s applications was considered as deserving of prioritization; on the
contrary, they were all considered as having “low urgency,” including Blue
Gas Unikow’s applications for the approval of the documentation allowing
this Company to continue works on the Unikéw-2 well and to move on to
the gas production phase as well as the application by Blue Gas Wrzosowo
to first amend its exploration license and subsequently to convert the
Wrzosowo Exploration License into a unified license;

. .. the Ministry refused to [] provide guidance for the Blue Gas Group’s
representatives so they could accelerate the various proceedings conducted
by the Ministry;

on numerous occasions, the Ministry went silent for up to ten months at a
time with no information about the status of the proceedings;

the Ministry did not respond to the letters in which the SPVs asked about
the status of the proceedings and reasons for them being delayed;

the SPVs could never tell when the proceedings would end or when the
requested decision would be issued because some of the Ministry’s
employees thought statutory deadlines were not binding;

whenever the Ministry informed the SPVs that the deadline for the
completion of given proceedings would be extended, the justification [] the
Ministry provided was neither reasonable nor truthful;

the Ministry provided either vague or no explanations at all as to why it did
not meet the deadlines for completing the proceedings and issuing the
requested decisions while setting new deadline[s] which it also failed to
observe due to its own misconduct; [and]

the Ministry kept summoning the SPVs to provide additional documentation
and explanations almost endlessly, sometimes up to 36 months after the

relevant proceedings had been initiated.°'®

Unreasonable and discriminatory measures

Given the general observation of the arbitral tribunal in Petrobart vs. Kyrgyzstan it
might be said that the obligation to protect investments against unreasonable or
discriminatory measures, including the guarantee of the national treatment and the
MEN and the FET standards, overlap. And it would be difficult to argue that the
Respondent’s actions, which could be perceived as discriminatory, should not be
classified as unfair and unequitable. That said, the Claimants decided to discuss this

subject separately in order to emphasize certain infringements attributable to the
Respondent.°!”

As stated in LG&E vs. Argentina “[i]n the context of investment treaties, and the
obligation thereunder not to discriminate against foreign investors, a measure is
considered discriminatory if the intent of the measure is to discriminate or if the
measure has a discriminatory effect. (...) in order to establish when a measure is
discriminatory, there must be (i) an intentional treatment (ii) in favour of a national
(iii) against a foreign investor, and (iv) that is not taken under similar
circumstances against another national.” The tribunal concluded that the
aforementioned prerequisites of declaring the host-State’s actions discriminatory
would have been met if the State had treated the gas-distribution companies (the
investors) in a discriminatory manner, imposing stricter measures on the gas-
distribution companies than other public-utility sectors.°!®

‘When deciding on the Investment, the Claimants were well aware that the Polish
gas market was dominated by PGNiG. However, PGNiG was too large to enter the
niche market in which the Claimants were interested. In addition, it was fair to
assume that this state of affairs would soon change as a result of the introduction of
the “exchange obligation” (the need to sell gas on the TGE) and the abolition of the
tariff regime for gas supplies. However, it transpired completely differently. The
Respondent’s primary policy became state control (and nationalization) over certain
industries, in particular the energy sector.°!?

The most evident examples of this policy are as follows:

e in November 2014, the Ministry revoked two licenses granted to a subsidiary
of Lumina Copper Corp. and allocated them to KGHM Polska Miedz S.A. (a
state-controlled company) which resulted in an investment arbitration being
instigated under the Polish-Canadian BIT;

e in May 2016, the Polish Parliament adopted a statute which effectively
suppressed the wind farm sector in Poland, and which resulted in multiple
disputes between the Respondent or state-owned companies and wind farm
owners, including the investment arbitration instigated by Invenergy LLC
underthe Polish-USA BIT;

e in July 2017, the Polish Parliament adopted new legislation on gas storages
which resulted in PGNiG becoming an effective monopolist on this market
(effectively preventing gas trading by foreign investors) and the EU
Commission commencing an investigation;

¢ in November 2017, Electricité de France S.A. (EDF) sold its Polish assets to
PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A., another state-controlled company;

in May 2018, the same PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. tried to take
over Polenergia S.A., one of the largest private electricity producers in Poland;

e in February 2019, another foreign investor, Prairie Mining Ltd., instigated
investment arbitration against Poland because of the Ministry’s (!) misconduct
regarding licenses for mining coal.°°

Admittedly, the Respondent’s policy does not amount to discrimination per se. But
when juxtaposed with publicly-available numbers regarding licenses for the
exploration, recognition and mining of hydrocarbon deposits it reveals a pattern. It
proves that the Ministry’s unlawful actions and omissions regarding the Blue Gas
Group were in fact intentional.°?!

The Ministry’s “disabilities” as described in the NIK Report did not seem to affect
PGNiG. On page 86 of its financial statement for 2017, PGNiG stated the following:

“As of 1 January 2017, the PGNiG Group held 53 licenses for the
recognition and exploration of crude oil and natural gas deposits. As of
31 December 2017, PGNiG held 48 licenses. In 2017, 33 administrative
proceedings regarding the prolongation, amendment or conversion of
licenses were concluded (a total of 21 licenses were converted). Forty
proceedings regarding the approval of appendices to PRG documentation
were also concluded. ”°?

On page 96 of the same financial statement, PGNiG observed the following:

“Both domestically and abroad there is a risk of competition from other
firms in terms of acquiring licenses for the recognition and exploration of
hydrocarbon deposits. However, it must be stated that this risk
significantly diminished over the past year on the domestic market. ””°”

PGNiG’s applications appear to have enjoyed maximum priority. If they had been
treated in the same way as the applications filed by the SPVs, the Ministry could
not have finished a total of 73 proceedings regarding licenses and PRG
Documentation. During this same time period, the Ministry settled fewer than ten
cases initiated by the SPVs.°*+

It is no coincidence that, as PGNiG observed, the risk of competition on the Polish
market diminished. This is because the Ministry eliminated PGNiG’s
competitors.°>

Such prioritization was even confirmed by Mr. Piotr Nowak in his witness
statement, in which he admitted that the SPVs were treated in a less favorable
manner than other applicants.*° This admission fits the statistics with respect to
those applications submitted by PGNiG as compared to the SPVs.°?7 Importantly,
there was no legal justification for this prioritization.°*® Issues such as staff
shortages are not an excuse for discrimination of foreign investors.°7

In summary, the Ministry’s actions and omissions, for which the Respondent is
liable, had discriminatory effects. They were intentional as they were part of the
Respondent’s policy in the energy sector. They favoured the national, state-
controlled PGNiG over foreign investors (the Claimants acting through the SPVs).
And no such measures were taken in similar circumstances against other national
operators. As of the end of 2017, the overwhelming majority of licenses were held
by either PGNiG or other state-controlled companies (e.g., Lotos Petrobaltic S.A.,
and Orlen Upstream sp. z 0.0.). The few remaining ones were either held by foreign
investors or were utterly insignificant.°°

The above remarks prove that the Respondent also failed to accord national
treatment to the Claimants. The Ministry failed to act in accordance with Art. 10(1)
of the ECT because the applications of the state-controlled “nationals” were
prioritized.°*!

4. Umbrella Clause

The last sentence of Art. 10(1) of the ECT contains an “umbrella clause” obligating
the Respondent to observe any obligations it has entered into with the Claimants or
the Investment. The traditional debate regarding similar clauses concentrates on the
type of obligations the relevant clause covers. Here, it is clear that the umbrella
clause applies.**

In SGS vs. Pakistan the arbitral tribunal concluded that “umbrella clauses” “are not
limited to contractual commitments. The commitments referred to may be embedded
in, e.g., the municipal legislative or administrative or other unilateral measures of
a Contracting Party.” In this context, the Respondent breached the obligations it

entered into by means of signing the agreements for the establishment of a mining
usufruct as well as issuing license No. 19/2009/L for the Unikéw project.°?

As shown, when granting a license, the Respondent, represented by the Minister of
the Environment, entered into the following agreements with the SPVs:

concerning license No. 1/2015/p, on 16 February 2015 the Respondent and
Blue Gas Unik6w entered into the agreement for the establishment of a mining
usufruct regarding the Wrzosowo natural gas deposit, which was assigned to
Blue Gas Wrzosowo on 9 November 2015;

© concerning unified license No. 19/2009/L, on 9 August 2016 the Respondent
and Blue Gas Unik6w entered into the agreement for the establishment of a
mining usufruct regarding the Unikow natural gas deposit; and

* concerning license No. 3/2017/p, on 12 May 2017 the Respondent and Blue
Gas Zakrzewo entered into the agreement for the establishment of a mining
usufruct regarding the Zakrzewo natural gas deposit.°*

Pursuant to Art. 354 of the Civil Code, the Respondent was obliged to act in good
faith, in particular to cooperate with the SPVs in the performance of their
obligations. The provision states:

“§ 1. A debtor should perform its obligation in accordance with its
substance an in a manner complying with its social and economic purpose
and the principles of community life, and if there is an established custom
in this respect, also in a manner complying with this custom.

§ 2. The creditor should cooperate in the same manner in the performance
of an obligation. ">

This means, as emphasized by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 25 February
2015, that both the debtor and the creditor are obliged to “look at the legitimate
interest of the contractor and not do anything that would complicate, hinder or
impede the performance of the obligation.” They should cooperate in order to
achieve the economic goal of the agreement.*°

Considering the facts of this case, it is apparent that the Respondent (the creditor)
not only did not cooperate with the SPVs in the performance of their contractual
obligations, but actually hampered them, and in some cases even blocked them,
negating the purpose for which the agreements were concluded. The Ministry's (i.e.,
the Respondent’s) behaviour was more inappropriate considering that it was just a

matter of whether the Ministry was willing to act in good faith, and not a matter of
actual ability to perform the agreements.°*”

The clearest example of a breach of the obligation to cooperate was the deferment
regarding the approval of the PRG Documentation and DGI Documentation for the
Unik6w Project. This completely blocked the possibility of obtaining an investment
decision specifying the conditions for extracting natural gas from the “Unikéw”
deposit and, as a result, Blue Gas Unik6éw’s ability to meet its obligations under the
agreement.©*

The same facts amount to a breach of the Respondent’s obligations under unified
license No. 19/2009/L. Undoubtedly, a license is an administrative decision
granting the licensee certain rights the acquisition of which is limited by law.
However, once such rights are granted, they must be mirrored by the obligations of
the licencing authority to facilitate the use of these rights.*?

The Ministry did exactly the opposite. Its inaction resulted in the observation made
by the Regional Mining Office in Kielce regarding the expiration of the deadline
for the recognition of the Unikéw deposit through Unikéw-2. The Ministry’s failure
to meet statutory deadlines for the conclusion of proceedings caused a situation in
which there was no legal requirement to continue recognizing the Unikow’s deposit
through Unikéw-2.°°

The Respondent contends that Claimants can not have umbrella clause claims
arising from the relevant agreements because the parties to the agreements were
Blue Gas Wrzosowo, Blue Gas Unikéw and Blue Gas Zakrzewo. However, the
authorities cited by Respondent do not refer to the ECT, Article 10(1) of which
explicitly reads that “Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has
entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other
Contracting Party.” Accordingly, the ECT umbrella clause covers agreements
concluded with both the investors and their subsidiaries which are covered by the
definition of “investment.” Here, the SPVs fall within that definition.™!

Claimants do not pursue any claims under the agreements which could otherwise
be adjudicated by Polish courts, contrary to Respondent’s contention.”

Given the importance of the Unikéw project to the entire Investment, it is fair to
say that the impairment of this project resulted in the eradication of the Investment.
The proceeds gained from the Unikéw license were to be reinvested in the other
projects so that the entire network could operate as one business entity. Destroying

the Unik6w project caused a chain reaction which could not be stopped or remedied
with the development of any other project.

Respondent’s Position

1. Fair and Equitable Treatment

Within their FET arguments, Claimants (i) advance the legitimate expectations
claim; (ii) generally claim that some of Respondent’s measures allegedly did not
meet some standards of good-government; and (iii) contend Respondent allegedly
failed to ensure transparency in the licence proceedings.°*

The international responsibility of a host state for a breach of the fair and equitable
treatment standard under the ECT is not triggered by any failure of host states, but
rather only when such failures are qualified as “gross” and “manifest.” It is well
established in the jurisprudence of the international investment tribunals that: “. . .
the issue of a high threshold of liability [with respect to the fair and equitable
treatment standard] provides assurance to host States that they will not be exposed
to international responsibility for minor malfunctioning of their agencies and that
only manifest and flagrant acts of maladministration will be punished.”>*

In the above context, Respondent submits that it is also well established in
investment case law that not every breach of domestic law amounts to a violation
of investment treaties. This was confirmed by the tribunal in Loewen vs United
States: “whether the conduct [of the host State] amounted to a breach of municipal
law as well as international law is not for us to determine. A NAFTA claim cannot
be converted into an appeal against decisions of [the host State].” Such approach
should be followed under the ECT.°

The scope of the standard presented in the Statement of Claim does not address the
issues relevant to this arbitration, i.e. (i) when legitimate expectations can actually
arise or (ii) which moment in time is relevant to establishing investor’s legitimate
expectations.”

In the above context, Respondent takes issue with the description of the legitimate
expectations standard in the Tecmed vs. Mexico case relied on by Claimants. As
opposed to Tecmed vs. Mexico, Respondent submits that the expectations must meet
certain clear criteria in order to be legitimate and thus protected under the ECT.“

First, it is widely established in investment case law that the legitimate expectations
have to be assessed at the time when the investment was made. The host state must
make a specific promise or assurance to a foreign investor and a foreign investor

must rely on such a promise or assurance. Finally, such reliance must be
reasonable.©!?

Second, the promise or assurance must be made by a competent authority or
representative of the respondent state. It may be explicit as well as implicit, as long
as the respondent state contributed to the creation of the legitimate expectations. A
foreign investor must have relied on such a promise or assurance when it made its
investment. The expectations of a foreign investor must be a determining factor for
a decision to make an investment. The reasonableness of the expectations depends
on the surrounding circumstances and factual background. What is more, the
reasonableness must be objective.°°

Against this background, Respondent asserts that Claimants’ claim concerning
legitimate expectations fails on at least multiple counts.°!

Firstly, and most importantly, Respondent made no specific promise or
representation to Claimants. In particular, Claimants could not have built their
legitimate expectations upon the law of general application. Such law did not imply
any specific representation of Respondent to Claimants.°?

Secondly, none of the Claimants established that they relied on any such promise
or representation of Respondent when deciding whether to make their alleged
investments. This alone is enough to defeat Claimants’ case.°°

Claimants rely on a statement of their witness, Jacek Strzelecki, who asserts that
“before pursuing the Investment, the Claimants analysed the Polish upstream gas
market.” In response, Respondent submits that no due diligence/feasibility reports
were included in the record of the case. The only “due diligence report” that
Claimants’ experts rely on is Exhibit CEG-1, i.e., a memorandum dated August
2015, entitled “Blue Gas N’R’G up to 100 MWe Gas Fired CHPs in Poland”
directed to the Blue Gas Group’s potential investors, which was not aimed to
replace such potential investors’ own due diligence. Irrespective of the content of
this “report,” none of Claimants could have reasonably relied on it when making
their decision to invest, at least due to the date of this “report.”°4

Claimants’ allegation about the allegedly non-transparent character of the
proceedings before the Ministry, allegedly confirmed by the Supreme Audit Office,
manifestly lacks relevance in the present case. Only the specific proceedings before
the Ministry concerning the Blue Gas Group’s Projects are relevant in this case, and
during such proceedings, the Blue Gas Group’s representatives manifestly ignored
applicable legal rules. In addition, (i) the Blue Gas Group had access to the files of

those proceedings; (ii) the Ministry’s officials were available for the Blue Gas
Group’s representatives by phone; (iii) meetings were held at the Ministry’s
premises to discuss the Blue Gas Group’s inquiries; and (iv) during the proceedings,
the Ministry responded to the Blue Gas Group’s written inquiries and/or letters
during concerning the Projects. Furthermore, the Supreme Audit Office’s Report
does not support Claimant’s allegations that the proceedings related to the Blue Gas
Group’s Projects, let alone all the proceedings before the Ministry related to
hydrocarbons, lacked transparency. Importantly, the scope of control performed by
the Supreme Audit Office was very limited and it did not include several types of
the relevant proceedings, such as (i) approvals of the DGI Documentation and (ii)
approvals of addendums to the PRG Documentation. In addition, Claimants fail to
demonstrate how the allegedly non-transparent nature of the relevant proceedings
translated into the corresponding decisions/rulings issued by the Ministry.
Claimants do not complain about the Ministry’s decisions granting the Blue Gas
Group, in particular: (i) the Unikéw exploration licence of 31 March 2009; (ii) the
unified Unik6ow licence of 9 August 2016; (iii) the approval dated 21 December
2017 of Addendum No. | to the PRG Documentation related to the unified Unikéw
licence of 9 August 2016; and (iv) the Wrzosowo exploration licence of 16 February
2015. In any case, Claimants do not explain whether they challenged the particular
decisions/rulings of the Ministry, inter alia, before the competent Polish
administrative courts and why the relevant awards/rulings of those courts, if any,
should be regarded as non-transparent.®>

It is incorrect for Claimants to contend that their alleged investments would have
enjoyed the support of Respondent in economic terms. Claimants’ claims do not
concern any changes to Respondent’s support system for the CHP projects, which
allegedly changed, contrary to some Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations.
The matter of the applicability of Respondent’s support to Claimants’ potential
CHP projects is only relevant for the purposes of Claimants’ causation/damages
theory, which is itself flawed.°

Claimants’ reliance on (i) the Polish Administrative Procedure Code and (ii) the
Geological and Mining Law remains undeveloped. Claimants’ legitimate
expectations again could not have been established on the basis of the law of general
application. Such law did not imply any specific representation of Respondent to
Claimants. Moreover, none of the Claimants established that they relied on the
respective provisions of the Polish Administrative Code or the Geological and
Mining Law the moment they made their decision to invest.°7

Claimants fail to support their contention that they relied on some “strict deadlines
for the Authorities to observe” as established by the Administrative Procedure Code
and the Geological and Mining Law. The relevant deadlines are in reality not strict
and they are not applicable in several situations, including, but not limited to, the
circumstances in which the delays are (i) due to fault/negligence of a party to the

administrative proceedings; (ii) due to participation in the administrative
proceedings of some consulting authorities, which is required under law; or (iii) due
to other reasons which are beyond control of an authority in charge of the
administrative proceedings. In addition, the deadlines provided for under the Polish
Administrative Procedure Code were inapplicable to the licence proceedings related
to the Blue Gas Group’s Projects due to the nature of those proceedings, which was
acknowledged by the Blue Gas Group in its correspondence to the Ministry.°**

In all, Claimants’ FET claim manifestly lacks merit. Even if the Ministry in some
cases did not comply with the relevant Polish law, it does not automatically translate
into a breach of the ECT. Only manifest and flagrant acts of maladministration are
relevant for the purposes of this international responsibility, which were not
remedied by exhaustion of available options, such as appeals to the Polish courts.
At the same time, Respondent notes that it also should not escape Tribunal’s
attention that the acquired rights obtained by the relevant companies of the Blue
Gas Group in the form of the licences concerning the relevant deposits were not
affected by the course of the proceedings before the Ministry. In this context,
Respondent also submits that the Blue Gas Group was, at all the relevant times, free
to perform the geological works foreseen under any and all the licences issued by
the Ministry, i.e., under (i) the Unikéw exploration licence of 31 March 2009; (ii)
the unified Unikéw licence of 9 August 2016; (iii) the Wrzosowo exploration
licence of 16 February 2015; and (iv) the Zakrzewo exploration licence of 12 May
2017:

2. Discrimination

It first must be noted that within the context of discrimination, Claimants discuss
other standards of protection, whose scopes do not overlap, i.e., National Treatment
(NT) and Most Favoured Nation Treatment (MFN). The conflating of these
concepts seems to imply that Claimants’ grievances relate only to alleged
discrimination of Claimants’ subsidiaries vis-a-vis Polish nationals, and not
investors from other countries. For this reason, the Respondents address solely the
claim resulting from the alleged breach of the NT standard.°°

Claimants’ contention here concerns primarily various unrelated acts, of various
branches of the Polish government, targeted at foreign investors. None of the facts
discussed relate to Claimants, Blue Gas Group companies or even gas extraction
industry. Among the alleged wrongdoings of Polish State, Claimants list the
following issues:

. Ordinary business transactions of Polish companies (such as the acquisition
of certain assets by a Polish company from a French state enterprise, EDF),

even when they were only planned and did not actually occur (the attempted
acquisition of Polenergia by PGE);

. Two disputes between Poland and foreign investors (concerning respectively
the investments in copper mining and wind farms), which are still pending
and in which no award establishing the violation of investment treaties was
issued;

. Misleading information about the alleged investment arbitration dispute
between Prairie Mining Ltd and Poland concerning the coal mining (in fact
no arbitration proceedings were instigated by the said company).!

Claimants admit that the above actions, “[do] not amount to the discrimination per
se.” Despite that admission, they contend that the actions “reveal the pattern” and
prove that Respondent’s actions regarding Blue Gas Group companies “were in fact
intentional.” Claimants lack any evidence suggesting that the length of
administrative proceedings instigated by the Blue Gas Group was the result of a
hidden discriminatory agenda targeted at foreign investors.°

It is well established in the investment case-law that an analysis to determine
whether discrimination occurred is based on three basic factors: (i) identification of
the relevant subjects for comparison; (ii) consideration of the relative treatment
each comparator receives; and (iii) consideration of whether any factors exist that
justify any deviation in the treatment.°

It should be also uncontested that the burden of proof with regard to the above
prerequisites of responsibility lies with Claimants.°*

With regard to the first factor (a relevant subject for comparison), it is widely held
that the subjects of comparison (“the comparators”) must be found to be “in like
circumstances” before considering any unfavourable treatment. The comparison
should be made between Claimants and their commercial competitors (domestic
investors or investments operating in the same sector). As noted by the Total
tribunal:

“In order to determine whether the treatment is discriminatory, it is

necessary to compare the treatment challenged with the treatment of

persons or things in a comparable situation. In economic matters the
criterion of “like situation” or “similarly-situated” is widely followed
because it requires the existence of some competitive relation between
those situations compared that should not be distorted by the State’s
intervention against the protected foreigner. ”°°

The only company mentioned by Claimants which possibly could be treated as a
comparator to Blue Gas Group Companies is PGNiG. While PGNiG is an
entrepreneur operating, among others, on the market of gas extraction, it can hardly
be treated as Blue Gas Group’s competitor sensu stricto. Even Claimants admit that
they intended to operate on the niche market, and that PGNiG, being too large to
enter, was not interested in that niche.°°

Concerning the second factor (relative treatment each comparator receives),
Claimants contend that PGNiG’s applications were given maximum priority by the
Ministry, while the proceedings instigated by Blue Gas Group were seriously
protracted.°”

It transpires that the entire discrimination claim relies on two short passages taken
from PGNiG’s financial statement for 2017. As indicated in that document, on 1
January 2017, PGNiG Group held 53 licences for the recognition and exploration
of crude oil and natural gas deposits. As of 31 December 2017, the number of
licences declined to 48. In 2017, 33 administrative proceedings regarding the
prolongation, amendment or conversion of licences, as well as 40 proceedings
regarding the approval of Addendums to PRG documentation, were concluded. The
document does not state how long the proceedings lasted, i.e. it does not specify if
they were instigated in 2017 or earlier. For this reason, Claimants’ allegation that
PGNiG’s proceedings were conducted more smoothly by the Ministry than the
similar proceedings instigated by the Blue Gas Group companies lacks any
evidentiary basis.°°*

It is also illegitimate to compare the number of licences held by PGNiG and the
Blue Gas Group in support of the contention that Poland systematically
discriminates against foreign investors. PGNiG has existed for nearly 40 years and
was ranked Sth among the biggest companies in 2017 in the whole CEE region.
PGNiG’s position on the market is therefore a result of several decades of
development and not recent actions of Polish authorities. Moreover, as transpires
from PGNiG’s financial statement, in 2017, the number of licences held by the
PGNiG Group actually declined by nearly 10%.”

Ex abundante cautela, it should also be observed that, even if the average time of
the proceedings instigated by PGNiG was shorter than in the case of the Blue Gas
Group, this alone is insufficient to prove the preferential treatment of this company.
It would be necessary to analyse the record of each case in order to establish
whether the proceedings were similar enough to be compared.°””

The length of the administrative proceedings is determined by a number of factors,
such as the type and scope of the application, the complexity of the factual and legal

background, the quality of the applications and of the accompanying
documentation, etc.°”!

Moreover, as pointed out by the Toral tribunal, in order to succeed with a
discrimination claim, an investor has to prove that different treatment between
foreign and national investors, who are similarly situated or in like circumstances,
must be nationality-driven. Claimants do not provide evidence in this respect.°”>
Claimants contend that the witness statement of Mr. Piotr Nowak is such evidence,
as he explained that during the heavy workload in 2016, the Department of Geology
and Geological Licenses was forced to prioritize certain applications. However, the
decision on how to prioritize was based on objective, non-discriminatory criteria,
i.e., priority was given to the extension of licences that were about to expire.°”*

Mr. Nowak did not state that the applications of the Blue Gas Group Companies
were generally deemed less urgent. Rather, he highlighted one example, Blue Gas
Unikow’s application for approval of Addendum No. | to the PRG Documentation,
which was deemed less urgent for the justified reason that the applicant informed
the Ministry that the relevant works were optional and that it had yet to make a
decision whether to undertake them.°+

3. Umbrella Clause

Claimants invoke the alleged breach of three agreements for the establishment of a
mining usufruct (“Agreements”) as the basis for their umbrella clause claim,
namely (1) the agreement of 9 August 2016 regarding the Unikéw gas deposit (the
“Unikow Agreement”); (2) the agreement of 12 May 2017 regarding the Wrzosowo
gas deposit (the “Wrzosowo Agreement”); and (3) the agreement of 16 February
2015 (the “Zakrzewo Agreement”).°”>

At the outset, it should be noted that all the Agreements contain a forum selection
clause, granting exclusive jurisdiction for the resolution of the disputes resulting
therefrom to the Polish common court competent for the seat of the Ministry.
Accordingly, the claims related to the alleged breach of the Agreements, absent the
judgement of a Polish court declaring that such breach occurred, cannot be
successfully pursued in investment arbitration on the basis of an umbrella clause.°”®

Claimants contend that they are not pursuing any claims under the relevant
agreements which could otherwise be adjudicated by Polish courts, but this claim
is logically flawed as the umbrella clause concerns an alleged breach of contract
(ruled by domestic law), which is then elevated to international law. If there is no

contractual claim based on Polish law, possible to be pursued before Polish courts,
there is nothing to elevate to a treaty breach by means of an umbrella clause.°””

686. In the case Toto Costruzioni Generali v. Lebanon, the arbitral tribunal observed:

“Although Article 9.2 of the Treaty may be used as a mechanism for the
enforcement of claims, it does not elevate pure contractual claims into
treaty claims. The contractual claims remain based upon the contract; they
are governed by the law of the contract and may be affected by the other
provisions of the contract. In the case at hand that implies that they remain
subject to the contractual jurisdiction clause and have to be submitted
exclusively to the Lebanese courts for settlement. Because of this
jurisdiction clause in favour of Lebanese courts, the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction over the contractual claims arising from the contract referring
disputes to Lebanese courts.”°”*

687. Similar conclusions were reached by the arbitral tribunal in SGS v. Philippines:

“(T]he Tribunal should not exercise its jurisdiction over a contractual
claim when the parties have already agreed on how such a claim is to be
resolved, and have done so exclusively. SGS should not be able to
approbate and reprobate in respect of the same contract: if it claims under
the contract, it should comply with the contract in respect of the very
matter which is the foundation of the claim. The Philippine courts are
available to hear SGS’s contract claim.”*”

688. Also, the tribunal in Bosh v. Ukraine stated that, in the presence of a valid forum
selection clause in the contract, the tribunal was not competent to establish whether
there was a breach of the umbrella clause:

“The Tribunal takes the position that in order to present a contractual
claim under the umbrella clause in the BIT, the Claimants (here B&P) are
required to have their rights and obligations under the 2003 contract
determined by the applicable dispute settlement forum, i.e., in accordance
with Article 13(1) of the 2003 Contract, which refers the parties to dispute
settlement ‘in accordance with Ukrainian legislation’. In other words,
B&P is obliged to follow the dispute settlement provision included in the
2003 Contract.”°*°

The SGS v. Pakistan and BIVAC v. Paraguay tribunals also endorsed the idea that a
tribunal should honor a forum selection clause, and that a tribunal cannot resolve
an alleged breach of the relevant contract that contains such a clause.°*!

Respondent therefore respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal declare
Claimants’ umbrella clause claims inadmissible, or, alternatively, to declare that the
Tribunal is devoid of jurisdiction with respect to these claims.”

Even assuming, arguendo, that the claims based on an umbrella clause are within
the ambit of the jurisdiction of Tribunal and admissible, Claimants cannot invoke
the Agreements as a legal basis for their claims. The reason for this is simple:
Claimants were not the parties to the Agreements and therefore acquired no rights
stemming therefrom. The only entities which could possibly raise the claims related
to the alleged breach of the Agreements are the relevant Blue Gas Group’s
companies.**

Claimants contend that they can indeed pursue these claims under the wording of
the ECT, but the jurisprudence on this issue indicates otherwise. Such cases
demonstrate that national law determines the obligor and oblige in a contractual
relationship, and an umbrella clause does not alter this, allowing an investor to
pursue claims which are not its own.°**

In order to establish whether the host state breached its “obligation” within the
meaning of the umbrella clause, it is necessary to resort to the law governing that
obligation, i.e. municipal law. In the case at hand, the agreements allegedly
breached by Respondent were of course governed by Polish law. It is also clear that,
both under general provisions of Polish law and the plain meaning of the
Agreements, the Agreements conferred no rights on third parties, including the
shareholders of the parties thereto.

On numerous occasions, investment arbitral tribunals have confirmed that an
umbrella clause does not allow a shareholder to pursue contractual claims of its
subsidiary. For example, the Burlington v. Ecuador tribunal observed:

“In this case, the PSCs are governed by Ecuadorian law. It is that law that
defines the content of the obligation including the scope of and the parties
to the undertaking, i.e., the obligor and the obligee. Applying these two
elements to this case, one cannot but conclude that the umbrella clause
does not protect obligations arising from the PSCs. Whose right is
correlated to the obligation? The answer is found in the law governing the
obligation, here Ecuadorian law. Burlington has not alleged, not to speak

of established, that under Ecuadorian law the non-signatory parent of a
contract party may directly enforce its subsidiary’s rights, "°°

In the same vein, the Annulment Committee in CMS v. Argentina explained:

“The effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which
is relied on into something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected,
as is its proper law. If this is so, it would appear that the parties to the
obligation (i.e., the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are
likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause. °°’

The reasoning of the Burlington decision was endorsed by the arbitral tribunal in
WNC Factoring v. Czech Republic, while the WNC Factoring tribunal further
stated:

“To summarise, the Claimant’s contention that there is no requirement of
privity in relation to umbrella clauses finds no authoritative support in the
case law of international investment tribunals. To the contrary, tribunals
have rather consistently resolved that they have no jurisdiction under
umbrella clauses to consider contractual obligations between host states
and investors’ locally incorporated subsidiaries. °**

Even if these umbrella claims do not fail for reasons of jurisdiction or admissibility,
the claims belong solely to the respective Blue Gas Group companies and not
Claimants themselves.°”

With respect to the merits, it must first be noted that Claimants failed to identify the
precise contractual provisions allegedly breached by Respondent. They invoke only
the provisions of Polish Civil Code regarding the performance of the obligations in
good faith.

The alleged breached was also indicated only vaguely. Claimants state that “the
clearest, though not the only, example of a breach of the obligation to cooperate
was the deferment regarding the approval of the PRG Documentation and DGI
Documentation for the Unikéw Project.”®!

Claimants fail to point out that the Unikéw Agreement does not mention any
obligations on the part of the State Treasury regarding the approval of the PRG and
DGI Documentation. It is also not an implied obligation of the State Treasury. The
issuance of the licence (and consequently also the execution of the agreement on
the mining usufruct), does not guarantee that the PRG or DGI Documentation will
be accepted. Moreover, the agreement, being a private law instrument, could not

create obligations with regard to acta iure imperii, i.e., a guarantee that the Ministry
will issue an administrative decision approving the PRG and DGI documentation.

In the absence of a clear contractual provision imposing on Respondent an
obligation to approve the PRG and DGI Documentation, Claimants rely solely on
the Polish statutory provision regarding the performance of obligations in good
faith. Under Polish civil law, a requirement to perform an obligation (and to
cooperate in its performance) in good faith plays only a subordinate role in respect
of the performance in line with the “substance” of the obligation. In other words,
good faith does not override clear meaning of the agreement and cannot create new
obligations in contravention to this meaning. Good faith is not, as Claimants seem
to suggest, a sufficient ground for introducing into the agreement brand new
obligations which were not contemplated by the parties thereto.

An analysis conducted from the perspective of public international law leads to
similar conclusions. While it is generally accepted that good faith is one of the
fundamental principles of international law, it is also recognised that good faith is
not a freestanding source of any obligations which may give rise to claims for its
violation. In Vigotop v. Hungary, the tribunal found that:

“\.. the principle of good faith, whether under Hungarian law or under
international law, informs the manner in which an international or, in the
case of Hungarian law a contractual, obligation is to be performed, but it
is not in itself an independent source of obligations. ”°*

Claimants’ contentions regarding the alleged “deferment” of the approval of the
PRG and DGI documentation for the Unikéw Project are unsubstantiated.°>

Claimants indicate no breaches of the Wrzosowo Agreement and Zakrzewo
Agreement, despite identifying these agreements as legal basis of their claim.°

19/2009/E [Respondents understands that Claimants refer to the Unikéw
exploration licence of 31 March 2009 and unified Unikéw licence of 9 August
2016] due to the protraction of the administrative proceedings, the deadline for the
recognition of the Unikéw deposit through the Unikéw-2 well expired. Claimants’
contentions do not constitute the violation of any of the conditions set out in the
licence (which unequivocally stated the short time limit for using the Unikow-2
well), but rather the failure to amend it.”

706. Moreover, Claimants fail to mention two facts crucial to understanding the reasons
of this situation:

707.

1.

The date of 31 December 2016 as the deadline for the test production was
chosen by Claimants and not Respondent;

It was only on 18 July 2017 (i.e. more than half a year after the lapse of the
said time limit) that Blue Gas Unikéw decided to apply for approval of
Addendum No.1 to the PRG documentation concerning reconstruction and
test production via the Unikéw-2 well;

The PRG documentation was accepted by the Ministry without undue delay
(after receiving necessary explanations from the applicant and conducting the
consultations with local authorities prescribed by applicable law) in the
decision of 21 December 2017.

Tribunal’s Decisions

Fair and Equitable Treatment

In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants particularised their case on the breach of Art.
10(1) ECT around three concepts set out in the first sentence of that provision: the
encouragement and creation of (i) stable, (ii) favourable and (iii) transparent
conditions for Investors to make Investments in Poland. The Respondent has
contested whether the first sentence of Art. 10(1) ECT imposes any freestanding
obligations upon a host State and cites [solux v Spain and Novenergia v Spain in
this context.” The Tribunal will return to that issue if necessary in its assessment
of Claimants’ claim.

708. In relation to “stable conditions”, Claimants summarised their case as follows:

8 Jd., P 685.

- the Ministry did not observe the statutory deadlines for the completion
of administrative proceedings, thus, completely undermining the
Claimants’ reasonable expectations as to when the licences and other
necessary approvals would be issued which, in turn, affected the
Claimants’ economic projections....

- the Ministry assured Blue Gas Unikow that the Unikow Unified
Licence would allow it to undertake the works on the Unikow-2 well
designed to clean up the borehole and secure the gas flows (as these
works were in a scope of the Licence) but refused to confirm this
assurance in writing for the Regional Mining Office in Kielce...

- the Ministry’s unpredictable and unreasonable behaviour in the
Unikow Project made it impossible to assume that similar problems

133

Bilaga 1

would not occur in Stanowice, Wrzosowo, Zakrzewo, Miedzyzdroje or
Lelikow. The situation in Unikow made the whole Investment
unpredictable which, from a financial standpoint, had to be regarded
as a serious risk factor for financial institutions (e.g. mBank S.A.); it
meant an exponential increase in regulatory risk.”

709. The Tribunal observes that the first paragraph of this submission relates to delay.
The second relates to a particular incident in respect of Blue Gas Unikow, which
will be considered below. The third paragraph is an inference that Claimants draw
from their allegations in respect of the Blue Gas Unikow project, which is
contingent upon making good those allegations (and thus succeeds or fails
depending on that).

710. In relation to “favourable conditions”, Claimants said the following in the Post-
Hearing Brief:

— even though the Ministry prioritised the examination of the applications
allowing the investors to continue their operations... none of the Blue Gas
Group’s applications was considered as deserving of prioritisation; on the
contrary, they were all considered as having “low urgency”, including
Blue Gas Unikow’s applications for the approval of the documentation
allowing this company to continue works on the Unikow-2 well and to
move on to the gas production phase as well as the application by Blue
Gas Wrzosowo first amend its exploration licence and subsequently to
convert the Wrzosowo Exploration Licence into a unified (exploration and
production) licence;

— as evidenced by Mr Piotr Nowak’s testimonies, the Ministry refused
even to provide guidance for the Blue Gas Group's representatives so they
could accelerate the various proceedings conducted by the Ministry."

711. These allegations all relate to delay in the administrative proceedings.

712. Finally, under the heading of “transparent conditions”, Claimants state as follows
in their Post-Hearing Brief:

— on numerous occasions, the Ministry went silent for up to ten months at
a time with no information about the status of the proceedings...;

— the Ministry did not respond to the letters in which the SPVs asked about
the status of the proceedings and reasons for them being delayed;

— the SPVs could never tell when the proceedings would end or when the
requested decision would be issued because some of the Ministry’s
employees thought statutory deadlines were not binding...;

71 Td. J 88.

134

713.

714.

715.

716.

717.

— whenever the Ministry informed the SPVs that the deadline for the
completion of given proceedings would be extended, the justification
(rationale) the Ministry provided was neither reasonable nor truthful;

— the Ministry provided either vague or no explanations at all as to why it
did not meet the deadlines for completing the proceedings and issuing the
requested decisions while setting new deadline which it also failed to
observe due to its own misconduct;

— the Ministry kept summoning the SPVs to provide additional
documentation and explanations almost endlessly, sometimes up to 36
months after the relevant proceedings had been initiated.

Once again, these allegations all relate to delay in the administrative proceedings.

The fact that this case in essence boils down to delays in administrative proceedings
is also apparent from Claimants’ summary of their position in the introduction to
their Post-Hearing Brief. Specifically, Claimants provide the following brief
summary of how Respondent’s actions caused the loss of the Investment:

e The administrative proceedings conducted by the Authorities lagged beyond
any measure of reasonableness, let alone statutory deadlines, which should
be determined from the perspective of international public law;

e The delays were unjustified insofar as [] they resulted from various
circumstances created or under the control of the Respondent and they
could not have been induced by the Claimants;

e In consequence, the entire enterprise lost its economic purpose and had to
be shut down to minimize the Claimants’ losses.””

Within its overall claim of delay, Claimants contend that a breach of the ECT occurs
if a license such as those in question in this arbitration is not granted after one

year.”°3

Before continuing, it is important to understand why Claimants are in a sense forced
into this contention in this particular case.

On 31 October 2017, Claimants filed for the bankruptcy of Blue Gas Unikéw,
which they have consistently contended was the end of the Investment. Obviously,
therefore, the relevant breach(es) must have occurred before that event in order for
there to be a causal link between the alleged breach and damage to the Investment.
On the other hand, Claimants agreed that only events beginning September 2015
could be considered as elements pertaining to a breach of the ECT.” On Claimants’
case there is, therefore, a window of approximately 25 months for the numerous

events pleaded in respect of each project to have risen to the level of a breach of the

719. In interpreting this graph, it is important to note what the indicated timeframes mean

706 Hearing Transcript Day 5, 141:

(e.g., 13 months for “Unikow — Conversion to the Unified License”). While
answering questions during closing statements, Claimants clarified that the yellow
segments correspond to the one-year period from the initiation of each relevant
application.”° Importantly, the timeframes indicated refer to the total time of the
initial one-year yellow segment plus the additional red time that elapsed.”
Therefore, for example, the 13 months for “Unikéw Conversion to the Unified
License” is 13 months from the application.

720. It is clear from this graph why Claimants ultimately adopted the “one year plus one
day” theory for the breach of the ECT by delay. In the critical Unikéw applications,
the applicable timeframes were 14 months or less, with some of those timeframes
falling on the wrong side of the 31 October 2017 bankruptcy for Claimants to
establish causation.

721. Asa result, during the hearing, Claimants’ explicitly put forth a theory of breach,

according to which a breach of the ECT occurs after one year has elapsed from a
relevant application.”°°

In communicating this theory, Claimants acknowledge that this one-year timeframe
is unrelated to Polish statutory deadlines, as such deadlines actually require periods
much shorter than one year. Instead, by selecting one year as the relevant time
period, Claimants contend they are trying to be reasonable and account for
flexibility.”

Claimants have also taken the position that their own conduct cannot be considered
in evaluating the delay as represented above, as Claimants necessarily must work
within the Polish system, meeting applicable statutory deadlines, or otherwise face
rejection as opposed to unjustified delay.”!° Accordingly, they contend that the
continuation of any such proceedings demonstrates they were working properly
within the Polish system.”!!

A threshold legal question thus arises. Assuming Claimants’ own conduct is
irrelevant to the assessment of the delay in issuing licenses, is the proposition that
a breach of fair and equitable treatment under Art. 10(1) of the ECT occurs if a
license is not granted after one year correct as a matter of international law?

It is true, as the Claimants maintain, that the ECT itself and previous arbitration
awards under the ECT do not provide concrete guidance as to when excessive
delays in processing administrative applications by state authorities meet the
threshold of unfair and inequitable treatment under Art. 10(1).

There is no doubt that extreme delay in processing applications for administrative
permits may very well amount to a breach of FET in the ECT context. But it is not
possible to settle upon a particular length of time, in the abstract, that will trigger
international responsibility. Context is everything. A delay of one-year to approve
the release of urgent medical supplies might amount to a violation of human rights,
whereas the same delay in processing a complex application to undertake a sensitive
mining project is unlikely to be a breach of international investment law unless there
are particular aggravating circumstances.

And it is precisely because context is everything that it is also impermissible to
disregard Claimants’ own conduct in an examination of the administrative
proceedings in question.

The Tribunal cannot, therefore, accept the two fundamental premises of Claimants’
case on breach of Art. 10(1) of the ECT. First, it cannot endorse an abstract rule
that when an application for a licence remains pending for more than a year then
the State is internationally responsible. There is no reason in principle and certainly
no authority in support of such a rule. To the contrary, the fault-based standards of
liability under the ECT require an assessment of the Respondent’s actions in their
proper context to determine whether delays in the administrative process may or
may not be justified on the basis of the objective circumstances. Second, the

conduct of Claimants is an essential factor in this analysis and the Tribunal cannot
simply disregard this conduct on the hypothesis that the Polish authorities would
have discontinued the licence-application procedures if Claimants had not complied
with the statutory requirements. Just as the statutory deadlines are not dispositive
in respect of a claim for actionable delay under the ECT, the conduct of Claimants
cannot be made irrelevant in applying the international standard simply because it
was not sanctioned by the Polish authorities.

The Tribunal now turns to the administrative proceedings relating to Blue Gas
Unikow. It will be recalled that Claimants filed for the bankruptcy of Blue Gas
Unikow on 31 October 2017.’!? It will further be recalled that the success of Blue
Gas Unikow was essential to the financial feasibility of the other projects:
Claimants intended to finance those other projects from the revenues generated by
Blue Gas Unikow.

Blue Gas Unikow applied for the conversion of its Exploration Licence into a
Unified Licence on 10 July 2015.’° The Ministry notified Blue Gas Unikow that
the conversion proceedings had commenced on 11 September 2015 after the formal
deficiencies in the application had been rectified’!* (a modified application had
been sent by Blue Gas Unikow on 4 September 2015).”!> The decision granting the
conversion was rendered on 9 August 2016.7'° In the process of rendering this
decision, the Ministry had completed the investigation phase by January 2016 and
had requested that Blue Gas sign and resend the mining usufruct agreement to the
Ministry, which it did on 11 February 2016.7!’ According to Claimants, “[t]his
means that after February 2016 the Ministry had no reason whatsoever to abstain
from issuing a decision”.’'* But taking Claimants’ case at its highest on this point,
that only amounts to inaction on the part of the Ministry of some six months. The
Respondent, moreover, contests Claimants’ inference that there was such inaction.
It refers to the issues raised by the Ministry’s Department of Geological Supervision
in respect of points 8 and 12a of the Unikow exploration licence, which required
action on Claimants’ part, which is evidenced by a series of letters in March 2016.7!”
Furthermore, a legal issue relating to the financial security that needed to be
provided in respect of obligations to be performed under unified licences arose and
the Ministry sought a legal opinion to ensure that all applicants would be treated in
the same way. That legal opinion was issued on 18 April 2016.”° Thus, on the
Respondent’s submission, the period of inactivity was only three months (from May
2016 to August 2016) and that was caused by the Ministry’s employees being
occupied with the audit performed by the Supreme Audit Office and the

implementation of an EU Directive.’”?! But regardless of whether there was 3

months or 6 months of inactivity, the Tribunal cannot possibly conclude that the
Respondent violated Art. 10(1) on that basis.

Blue Gas Unikow then filed an application for approval of a newly designed 3D
seismic survey for areas within and outside the area covered by the Unikow Unified
Licence on 24 August 2016.’ This application related to seismic works that Blue
Gas Unikow intended to perform (but had not yet committed to performing). The
pendency of this application did not have any impact on Blue Gas Unikow’s ability
to unblock the Unikow-2 well, the problems with which started in May 2016.’ It
is thus difficult to fathom how any delays relating to this application could have
caused Claimants to abandon Blue Gas Unikow. In any event, the Ministry sent a
letter on 22 September 2016 by which it raised several issues in respect of the
applicable regulations.”*+ Blue Gas Unikow then responded on 10 October 2016.’°
The Ministry then affirmed its original objection to Blue Gas Unikow’s plans for
3D seismic surveys on 18 January 2017.76

Blue Gas Unikow then submitted a modified application on 18 July 2017, which
was directed to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Unikow-2 well in order
to resume gas production.’”’ This application was in the form of Addendum No. 1
to the PRG Documentation. Claimants could have submitted this application
immediately after Blue Gas Unikow had received the Unified Licence on 9 August
2016 and yet they waited until July 2017. According to the Respondent, it would
have been impossible for Blue Gas Unikow to receive the four regulatory approvals
to start the works on Unikow-2 well before Claimants put Blue Gas Unikow into
bankruptcy on 31 October 2017.

Following requests for further information and rectifications sent by the Ministry
on 10 August 20177* and 15 September 2017,’ to which Blue Gas Unikow
responded on 5 October 2017,’*° the Ministry then forwarded a draft decision on
the approval of Addendum No. | to the Unikow PRG Documentation to the relevant
authorities for their opinion on 13 November 2017.”! The decision granting
approval was given on 21 December 2017.7*7

Blue Gas Unikow further filed an application for the approval of the Unikow DGI
Documentation on 8 September 2016,”> which was necessary to move to the

production phase and to be able to extract gas from the Unikow deposit using the
Unikow-2 well after 31 December 2016 following the completion of the production
test. According to the Respondent, four regulatory decisions were also required
from different competent authorities (including the Mineral Resources Commission
and the Polish Geological Institute) and Claimants had only applied to the Ministry
for the first decision.’* Claimants say that they had anticipated that the production
test of the Unikow-2 well would be completed by 31 December 2016,’*> but this
was clearly unrealistic in light of the regulatory requirements for approval of the
DGI Documentation.

The Ministry sent a letter to Blue Gas Unikow concerning its application on 4
November 20177*° and 2 December 2017.’*’ A hearing to discuss the DGI Unikow
Documentation was scheduled on 15 December 2016 with the Mineral Resources
Commission.”** This was followed up with a letter from the Commission to the
Ministry on 20 December 2016, which contained a series of recommendations.”*?
Blue Gas Unikow submitted revised DGI Documentation on 16 March 2017. The
Ministry then pointed out deficiencies with the revised documentation (most
notably in relation to the absence of proof concerning its right to the geological
information underlying the documentation) on 15 May 2017.”*° Claimants did not
seek to rectify those deficiencies and the application remained unprocessed as a
result. Blue Gas Unikow was notified of this on 24 May 2017.”! This was further
confirmed in the Ministry’s letter to Blue Gas Unikow of 27 July 2017.7

Meanwhile a meeting between Blue Gas Unikow and the Ministry took place on 4
July 2017 at which the deficiencies in the DGI Documentation were again discussed
(principally the absence of proof concerning Blue Gas Unikow’s right to the
geological information underlying the documentation).”? Following further
correspondence between the parties, the Ministry then received an opinion from one
of the members of the Mineral Resource Commission on this issue on 8 September
2017.4 This was later confirmed to be the opinion shared by the Commission as
a whole on 18 September 2017.

The Tribunal cannot conclude from this brief survey of the administrative
proceedings relating to Blue Gas Unikow that the Respondent’s conduct reached
the threshold of inordinate delay that would justify a finding of international
responsibility under Art. 10(1) ECT. Furthermore, the Tribunal cannot draw a
causal connection between any delay in these administrative proceedings and the

failure to unblock the Unikow-2 well so that production could be restarted and
revenues be generated. Blue Gas Unikow did not apply for the approval of modified
Addendum No. 1| to the Unikow PRG Documentation until 18 July 2017. This was
one regulatory route to performing the necessary works to the Unikow-2 well albeit
it was by no means a straightforward one and the Tribunal is satisfied that it would
not have been possible to obtain the relevant approvals before Blue Gas Unikow
was put into liquidation in October 2017. Another more promising regulatory route
would have been for Blue Gas Unikow to request that the deadline for completion
of the test production at the Unikow-2 well be set for after 31 December 2016 in its
original application for conversion of the exploration licence into a unified licence.
This it could have done before the Ministry approved the conversion on 9 August
2016. For this reason, Claimants’ reliance on the report of the Regional Mining
Office in Kielce to the effect that the production test of the Unikow-2 well could
only be performed until 31 December 20167 is a red herring because it was
Claimants’ regulatory strategy that resulted in that impasse. It is also not the
Respondent’s fault that Claimants apparently discovered only on 26-28 April 2017
during the inspection performed by the Regional Mining Office that the works on
the Unikow-2 well could only be performed if the Ministry approved the DGI
Documentation”® as this was a clear requirement under Polish law. In any case, it
appears from Blue Gas Unikow’s own correspondence that it was well aware of that
requirement much earlier.’*”

Claimants placed particular significance™* on the fact that the Regional Mining
Office in Kielce stated in its letter of 27 June 2017”? that the works designed to
clean out the Unikow-2 well could be possible if the Ministry confirmed in writing
that this was permissible in circumstances where neither the DGI Unikow
Documentation nor Addendum No. | to the Unikow PRG Documentation had been
approved. But it was not incumbent upon the Ministry to give an approval outside
the standard administrative procedures; indeed, it may well have been a violation
of the applicable regulations to do so.

As a matter of causation, it seems more likely than not that the real reason that the
Claimants abandoned Blue Gas Unikow in October 2017 by placing it into
bankruptcy was the fact that the Unikow-2 well could not be exploited in a manner
that was financially feasible.

The problems at the Unikow-2 well started in May 2016 and production ceased
altogether in October 2016. There were several attempts to unblock the well in
2016 and 2017.”° The Claimants’ expert, Dr Moy, describes the situation as
follows:

[The well] was cleaned and rinsed with fresh water and production
resumed on 31st May; however, salt continued to be an issue and the well
was shut-in again on 24: June; both the facilities and the Unikow-2
production tubing had to be cleaned and rinsed with fresh water.
Production resumed on 28tn June, but the well had to be shut-in for a third
time on 16m July for further cleaning. Production re-started on 25: August
[over a month later] and continued until 30 August. A service company
was employed to use coiled tubing (CT) to clear out the production tubing
within the well using a 15% solution of HCL. The well was placed back
into production but was finally shut-in on 29: October 2016.7!

It is critical that just two weeks before Blue Gas Unikow was put into liquidation
by Claimants, they received a report on 14 October 2017 that it had commissioned
from a mining expert, Mr Mularczyk. He concluded that the planned works at the
Unik6w-2 well were “burdened with a high technical risk, and the result of salt
swilling out as well as the final effect in the form of liquids inflow, their type and
volume, remain a great unknown. This has to be weighed against the possible costs
and benefits to be gained, if any.” He further concluded that “[i]t is highly probable
that the most productive part of the zone of Unikéw-2 well influence has been
largely exploited”.’

In preparing this report, Mr Mularczyk relied upon the documentation that Blue Gas
Unikow’s services company, Naftech, had prepared earlier that year on 15 March
2017.7 But in this respect it is also important to note that Blue Gas Unikow’s
contractor, Exalo Drilling, had not been able to submit a final proposal to Blue Gas
Unikow to carry out the works. The evidence shows that they were in
communication in July and August 2017.’4 Indeed, on 30 October 2017, the day
before the Claimants put Blue Gas Unikow into liquidation, Exalo Drilling send the
following message to Blue Gas Unikow:

First of all, I'm sorry that we didn't write a specific proposal for the
borehole. Imake no secret of the fact that we have a lot of current projects.
Practically, we are carrying out the project after the project on an ongoing
basis. Due to the fact that the borehole is very difficult to come up with an
unambiguous proposal, bearing in mind, on the one hand, the costs, on the
other hand, the maximum possibility of exploiting the deposit, we made a
meeting where we considered several ideas. Taking all pros and cons into
account the most optimal proposition for the borehole would be to
reconstruct it.””°

The Tribunal finds that the likely reason that the Claimants put Blue Gas Unikow
into bankruptcy on 31 October 2017 was their receipt of information during the

same month to the effect that: (i) the planned works to unblock the Unikow-2 well
were fraught with technical risk; (ii) the most productive part of the well was likely
to have already been exploited; and (iii) the most optimal approach to exploiting
the well would be to reconstruct it, with all the costs that would entail.7*°

For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants’ claim based upon
the FET standard under Art. 10(1) ECT. There was no inordinate delay on the part
of the Respondent’s organs during the administrative procedures involving Blue
Gas Unikow and therefore no breach of the ECT. The reason that Blue Gas Unikov
could not generate revenue and the reason for which it was ultimately put into
bankruptcy by Claimants are likely to have been unrelated to the administrative
procedures in so far as the Unikow-2 well was blocked and it was unlikely to be
profitable given the probable costs involved in dealing with the technical problems.
As the success of the Blue Gas Unikov was critical to the development of the other
projects, as it was to be the source of finance, it follows that Claimants’ decision to
put Blue Gas Unikow into bankruptcy effectively ended those other projects as well.

2. Discrimination

Respondent is correct that Claimants primarily base their discrimination allegation
on limited information concerning licenses held by PGNiG. Specifically, Claimant
primarily relies on the following:

e On page 86 of its financial statement for 2017, PGNiG stated the following:
“As of I January 2017, the PGNiG Group held 53 licenses for the
recognition and exploration of crude oil and natural gas deposits. As of 31
December 2017, PGNiG held 48 licenses. In 2017, 33 administrative
proceedings regarding the prolongation, amendment or conversion of
licenses were concluded (a total of 21 licenses were converted). Forty
proceedings regarding the approval of appendices to PRG documentation
were also concluded.”"*"

e And, in a similar vein, Claimants demonstrate that on page 24 of PGNiG’s
Directors’ Report for 2017 stated: “As at December 31st 2017, PGNiG held
48 licences for exploration and appraisal of crude oil and natural gas
deposits, vs 53 licences as at January Ist 2017. In 2017, 33 proceedings to
extend, change or convert licences were closed (with a total of 21
concessions converted). 40 proceedings to approve additional works in
geological projects were also completed. As at December 31st 2017,
proceedings to convert 4 licences and extend 2 licences were still pending at
the Ministry of the Environment. 17 additions to geological projects also

756 Although there was some dispute about what “reconstruction” meant in this context, one of Claimants’
experts conceded that it would mean “redrilling” the well: Transcript, Day 3, p. 67. The Respondent’s
expert, Mr. Goedhals, agreed: Transcript, Day 4, pp. 100-101. Only Dr. Moy expressed a different opinion:

await final approval. As at December 31st 2017, PGNiG held a total of 213
production licences in Poland. In 2017, no new licences were granted to
PGNiG, 26 licences were changed and 12 licences expired.””*

Respondent is correct that the Tribunal cannot simply view the number of licenses
held, converted, extended, etc. for a single entity and, without more, determine that
is demonstrates discrimination to an extent sufficient to find a violation of the ECT.

To find that these facts demonstrate actionable discrimination, the Tribunal would
have to be in possession of significantly more evidence proving (i) that the
Claimants and PGNiG were afforded noticeably different treatment in proceedings
similar enough to be compared; and (ii) that such a discrepancy was nationality-
based and not the result of some other confounding variable unrelated to nationality.

Here, the Tribunal lacks evidence on either point. First, it is not possible to view
these limited passages concerning PGNiG’s licenses and determine, without more
than Claimants’ account of the factual background, that PGNiG was treated in a
considerably different manner that could amount to a potential treaty breach.

As Respondent correctly points out, “the length of the administrative proceedings
is determined by a number of factors, such as the type and scope of the application,
the complexity of the factual and legal background, the quality of the applications
and of the accompanying documentation, etc.””°? Claimants would have needed to
provide additional evidence regarding the facts present in the PGNiG reports to
establish that these factors were comparable enough to warrant its theory of
discrimination.

Further, even if the Tribunal was convinced that Claimants and PGNiG were treated
differently in comparable proceedings, the Tribunal lacks any evidence suggesting
that such differences were not the result of other variables. The Tribunal is not
willing to determine, absent any evidence suggesting this is the case, that potential
differences in license proceedings between Claimants and a single other entity were
the result of discrimination as a matter of international law.

Tf discrimination could be found merely based on limited summaries of oil and gas
licenses held, sought, etc. by certain entities, States would be put in a virtually
impossible situation to maintain levels of potentially-superficial equality to avoid
treaty claims. Considering the complexity in this sector and the numerous variables
that go into such license proceedings, such a result would surely have obstructive
implications and, more importantly, would impose such requirements absent
support in international law.

3. Umbrella Clause

Before discussing the role of the umbrella clause under the ECT, the Tribunal notes
that the factual issues at hand in Claimants’ view on this point overlap with the

general discussion of FET in that they concern various back-and-forth moments
between the Parties as they navigated proper filings, addressed deficiencies,
deadlines for responses, etc.

As was the case with FET, the Tribunal can acknowledge that Respondent failed to
act as efficient as possible without finding conduct actionable under an umbrella
clause.

Both Parties focus on the fact that Claimants’ umbrella clause position primarily
rests of Art. 354 of the Civil Code, which mandates that Respondent act in good
faith, which Claimants quote the Supreme Court as requiring Respondent to “look
at the legitimate interest of the contractor and not do anything that would
complicate, hinder or impede the performance of the obligation.”

Claimants do not provide any evidence demonstrating that good faith under the
Polish system is stricter than the principle as found in civil law systems more
generally. In other words, the phrase “not do anything” cannot be taken to the
extreme to imply that any such acts on the part of Respondent that could possibly
have even a minimal negative impact on Claimants’ investment are necessarily a
violation of good faith.

The Tribunal does not wish to engage in a lengthy discussion of the requirements
of good faith, but it can be safely said that something more than administrative
inefficiencies is required to find such a violation. Here, like with FET, Claimants
point to administrative proceedings that they argue were delayed, with Respondent
failing to act timely both on its own and when requested to expedite certain

processes. ’°!

Without going into detail about possible acts taken by Claimants that could be
blamed for aspects of the relevant delays, the Tribunal can acknowledge a level of
failure on the part of Respondent to act in an efficient manner without finding a
violation of good faith, which it does here.

The Tribunal lacks evidence demonstrating any ill-intent on the part of Respondent
in the relevant administrative proceedings. The Tribunal is not satisfied that
Respondent acted in a manner to complicate, hinder or impede the Investment. With
the evidence in front of it, the Tribunal instead finds various administrative
proceedings that, due in part to factors such as staff shortages and an arguable
failure to act in the most effective manner (as well as possible deficiencies in
various filings made by Claimants), were not completed in the most ideal
timeframe. While this is regrettable and the Tribunal agrees that Claimants
reasonably expected a smoother process, the facts of this case, as presented, fail to
establish a violation of good faith.

Even if, arguendo, there were a breach of the duty of good faith as understood under
Polish law, this does not mean that this duty itself is somehow actionable under
Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Claimants have not explained how a general duty of
good faith under Polish law can be equated with an obligation that Poland has
“entered into” with the Claimants’ Investment as required under Article 10(1).
Such an approach would have far-reaching consequences: all general legal
obligations in domestic law would be elevated to the level of international
obligations. The Claimants have failed to make out its case on this point as well
and for this additional reason the Tribunal dismisses this claim.

CAUSATION AND DAMAGES

Because the Tribunal finds that the Respondent did not breach the ECT, there are
no issues of causation or damages.

Costs

Claimants’ Statement of Costs indicate a total amount of EUR 2,237,526.50. Out
of this total, EUR 406,201.75 have been spent on costs of the arbitration.

Respondent’s Statement of Costs indicates that, when combining the costs of the
General Counsel to the Republic of Poland and the Ministry of Climate and
Environment, the total costs amount to PLN 6,611,245.73. None of these costs were
allocated to the costs of the arbitration.

Pursuant to Article 49(6) of the SCC Rules:

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal shall, at the
request of a party, apportion the Costs of the Arbitration between the
parties, having regard to the outcome of the case, each party’s
contribution to the efficiency and expeditiousness of the arbitration and
any relevant circumstances.

Pursuant to Article 50 of the SCC Rules:

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal may in the
final award, at the request of a party, order one party to pay any
reasonable costs incurred by another party, including costs for legal
representation, having regard to the outcome of the case, each party’s
contribution to the efficiency and expeditiousness of the arbitration and
any other relevant circumstances.

In this case, both Parties have requested that the Tribunal order the other Party to
pay for all costs and expenses included in this arbitration, including arbitration fees

and expenses, fees and expenses of experts and fees and expenses spent on legal
representation.’°

It is fairly common practice to allocate costs and fees based on the costs follow the
event principle, In these proceedings, however, neither party was fully successful
in its claims. That is, the Claimants prevailed on numerous jurisdictional objections
while the Respondent prevailed on the merits.

As a result of these mixed outcomes, the Tribunal feels a justified outcome involves
a more balanced approach.

While the Respondent presented numerous unsuccessful jurisdictional challenges,
it did not seek bifurcation of this arbitration and thus the Tribunal was able to
address these issues without suffering significant delays or increases in costs. While
Claimants and ultimately the Tribunal were indeed forced to confront all such
unsuccessful challenges in written pleadings, hearing time and this award, they
were not so significant as to outweigh the ultimate outcome of the merits of this
dispute.

Concerning the merits, the Claimants’ case ultimately failed in its entirety, as the
Tribunal has dismissed all the claims for violations of the ECT. This is the
fundamental result of this arbitration, and thus while the Tribunal acknowledges
that Respondent also failed in many aspects of its case, its success on the merits
renders it the more prevailing party of the two opposing sides.

As aresult, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants should bear a more significant
share of the costs and fees associated with this arbitration than the Respondent.

Accordingly, the Tribunal first determines that the Claimants should bear all of the
costs of the arbitration. The Claimants are jointly and severally liable to pay such
costs, which were set by the SCC on 17 June 2021 as follows:

The Fee of Chairperson Bernardo M. Cremades amounts to EUR 255,170 and
compensation for expenses EUR 735, in total EUR 255,905, plus VAT of EUR
63,976.25.

The Fee of Co-Arbitrator Kaj Hobér amounts to EUR 127,585, plus VAT of EUR
31,896.25.

The Fee of Co-Arbitrator Zachary Douglas QC amounts to EUR 127,585.

The Administrative Fee of the SCC amounts to EUR 60,000, plus VAT of EUR
15,000.

With respect to fees, the Tribunal notes that Respondent’s Statement of Costs
includes a breakdown of fees incurred by separate branches of the Polish
government, namely the Ministry of Climate and Environment and the General

762 Soc, P 318(c); Sod, P 727.

Counsel to the Republic of Poland.”? Due to Respondent’s failed jurisdictional
challenges, the Tribunal determines that Claimants should not bear all of the legal
fees incurred by Respondent. After analyzing the amounts incurred by each branch,
the Tribunal determines a fair allocation is for Claimants to bear the costs incurred
by the General Counsel to the Republic of Poland, but not the Ministry of Climate
and Environment. This total amounts to PLN 1,296,584.50.

777. Within their submissions, the Parties both requested that any amount awarded in
this arbitration be subject to interest. While Respondent failed to specify any
particular percentage, Claimants requested that a standard rate of 5% per annum be
applied.”* The Tribunal finds this percentage to be reasonable and it shall be
applied to the order for Claimants to partially reimburse Respondent for their legal
fees.

VIII. TRIBUNAL’S AWARD
778. For the reasons stated above, the Arbitral Tribunal:

778.1. DENIES Respondent’s jurisdictional objections and upholds the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal;

778.2. DENIES all of Claimants’ claims;
778.3. DENIES all other claims;

778.4. ORDERS Claimants to bear all costs of the arbitration as noted in
paragraphs 771 through 775 of this Award; and
