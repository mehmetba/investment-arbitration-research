INTRODUCTION

A. THE PARTIES

The claimant in the present arbitration is Mr Mohamed Abdel Raouf Bahgat (“Claimant”), a
businessman born in Egypt and who later acquired Finnish nationality. His address is Aleksis

Kiven Katu 11 Ab36, 00510 Helsinki, Finland.

Claimant is represented by Mr Stephen Fietta QC, Mr Jiries Saadeh, Ms Laura Rees-Evans,
Ms Oonagh Sands, and Ms Fanny Sarnel of Fietta LLP, London; Professor Andrew Newcombe
of the University of Victoria; and Mr Samuel Wordsworth QC and Mr Peter Webster of Essex
Court Chambers. Previously, Claimant was also represented by Mr Subir Karmakar of Saunders

Law Ltd.

The respondent in the present arbitration is the Arab Republic of Egypt, a sovereign state
(“Egypt” or “Respondent”, and together with Claimant, the “Parties”). Respondent’s
address is Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, 42 Gameat El Dowal El Arabiya St.,
Mohandeseen, Giza, Egypt.

Respondent is represented by H.E. Counselor Abou Baker El-Sedik Ameer, Counselor Abdel
Hamid Nagashy, Counselor Fatma Khalifa, Counselor Razan Abou Zaid, Counselor Lela
Kassem, Counselor Ahmed Sayed, Counselor Nada El-Kashef, Counselor Yasmine Shamekh,
and Counselor Yousra Mohamed of the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority; and Mr Louis
Christophe Delanoy, Mr Tim Portwood, Mr Raed Fathallah, Mr Suhaib Al Ali, Ms Laura
Fadlallah, and Ms Khrystyna Kostiushko of Bredin Prat.

B. THE DISPUTE

The present dispute is an arbitration initiated by Claimant against Respondent under the
Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Finland and the Government of the
Arab Republic of Egypt on the Mutual Protection of Investments, dated 5 May 1980 (“1980
BIT”) and the Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Finland and the
Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt on the Promotion and Protection of Investments
dated 3 March 2004 (“2004 BIT”, collectively with the 1980 BIT referred to as the “BITs”),
and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law

1976 (SUNCITRAL Rules”).

Claimant is the founder of and investor in the Aswan Development and Mining Company

Case 1:20-cv-02169 Document 1-1 Filed 08/07/20 Page 10 of 177

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award

(‘ADEMCO”) and the Aswan Iron & Steel Company (“AISCO”, and together with
ADEMCO, the “Companies”). He founded the Companies after he was selected by
Respondent to develop the iron ore resources located near Aswan, Egypt (the “Project”) and
to build a facility to develop the Project. ADEMCO was granted a 30-year mining concession

and AISCO was created in order to run the steel operations.

Developments in the Project were underway when, on 5 February 2000, the police arrested
Claimant. Claimant’s personal assets as well as the assets of the Companies were frozen
pursuant to an order of the Public Prosecutor that was confirmed by the Cairo Criminal Court
on 20 February 2000 (the “Freezing Order”). The police raided the offices of Claimant and
the Companies, and shut down and took over the Project site. Claimant was incarcerated for
over three years. The Freezing Order over the Companies’ assets was lifted by a court in
October 2006. Claimant argues that the Project site has been destroyed and he still had not

been provided access to the Companies’ bank accounts.

Claimant contends that the actions taken by Respondent with respect to the Project are in
violation of the investor protections contained in the BITs; specifically, that Respondent’s
actions amounted to an unlawful expropriation, unfair and inequitable treatment, and a failure

to accord full and constant protection and security.

Respondent initially argued that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction ratione personae and
ratione temporis over the present claim. Respondent’s jurisdictional objections were
dismissed in the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction of 30 November 2017 (the “Jurisdiction
Decision”). In its Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal decided that it has jurisdiction over the
dispute, and reserved all questions concerning the merits, costs, fees, and expenses for
subsequent determination. In the present phase of the proceedings, Respondent describes
Claimant’s investment as one that was doomed to failure due to the poor quality of the iron
ore, and that lack of profit was not caused by any ‘political vendetta’ or conduct of the
Egyptian Government. Respondent maintains that it has not breached the BITs and submits
that Claimant has failed to plead or prove causation or actual damages. Accordingly,

Respondent seeks dismissal of the claim and the reimbursement of its costs.

This Final Award recalls the procedural history of the merits phase of this arbitration (Part
ID) and the relief sought by the Parties (Part III). It sets out the relevant factual background
of the claim (Part IV). The Tribunal deals with the Parties’ jurisdictional and merits
arguments relating to breach of the 1980 BIT (Part V), the 2004 BIT (Part VI) and the
Egyptian Law No. 8 of 1997, Law of Investment Guarantees and Incentives (the “Egyptian

Investment Law”) (Part VII). Issues of quantum are covered in Part VIII, followed by
consideration of interest (Part IX) and both Parties’ contentions with respect to Costs

(Part X). The Tribunal’s decisions are set out in Part XI.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

In Part II of its Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal set out in detail the procedural steps
starting from the initiation of the arbitration on 3 November 2011, through the suspension of
the arbitration pending resolution of issues relating to Claimant’s nationality in the Finnish
court system, the resumption of proceedings, the issuance of five procedural orders, the
hearing on jurisdiction, and the issuance of the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Decision on

30 November 2017.

In this section of the Final Award, the Tribunal recalls only key procedural developments
from the first phase of the case and details the procedural steps taken since the Jurisdiction

Decision.

A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION

On 3 November 2011, Claimant initiated arbitration proceedings against Respondent for
breach of the BITs, through a Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Article 9(2)(d) of the 2004
BIT (the “Notice of Arbitration”). In addition, and/or in the alternative, Claimant brought

claims against Respondent for violations of the 1980 BIT, under Article 7(2) of that treaty."

B. CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

The Tribunal is composed of (i) Professor W. Michael Reisman, a national of the United
States of America, who was appointed by Claimant, and whose address is Yale Law School,
P.O. Box 208215, New Haven, CT 06520-8215, United States of America, (ii) Mr Laurent
Lévy, a national of Switzerland and Brazil, whose address is Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler, 3-5 rue
du Conseil-Général, P.O. Box 552, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland, who was appointed by
Respondent on 30 October 2018 following the death on 2 October 2018 of Respondent’s
original appointee, Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia, and (iii) Professor Riidiger Wolfrum,
a German national appointed by the two original co-arbitrators as the Presiding Arbitrator,
and whose address is Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International

Law, Im Neuenheimer Feld 535, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.

C. THE JURISDICTIONAL PHASE

On 27 June 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties signed the Terms of Appointment, thereby

agreeing that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) will act as registry in the

Notice of Arbitration, 3 November 2011, paras. 11-14.

proceedings.

On 8 March 2013, following agreement of the Parties, the Tribunal confirmed that the
proceedings would be bifurcated into a jurisdictional phase and a subsequent phase to deal

with the merits.

Throughout the course of the jurisdictional phase, the Tribunal issued the following

procedural orders:

¢ Procedural Order No. 1 on 19 September 2012, setting a timetable, and noting the
Tribunal may use, as additional guidelines, the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence

in International Arbitration (2010) (“Procedural Order No. 1”);

e Procedural Order No. 2 on 21 December 2012, addressing an application by

Claimant for Interim Measures (“Procedural Order No. 2”);

e Procedural Order No. 3 on 25 September 2013, suspending the proceedings pending
resolution of Claimant’s challenge before the Finnish administrative courts

(“Procedural Order No. 3”);

e Procedural Order No. 4 on 8 March 2017, noting the obligation on both Parties to
pay their shares of the supplementary deposit, and inviting updated information from

Claimant on his third-party funding arrangements (“Procedural Order No. 4”); and

e Procedural Order No. 5 on 17 May 2017, dismissing with reasons three objections of
Respondent that Claimant had identified as being raised out of time (“Procedural

Order No. 5”).

On 10 November 2012, Claimant filed his Statement of Claim together with accompanying
materials (“Claimant’s Statement of Claim”). The accompanying materials included seven
witness statements, six expert reports, exhibits C-0001 to C-0043, and legal authorities CLA-
1 to CLA-44.

During the jurisdictional phase, the Parties exchanged the following written submissions:

e Respondent’s Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 15 July 2013 (Respondent’s

Memorial on Jurisdiction);

*  Claimant’s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 30 August 2013 (“Claimant’s

Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction”);

Claimant’s Supplementary Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 14 December
2016 (“Claimant’s Supplementary Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction”) (which
included an English translation of the Finnish Supreme Administrative Court

Judgment of 15 November 2016, in which Claimant had prevailed);

Respondent’s Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 23 March 2017 (“Respondent’s

Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction”); and

Claimant’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 25 May 2017 (“Claimant’s Rejoinder on

Jurisdiction”).

A hearing on jurisdiction was held on 19 and 20 June 2017 (“Jurisdiction Hearing”) and the

Parties agreed that no post-hearing briefs were necessary and that costs submissions would be

deferred until after the Jurisdiction Decision.

The Tribunal issued its Jurisdiction Decision on 30 November 2017, which contained the

following decisions at Paragraph 319:

Based on the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal:

A.

B
Cc
D.

Dismisses the jurisdiction ratione personae objections advanced by Respondent.
Dismisses the jurisdiction ratione temporis objections advanced by Respondent.
Decides that it has jurisdiction over the dispute.

Reserves all questions concerning the merits, costs, fees and expenses for
subsequent determination; and

Invites the Parties to confer regarding the procedural calendar for the merits
phase of the arbitration, and to report to the Tribunal in this respect within six (6)
weeks of receipt of this Decision.

All three arbitrators signed the Jurisdiction Decision and Professor Orrego Vicufia

additionally appended a separate opinion.

D. PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THE MERITS PHASE

By letter dated 11 December 2017, Claimant renewed its request that the Tribunal make an

order, with the same legal effect as an interim award, promptly directing Respondent to

comply with its legal obligation to pay its share of the deposit by (a) repaying Claimant the

three deposits he had already paid in lieu of Respondent and (b) paying forthwith its share of

any future deposits that may from time to time be requested by the Tribunal.

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

On 13 December 2017, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimant’s request,
and also invited both Parties to advise if they consented to publish the Jurisdiction Decision.
On 3 January 2018, Claimant did provide consent to publish, but Respondent indicated that it
did not consent. The Tribunal noted on 5 January 2018 that “[i]n the absence of consent to
publication of both the Parties, as required by Article 32(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules 1976,
the [Jurisdiction] Decision and the Separate Opinion of Professor Orrego Vicuiia will remain

confidential.”

By letters dated 10 and 12 January 2018, the Parties shared their proposals on the procedural
timetable for the merits phase of the case pursuant to Paragraph 319.E of the Jurisdiction

Decision.

On 11 January 2018, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was “willing to pay its share of
any future deposits that may from time to time be requested” however stated that it was “not
prepared to restitute to Claimant any deposits that he has already paid in lieu of Respondent,
unless ordered to do so by the Tribunal in its Final Award, if at all.” Respondent reiterated its
position that “the Tribunal does not have the authority under the UNCITRAL Rules to issue
an interim award ordering a party to pay its share of the deposits.” Both Parties filed further
comments on these issues. Among other things, on 23 January 2018, Claimant corrected
Respondent’s assertion that there was “certain instability” to Claimant’s funding and
confirmed that he had in place a third party non-recourse funding agreement with Vannin

Capital PCC (“Wannin”).

The Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on 2 February 2018, dealing with the procedural
calendar for the merits phase and payment of the deposit (“Procedural Order No. 6”). With
respect to the deposit, the Tribunal recalled the history of payment of the deposits in the
arbitration to date. It further recalled that in Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal had
(i) determined that “Respondent remains under a legal obligation to pay its share of the
deposit and to continuously monitor its own financial and political situation”; (ii) directed
Respondent to “report to the Tribunal immediately when it is in a position to pay its share of
the deposit and to arrange as soon as practicably possible for restitution to Claimant of the
share of the deposit that he paid in lieu of Respondent”; and (iii) deferred making an order on
costs “until the final award, or in any event, until after the jurisdiction of the Tribunal has
been determined.” In Procedural Order No. 6, the Tribunal noted that Respondent had
confirmed its ability to satisfy all future requests for deposit payments and was therefore in a

position to pay its share of the deposit. Without prejudice to the final allocation by the

Tribunal of costs, and any interest thereon, at a later stage in this arbitration, the Tribunal
directed Respondent “to make payment of EUR 275,000, representing the deposit payments
that Claimant has made in liew of Respondent in this arbitration thus far, to Claimant within

45 days of receipt of this Order.”
On 7 February 2018, the Tribunal requested a supplementary deposit from both Parties.
Claimant paid its portion of the supplementary deposit on 23 February 2018.

Following a further exchange of correspondence among the Parties and the Tribunal
regarding hearing dates, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 on 12 March 2018
(‘Procedural Order No. 7”), containing an adjusted schedule, with the week of 10

December 2018 set for the hearing on the merits (the “Merits Hearing”).

On 22 March 2018, Respondent confirmed that it had initiated processes to pay its portion of
the supplementary deposit. It also reiterated that “while it is willing to pay its share of future
advances on costs, it cannot make any payment to Claimant as reimbursement of past
payments.” In response to that communication, Claimant expressed the view that
Respondent’s position was inexplicable, and ignored Procedural Order No. 6. Claimant
“appreciate[d] that there is little that the Tribunal can do at this stage to address Respondent’s
disregard of its procedural orders”, but “nevertheless request{ed] that the Tribunal note
Respondent’s conduct” and “reserve[d] his rights in that regard, including as to costs and his
right to claim interest on the unpaid amount as from 19 March 2018.” The Tribunal noted the

contents of both Parties’ communications on 26 March 2018.

The Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 on 10 May 2018, which set out a revised
procedural calendar agreed by the Parties, but retained the dates for the Merits Hearing in the
week of 10 December 2018 (“Procedural Order No. 8”). The Tribunal confirmed on
29 May 2018 that the Merits Hearing would be held in The Hague.

Respondent's portion of the supplementary deposit was received on 15 June 2018.

On 3 July 2018, following an extension request and explanation from Respondent, the
Tribunal granted Respondent until 6 July 2018 to file its Statement of Defense, noting
Respondent’s undertaking to file even if missing elements had not then been received by
counsel. The Tribunal indicated that it would issue a further revised procedural calendar,
which was done in the form of Procedural Order No. 9, issued on 17 July 2018 (“Procedural

Order No. 9”).

Case 1:20-cv-02169 Document 1-1 Filed 08/07/20 Page 17 of 177

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

Respondent filed its Statement of Defense, with accompanying materials, on 6 July 2018 (the
“Respondent’s Statement of Defense”). The accompanying materials included two expert

reports, exhibits R-0033 to R-0063, and legal authorities RLA-0086 to RLA-0117.

In July and August 2018, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 9, the Parties exchanged
document production requests, replies and objections to such requests, and on
10 August 2018, both Parties applied to the Tribunal for document production orders. On
20 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 on document production
(“Procedural Order No. 10”).

On 30 September 2018, the PCA advised the Parties that it had been informed by Professor
Orrego Vicufia’s family that for health reasons he was no longer able to serve as arbitrator.
Respondent was invited to appoint a replacement. On 3 October 2018, the PCA conveyed to

the Parties the news that Professor Orrego Vicufia had passed away.

On 9 October 2018, Claimant filed its Reply (the “Claimant’s Reply”), accompanied by
3 witness statements, 5 expert reports, exhibits C-0086 to C-0158, and legal authorities CLA-
77 to CLA-130.

On 30 October 2018, Respondent appointed Mr Laurent Lévy to replace Professor Orrego
Vicufia. In the same correspondence, Respondent requested that the Merits Hearing be

postponed to the week of 18 February 2019 to allow Mr Lévy sufficient time to prepare.

On 30 October 2018, the PCA circulated to the Parties a list of case documents that it
proposed to send to Mr Lévy. Claimant provided its comments on this list on

31 October 2018, to which Respondent agreed on 1 November 2018.

On | November 2018, the PCA circulated to the Parties Mr Lévy’s Statement of Acceptance
and Independence under the UNCITRAL Rules, his curriculum vitae, and Mr Lévy’s
disclosures pursuant to Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Rules. The PCA informed the Parties that
the only period in which the Tribunal would be available for the Merits Hearing in the first

half of 2019 would be 22 to 26 April 2019.

On 3 November 2018, Claimant requested the Tribunal to maintain the 10 December 2018
Merits Hearing dates. By letter dated 5 November 2018, Respondent maintained its request to

postpone the Merits Hearing.

On 5 November 2018, the PCA asked Claimant to indicate his availability for the Merits

Hearing the week of 22 April 2018. On 6 November 2018, Claimant indicated that he was not
available to attend the Merits Hearing the week of 22 April 2018 due to commitments of
Claimant’s lead counsel in another matter for the three weeks prior. Claimant reiterated his

request that the original hearing dates be maintained.

On 7 November 2018, Respondent informed the PCA and the Tribunal that it would be
unable to file its Rejoinder by 15 November 2018 because some of its experts were unable to
finalise their reports in time, with one expert being unavailable between the end of November
and 15 December 2018. This was followed by Respondent’s formal request for an extension

until 6 December 2018 for the filing of its Rejoinder.

On 8 November 2018, Claimant objected to any postponement of the Merits Hearing due to
the unavailability of Respondent’s experts, inter alia citing Paragraph 6.2 of Procedural Order
No. 1 that makes each Party responsible for the attendance of its experts at a hearing.
Claimant noted, referring to Paragraph 6.7 of Procedural Order No. 1, that the Tribunal may
refuse to admit the expert report or draw any other appropriate inferences, should Respondent

fail to produce an expert that Claimant has called for cross-examination.

On 8 November 2018, Claimant requested Mr Lévy to supplement his disclosures pursuant to
Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Rules with respect to any relationship he may have had with
Claimant’s third-party funder Vannin. On 12 November 2018, Mr Lévy confirmed that, to the
best of his knowledge, Vannin was not funding a party appearing before him. Claimant
supplemented its submission by letter dated 12 November 2018, in which it inter alia agreed
to a one-week extension until 22 November 2018 for the filing of the Rejoinder, subject to

preservation of the 10 December 2018 Merits Hearing dates.

On 12 November 2018, the Tribunal proposed that a hearing limited to opening statements
and fact witness testimony take place in December 2018, followed by a hearing on the expert
witness testimony and closing submissions in late April 2019. The Tribunal noted that this
structure would accommodate Claimant’s concern to preserve the December hearing dates at
the same time as Respondent’s concerns as to the preparation of its experts and Mr Lévy’s
capacity to prepare for the hearing. Such a split in the hearing would (i) reduce both the
length of the December hearing and the material covered, (ii) allow Claimant to provide
testimony this year, addressing points as to his advanced age and the time it has taken to have
his claims heard, (iii) allow Respondent to complete expert reports of the new expert who was
unavailable in December, and (iv) allow time for Party-appointed experts to confer and

produce potentially constructive joint expert reports. The later start date of 24 April 2019 for

Case 1:20-cv-02169 Document 1-1 Filed 08/07/20 Page 19 of 177

the second part of the hearing, along with the reduced scope of that portion of the hearing and
five months lead time, would adjust the availability of Claimant’s lead counsel. The Tribunal
noted that “in the circumstances there is no perfect solution” but considered the proposal “to
be consistent with its general duties under the UNCITRAL Rules to conduct the arbitration in
such manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the parties are treated with equality and
that at any stage of the proceedings each party is given a full opportunity of presenting his

case.”

On 14 November 2018, the Parties provided their comments on the Tribunal’s proposal.
Respondent reiterated its preference to organise a hearing over a single week in 2019 but
stated that if the Tribunal were to reject that option, Respondent “will follow the Tribunal’s
suggestion and make itself available in December 2018 for the opening statements and the
cross-examination of the factual witnesses and in April 2019 for the cross-examination of the
experts and the closing statements.” Claimant however reiterated concerns as to his advanced
age, the time he has already spent in the case, and explained that the arrangement with his
new funder will increase the costs entailed for him if the dispute is not resolved by
31 December 2019. Claimant also stated that splitting the hearing would provide a procedural
advantage to Respondent as it would have four months to work on further responses to the
fact evidence and is not presenting any fact witnesses. Claimant repeated its preference to
maintain the hearing commencing 10 December 2018 and stated it would be “amenable to the
Respondent receiving a one-week extension for filing its Rejoinder (but not otherwise).”
Claimant also stated that, although sub-optimal, “if one of the Respondent’s technical experts
is in fact unavailable to attend at any point during the December hearing, there may be scope
of holding the evidence of that expert over to be heard at the earliest convenient date after the

December hearing, whether in person or by video conference.”

On 18 November 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 addressing the
scheduling of the merits phase (“Procedural Order No. 11”). In line with Article 15 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal reiterated its concerns to conduct the proceedings in such a
manner so as to ensure equality of treatment amongst the parties while providing them a full
opportunity to present their respective cases. The Tribunal took note of the fact that Claimant
commenced proceedings over seven years earlier and that circumstances beyond his control
caused delays in having his claims on the merits heard. It recalled that at the request of
Respondent, Claimant on several occasions agreed to postpone steps within the procedural
calendar. Notwithstanding the difficulty in finding a convenient hearing date for both Parties

and Tribunal members, the Tribunal noted that the case was almost fully briefed and it did not

wish to lose the momentum of proceedings. The Tribunal factored in the availability of
Mr Lévy and the size of the files to be reviewed for this portion of the proceedings.
Acknowledging some overlap between factual and expert witness testimony to be presented,
the Tribunal nevertheless considered it feasible to split the hearings, beginning with opening
statements and examination of fact witnesses December 2018 and the expert witnesses and

closing statements in April 2019.

The Tribunal noted Claimant’s concerns as to its funding arrangements, and stated it would
“use every best effort to issue a final award in the eight months between the close of the
merits hearing and 31 December 2019, assuming the Parties likewise adhere to scheduled
dates.” As to whether fact and expert evidence may be cleanly split, the Tribunal found that
save for the testimony of Mr Richard Hills Verdier, Claimant’s witness statements do not
touch on issues of a technical nature and can effectively be treated separately in December.
Regarding Mr Verdier’s testimony, the Tribunal decided to hear his testimony as to his first
statement of 2 November 2012 in the December phase of the hearing, as it discusses facts not
of a technical nature. Mr Verdier may then be recalled in the April phase of the hearing to
testify as to his second statement of 7 October 2018 which addresses technical details. As
such, the Tribunal decided that the hearing on the merits will take place at the Peace Palace in
The Hague from 12-13 December 2018 and, if necessary, the morning of 14 December 2018
(‘2018 Merits Hearing”). Expert testimony and Mr Verdier’s examination on his second
statement, and closing submissions, would then be in The Hague from 24-26 April 2019
(‘2019 Merits Hearing”).

Also in Procedural Order No. 11, the Tribunal granted Respondent until 23 November 2018
to file its Rejoinder. The Tribunal noted that Respondent has “had ample notice of the date for
the filing of its Rejoinder” and that despite the need to find a replacement arbitrator, the
Tribunal was not convinced that Claimant’s Reply necessitates extra time for filing given the
extensions already proffered to Respondent. Respondent was extended an invitation until
6 December 2018 to apply for leave if it needed to supplement its Rejoinder with an
additional expert report that it is not able to finalise until a later date. The Tribunal also
reminded Respondent that as per Procedural Order No. 6, it was directed to make payment of
EUR 275,000 by 19 March 2018 to Claimant as reimbursement for payments Claimant made

in lieu of Respondent.

A further and final extension request for the Rejoinder was granted by the Tribunal on

23 November 2018, and on 28 November 2018, Respondent filed its Rejoinder, together with

On 6 December 2018, Respondent filed an updated rejoinder, accompanied by the expert

report of Dr Jiirgen Cappel.

E. THE 2018 MERITS HEARING

On 29 November 2018, Respondent notified that it wished to cross-examine Mr Bahgat and
Mr Verdier at the December hearing, and reserved its right to recall Mr Verdier at the 2019
Merits Hearing. Claimant observed that, as Respondent had proffered no fact witnesses, there
were no fact witnesses for it to cross-examine in December, and reserved its right to cross-

examine the expert witnesses at the 2019 Merits Hearing.
On 3 December 2018, the Parties submitted chronological lists of exhibits.

On 4 December 2018, the Parties, Presiding Arbitrator, and Registry participated in a
pre-hearing teleconference to deal with administrative and procedural aspects of the 2018
Merits Hearing. This was followed by the issuance of Procedural Order No. 12 on
8 December 2018, which set out arrangements for the 2018 Merits Hearing (“Procedural
Order No. 12”).

From 12-14 December 2018, the 2018 Merits Hearing was held at the Peace Palace in

The Hague. In attendance were the following:

Oral submissions were presented by Mr Fietta and Mr Wordsworth for Claimant and Mr
Delanoy, Mr Portwood, and Ms Fadlallah for Respondent. Fact testimony was heard from
Mr Bahgat, who was cross-examined on his five witness statements by Respondent, and
Mr Verdier, former technical director of ADEMCO and AISCO, who was cross-examined by
Respondent on his first witness statement of 2 November 2012 relating to the events leading

to the closure of the Project.

At the close of the hearing, the Parties and Tribunal discussed next steps for the 2019 Merits

Hearing and a possible schedule for joint expert reports.

By letter dated 18 December 2018, the Tribunal confirmed the dates of the 2019 Merits
Hearing to be Wednesday, 24 April 2019, Thursday 25 April 2019, and Friday, 26 April 2019
with Saturday, 27 April 2019 held in reserve should extra time be needed. The Tribunal also
stated that in accordance with Paragraphs 2.32 and 7.2 of Procedural Order No. | and
subsequent Procedural Orders, the Parties are requested to confer with one another and their
respective experts to set a schedule for filing joint expert reports by 10 January 2019. The
Tribunal also invited the parties to confirm by 10 January 2019 any corrections to the
transcripts of the 2018 Merits Hearing, and the dates for when witnesses/experts would be
called for examination, when a pre-hearing teleconference with the Presiding Arbitration

would be held, and when the core bundle would be delivered to the Tribunal and Registry.

On 14 January 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, which confirmed the dates

for the 2019 Merits Hearing (“Procedural Order No. 13”). The Tribunal also requested
notification of which witnesses/experts would be called for examination by 31 January 2019,
submission of joint expert reports by 1 March 2019, a pre-hearing teleconference with the
Presiding Arbitrator on 28 March 2019, and delivery of an index and electronic version of a

core bundle by 8 April 2019.

On 31 January 2019, Claimant notified the Tribunal that he wished to call for cross-
examination Respondent’s experts Dr Mike Armitage, Dr John Willis, Dr Jiirgen Cappel, and
Mr Gervase MacGregor. Respondent notified the Tribunal that in addition to
Mr Richard Verdier, it would call Claimant’s experts Mr Noel Matthews, Dr Kadri Dagdelen,
Dr Erik Spiller, and Dr Joseph Poveromo.

On 4 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14, approving the Parties’
agreement to amend the “schedule for the submission of joint expert reports” (“Procedural

Order No. 14”).

On 28 March 2019, Respondent consented to Claimant’s request to introduce into the record
two publicly-available reports from Egypt’s Department of Industry and Mineral Resources,
as well as an updated version of Annex | to the First ADEMCO-MD Contract, which
Mr Verdier had recently found in his possession. Respondent also requested leave to
introduce to the record the decision of the Supreme Security Council of 15 January 2001, and
informed the Tribunal that it had requested Claimant to produce a full version of the

November 1999 Met-Chem Report (Exhibit C-0049).

On 28 March 2019, following exchanges amongst the Parties and Tribunal on procedural
questions, the Presiding Arbitrator, the Parties, and the PCA participated in the pre-hearing
conference call in which they discussed outstanding logistical arrangements for the 2019

Merits Hearing.

On 29 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 in which it inter alia,
extended the deadline for the submission of the Parties’ joint expert reports on beneficiation,
mining, and steel, confirmed the hearing schedule and other arrangements for the hearing, and
requested a written update from Respondent on the payment of EUR 275,000 to Claimant
(representing the deposit payments made by Claimant in lieu of Respondent) (“Procedural

Order No. 15”).

On 29 March 2019, Claimant, with the consent of Respondent, submitted copies of: (i)

On | April 2019, Claimant objected to Respondent’s request to introduce into the record the
decision of the Supreme Security Council of 15 January 2001. He further noted that he was
not in possession of the full version of the November 1999 Met-Chem Report and that he also
wished to produce the decision of the Court of Cassation of 18 October 2001 quashing the

decision of the Supreme Security Council.

On 3 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16 in which it inter alia granted
Respondent leave to introduce into the record the decision of the Supreme Security Council of
15 January 2001 and directed Respondent to produce the decision of the Court of Cassation of
18 October 2001 quashing that decision (“Procedural Order No. 16”). Respondent produced
both documents on 4 April 2019 (Exhibit R-0088 and Exhibit R-0089).

On 5 April 2019, the Parties submitted their joint expert reports on beneficiation along with
two new exhibits, (i) Bo Arvidson, “Continuous High Gradient Magnetic Separation, Pilot
Plant: Machine Description and Mineral Processing Results”, 1976 (Exhibit ES-5), and (ii)
L. Paul Staples, Jan E. Nesset, “An Evaluation of a High Gradient Magnetic Separation Pilot
Plant at Brunswick Mining and Smelting”, Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and
Petroleum, | January 1996 (Exhibit ES-6).

On 5 April 2019, pursuant to the direction contained in Procedural Order No. 15, Respondent

provided the Tribunal with an update regarding the payment of EUR 275,000 to Claimant.
On 7 April 2019, the Parties submitted their joint expert report on steel.
On 15 April 2019, Respondent submitted an updated version of Exhibit R-0089.

On 20 April 2019, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 275,000 from Respondent,
representing the amount to be reimbursed to Claimant for the three substitute deposit

payments he had made in lieu of Respondent.

On 9 June 2019, Claimant filed a corrected version of his Statement of Costs (“Claimant’s

On 10 June 2019, Respondent requested a further extension to file its Statement of Costs to
finalise its figures and requested the opportunity to file comments on Claimant’s Statement of

these requests.

On 11 June 2019, the Tribunal directed Respondent to file its Statement of Costs by no later

Claimant’s Statement of Costs. The Tribunal noted that each Party would be invited to
comment on the other Party’s Statement of Costs within two weeks from the date on which
Respondent’s Statement of Costs would be submitted. The Tribunal invited Respondent, by
12 June 2019, to explain the delay in the submission of its Statement of Costs and to send to

RELEVANT BACKGROUND

A. INTRODUCTION

Claimant argues that Respondent has not contested the main facts underlying Claimant’s
case,‘ including the grant of the mining concession to Claimant, the initiation of criminal
proceedings against Claimant, the search of Claimant’s and Mr Mohamed Ali Shimi’s offices,

and the arrest and imposition of sanctions against Claimant and the Companies.*

Respondent argues that this case is an attempt by Claimant to “recoup [...] an investment that
was doomed to failure” because the quality of the iron ore was too poor to manufacture steel.°

Respondent denies the existence of any political vendetta against Claimant and submits that

there were no issues with the working of the Egyptian court system.”
1. The development of the Project

Claimant is a businessman who established several business ventures across the world in the
1970s and 1980s.* Around 1976, Claimant felt that the Egyptian Government had become
more democratic and liberal, and so he expanded his export business to Egypt.°? Claimant was
born an Egyptian national,'® but became a Finnish national by Presidential Decree on
12 February 1971.'' On 6 November 1980, the Egyptian Minister of the Interior by Decision
Number 1896/1980 authorised Claimant to acquire Finnish nationality while not retaining

Egyptian nationality. '

In 1997, Claimant learned about an iron ore reserve in the south east of the Aswan region of
Egypt.'? Claimant highlights that Respondent’s geological and mining authority, the Egyptian
Geological Survey and Mining Authority (“EGSMA”) discovered the iron ore deposits in this
region, publicised these deposits in the state-controlled press, and invited private investors to
participate in the development of this region.'‘ EGSMA published a very positive report in
1997 on the future of iron ore mining in Egypt which “engaged the Claimant’s interest.”'>
Claimant states that then President Mubarak first visited the Aswan region in 1997 and lauded
the prospective investment, “expressing hope that a large investment project would be
established in the Aswan area, which is a relatively undeveloped and poor area of Egypt.”!¢

These statements prompted Claimant to meet with the Egyptian Minister of Industry,

Mr Soliman Reda.'”

Respondent maintains that in the 1990s, the Egyptian government discovered “potentially
promising” iron ore deposits in south east Aswan, although the Aswan area was generally
“Jess attractive due to (i) its location and (ii) the limited quantity and quality of its ore.”!*
Respondent notes that Egyptian Steel, which initially received its iron ore directly from the
Aswan region in the 1970s, switched to receiving resources from the Bahariya Oasis region in
the 1980s because the latter had “larger and better quality reserves.”'° Respondent states that
Mr Ganzouri, the then Prime Minister of Egypt “strongly encouraged Claimant and his
investment.””°

According to Claimant, Mr Reda suggested in a letter dated 31 July 1997 that Claimant
collaborate with Arbed SA, a company based in Luxembourg and that owned a used steel
facility.*! Claimant argues that after visiting Arbed SA, he wrote a letter to Mr Reda
confirming that Claimant planned to build a steel plant in Aswan using an old steel plant that

he would purchase from Arbed SA.”

In July 1997, Lux International Business Relations (“LIBR”), a Luxembourg based company,
began to establish an integrated steel production facility in Aswan by purchasing an old steel
factory in Luxembourg from ProfilArbed (a 100% subsidiary of Arbed SA) and repurposing
this.> LIBR acted as an intermediary for the sale of the used factory between ProfilArbed and
Tradecon (an Egyptian company represented by Claimant).*4 Respondent notes that the

repurposing of an old factory was approved by its authorities even though “the details of the

project were unclear.”

Claimant states that Mr Reda confirmed in the second half of August 1997 that Claimant had

been awarded the contract to mine iron ore in the Aswan region.”° Claimant states that after

being awarded the contract, he began work on its implementation.””

Claimant alleges that on 1 September 1997, Mr Reda invited Claimant to his office
(the “1 September 1997 Meeting”). This meeting was also said to have been attended by
Mr Mokhtar Ali Mohamed El Ashri, a potential investor in the Project, who has submitted
four witness statements in this arbitration dated 31 October 2011, 15 January 2013,
7 February 2013, and 27 August 2013.8 According to Claimant, at the 1 September 1997
Meeting, Mr Reda confirmed that Claimant would be the chairman of the company that would
run the Project subject to certain conditions.” First, Claimant was told he would need to re-
acquire his Egyptian nationality. Claimant states that Mr Reda made it clear that if Claimant
did not take on Egyptian nationality, the government would look for someone else to run the
Project and the money and time invested by Claimant in the Project would be lost.*° Claimant
states that Mr Reda indicated that Claimant would be “out of this project and from any other
project in Egypt.”*! Second, Claimant would have to allocate 5% of the shares in that
company each to the Bank Misr and to the Al Sharq Insurance Company.* Third, Claimant
would have to assign to each of Bank Misr and the Al Sharg Insurance Company the right to

appoint one board member of Claimant’s company.**

Claimant describes that he accepted Mr Reda’s demands, seeing no other method of
preserving his investment in the Project and fearing the possibility of being put in jail if he
refused the demands.™ Claimant alleges that Mr Reda handed him an application to regain
Egyptian nationality, which Claimant completed immediately.** On 28 September 1997, the
Egyptian Ministry of the Interior issued Decision Number 10815/1997, which restored
Claimant’s Egyptian nationality pursuant to Article 18 of the Nationality Law No. 26 of

On 19 November 1997, Tradecon and ProfilArbed signed a letter of intent (the “LOT”) for the

purchase of a used steel factory in Luxembourg.*”

On 22 December 1997, USD 5 million was transferred to ProfilArbed, pursuant to the LOI, as
“{a]dvance payment for second hand equipment.”** It is contested whether Claimant was the

source of these funds.

On 24 December 1997, Claimant established ADEMCO with the authorization of the Chairman
of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones in Egypt (“GAFT”), to carry out the
exploitation and mining of iron ore.** On its establishment, Claimant held 7% of ADEMCO’s
shares.“ According to Claimant, there was no need for a written agreement of a loan between
himself and ADEMCO because he was the chairman and main shareholder of ADEMCO.*' He
preferred to keep his shareholding “as low as possible” because of Egyptian inheritance laws
that would require his shares to be passed on to his stepfamily whom he does not wish to have

control over his assets.“
On 3 January 1998, ADEMCO was registered as a corporate entity under Egyptian law.**

On 29 January 1998, ADEMCO signed a sale and purchase contract with ProfilArbed for the
second hand iron ore preparation plant (the “ADEMCO-Arbed Contract”) for
USD 21,621,000, 51% of which was to be paid within 60 days of the signing of the contract.
On 29 January 1998, ProfilArbed and ADEMCO also entered into a side letter to the
ADEMCO-Arbed Contract, in which ADEMCO confirmed its knowledge that the used

corresponding to these number of years.

On 6 February 1998, ADEMCO and Mannesmann Demag A.G. (“MD”), a German company,
entered into a contract (the “First ADEMCO-MD Contract”) for USD 450 million for the
dismantlement, transport, and re-erection of the used steel factory and the installation of the
new secondary equipment.** The First ADEMCO-MD Contract reflects that the Project would
utilise a used steel plant from ProfilArbed.*” 7.2% of the total price of the First ADEMCO-
MD Contract was to be paid to MD between the beginning of February 1998 and early March
1998."

Respondent notes that the ADEMCO-Arbed Contract and the First ADEMCO-MD Contract
were signed before Claimant had been granted any concession and before the existence of
minable resources had been confirmed in south east Aswan.“ Claimant denies that the
signature of the ADEMCO-Arbed Contract and the First ADEMCO-MD Contract were
premature.*° Claimant argues that at the time, Egypt had granted Claimant the concessions,
there was proof of minable resources and that the Project, given its scale, required Claimant to
evaluate development possibilities at an early stage. *! Claimant further argues that
Respondent, at the time, promoted the viability of the Project and despite being aware of
Claimant’s business dealings, did not object to Claimant’s actions.*? Claimant notes that

Respondent encouraged Claimant to negotiate with Arbed.**

On 10 March 1998, the Egyptian General Organization for Industrialization “referring to the

information in this study has been carefully prepared and on local assumptions.”

On 12 April 1998, GAFI authorised the increase in ADEMCO’s share capital from
EGP 10 million to EGP 100 million.** Respondent argues that Claimant’s shareholding in
ADEMCO remained at 7%.*° Claimant contends that upon Mr Shimi’s contribution of
EGP 42 million to ADEMCO, Mr Shimi’s shareholding in ADEMCO increased to 42.03%

and Claimant’s shareholding in ADEMCO was 54.3%.*’ Claimant maintains that he invested

 

EGP 2.5 million at the time ADEMCO was incorporated, then at a later stage, this was
increased to EGP 7.5 million by way of a credit balance through the MD payment, to reach
EGP 10 million, and then further increased to reach EGP 100 million.**

In April 1998, a decision was made to purchase new equipment for the Project rather than
utilise the used factory: the weight of the assets of the used factory were greater than expected
(which resulted in increased prices for dismantlement, transport, and re-erection) and the
capacity of the old factory was more limited than expected.” On 12 April 1998, a meeting
was held between representatives of ADEMCO and MD.” At this meeting, MD suggested
“[substituting] the second hand equipment by brand new ones...” and that “ADEMCO should

... consider new equipment instead of a mix between used and new.”*!

ADEMCO and MD entered into a new contract to reflect the use of a new steel plant for
USD 585 million (which was antedated to keep the date of 6 February 1998) (the “Second
ADEMCO-MD Contract”). In April 1998, MD and Tradecon prepared an information
memorandum about the iron ore deposits in the Aswan region (the “April 1998 MD

Report”).® Claimant notes that the April 1998 MD Report contemplated a new steel plant

and that the Minister of Industry had no objection to this change.

In June 1998, the following shareholders were added to ADEMCO: MD (10%), Cegelec
(5%), and Orascom (5%).°° Claimant argues that his shareholding in ADEMCO was
increased to 12% and Respondent contends that Claimant’s shareholding in ADEMCO

remained at 12% from this date onwards.

ADEMCO’s 30-year mining license was confirmed by Law No. 166 on 14 June 1998, which
was enacted by the Egyptian Parliament and signed by then President Hosni Mubarak
(“Law No. 166” or the “Concession”).°’ Law No. 166 was accompanied by a commitment
agreement between ADEMCO and the Ministry of Industry (the “Commitment
Agreement”). Under the Commitment Agreement, ADEMCO undertook to “commence the
search operations” within three months and to submit, within a year, a “conclusive economic
feasibility study.”

Claimant argues that the conditions of the Commitment Agreement were satisfied, given that
the Ministry of Industry had approved the feasibility study in the April 1998 MD Report and
the changes to the contract between ADEMCO and MD.” Claimant contends that he was in
constant contact with Respondent’s authorities at the time and that they did not terminate the

majority of his shares in ADEMCO to Claimant.”°

Between July and December 1998, Claimant explains that MD, Cegelec, US Steel, and
Pomini (the “Project Partners”) each agreed to take equity in ADEMCO, but allowed

Claimant to retain legal control over the shares until the companies paid for them.”

On 9 July 1998, Claimant and the Project Partners entered into an agreement
(the “ADEMCO Shareholder Agreement”). ” According to the ADEMCO Shareholder
Agreement, the Project Partners would pay Claimant the nominal value of ADEMCO’s shares

(EGP 10/share) and 20 piasters per share and contribute further capital as set out in the Annex

to that agreement.”

Claimant contends that in July 1998, Claimant controlled 80.2% of ADEMCO’s share capital
(including the 60% share capital that Claimant had agreed to transfer to the Project

Partners).””

On 21 July 1998, AISCO was established by a decision of ADEMCO’s shareholders, in order
to concentrate on the business of manufacturing iron steel in mills and plants constructed for
that purpose.*° With the authorization of GAFI,*! AISCO was incorporated in September
1998 and was registered as a corporate entity on 10 September 1998.*? Claimant submits that
ADEMCO had an 87.5% shareholding in AISCO and Claimant had a 0.2% shareholding in
AISCO. * Accordingly, Claimant states that he had a 34.7% interest in AISCO and,

On 25 August 1998, the land covered by the Concession was delivered to ADEMCO. *°
Claimant argues that in the second half of 1998 and in 1999, there was significant progress on
the Project.*”

In October 1998, the Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute
(the “CMRDI”), an Egyptian state-owned entity, published a progress report containing an
evaluation and beneficiation study of the deposits at the Project.** Respondent notes that this

report identified low iron levels and high levels of impurity (particularly, phosphorus).*°

In October 1998, EGSMA, another Egyptian governmental entity produced a report on the

iron ore at the Project site.*°

In late 1998, ADEMCO contracted Met-Chem, a private Canadian company and subsidiary of

US Steel, to investigate the iron ore at the Project site and to provide a mining plan.”'

A December 1998 GAFI decision notes that the Project Partners held shares in ADEMCO in
the following percentages: MD (10%), Cegelac (5%), US Steel (10%), and Pomoni (5%).”?
Claimant explains that the Egyptian Company for Investment and Undertaking returned its
shareholding in ADEMCO to Claimant in 1999, and that Arab Contractors and Orascom did
the same in 2000.

2. Claimant’s incarceration and state scrutiny of the Project

Claimant contends that following the change in government in October 1999, the newly
instated Prime Minister Dr Atef Ebied allegedly took measures to reverse the legacy of
former Prime Minister Dr Ganzouri.'“ Claimant exhibits newspaper reports suggesting that
the new government had a negative approach to the Project and to Claimant.'® Claimant
points out that his foreign partners, such as MD, continued to support the Project even though

it had lost favour with the State-controlled press.'°°

In September 1998, the Egyptian Capital Market Authority (the “CMA”) suspended approval
of the establishment of AISCO until it received a bank notice evidencing a transfer of
DEM 54 million, equivalent to USD 30 million, to MD.'®’ Claimant submits that this was

resolved quickly after AISCO representatives met with the CMA.!°*

On 13 December 1999, Claimant received a letter from the CMA requesting evidence of the
payment of USD 30 million to MD.'”

On 4 January 2000, the Minister of Industry Technology Development invited only the State-
owned shareholders of the Companies and the presidents of GAFI and the CMA to an urgent
meeting on the same day to discuss issues relating to the Companies.'! The next day, the
Minister of Industry Technology Development wrote a letter to the President of Egypt,
forwarded to the Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, in which he noted that the capital of

AISCO included a payment of USD 30 million to MD, which had not been proven.!!' He

The legal advisor of the Companies provided the CMA evidence from the auditors of

ADEMCO regarding the transfer of USD 30 million to MD.'"3

In January 2000, the accounting books of ADEMCO and AISCO were scrutinised by a
committee formed by GAFI and chaired by Mr Salah El-deen Mandour (the

“Committee”).!'*

On 30 January 2000, the CMA requested Claimant to provide evidence of the payment to MD
by 10 February 2000.'' Claimant, citing Respondent’s exhibit, claims that the cheques for
USD 15 million each, paid to MD and signed by Claimant, were faxed to Respondent on
15 January 2000 and that “the prosecutor and other parts of the Respondent saw those
cheques almost immediately, and they provided the information that the Respondent had been
asking for.”!!

On 5 February 2000 — one day before the Committee report was submitted to GAFI and five
days before the deadline imposed by the CMA to provide evidence of the payment to MD —
Claimant was arrested by the Egyptian police in connection with ADEMCO’s alleged failure

to make payment of USD 30 million to MD."

Claimant alleges that he was banned from travelling outside of Egypt from around the time of
his arrest on 5 February 2000 until late June 2005.''* Claimant notes that once he became
aware that Egypt had imposed a travel ban on him, he transferred the shares that his wife and
daughters held in ADEMCO to himself.'!? Claimant notes that this transfer was only recorded

trial before a panel of judges of the Egyptian Supreme State Security Court.'?°

On 11 June 2002, the Egyptian Supreme State Security Court acquitted Claimant of all

imbalance, backwardness, failure, and absence of applying the scientific approach in taking
decisions instrumental to the future of Egypt’s economic progress.”'*! The court found that
the testimony in favour of the prosecution’s case was “replete with overtones of uncertainties,
lack of acquaintance, lack of confidence, doubt and suspicion” and that the record before the
court did not support the charges against Claimant.'*? The court found that the documentary

Administrative Court upheld the determination of the Finnish Immigration Service.'"”

On 15 November 2016, Claimant informed the Tribunal that he had prevailed on appeal
before the Supreme Administrative Court and that the decisions of the Helsinki
Administrative Court and Finnish Immigration Service had been revoked. Claimant provided
the Tribunal with a copy of the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court dated
15 November 2016 (the “SAC Judgment’) in Finnish. '4*

In its Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal dismissed the jurisdiction ratione personae and
ratione temporis objections advanced by Respondent and also found that it had jurisdiction to
hear claims arising out of alleged breaches of the Egyptian Investment Law.'*? Professor
Orrego Vicuiia provided a separate opinion expressing concerns about the holding on
jurisdiction ratione personae, inter alia, including his view that only exceptional
circumstances may justify departing from the international law rule prohibiting claims by a

dual national against the State whose nationality it also holds.'*°

B. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

1. The 1980 BIT
Article 1(1) of the 1980 BIT, contains the definition of the term “investment”:

For the purposes of this Agreement:

. The term “investment” means every kind of asset and more particularly, though not
exclusively:

a) Movable and immovable property as well as other rights, such as mortgage, lien,
pledge, usufruct and similar rights;

b) Shares or other kinds of interest in companies;

c) Title to money or pecuniary claim or right to any performance having an economic
value;

d) Copyrights, industrial property rights, technical processes, trade names and
goodwill; and

e) Such business concessions under public law, including concessions regarding the
prospecting for or the extraction or winning of natural resources, which entitle the
holder to a legal position of some duration;

According to Article 2 of the 1980 BIT, investors are afforded fair and equitable treatment

(“FET”), national treatment, and most-favoured nation (“MFN”) protections:

Each Contracting State shall, subject to its laws and regulations, at all times ensure fair
and equitable treatment to the investments of nationals and companies of the other
Contracting State.

N

Investments by nationals of either Contracting State in the territory of the other
Contracting State shall not be subjected to a treatment less favourable than that
accorded to investments by nationals or companies of third States.

»

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, a Contracting State which
has concluded with one or more other States an agreement regarding the formation of a
customs union or a free-trade area shall be free to grant a more favourable treatment to
investments by nationals and companies of the State or States which are also parties to
such an agreement, or by nationals and companies of these States. A Contracting State
shall also be free to grant a more favourable treatment to investments by nationals and
companies of other States, if thi pulated under bilateral agreements concluded with
such States before the date of signature of this Agreement.

 

161. Article 3(1) of the 1980 BIT contains provisions relating to expropriation, nationalization or

any other dispossession:

Neither Contracting State shall take any measure of expropriation, nationalization or
any other dispossession directly or indirectly against the investment of a national or a
company of the other Contracting State except under the following conditions:

a) The measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;

b) The measures are not discriminatory; and

as normally required for the completion of transfer formalities.

162. Article 7 of the 1980 BIT provides for dispute resolution:

Any dispute which may arise between a national or a company of one Contracting State
and the other Contracting State in connection with an investment on the territory of that
other Contracting State or between the Contracting States with respect to the
interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be subject to negotiation between
the parties in dispute.

N

If the dispute cannot be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the preceding

arbitration. The Chairman is to be agreed upon within three months after such
notice. If the time limits have not been adhered to, and the parties to the dispute have
not agreed on another designation procedure, any disputing party may request the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, established under the
Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
and Nationals of other States, dated 18 March 1965, to effect the necessary

The 2004 BIT

Article 2 of the 2004 BIT provides for the promotion and protection of investments:

. Each Contracting Party shall promote in its territory investments by investors of the
other Contracting Party and shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations, admit
such investments.

2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and
full and constant protection and security.

3. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory impair by unreasonable or arbitrary

measures the acquisition, expansion, operation, management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment and sale or other disposal of investments of investors of the other
Contracting Party.

Article 3(1) of the 2004 BIT on the treatment of investments provides that:

Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their

Article 5(1) of the 2004 BIT on expropriation provides:

Investments by investors of a Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting

discriminatory basis, in accordance with due process of law, and against prompt, adequate
and effective compensation.

THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS ARIS

 

+ UNDER THE 1980 BIT

In this Part V, the Tribunal deals with the Parties’ claims arising under the 1980 BIT. The
Tribunal recalls that pursuant to the Jurisdiction Decision, the substantive provisions of the
1980 BIT will be applied to actions that took place before 5 February 2005 and the
substantive provisions of the 2004 BIT will be applied to actions that took place after
5 February 2005.'°!

The Tribunal first addresses the new jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent in its
Statement of Defense (Section A) followed by allegations of expropriation (Section B),
unfair and inequitable treatment (Section C), and alleged breaches pursuant to Article 2(2) of

the 1980 BIT (Section D).

In short, Respondent raises three new jurisdictional objections in its Statement of Defense.

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

First, Respondent argues that the 1980 BIT does not apply to any acts against Claimant that
are personal injury claims (the “Personal Injury Objection”). Second, it submits that the
1980 BIT does not apply beyond Claimant’s shares and capital contributions to the
Companies (the “Investment Objection”). Respondent further states that the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to award moral damages (explained in Section VIII.B.6). Respondent argues that
Claimant cannot import, via the MFN clause in Article 2(2) of the 1980 BIT, investment
protection standards that are not contained in the 1980 BIT. In any event, on the merits,
Respondent argues that it has not breached the investment protections that Claimant seeks to

import, nor any substantive provisions of the 1980 BIT.

174. Claimant contests Respondent’s jurisdictional objections, while also noting that they are
untimely. Relying on the MFN clause in the 1980 BIT, Claimant argues that Respondent has
breached various protections of the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection
of Investments between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Kingdom of the Netherlands (the
“Netherlands-Egypt BIT”) and the Agreement on the Promotion and Protection of
Investments between the Government of the Republic of Korea and the Government of the
Arab Republic of Egypt (the “Korea-Egypt BIT”). Claimant further argues that Respondent
has breached the FET standard and protections against expropriation contained in the 1980

BIT itself.

A. THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION UNDER THE 1980 BIT

1. Timeliness of Respondent’s Objections

Respondent’s Position

175. Respondent rejects Claimant’s allegations that its jurisdictional objections are untimely and
urges the Tribunal to consider the jurisdictional objections raised in its Statement of
Defence.'*? Respondent argues that its Request for Bifurcation only covered its objections

ratione temporis and ratione materiae (that were completely separable from the merits of this

arbitration) and included a broad reservation of rights to raise other jurisdiction objections

that are entwined with the merits with the Statement of Defence.'*?

176. Respondent cites a number of investment arbitration decisions where certain jurisdictional

objections were considered in a dedicated phase, whilst others were considered with the

152 Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 56, 59.

merits.'™ In any event, Respondent maintains that belated jurisdiction objections are not to be
rejected outright by the Tribunal, but may cause the objecting party to be subject to

procedural sanctions. !°°

Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that at this merits phase of the arbitration it is untimely for Respondent to
raise jurisdictional arguments. '*° Claimant recalls that the Tribunal has previously struck out
belated jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent after its Memorial on Jurisdiction of
15 July 2013.'*’ Claimant therefore argues that Respondent is precluded from now raising its
Personal Injury Objection and Investment Objection. '** Claimant requests that the above

objections be declared inadmissible.'”

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal will deal with the specific objections made by Respondent, Respondent’s
Personal Injury Objection and Respondent’s Investment Objection (see below at Paragraphs
183 to 187 and Paragraphs 193 to 199 respectively). The Tribunal notes that the objections
made by Respondent have not been dealt with in the Decision on Jurisdiction. However, the
Tribunal does not agree with Claimant that these objections were belated. The issues
concerned are intricately linked with the merits and, accordingly, are to be dealt with in the

context of the merits.
2. Respondent’s “Personal Injury Objection”

Respondent's Position

Respondent argues that the protections of the 1980 BIT cover only Finnish “investments”, not
Finnish “investors”. !© By contrast, Respondent cites Article 3(1) of the 2004 BIT that

accords protections to both “investors” and to their “investments”.'°' Respondent argues that

had the drafters of the 1980 BIT intended to grant protections to investors, they should have
explicitly stated so.'® Respondent notes that past tribunals (Biloune v. Ghana) have declined
jurisdiction over claims arising from actions directed at the investor rather than the

investment.’

Respondent contends that the majority of the acts alleged by Claimant (such as Claimant’s
arrest, the imposition of the Freezing Order, the alleged political campaign against Claimant,
the alleged discrimination in favour of steel companies controlled by Mr Ezz, Claimant’s
imprisonment, and the travel ban imposed on Claimant) are actions directed at Claimant
rather than at his investment, and therefore fall outside the scope of the 1980 BIT.'*
Respondent underlines that the criminal proceedings against Claimant are irrelevant to this
arbitration and that Claimant should not bring “under the guise of an investment treaty claim

what is in reality a personal injury claim.”!°

Claimant's Position

Claimant maintains that Respondent’s misconduct affected Claimant’s investment (the
Project), not simply Claimant as an investor. '% In particular, Claimant notes that
Respondent’s conduct prevented the Companies from pursuing the Project by depriving them
of their management and that Respondent’s actions against Claimant were intimately
connected to his actions against the Project.'*’ Claimant contends that “steps against him were
taken precisely in order to target (and destroy) the investment.”!®*

Further, Claimant denies any distinction between “investment claims” and “investor
claims”.'® He points out that the authorities cited by Respondent in support of this distinction
also note that personal injury to an investor can be considered by a tribunal if the property
rights affecting the investment were also affected.'” Moreover, according to Claimant, the
tribunal in Biloune v. Ghana only disregarded those alleged violations of the investor’s

human rights that were independent causes of action and that were not relevant to the

investment claim.'7!

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal understands Respondent to advance two different objections, a general and a
specific one, which supplement each other. In general, Respondent argues that the term
“investment” as referred to in the 1980 BIT should be interpreted narrowly with the
consequence that the 1980 BIT does not provide jurisdiction to the Tribunal to consider

measures taken against the investor, but only in respect of the investment.

The Tribunal also notes that Respondent further limits the interpretation of the term
“investment” so as to exclude indirect investment (on that see below). Finally, and in respect
of the dispute to be decided here Respondent takes the view that the measures against

Claimant were directed against him as a person rather than against the investment.

The Tribunal holds that the approach advanced by Respondent in general or in respect of the
facts of this dispute are not convincing. The success of investments depends on more factors
than the unrestricted flow of capital or the absence of measures against the property. Apart
from the financial aspect, the success of investments depends upon effective management and
making use of the adequate technical expertise, amongst other factors. Measures against an
investor or the management, or measures deteriorating circumstances which were favourable
for the investment, may equally have a negative impact upon the investment. It would reduce
the effectiveness of the system of investment protection system if it would only prohibit

limitations to the flow of capital or infringements of property.

'? The Tribunal understands from this

Both Parties refer for support to Biloune v. Ghana.
Biloune v. Ghana award that only those alleged violations of the investor’s human rights were
disregarded which had no relationship with the investment claim. Biloune v. Ghana cannot be
used to support the proposition that measures taken against the investor are generally
irrelevant when deciding whether an infringement of investment has taken place. In any

event, there is ample evidence of measures that were directed at the investment.

This brings the Tribunal to the second, specific argument advanced by Respondent. The arrest

of Claimant was triggered by a letter of the Minister of Industry Technology Development to

the President of the Republic in which it was noted that the capital of AISCO included a

payment of USD 30 Million to MD, which had not been proven (see above at Paragraph 133).
This establishes, in the view of the Tribunal, a close connection between the arrest and the
investment. It is evident for the Tribunal that the Freezing Order covering the bank accounts
of Claimant as well as the bank accounts of the Companies, the raid of the offices of
Claimant, and the prohibition of the staff to enter the site of the Project, were investment
related and, de facto, ended the Project. Therefore, in the view of the Tribunal, the measures

taken by Respondent were predominantly directed against the investment.
3. Respondent’s “Investment Objection”

Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that the definition of “investment” in the 1980 BIT only covers “every
kind of asset and more particularly, though not exclusively ... (b) Shares or other kinds of
interest in companies; (c) Title to money or pecuniary claim or right to any performance
having an economic value” that are made by nationals of the other contracting state.!7> Unlike
the 2004 BIT, Respondent notes that the 1980 BIT does not cover investments made by

companies that are owned and controlled by investors of the other contracting state. !”*

Accordingly, Respondent maintains that while Claimant’s shares and capital contributions to
the Companies may be regarded as investments protected by the 1980 BIT, investments made
by and assets held by the Companies are not “investments” under the 1980 BIT. '7
Respondent argues that Claimant cannot rely on Article 5(4) of the Egypt-Korea BIT because
an MEN provision only allows substantive investment provisions to be imported. '%
Article 5(4) is not a substantive provision because it delineates the scope of application of the
treaty, and therefore, cannot be characterised as more or less favourable than the 1980 BIT.'””
Respondent argues that tribunals have cautioned against using MFN clauses to expand the

scope of application of a treaty.!7*

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

Claimant’s Position

Claimant maintains that the protections under the 1980 BIT cover alleged misconduct against
Claimant, the Companies, other members of senior management and equity stakeholders in
the Companies, which was aimed at destroying the Project (i.e., the investment in
question).'” Claimant argues that the shares in Companies that he held in his own name and
the USD 39 million capital investment he made in the Companies are “investments” under the
1980 BIT.'* Further, Claimant contends that the investments made by and assets held by the
Companies (including the rights under the Commitment Agreement, land, buildings,
equipment, bank accounts, and contractual rights) are also “investments” protected by the

1980 BIT.'*!

Claimant argues that the Companies’ assets constitute investments for the purposes of the
1980 BIT.'* According to Claimant, Article 1(1)(a) of the 1980 BIT covers moveable and
immoveable property, and Article 1(1)(e) covers concessions, but there is no requirement that
these assets be directly held.'** Claimant points to several prior arbitral awards that have held

that indirect investments are protected by investment treaties. '**

Claimant further claims that he can, through the MEN provision in Article 2(2) of the
1980 BIT, benefit from the protections in Article 5(4) of the Egypt-Korea BIT, which states
that:

Where one Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or
constitutes under its laws and regulations, and in which investors of the other Contracting
Party own shares or other forms of participation, the provisions of this Article shall be
applied. !85

Tribunal’s Analysis

Respondent relies on the absence of the mention of indirect investment in the 1980 BIT

The starting point for the Tribunal has to be the definition of “investment” as contained in

Article 1(1) of the 1980 BIT which reads as follows.

1. The term “investment” means every kind of asset and more particularly, though not
exclusively.

a) Movable and immovable property as well as other rights, such as mortgage, lien, pledge,
usufruct and similar rights;

b) Shares or other kinds of interest in companies;

c) Title to money or pecuniary claim or right to any performance having an economic
value;

d) Copyrights, industrial property rights, technical processes.
and

trade names and goodwill;

 

 

e) Such business concessions under public law, including concessions regarding the
prospecting for an extraction or winning of natural resources, which entitle the holder of a
legal position of some duration;

  

provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations in

the host country but irrespective of whether the investment was made before or after the

entry into force of this Agreement.
The Tribunal notes that Article 1 of the 1980 BIT does not expound an abstract definition of
the term “investment”; there is no reference to direct or indirect investment. It rather includes
the more sweeping term “every kind of asset” and resorts to a non-exclusive list of categories
of investments. The specific categories included constitute examples rather than excluding
others as indicated by the words “not exclusively” at the beginning of the list. The 1980 BIT
at Article 1(1)(b) lists “shares or other kinds of interest in companies” as being an investment.
The 1980 BIT does not require that there be no interposed companies between the ultimate
owners of the company. Therefore, a literal reading of the 1980 BIT does not support the
allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments. The Tribunal is
aware of the fact that the 2004 BIT explicitly refers to indirect investment. The Tribunal
further notes that the Preamble of the 2004 BIT states the Parties’ desire ‘“*...to promote
greater economic cooperation between them, with respect to investments by nationals and
companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.” Both
factors in the view of the Tribunal do not, however, convincingly lead to an interpretation of
the 1980 BIT excluding indirect investments from Article 1(1). The most reasonable
interpretation for this difference between the two BITs is that such reference to indirect
investment in the 2004 BIT was meant to be a clarification. To come to this conclusion, for
the Tribunal, the literal reading of Article 1(1) of the 1980 BIT, which also refers to “shares
or other kinds of interest in companies,” is of essence. Such reference would not make sense

if indirect investment was excluded from the 1980 BIT.

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

Apart from the textual interpretation of Article 1(1) of the 1980 BIT, taking the object and
purpose of the investment protection into account leads to the same result, namely, that the

term “investment” covers direct and indirect investment alike.

Additionally, the Tribunal would like to emphasise that, economically speaking, there is no
difference between direct and indirect investment; in consequence it would be unreasonable
to afford indirect investment lesser protection than direct investment. The jurisprudence is
that indirect investments are covered by the definition of an “investment” unless specifically
excluded. Accordingly, investments as defined in Article 1(1) of the 1980 BIT can be direct

or indirect investments.

This reading of Article 1(1) of the 1980 BIT is supported by the international jurisprudence of
ICSID tribunals in cases interpreting other investment treaties with clauses similar to the one
at hand. Examples to that extent are Siemens AG v. The Argentine Republic,'*° loannis

87

Kardassopoulos v. The Republic of Georgia,'*’ and Venezuela Holdings, B.V, et al v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.'**

On the basis of the considerations above, the Tribunal discards the narrow interpretation of

the term “investment” in the 1980 BIT, as advocated by Respondent.

B. EXPROPRIATION
Claimant's Position

Claimant recalls that Article 3(1) of the 1980 BIT protects investments from “any measure of
expropriation, nationalization or any other dispossession directly or indirectly against the
investment of a national.” '*? Claimant notes that the language of Article 3(1) is broad because
it applies to “any other dispossession” and because it applies to measures which directly or

indirectly give rise to an expropriation, nationalization, or other dispossession.!°°

Claimant points to investment decisions in which arbitral tribunals have interpreted

expropriation to include all forms of substantial deprivation. This could result, according to

Claimant, from:

depriving the investor of control over the investment, managing the day-to-day operations
of the company, arresting and detaining company officials or employees, supervising the
work of officials, interfering in administration, impeding the distribution of dividends,
interfering in the appointment of officials or managers, or depriving the company of its
property or control in whole or in part. !!
Further, Claimant highlights that the concept of indirect expropriation or “unreasonable
interference with the use, enjoyment, or disposal of property” is well-established. !°? Claimant
argues, relying on Quiborax v. Bolivia, that State interference with company assets can

amount to indirect expropriation.'*?

Claimant argues that the following conduct of Respondent, which deprived the Companies of
the ability to manage their business, amounted to an expropriation of his investment:
(i) Claimant’s arrest on 5 February 2000 that deprived the Companies of their chief executive
officer and resulted in the Project Partners withdrawing from the Project, (ii) the removal of
Claimant’s and the Companies’ documents from their offices in February 2000 that deprived
the Companies of their ability to manage their business, (iii) the 9 February 2000 Freezing
Order and the resulting discontinuation of the salaries of the Companies’ employees, (iv) the
confirmation of the Freezing Order by the Cairo Criminal Court on 20 February 2000, and
(v) the resulting permanent closure of the Companies’ offices, the removal of their officers

from the Project site, and Respondent’s takeover of the Companies’ properties.'**

Claimant clarifies that Respondent did not meet the conditions of Article 3(1)(a)-(c) of the

1980 BIT, and therefore this was not a lawful expropriation. !°°

Claimant submits that even if the only protected investments in this case are his shareholding

in and substantial capital contribution to the Companies, the seizure and non-return of the

purposes of Article 3 of the 1980 BIT.'°° According to Claimant, he need not have lost title to

Claimant submits that Pope & Talbot v. Canada, upon which Respondent relies, in fact
supports Claimant’s case.'** The Pope & Talbot v. Canada tribunal found that expropriation
includes action that prevents, unreasonably interferes with, or unduly delays, effective

enjoyment of an alien’s property, which is what Respondent has done in the present case.'°°

Claimant denies that expropriation only results when an investor has lost control of the
investment, and notes that expropriation can involve the taking of the use or reasonably
expected benefit of the property.” Claimant argues that the Companies have not been able to
continue operations and that, following the reasoning of the tribunal in LG&E Energy Group

v. Argentine Republic, the economic impact of Respondent’s measures in terms of its duration

Claimant argues that measures need not be irreversible and permanent to amount to

203

that expropriation could be partial or temporary.**’ In any event, Claimant’s investment was

permanently destroyed: his investment was subject to a degree and duration of interference

stringent: Claimant must still establish substantial deprivation of its investment due to the

expropriation where the investor retains control over the overall investment (even though the

further notes that the Concession is still in force and that ADEMCO still owns the rights to
the Concession. > Respondent argues that Egypt did not cancel, rescind, or terminate
Claimant’s Concession.” Respondent notes that as at the alleged period of expropriation
(February 2000), the Egyptian Public Prosecutor was merely conducting investigations
following the CMA’s investigation and had taken conservatory measures against Claimant, all
of which were valid and did not amount to an expropriation of Claimant’s investments as they
did not permanently deprive Claimant of his shares or capital investments in the

Companies.”””

Respondent maintains that it did not directly expropriate the Companies.” First, Respondent
reiterates that this claim falls outside the scope of the 1980 BIT, which does not cover the
assets of the Companies.” Respondent submits that the facts of the case do not support a
finding of direct expropriation by it.*° Respondent argues that the Companies’ bank accounts
were made subject to the Freezing Order in accordance with Egyptian law.**! Respondent
argues that its authorities did not take any assets from the Project site, but merely installed
measures to protect these assets.*? Respondent further alleges that its authorities did not take
ownership over the assets of the Companies.” Respondent clarifies that the measures taken
against the Companies were not permanent.?™ Respondent points out that Claimant has never
filed a request that measures against the Companies be lifted.?** Respondent states that
Claimant has not shown that access to the Project site was denied.?*°

Respondent highlights that, since the alleged expropriation, Claimant has publically
announced his intention to pick up the Project via the Companies and has freely altered his

Tribunal’s Analysis

In order to establish the substantiality of an indirect expropriation, the Tribunal first must
define the concept and in a second step ascertain whether the conditions for an indirect

expropriation are met.?**

The 1980 BIT, like other bilateral investment agreements, does not define what constitutes an
expropriation, let alone an indirect expropriation. The relevant part of Article 3(1) of the 1980

BIT reads:

Neither Contracting State shall take any measure of expropriation, nationalization or any

other dispossession directly or indirectly against the investment of a national or a company

of the other Contracting State except under the following conditions:...
It is to be noted that this article refers to “expropriation, nationalization or any other
disposition directly or indirectly against the investment of a national” without offering any
definition for the terms used. Therefore, it is for the Tribunal to determine, on the basis of
public international law as reflected in international jurisprudence, the criteria which qualify
actions or the conduct of a host State directed at or affecting foreign investment as

expropriation or other dispossession as referred to in Article 3(1) of the 1980 BIT.

In scholarly writing as well as in international jurisprudence two kinds of expropriation are

known: direct and indirect.

In international jurisprudence, expropriation is described as a measure taken by a public
authority if the measure in question deprives the investor of its investment, the deprivation is
permanent, and the deprivation finds no justification under the police powers doctrine, that is,
ordinary measures of a State and its agencies in the proper execution of the law.” For an
indirect expropriation to exist, it is generally accepted that the act or acts of the public

authority concerned must have the effect of substantially depriving the investor of the

Respondent's Statement of Defense, paras. 90-91 citing Newspaper articles Al-Shari issue no. 87, 4
March 2011, Exhibit C-0060.

The Tribunal’s reasoning on the substantial deprivation of Claimant’s investment giving rise to
Respondent's duty to compensate (under the expropriation provisions of either the 1980 or 2004 BIT)
was reached by a majority decision.

economic value of its investment.” It is evident that deciding whether an investor has been
substantially deprived of the economic value of his investment requires a tribunal to take into

account the circumstances of the case.

In the dispute before the Tribunal, it is evident and not disputed by the Parties that the claim
at issue does not involve direct expropriation since Claimant still is the owner of his shares in
ADEMCO and AISCO and since the Concession of ADEMCO concerning mining iron ore is

still valid.

Therefore, it is only necessary for the Tribunal to establish the meaning of “dispossession
directly or indirectly” under Article 3(1) of the 1980 BIT and to ascertain whether the acts
and conduct of Respondent substantially deprived Claimant of the economic value of his

investment.

The interpretation of Article 3(1) of the 1980 BIT has to take into account two principles, the
protection of an investment in foreign countries according to public international law on the
one side and the sovereign right of States to define and implement their economic and social
policy on the other. Therefore, establishing what constitutes a dispossession under
Article 3(1) of the 1980 BIT means balancing these two conflicting principles. This has to be
achieved by defining an appropriate threshold for what is to be considered dispossession and

what constitutes acts or conduct Respondent may undertake according to its legal system.

In the view of the Tribunal, the words “dispossession directly or indirectly” cover a situation
where acts or the conduct of Respondent do not involve the direct taking over of assets or
property of Claimant but effectively neutralize the benefit of Claimant.”*! In Pope & Talbot v.
Canada, the tribunal held that the necessary standard of interference to qualify a State’s

action as expropriation had to be that the owner “will not be able to use, enjoy or dispose of

242

the property... In Quiborax y. Bolivia it is stated that: “For an indirect expropriation to

exist, it is generally accepted that the State measure must have the effect of substantially

depriving the investor of the economic value of its investment.”” The Quiborax v. Bolivia
award proceeds to state that: “Similarly according to the first Occidental tribunal, the question
is whether there has been a ‘substantial deprivation’ of ‘the use of reasonably expected
benefits of the investment’.”*“* “In addition as noted in Burlington, the deprivation must be
permanent and must not be justified by the police powers doctrine.” This jurisprudence will
guide the Tribunal in the following considerations. The Tribunal in the Tecmed v. Mexico
case required that claimant had been “radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment
of its investment, as if the rights related thereto — such as the income or benefits related to the
[investment] — had ceased to exist.”™4° In other words, there will be an indirect expropriation
if due to the actions of Respondent, the assets involved have lost their value or economic use

for Claimant.

The Tribunal is not convinced by the argument of Respondent that Article 3(1) of the 1980
BIT does not cover derivative claims, which are explicitly mentioned in the 2004 Egypt-
Finland BIT. The fact that such claims are included in a later BIT does not necessarily mean
that the parties had agreed to exclude such claims from the earlier BIT. The explicit reference
to derivative claims in the later BIT may have been the consequence of the insight that the
1980 BIT was unclear in this respect. What counts for the Tribunal is first the wording of the
1980 BIT. Article 3(1) of the 1980 BIT speaks of investment. This term is broad and does not
exclude derivatives. However, the Tribunal wishes to point out that the expropriation of
derivatives, i.e., economic benefits derived from investments, does not necessarily constitute
an indirect expropriation. Apart from the effects produced by the measures or conduct in
question it is equally necessary to take into account the purpose pursued by the host State
concerned. Based on the above, the Tribunal will proceed in three steps. First, it will establish
the effects the measures taken by Respondent had and still have on the investment of
Claimant. Claimant argues that these measures de facto devalued his investment, whereas

Respondent emphasises that the investment was without value in the first place, that the

shares were still the property of Claimant, and the concession for mining was still valid.
Second, the Tribunal will ascertain which purpose was pursued by Respondent with the
measures undertaken and whether these were legitimate under the rules of public international
law on investment protection. Respondent emphasises that the measures taken were fully
legitimate under Egyptian law, which Claimant denies. Third, the Tribunal will engage in the
question of whether the measures taken were proportional considering the purpose pursued, as

Respondent argues and Claimant denies.

The Tribunal is aware that Claimant is still the owner of his shares in ADEMCO and AISCO,
a fact which Respondent considers to exclude the possibility of qualifying its measures
against Claimant as indirect expropriation. The Tribunal takes a different position in this
respect as already stated above at Paragraph 225. The taking of property is necessary to
qualify State actions against an investor as direct expropriation, whereas other measures, short
of taking property but in one way or the other invalidating the investment, such as depriving
or almost fully depriving the investment of its future profitability, may be qualified as indirect
expropriation. Nevertheless, the Tribunal wishes to point out that the fact that Claimant is still
the owner of his shares in ADEMCO and AISCO, which have their basis in the investments
made by Claimant, will have to be considered when dealing with damages. As to the effects
the measures have had on the investment, the Tribunal is convinced, and Respondent has not
disputed this, that the arrest of Claimant on 5 February 2000 deprived ADEMCO and AISCO
of their chief executive officer. The removal of Claimant’s and the Companies’ documents
from the offices in February 2000 deprived the Companies of their ability to manage their
business. The Freezing Order and its confirmation resulted in the discontinuation of the
paying of salaries to the employees. On the same days followed the closure of the offices of
ADEMCO and AISCO and the removal of the officers from the Project site. All these
measures de facto brought an end to all commercial activities of ADEMCO and AISCO.
Respondent, without denying these facts, argues that these measures were neither permanent
nor irreversible; Claimant could have returned to the management of ADEMCO and AISCO
after his release from prison and after opening of access to his as well as the Companies’ bank
accounts and assets. He could return, as the letter of the Egyptian Prime Minister of
November 2018 indicates, to his business even now. The Tribunal does not find these
arguments advanced by Respondent to be convincing. Between the arrest of Claimant in
February 2000 and his final rehabilitation in 2006 when the Public Prosecutor had lifted the

Freezing Order against Claimant on 11 October 2006, more than six years had elapsed.

The Parties dispute whether the measures have to be irreversible to qualify as indirect

expropriation. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to decide on that matter. In its
view, no possibility exists to undo the negative impact that the lost 6 years had on Claimant’s
investment. The Tribunal is aware that the mining concession of ADEMCO is still valid.
However, of the 30 years of its duration, due to the standstill of all business between
February 2000 and the final rehabilitation of Claimant, 6 years had elapsed. It is, in the view
of the Tribunal, unlikely that in the remaining period, the mining project could be brought to
economic viability with an adequate return on the investment. At least Respondent has

advanced no sustainable argument to substantiate its reasoning in this respect.

In conclusion, the Tribunal holds that the measures taken by Respondent against Claimant
and his investment as outlined above very significantly and irreversibly devalued his

investment.

On this basis, the Tribunal will proceed to the second step, namely to ascertain which purpose
Respondent’s measures pursued and whether these were legitimate under the rules of public
international law on investment protection. Respondent characterized the arrest of Claimant
and the Freezing Order concerning his, his family’s and the Companies’ bank accounts, as
part of criminal investigations according to Egyptian law. The Tribunal is, in spite of the
allegations of Claimant, not in the position to decide as to whether there were other motives
for the measures taken against Claimant. However, the undisputed fact that Claimant was
arrested even before the period he was given to clarify the question concerning the payment to
MD had expired, casts, in the view of the Tribunal, a shadow on the whole procedure. With
respect to an allegation of expropriation, the police power defence is not carte blanche; a
State’s actions must be justified, meet the international standards of due process, and inter
alia be proportional to the threat to public order to which it purports to respond. The Tribunal
also notes that the Public Prosecutor objected to lifting the Freezing Order even after
Claimant had been acquitted by the Egyptian Supreme State Security Court. However, the
Tribunal has already stated (Paragraph 227 above) that the measures taken against Claimant

by the prosecution had a substantial, negative effect on his investment.

If the investigation had only been triggered by doubts regarding whether the payment to MD
had been properly made, this did not justify a Freezing Order on the bank accounts of
ADEMCO and AISCO, the closing of the site of ADEMCO and AISCO, and the prohibition
on officials of the Companies from returning to the site and conducting their work. The
Prosecution should have clearly distinguished between Claimant and ADEMCO as well as

AISCO. Therefore, taking action against ADEMCO and AISCO directly, in particular closing

the site, lacked legitimacy from the outset.

To conclude, the Tribunal holds that even if the measures taken against Claimant and the
Companies had a legitimate purpose they were, as far as their scope was concerned, not
proportional to the purpose pursued. Therefore, they fail the police powers test. Due to the
significant and lasting negative effect they had on the investment of Claimant, the measures

are to be considered as indirect expropriation and thus require compensation.

C. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
Claimant's Position

Claimant argues that Respondent has breached the FET standard contained in Article 2(1) of
the 1980 BIT.”

Relying on arbitral precedent, Claimant argues that the FET standard encompasses an

obligation on part of the host state not to:

(i) abuse its authority or subject investors to harassment or intimidation; (ii) act arbitrarily;
(iii) be capricious, indifferent or negligent in its conduct relating to the investment; (iv) act
inconsistently or incoherently; (v) engage in a denial of justice; (vi) act in a discriminatory
manner; (vii) fail to accord due process; (viii) fail to meet an investor's legitimate
expectations; (ix) fail to act with even-handedness; (x) act disproportionately; (xi) act in
bad faith; (xii) fail to provide a stable and predictable legal and business environment;
(xiii) act nontransparently; or (xiv) fail to provide full protection and security.74*

 

Claimant submits that a series of acts and omissions may result in a breach of the FET

standard.”

Claimant submits that Respondent breached the FET standard by: (i) unlawfully requiring
Claimant to acquire Egyptian nationality as a condition for allowing the Project to proceed;

(ii) instituting a political campaign against Claimant, the Companies, and others involved in

ADEMCO had paid MD and perpetuating false stories about Claimant; (v) prosecuting
Claimant on false charges; (vi) arresting Claimant, thereby depriving the Companies of their
most senior executive; (vii) removing documents from the offices of Claimant and the
Companies, thereby depriving the Companies of their ability to manage the business; (viii)
imposing the Freezing Order through the Egyptian Public Prosecutor on the bank accounts of
Claimant, Claimant’s family, and the Companies; (ix) closing and taking over the Project site
and excluding the Companies’ employees from the Project site; (x) including the Companies
in the Freezing Order, despite the criminal charges being imposed only against Claimant; (xi)

(xiii) failing to allow Claimant to access documents for his defence; (xiv) sentencing
Claimant to 15 years of hard labour on 15 February 2001; (xv) imprisoning Claimant falsely
from February 2000 to March 2003; (xvi) failing to release Claimant from prison after his
acquittal by the Court of Cassation on 11 June 2002; (xvii) failing to lift the travel ban on
Claimant after his release from prison in March 2003; and (xviii) failing to immediately lift
the Freezing Order on 16 May 2006 when the Court of Cassation dismissed the Public
Prosecutor’s appeal against the order of the Supreme State Security Court that acquitted
Claimant. Additionally, Claimant alleges Respondent breached the FET obligation under
the 2004 BIT, by (xix) continuing to fail to allow representatives of the Companies to access
the Companies’ bank accounts, assets, or the Project site after the Freezing Order was lifted
on 18 October 2006; (xx) continuing to fail to provide protection and security to the
Companies’ assets at the Project site despite the Egyptian authorities having control over the
Project site since February 2000; and (xxi) continuing to fail to return to Claimant and the
Companies their property (including the documents requested by Claimant on 24 July

2012).25!

Claimant notes that media reports in February 2000 stated that the Project was “under attack”
by senior government officials and in April 2000 the Ministry of Energy declared

unreasonable the entry of any new investors into the “dead” Project (even though the

Commitment Agreement was still in place). According to Claimant, the above actions that
were taken against the Project and the Companies are a plain violation of the FET standard
vis-a-vis Claimant’s investment.’

Claimant observes that Respondent has not presented any factual defences to the FET
claim.?* Claimant argues that the shares in the Companies are an investment under the 1980
BIT and the imprisonment of Claimant (a significant shareholder, Managing Director, and
Chairman of the company) was mistreatment of the investment because a State’s commitment
to protect an investment extends to key persons connected to the investment as well.?* In any
case, Claimant argues that the criminal proceedings against Claimant were intimately
connected with the Project and therefore affect whether the FET standard was violated.”
Claimant notes that the investigations against Claimant were conducted in his capacity as the
Chairman/Managing Director of the Companies and the investigation pertained to fraud in the
means by which Claimant acquired shares in ADEMCO, the misappropriation of ADEMCO’s
funds, and the falsification of contracts in respect of the work of ADEMCO.”” Claimant
recalls that the Companies’ offices were searched during the investigation.>**

Claimant argues that Respondent cannot rely on Swisslion v. Macedonia to argue that the
Freezing Order was reasonable because the freezing order in that case was in place for merely
five months, whereas the Freezing Order against Claimant was in place for six and a half
years and the Freezing Order against the Companies is in force to date.?*°

Claimant describes Respondent’s argument that the Companies should have found a
replacement for Claimant during his imprisonment as a specious argument that ignores the

“culpable conduct” of Respondent.”

Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that it did not fail to accord FET to Claimant’s investments within the
meaning of Article 2(1) of the 1980 BIT.**! Respondent reiterates that any conduct directed
against Claimant or his family and any conduct directed at the bank accounts and assets of the
Companies, their employees and agents, and/or against the Project cannot constitute a
violation of the FET standard because it was not directed against an “investment” under the

1980 BIT.?

Respondent highlights that a breach of the FET standards requires a showing of “wilful

disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial

propriety.” It cites Ahmonseto v. Egypt, a case which also involved the conviction and

imprisonment of a claimant for parallel criminal proceedings, in which the tribunal found that
to be a violation of the FET standard, the criminal procedure must be “fundamentally
unjustified and groundless” and that the annulment of a lower court’s decision by a higher
court does not necessarily amount to a treaty violation.“ The same tribunal found that

imprisonment can only violate an investment protection if it “gravely violates the rights of the

+9265

person placed in custody. Respondent notes that the tribunal in Ahmonseto v. Egypt

ultimately decided not to opine on decisions that were issued during the criminal

procedures.°¢

Respondent maintains that the domestic court proceedings in Mr Bahgat’s case were
justified.” It recalls that Claimant was not released upon acquittal because he was serving

another jail sentence and that Claimant’s initial requests to lift the travel ban and Freezing

Order were not acted upon because they were procedurally flawe Respondent notes that it

cannot be held liable for breach of the FET standard as a result of the Companies’ failure to

Respondent additionally observes that less than 10 of the exhibits submitted by Claimant with
his Reply were obtained in the document production phase of this arbitration, thus suggesting
that Claimant was incorrect in arguing that he could not present a proper case because he did

not have access to relevant documentation.*”

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal proceeds from Article 2(1) of the 1980 BIT which reads:

Each Contracting State shall, subject to its laws and regulations, at all times ensure fair and
equitable treatment of the investments of nationals and companies of third States.

FET is an autonomous standard generally guaranteeing the rule of law in the treatment of
foreign investors under the legal systems of host states. It has been held to comprise concepts
such as the protection of legitimate expectations, the absence of bad faith, and the
requirements that the conduct of the State be transparent, consistent and non-discriminatory

and not based on unjustifiable distinctions or arbitrary.?”!

The Tribunal does not accept the interpretation of Respondent, which reduces the FET clause
of Article 2(1) of the 1980 BIT to minimum standard of treatment or to prohibit denial of
justice. Respondent’s arguments find no basis in Article 2(1) of the 1980 BIT nor in the object
and purpose of the 1980 BIT. Respondent can also not rely on jurisprudence. The Tribunal is
aware of the jurisprudence of Ahmonseto v. Egypt.?” In the view of the Tribunal, this
jurisprudence focuses on arbitrariness and discrimination and not on the applicability of the

FET clause as a whole. In the view of the Tribunal, the FET clause has a broader scope.

Case 1:20-cv-02169 Document 1-1 Filed 08/07/20 Page 72 of 177

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

The Tribunal notes that the arguments advanced by Claimant in support of his claim that
Respondent has violated the FET clause touch upon the elements of fair trial and due process
and are identical to the arguments used to establish that the measures undertaken by

Respondent amounted to an indirect expropriation of Claimant’s investment.

The Tribunal is of the view, as already expressed above, that the measures taken against
Claimant and the two companies were not proportional considering that it was Claimant who
was charged and not his family and the Companies. However, Claimant was not able to
establish convincingly that the measures taken against him were motivated by malicious
intent and in violation of the applicable rules as referred to in the award in Ahmonseto v.
Egypt. The reference to newspaper reports upon which Claimant relies to prove that the
actions of Respondent were politically motivated is not enough to prove Respondent’s
improper conduct. Apart from that, the Tribunal cannot fail to note that ADEMCO and
AISCO were not financed in a manner that was transparent from the outside. Even for
Claimant it was difficult to establish the flow of capital and the fact that the funds invested
originated from his private funds. In any event, the Supreme State Security Court found that
the CMA had approved and confirmed in 1998 that the payment had been made. Therefore,

the investigation was unfounded ab initio.

However, it is beyond doubt for the Tribunal that the investigations against Claimant and the
Companies were not guided by the principle of fair trial; on the contrary, Claimant was a
victim of denial of justice. Denial of justice has been recognised to include the entire criminal
process, not only the trial, and an eventual acquittal of an investor is not dispositive of
whether denial of justice occurred. In international law, denial of justice covers the actions of
the prosecution before trial, the trial itself, and post-trial actions. Prosecutorial misconduct, or
malicious prosecution, fits neatly into the standard of denial of justice, and breaches the FET

standard of treatment.

Claimant was arrested even before the time had elapsed for him to clarify whether the
payment to MD had been made by Claimant on behalf of ADEMCO. Even after the fact of
the payment was established, the prosecution did not drop the case against Claimant. The
Tribunal is aware that Article 2(1) of the 1980 BIT refers to the “laws and regulations” of the
host State as potential limitations of the applicability of the FET clause, but the Tribunal

cannot accept that such disregard of the principle of fair trial was common in Egypt.

That Claimant was a victim of denial of justice is also based on the observations of the

Supreme State Security Court of Egypt. The court determined that the proceeding against

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

Claimant was a “clear example of fumbling, defectiveness, retrenchment and failure, and the
absence of a scientific methodology in the making and taking of decisions [].” The review of
the process by Egypt’s Supreme State Security Court reveals that Claimant’s arrest,
prosecution, and incarceration lacked any probable cause, and were an irregular prosecutorial
proceeding, performed arbitrarily, in bad faith, with a wilful disregard of any obligation to
provide reasonable due diligence in the application of due process of law. All these acts or
omissions by the prosecution constitute elements of denial of justice. Respondent has not
advanced any reason to doubt the objectivity of the factual assessment of that court and its

reasoning.

On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has violated the clause as contained in
Article 2(1) of the 1980 BIT. It shall deal with the consequential compensation in Part
VIILB.S.

The Tribunal takes note of the fact that the CMA confirmed, after reviewing all the originals
of the documents, that the sum of DEM 54 million was paid by Claimant to MD. The
Supreme State Security Court then concluded that the oral testimonies and statements
presented by the prosecution were no more than “enquires, or conclusions or personal
opinion,” showing lack of certainty, knowledge, conviction and conclusiveness.?”* Egypt’s
Supreme State Security Court strongly criticised the lower court for convicting Claimant
based on lack of evidence, which the Supreme State Security Court concluded was contrary to

the basic expectation and demand of any citizen from a functioning justice system.?”

The Tribunal notes the Supreme State Security Court’s assessments of the testimonies
provided during trial, which resulted in the conclusion that the evidence provided by
Claimant, obviously available to the prosecution, “revealed the truth of this debt and provide
[sic] adequate evidence that it was paid.”?”° Such evidence included a confirmation of the
payment by the local agent of MD during the investigation by the public prosecutor (No. 5)
and a letter from the company itself (No. 3). This letter proves the irregularity and
arbitrariness in arresting Claimant before the deadline for providing the evidence contained in
this letter had even passed. Even absent the premature arrest, this letter as well as other
evidence cited by the Supreme State Security Court refuting the probable cause against

Claimant, was available to the prosecution, which disregarded it.

Case 1:20-cv-02169 Document 1-1 Filed 08/07/20 Page 74 of 177

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

The Tribunal not only refutes the reasoning of Respondent, which aims at limiting the scope
of protection of the FET clause, it also, for the above reasons, disagrees with the argument
that the domestic court proceedings against Claimant were justified. Finally, the Tribunal
cannot accept the statement that ADEMCO and AISCO could have appointed an alternative
chairperson. Such a statement cannot be reconciled with the fact that the sites of ADEMCO
and AISCO were closed, access to the site was prohibited, and the assets of both Companies

were frozen.

Based on the above, the Tribunal concludes that the treatment of Claimant by the prosecution
and the lower courts, even disregarding the treatment he received after his acquittal,
constituted a violation of the obligations under the FET clause of Article 2(1) of the
1980 BIT.

D. BREACHES PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 2(2) OF THE 1980 BIT
Claimant’s Position

Claimant argues that under the MEN provision in Article 2(2) of the 1980 BIT, he is entitled
to obtain the benefit of the most favourable treatment Respondent accords to foreign investors
in its other investment treaties.” Article 2(2) of the 1980 BIT states that “[i]nvestments by
nationals of either Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State shall not be
subjected to a treatment less favourable than that accorded to investments by nationals or

companies of third States.”

Claimant accordingly invokes Article 3(1) (no impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures and full physical security and protection), Article 3(2) (national treatment), and
Article 3(4) (observance of obligations) of the Netherlands-Egypt BIT, and Article 2(2) (full
protection and security) of the Korea-Egypt BIT.?””

Claimant argues that the MFN provision in the 1980 BIT should not be interpreted as
Respondent suggests: there is nothing in Article 2(2) that indicates that standards that are not
already contained in the 1980 BIT cannot be imported from other treaties.?”* Claimant argues
that the cases upon which Respondent relies consider MFN clauses that are materially

different to Article 2(2) of the 1980 BIT and therefore those precedent are irrelevant to this

case.*” Claimant argues that in Teinver v. Argentina, the tribunal read the MFN clause
narrowly on account of the following wording, which is absent in Article 2(2) of the
1980 BIT: “[i]n all matters governed by this A such shall be no less
favourable than that accorded by each Party to investments made in its territory by investors
of a third country.””*° Claimant distinguishes the narrow interpretation of the MFN clause by
the tribunal in Paushok v. Mongolia, on the basis that (i) the tribunal’s decision was based on
the specific treaty text, and (ii) the tribunal acknowledged that MFN clauses have generally
been interpreted broadly to allow the importation of substantive protections from other
treaties.?*' Claimant similarly distinguishes the findings of the /¢kale v. Turkmenistan tribunal
as being limited to the particular wording of the MFN clause in that case.?*? Claimant
contends, consistent with the ejusdem generis principle, that the Tribunal should apply the
general approach to the interpretation of Article 2(2), which has been adopted by several
investment tribunals, and allow Claimant to rely on substantive standards not contained in the

1980 BIT.*%

Respondent’s Position

Referring to arbitral case law and the ejusdem generis principle, Respondent argues that the
MEN clause in Article 2(2) of the 1980 BIT can only be used by Claimant to import
investment protection standards that are already contained in the 1980 BIT, not entirely new
standards that are not otherwise contained in the treaty.*** Respondent refers to Article 9(1) of

the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on MEN Clauses, which states that under

a MEN clause, “the beneficiary State acquires, for itself or for the benefit of persons or things
in a determined relationship with it, only those rights which fall within the limits of the
subject-matter of the clause.” **° Respondent points out that the International Law
Commission’s Commentary on this draft article explains that unless the MFN process is
“strictly confined to cases where there is a substantial identity between the subject matter of
the two sets of clauses concerned, the result in a number of cases may be to impose upon the
granting State obligations it never contemplated.”?*° Respondent explains that Article 2(2),
being part of a specifically negotiated bilateral agreement, cannot be applied in a mechanical

way, or as MEN clauses are applied in trade law.?*”

Respondent distinguishes the cases presented by Claimant where MFN clauses were used to
import protections that were absent in the treaty underlying the arbitration.*** Respondent
submits that in Bayindir v. Pakistan the MEN clause was used to invoke FET provisions, but
there was a reference to FET in the preamble of the base treaty.”*° Respondent notes that the
awards in EDF v. Argentina and Arif v. Moldova have been criticised for their treatment of
the MFN clause.” Respondent argues that the findings of the tribunal in White Industries v.
India cannot be applied to the present case because that tribunal was faced with denial of
justice.””! Respondent states that the tribunal in Devas v. India only imported the “full legal

protection and security” standard because the respondent did not invoke the ejusdem generis

principle.”

Therefore, Respondent argues that the Tribunal should reject Claimant’s attempt to import the
following standards from the Netherlands-Egypt BIT and Korea-Egypt BIT: (i) non-

impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures; (ii) the national treatment standard;

and (iii) observance of obligations full protection and security.”

Tribunal’s Analysis

Having determined that Respondent has breached Articles 2(1) and 3(1) of the 1980 BIT, the
Tribunal does not consider it necessary to rule on Claimant’s alternative arguments based
upon the MFN clause under Article 2(2) of the 1980 BIT with the view to expand the

investment protection under the 1980 BIT.

BREACHES OF THE 2004 BIT

As noted above, in line with the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Decision, the substantive provisions
of the 1980 BIT will be applied to actions that took place before 5 February 2005, and the
substantive provisions of the 2004 BIT will be applied to actions that took place after
5 February 2005.7"

Claimant argues that Respondent breached the expropriation and FET protections contained

in the 2004 BIT. Respondent denies Claimant’s allegations.

A. EXPROPRIATION
Claimant's Position

Claimant argues that, should the Tribunal find that there was no expropriation by
5 February 2005, Respondent’s conduct after 5 February 2005 would by itself, or taken with

prior conduct, amount to expropriation and a breach of Article 5 of the 2004 BIT.”

Claimant argues that, after the 2004 BIT came into force, Respondent failed to lift the
Freezing Order and restore the Companies’ assets and the Project site. Claimant highlights
that despite the Freezing Order being lifted, the Companies were deprived of the benefit of
their assets, which were stripped of all improvements and movable properties while under

Respondent’s custody.’ Claimant has no access to the Companies’ bank accounts, and the

Companies’ movable assets have disappeared.”°*

Claimant emphasises that he is not under an obligation to exhaust local remedies before

approaching this Tribunal.” He clarifies that he never announced that he intended to return

to the Project.

Respondent's Position

Respondent contends that the events between February 2000 and February 2005 do not meet

the standards for indirect expropriation as set out in Paragraphs 21 1-216.°"'

Respondent argues that the criminal proceedings associated with the payments to MD lasted

302

2.5 years and therefore were not permanent or long-term. “* Respondent clarifies that

Claimant remained in jail for three years after his acquittal in the matter concerning payment
to MD, on account of another three-year sentence, which it notes that Claimant has not
criticised in this arbitration.*”* Respondent argues that the failure to lift the travel ban and the
Freezing Order does not meet the high standard of indirect expropriation, because these
measures were lifted as soon as Claimant submitted the necessary requests before the
authorities in an appropriate form.*4 Respondent states that it cannot take responsibility for

the delays caused by the rejection of Claimant’s initial requests to lift the travel ban and

305

Freezing Order, which were not compliant with the applicable procedures.*”” Respondent

argues that no indirect expropriation on account of Claimant’s detention or the investigation
into payments due to MD has been established.*° In any event, Respondent points out that

Claimant could have avoided any damage to his business due to his imprisonment by simply

307

producing the proof of transfer of funds to MD that was requested by the CMA.

Respondent argues that the sole conduct to be assessed pursuant to the 2004 BIT is the

alleged failure of Respondent to restore the Companies’ assets following the lifting of the

Freezing Order.*°* Respondent submits that Claimant has presented insufficient evidence that
the Companies do not have access to their assets and bank accounts and notes that the
Companies have not approached the Egyptian courts seeking any relief in this regard.*”
Respondent notes that Claimant has presented his correspondence with banks confirming that
the Companies’ bank accounts are frozen as evidence of his inability to access the

Companies’ bank accounts, but notes that this is insufficient to establish an expropriation

  

claim.*!° Moreover, Respondent notes that Claimant did not raise this issue in 2011 when he

 

announced that he would continue work on the Project.*!!
Respondent maintains that the Project was abandoned as early as March 2000 (the month
after Claimant’s arrest) as evidenced in letters sent by Mr Verdier, and therefore the Project’s

discontinuance was not caused by Respondent.*!?

Respondent suggests that the decision to
discontinue the Project could be because its feasibility had not been demonstrated as at

February 2000.*"

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal notes that there is a disagreement between the Parties as to when the Project was
finally abandoned. Respondent relies upon the letter of Mr Verdier whereas Claimant
considers activities and omissions by Respondent after the entry into force of the 2004 BIT
also to be of relevance. The Tribunal holds that the indirect expropriation took place with the
arrest of Claimant and the Freezing Order of his, his families’ and the Companies’ bank
accounts. The Tribunal would like to emphasise that it was not the letter of Mr Verdier, which
ended Claimant’s Project. Mr Verdier’s letter only informed the partners of the actions taken
by Respondent. However, the Tribunal finds that acts or omissions of Respondent after the
entry into force of the 2004 BIT were not material in constituting indirect expropriation; they
constituted the continuation in time of acts against the investment of Claimant. On that basis,
the Tribunal holds that Claimant cannot invoke Article 5 of the 2004 BIT concerning indirect
expropriation, because the expropriation had already taken place.

B. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
Claimant's Position

Claimant submits that Respondent is in continuing breach of Article 2(2) of the 2004 BIT.*"4
Claimant argues that, despite his acquittal by the Supreme State Security Court on
11 June 2002, he was not released from prison until March 2003, he was subject to a travel
ban until June 2005, and his assets remained frozen until October 2006.*!° Further, he notes
that Respondent continues to deny him access to the Project site and maintains the Freezing

Order against the Companies.*"°

Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that Claimant has not established how the alleged conduct violates the
stringent FET standard.?!’ Respondent submits that a freezing order is a standard measure
under Egyptian law (and in other legal systems) that, being temporary, cannot constitute a
treaty breach.*!* Respondent points out that the Companies took no steps to challenge the

Freezing Order when it was in force.*!

Respondent contends that, even if the Tribunal finds that the Freezing Order against Claimant
should have been lifted sooner, this is not sufficient to find a breach of the FET standard.*”°
Respondent argues that Claimant has not established how the Freezing Order impacted the
Project, particularly since he had bank accounts abroad that could have facilitated investment

in the Project.*?! Respondent further argues that Claimant has not shown how his inability to

travel on account of the travel ban impacted the Project.*””

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal wishes to state at the outset that the 2004 BIT only covers acts or omissions of
Respondent that took place after the 2004 BIT entered into force. Therefore, the release of

Claimant only in March 2003 falls under the 1980 BIT. However, his travel ban until

23 December 2019

June 2005, the freezing of Claimant’s assets until October 2006, the denial of Claimant’s
access to the Project site, and the maintenance of the Freezing Order against the Companies
may be assessed under the 2004 BIT. Claimant invokes the violation of the FET clause of the
2004 BIT.

Article 2(2) of the 2004 BIT reads:

Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and full
and constant protection and security.

The Tribunal notes that Article 2(2) of the 2004 BIT addresses investors and investments
alike and that Claimant, in spite of having been released from prison already in June,
remained subject to a travel ban until 2005. Further, Claimant’s bank accounts remained

frozen until October 2006 and the bank accounts of the Companies are still frozen.

Respondent offers no convincing justification for not lifting these limitations on Claimant and
on his investment. The Tribunal is not convinced by the argument that Claimant had bank
accounts abroad and could have used those to conduct his business. Whether such a
possibility really existed is not the point; what matters is that Claimant did not have access to
his funds in Egypt until 2006, nor to the Companies’ funds till date. Apart from that, Claimant
had no access to the site. The Tribunal cannot believe—and no reliable information has been
produced by Respondent to that extent—that such treatment of an accused who has been

acquitted is normal under Egyptian law.

On the basis of the above, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent violated its obligation

under Article 2(2) of the 2004 BIT vis-a-vis Claimant.

C. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE 2004 BIT
Claimant’s Position

Claimant contends that Respondent violated Article 2(2) of the 2004 BIT, which states that
“TeJach Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party ... full and constant protection and

security”.*7

Claimant contends that Respondent violated Article 2(3) of the 2004 BIT, which states that:

Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory impair by unreasonable or arbitrary measures

the acquisi ion, operation, use, enj and sale
or other disposal of investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.*°+

Claimant contends that Respondent violated Article 2(1) of the 2004 BIT, which states that:

Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their
investments, a treatment no less favourable than the treatment it accords to its own
investors and their investments with respect to the acquisition, expansion, operation,
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and sale or other disposal of investments.*?>

Claimant contends that Respondent violated Article 12(2) of the 2004 BIT, which states that
“[eJach Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have with regard to a

specific investment of an investor of the other Contracting Party.”*?°

Respondent’s Position

No specific arguments on these points are made by Respondent.

Tribunal’s Analysis

As stated already in Sections V.B, V.C, and VI.B above, the activities of Respondent directed
against the investment of Claimant are to be dealt with under the 1980 BIT and under
Article 3(1) of the 2004 BIT. Article 12(1) of the 2004 BIT does not offer, in the view of the

Tribunal, an additional legal basis to support the claims of Claimant.

BREACHES OF THE EGYPTIAN INVESTMENT LAW

Claimant’s Position

Claimant contends that Respondent breached Articles 8 and 9 of the Egyptian Investment
Law by virtue of the conduct set out in Paragraphs 203 and 236 above. *?? Claimant
emphasises that Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law is available not only to companies.
He explains that Article 8, which provides that “companies may not be nationalized or
confiscated,” would be rendered ineffective if only the nationalised entity (rather than the

owners of the entity) could avail themselves of relief.*** Moreover, Claimant notes that the

Egyptian Investment Law refers to investors at various points (including in the dispute

resolution provision, Article 7).*”°

Claimant highlights that Respondent made it impossible for the Companies to pursue their
business.* As Egyptian law protects against direct and indirect deprivation of ownership,

Claimant argues that he is entitled to bring a claim under Article 8.°*!

Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument that the Freezing Order was lawful because it was
imposed by administrative means.**? He argues that the Companies, having independent legal
personality, should never have been subject to the Freezing Order that arose out of an
investigation pertaining to Claimant and notes that he still cannot access the Companies’ bank
accounts because the Freezing Order continues to operate on the Companies.**7

Claimant argues that Respondent breached Article 12 by coercing Claimant to obtain
Egyptian nationality.** Claimant notes that Respondent does not contest that it breached
Article 12 if Claimant’s factual allegations are proven.** Claimant notes that Respondent
does not factually contest Claimant’s account of his being coerced to take on Egyptian
nationality. ° Claimant considers the letter from the Minister of Trade and Industry
suggesting that Respondent has never forced anyone to take on Egyptian nationality to be
self-serving.**’ Claimant notes that his use of Egyptian nationality at the borders does not
speak to the circumstances in which this nationality was acquired.*** Moreover, Claimant
notes that he usually used his Finnish passport and only used his Egyptian passport when
travelling with Egyptian officials.*”

Claimant criticises Respondent’s reliance on the SAC Judgment on the matter of his
acquisition of Egyptian nationality. “° Claimant argues that the Finnish Supreme

Administrative Court is only competent to decide Claimant’s Finnish nationality, not the

circumstances in which Claimant acquired his Egyptian nationality.“

Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that its conduct does not give rise to a breach of the Egyptian Investment

Law.”

Respondent submits that the plain text of Articles 8, 9, and 12 indicates that the
Egyptian Investment Law only applies to “companies and firms” and not to the owners or
shareholders of the same.*“? Therefore, according to Respondent, any wrongful acts alleged
against Claimant or his family and personal assets falls outside the scope of the Egyptian

Investment Law.**

Referring back to its arguments on expropriation, Respondent contends that it did not breach
Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law because it did not nationalise or confiscate the
Companies. *° It argues that ownership of the Companies was never transferred to
Respondent; Claimant is today a shareholder of ADEMCO and of AISCO and can freely

transfer his shares in the Companies.*4°

Again, referring back to its arguments on expropriation, Respondent argues that it did not
breach Article 9 of the Egyptian Investment Law because it did not sequester, attach, seize,
distrain, freeze or confiscate any asset of the Companies by administrative means. *47
Respondent notes that the Freezing Order was not issued by administrative means but was
issued as part of the criminal investigation conducted against Claimant. ** Respondent
highlights, moreover, that Claimant never challenged the Freezing Order before the Egyptian

courts and that the Freezing Order was temporary.*””

Respondent denies that it breached Article 12 of the Egyptian Investment Law by coercing
Claimant to apply for Egyptian nationality in 1997 but maintains that Claimant voluntarily

applied to regain his nationality in order to avail of the opportunity to invest in the Aswan

region.**° Respondent states that Claimant has not before in these proceedings contested his
nationality based on coercion and that Claimant repeatedly travelled abroad on his Egyptian
passport.**! For its position that Claimant had voluntarily applied for Egyptian nationality,
Respondent relies on the Finnish Administrative Court’s decision of 26 January 2015.*?
Respondent submits that the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland confirmed that “there
is no reason to consider that [Claimant] has obtained Egyptian citizenship otherwise than
upon his own voluntary application.”3*? Respondent argues that the Supreme Administrative
Court’s findings on Claimant’s voluntary acquisition of Egyptian nationality should bind this
Tribunal in the same manner that its findings regarding Claimant’s dual nationality bound this

Tribunal at the jurisdiction phase of this arbitration.**4

Respondent argues that Claimant has not provided any new evidence of Egypt coercing him
to acquire Egyptian nationality and that Claimant only relies on ex post facto witness
testimony from the jurisdiction phase to support his argumentation.**> Respondent points out
that Claimant presents Mr Reda as a key supporter of the Project while at the same time
suggesting that he contemporaneously forced Claimant to acquire Egyptian nationality.**°
Respondent notes that Claimant has introduced new allegations of threat and coercion by Mr
Reda in his later witness statements (that are absent in the early witness statements), which
calls into question the authenticity of his claims.**” Respondent argues that the record is clear
that Claimant was not coerced by Mr Reda to take Egyptian nationality. *** Respondent
emphasises that any procedural irregularities that occurred in the taking of Claimant’s

Egyptian nationality in 1997 cannot constitute a violation of the Egyptian Investment Law.*?

Respondent also notes inconsistencies in Claimant’s witness statements about when and

whether he called the Finnish authorities after he had been informed that his Egyptian

nationality was restored. **° Respondent argues that the record suggests that the Finnish
immigration authorities did not know that Claimant had lost his Egyptian nationality in 1980
(making him Finnish) and acquired his Egyptian nationality in 1997 (thus, losing his Finnish
nationality).**' Respondent argues that Claimant could only have a legitimate expectation of
Finnish nationality, as set out by the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland, if he had been
transparent with the Finnish authorities about the changes to his nationality, which he was

not.362

Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law states that “[c]ompanies and firms may not be
nationalised or confiscated.” * Article 9 of the Egyptian Investment Law states that
“[c]ompanies and firms may not be sequestered or have their assets attached, seized,
distrained, frozen or confiscated by administrative means.”** Article 12 of the Egyptian
Investment Law states that “[c]ompanies and firms shall be entitled to acquire the necessary
building land and built properties to carry on or expand their business, whatever the
nationality, domiciles or percentage participation of the partners.”*°

Inasmuch as the Tribunal has already concluded that the treaty was breached, the issues raised

in connection with the domestic legislation are moot and there is no need to consider them.

Accordingly, Claimant’s request for a declaration that Respondent has violated Articles 8, 9,
and 12 of the Egyptian Investment Law is dismissed. The Tribunal nevertheless notes that
Claimant makes essentially the same substantive arguments pursuant to Article 8 and 9 of the
Egyptian Investment Law as he does pursuant to the expropriation provisions of the 1980 BIT
(Article 3(1)) and that the Tribunal has found at Paragraphs 217-232 that Respondent violated
Article 3(1) of the 1980 BIT and is entitled to relief for such violations.

Report”), the first expert report of Dr John Willis, and the expert report of Dr Jiirgen Cappel.

A. VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT
Claimant’s Position

Claimant denies Respondent’s allegation that the Project was not feasible.*°

Claimant argues that the Project Partners (who were large international companies with
stringent professional obligations) were confident about the viability of the Project. **
Claimant clarifies that the Project Partners left the Project due to the air of hostility around the
Project, not on account of its lack of viability.** Claimant submits that Mr Verdier, who was
the most knowledgeable about the Project, was convinced of its viability, even after

Mr Bahgat’s arrest.*°°

Claimant argues that Respondent’s criticism of the viability of the Project contradicts its
contemporaneous promotion of the Project.*” Claimant recalls that, to assuage concerns
about iron ore shortages, the EGSMA published a report in October 1998 estimating the

presence of 100 million tons of geological reserves in Egypt after conducting extensive

studies.*”' Several key political figures in Egypt publicly confirmed the presence of iron ore
in Aswan and private sector participation was welcomed for its development,*” in the hope
that “a large investment project to extract iron ore would be established”*”* that would
provide economic benefits for the region.*” Claimant submits that the Egyptian government,
in particular the Prime Minister and Mr Reda, encouraged him to develop the Project.*”°
Claimant adds that the Project received several incentives under the Egyptian Investment Law
and the Concession Agreement and that the Egyptian government built two roads for the
Project.*”° The Egyptian government’s support, according to Claimant, was clear at the
inauguration of the Project that was telecasted, widely reported, and attended by key
government officials.*77 Mr Reda and President Mubarak expressly approved the Project and
its partners. ** Claimant, ADEMCO representatives, and representatives of the Project
Partners noted at its inauguration that the Project was made possible by the support and
policies of the government.*” Claimant explains that, at the time of and immediately after the
inauguration of the Project, he was in discussions with the government regarding the
provision of water and power and the construction of a railway line connecting the Project site
to Aswan.**°

Claimant submits that the SRK Report’s references to other ores used elsewhere at other
times by other projects are not relevant to the Project.**! Claimant argues that the Egyptian
government, financiers, foreign consultants, and foreign industry partners were confident of
the viability of the Project up until February 2000.**?

mine was feasible, and EGSMA had concluded that the Aswan region had a number of sites
with “good geological reserves and high iron ore grade.”*** Claimant notes that the UEC
Study was a steel plant project feasibility study, not a mining feasibility study, but notes that
the UEC Study and the Met-Chem Report supported the feasibility of the mineral resource
and reserve estimates at the Project site.*** Claimant maintains that the UEC Study and the
Met-Chem Report described technical information regarding exploration (including mineral
resource and reserve estimates, mine planning and scheduling, metallurgical test work,
beneficiation work, and capital and operating costs estimates for mining and beneficiating the

iron ore for the Project).*8°

1. Mining

Claimant denies Respondent’s argument that there was not sufficient ore to run the steel plant
for 20 years.**° Claimant notes that EGSMA found 137 million tonnes of confirmed reserves
across five numbered areas of Claimant’s Concession,**’ which would run the steel plant for
over 30 years.*** The UEC Study, after conducting exploration work in the relevant areas,
suggested that there were almost 67 million tonnes of mineral reserves in the possible,
probable, and proven categories. **? Met-Chem had provided a plan concerning iron ore
mining that not only identified sufficient resources for 23 years of production to produce
1.435 metric tons per year of steel billets, but also noted that there was greater potential in the

area.*”°

Claimant notes that Met-Chem’s finding of 67 million tonnes of reserves was only reflective
of work done up until July that year, was subject to further investigations being conducted at

the end of 1999, and was in respect of work that was interrupted by the expropriation.*”!

result, it was not on the ground collecting the information used in its report.
Mr Verdier testifies, there might have been gaps between the discovery of reserves and their
reflection in the Met-Chem reports.*** Claimant submits that the Tribunal should take into
account the other reserves that were identified between July 1999 and the expropriation in
February 2000.*°5 Claimant notes that Respondent’s expert, Dr Armitage, admitted to not
having reviewed the EGSMA materials, which casts doubt upon his testimony.*”° Further,
Claimant submits that even the “possible reserves” set out in the Met-Chem Report already

had attained a high level of confidence.*””

Mr Verdier further testifies that Dr Walter Schiebel, a German mining specialist, was
assessing resources in parallel to Met-Chem and had found reserves in area 8 of the
concession area.*°* Mr Verdier states that in February 2000, the assessment of reserves and
resources was to be accelerated in order to find ores of higher quality.*°? Claimant argues that
the Tribunal cannot accept that the other areas of the Concession (that were partly explored or
unexplored) would fail to produce ore, because this is contrary to EGSMA’s estimate of the

confirmed reserves and the work of Dr Schiebel.“”

Claimant argues that Respondent’s suggestion that some of the reserves discovered were

outside the Concession is a belated argument and was not put to Mr Bahgat or Mr Verdier on

cross-examination.“!

Claimant suggests that the Tribunal should not rely solely on the views of Dr Armitage and
reject the aforementioned, positive evaluations of the reserves provided by those individuals
and entities that were most closely involved with the concession area (Met-Chem, EGSMA,

and UEC).*
Claimant notes that Respondent relies on a contemporaneous study by British Steel. Claimant

argues that the British Steel study cannot be relied upon because it is not on the record, it was

produced after Claimant fell out of favour with Respondent’s government, and it post-dates

403

the dispute between the Parties.*°’ Claimant submits that Dr Armitage has been retained for

the purposes of this arbitration, does not have contemporaneous knowledge of the Project, and

has not read the record fully.“ Claimant suggests that Dr Armitage’s evidence is less about

available reserves and more targeted towards discrediting the DCF method of valuation.*”°

Claimant maintains that the reports on the Project, in line with contemporaneous codes and
practices, extensively described the necessary technical information regarding “exploration;
mineral resource and reserve estimates; mine planning and scheduling; metallurgical test

work; beneficiation work; and capital and operating costs estimates for mining and

beneficiating the iron ore.”4°°

2. Beneficiation

Claimant acknowledges that the iron ore in Aswan has low iron content, but notes that

Claimant and the Project Partners were working on increasing the iron content and reducing

phosphorus.*””

Addressing Respondent’s questions regarding the beneficiation process to be used at the
Project, Claimant explains that they planned to use well-known beneficiation processes and to
attack the phosphorus content at multiple points in the process sequences.*** Claimant submits

that the iron ore could be beneficiated further than 1.3% phosphorus and that this was not a

major project cost.

Claimant argues that after several rounds of testing, CMRDI and Met-Chem identified the
basic beneficiation techniques for the Aswan ores.*!° Claimant notes that CMRDI and Centre
de Recherche minérale (“CRM”) (instructed by Met-Chem) identified two beneficiation
methods: wet high-gradient magnetic separation and roasting followed by wet low intensity
magnetic separation.*!! Both of these processes achieved an upgrade in iron content and
reduction in phosphorus.*!? Claimant notes that contemporaneous documents suggest that the

focus of the beneficiation was the increase in iron grade, not the reduction of phosphorus

413

content.*!* The CRM studies showed an iron content of 54.3% in Aswan ores and in early

2000, completed beneficiation work showed iron content of 56%.*"*

Claimant explains that in late 1999 he had engaged Studiengesellschaft fiir
Eisenerzaufbereitung (“SGA”), a German company, and Svedala, a Swedish company, to
finalise the beneficiation process. *'’ Claimant argues that SGA and Svedala, based on
meetings with representatives in Egypt and observing trials by CMRDI at the Abu Tatur pilot
plant, indicated that they could develop viable beneficiation processes that would likely be
more effective than the beneficiation tests that were conducted up until that point by the local

Abu Tatur plant.*'° Claimant notes that Dr Willis (Respondent’s expert) agreed that SGA

might have been able to achieve an iron concentration of 55 to 60%.*!”

this understanding, relying on technical papers.*!

Claimant argues that the Project would have been viable based on its 54% iron level and
assumed phosphorus levels.*”° This is because the plant could process iron ore at 50.25% iron
and 1.65% phosphorus (which results the wet high-gradient magnetic separation could
achieve).””! According to Claimant, Respondent’s expert, Dr Willis, confirms this point.*??
Mr Verdier clarifies that he was disappointed by the pilot plant testing resulting in 50.25%
iron content, but did not have any concerns about the suitability of the ore for the steel
plant.*?3

Addressing Respondent’s argument regarding uncertainty of operating costs for the
beneficiation, Claimant notes that beneficiation was not expected to be a major cost for the
Project: the CMRDI projected beneficiation costs at up to USD 12 per ton, however this cost
could have been absorbed by the Project given the low operational costs of the Project and the

government incentives.‘

In summary, Claimant argues that the Project had a clear vision of what would be required to
process the iron ore. “ However, due to his arrest, the Companies could not complete the

further stages of the development.
3. Steel-making

Claimant submits that the steel plant would have been a modern one and most of the technical
work was in place by February 2000.*”° Claimant notes that the process envisaged was to use
a basic oxygen furnace and the “double slagging”, which was quite a common process used in
several plants across the world and is considered to be technically feasible.*?’ Claimant notes

that the technical and financial feasibility of the Project is not in question, Respondent’s

expert, Dr Cappel, only questions the design of the plant.*?°

According to Claimant, iron ore with high phosphorus content can still be used for the
production of steel, noting that oolitic iron ores have been processed successfully across the

world.“

Claimant submits that the criticisms levied by Respondent’s steel expert, Dr Cappel, are
unfounded. First, Claimant submits that Dr Cappel ignored that the Annex to the ADEMCO-

MD Contract did in fact deal with performance guarantees and sets out the basis and rates for

liquidated damages.**°

Second, Claimant denies that 100% concentrated ore cannot be used in the sinter plant.**!
Mr Verdier confirmed this in his testimony.**? Further, Claimant recalls that Dr Cappel agreed

that the plant could operate on 100% sinter if micropelletising technology was used in the

sinter plant package, which was in fact the case with the Project.

Third, Claimant denies that an additional basic oxygen furnace would be needed to
accommodate the double slag process.** Claimant notes that the Parties’ experts agree that
the double slag process is well established to process high-phosphorus ores and that

historically a third basic oxygen furnace was not necessary.**°

Fourth, Claimant denies Dr Cappel’s argument that a lime injection system was required for
the basic oxygen furnace and notes that Dr Cappel has been inconsistent regarding the

possible cost of the lime injection system. Mr Verdier also confirmed Claimant’s argument

that a lime injection system was envisaged in the First ADEMCO-MD Contract.**’

Fifth, Claimant denies Dr Cappel’s suggestion that there were insufficient slag pots for the

plant, noting that the ADEMCO-MD Contract calculated the number of slag pots necessary

for the project.1**

Claimant argues that the SRK Report analyses the Project for its potential as a global
competitive project, whilst it was actually a smaller scale project.*° Claimant argues that the
Project saved costs by using local raw materials and labour (which the SRK Report
disregards).“° Claimant notes that the plant was in the same location as the iron ore, which
was a cost benefit to the Project.**! Claimant notes that Dr Cappel agrees with this cost

analysis. “7

Claimant submits that there is agreement that the construction of a railway line, a water
pipeline, and a gas pipeline was feasible, but the Parties differ on who would pay the resulting

443

costs. Claimant notes that the various suppliers would themselves pay for these

pipelines.“

Claimant states that the discussions with Arbed were not terminated. The negotiations with
Arbed were suspended until an agreement with MD was reached as to the issue of a

performance guarantee for the old factory.“

Respondent’s Position

Respondent rejects Claimant’s claim for damages outright, arguing that the mine at Aswan
was never economically feasible in light of its location, disposition, and composition of the

iron ore, and that therefore, the Project had no value without the mine.“

Respondent argues that Egypt’s support of the Project was in no way a guarantee of its
feasibility.” Respondent contends that EGSMA’s search for iron in the early 1990s was

focused on assessing the geological content of the ground and did not confirm the feasibility

of any project.* Whilst Egypt publicised the mining opportunities in Aswan in order to
attract investors and generate job and development opportunities in the Aswan region, it never
guaranteed the feasibility of Claimant’s Project.*“° Citing the First SRK Report, Respondent
explains that it is not unusual for a State to simply identify potential resources and seek out

investors, and not conduct any further feasibility studies.*°° Respondent maintains that it was

 

Claimant’s responsibility to determine the feasibility of the Project.**' Respondent highlights

that the concession awarded to Claimant covered “the search for, exploitation and

 

manufacture of iron ore in the east and south east region of Aswan” and such search included
a verification of “the existence or potential existence of iron ore” and “determining the iron
ore, its quantities, characteristics, means of extraction, breaking, grounding, treating, melting,
purifying and marketing and feasibility studies related thereof.”**? Respondent explains that
the concession required Claimant to conduct a search phase for a year and then submit a

453

conclusive feasibility study.*°’ Respondent notes that the feasibility of the Project could only

have become clear after this search phase.*™4

Respondent maintains that, had a proper study been conducted by Claimant, the Project would

have been abandoned.** Respondent clarifies that it does not allege that Claimant failed to

produce a feasibility report pursuant to Article 4, but that Claimant’s feasibility studies do not

show that the iron ore at Aswan could be economically exploited.**°

Respondent relies on the cancellation of the “premature” First ADEMCO-MD Contract and
the conclusion of the Second ADEMCO-MD Contract as contemporaneous evidence that the
Project was not moving forward as planned.**” Moreover, Respondent points to the lack of
evidence that all payments under the Second ADEMCO-MD Contract were made by

Claimant.*** Respondent submits that the Project Partners did not have confidence in the

 

feasibility of the Project, noting the absence of witness evidence from the Project Partners in

support of the Project*?

ADEMCO Shareholder Agreement.* Respondent highlights that on 14 January 2000, MD

and that none of the Project Partners made payments pursuant to the

raised questions about the beneficiation of iron ore and efforts made towards funding the

Project.**!
Respondent relies on the First SRK Report, which demonstrates that the UEC Study (upon
which the Inglis Report relies to assess damages) is not comprehensive and is at best a

preliminary study.“ Respondent argues that a feasibility study is:

a detailed technical and economic study of a mining project the aim of which is to
demonstrate the technical and economic viability of a project to a sufficient level so as to
enable the owners of that project to make a decision on whether or not to construct the
project and also provide enough certainty in the economic returns to enable a lender or
investor to provide sufficient finance to fund [the] construction.“

Respondent argues that the UEC Study does not meet this standard because it does not
provide satisfactory solutions for the extraction and beneficiation of the iron ore, nor for the
transportation of raw materials (e.g. limestone and coal) required for the factory. “*
Dr Dagdalen in his testimony confirmed that Section 4 of the UEC Study would not, by itself,
comprise a feasibility study, because it is based on reserves of all categories, not just probable

and proven reserves.*°
1. Mining

Respondent argues that the quantities of iron ore at Aswan were insufficient to sustain the 20-
year mine plan.*®° Respondent notes that the Met-Chem Report only evidenced a maximum of
six years of operation.**’ Respondent’s mining expert, Dr Armitage, suggests that losses and

dilutions usually experienced during mining would have reduced the mine life to five years.**

Respondent argues that the UEC Study states that there were sufficient resources for the

Project to operate for 23 years, but in making this determination, includes “proven”,

“indicated”, and “inferred” resources. According to Respondent, there is nothing to show that
the reserves would have been of sufficient quality to be mined.*® Respondent argues that the
Met-Chem Report found only 4.4 million tonnes of iron ore in area 10 of Claimant’s
concession, in which area EGSMA found 64 million tonnes.‘ In the other areas of
Claimant’s concession, the Met-Chem Report only have “indicated resources”, not the more
certain “measured resources”.*”' Respondent further explains that the “inferred resources”
referred to in the Met-Chem Report are only possible reserves and this cannot be used for a
feasibility study.*”? Respondent argues that the level of proven resources was reducing as the
exploration work continued.‘”? Respondent notes that EGSMA’s report of October 1998
suggests that the measured and indicated reserves in area 10 were even lower than those
indicated in the EGSMA report of 1997 and that these were further reduced in the Met-Chem
Report.44

Respondent acknowledges that although the overall geological resources are higher in the
Met-Chem Report, the amount of minable resources would only allow the Project to operate
for six years.*” Respondent further notes that Dr Dagdalen (Claimant’s expert) agreed that

the EGSMA numbers cannot be relied upon.*”°

Respondent points out that Met-Chem prepared its June 1999 report on the basis of a
concession area that represented the “approximate location of extended concession as filed
with Egyptian Mining Authority” that did not conform to the concession area awarded to
Claimant (as set out in the Concession Agreement, the UEC Study, and Claimant’s
presentation to President Mubarak in May 1999).*”’ Respondent submits that there is no
evidence that Claimant applied to extend the concession area.*”* Respondent notes that 59.4%

of the diluted minable reserves estimated by Met-Chem in its 6-year mining plan, come from

479

“area 16” that is not in the original concession area.*” Respondent concludes that Claimant

moved to exploring other areas because there were insufficient reserves in the concession area

granted to him.**°

Respondent suggests that the contemporaneous references by Claimant’s officials to the vast
iron ore reserves in Aswan, as well as their estimates regarding the viability of the Project,
may have included reserves that are not confirmed.**! Respondent points to contemporaneous
news items and a study by British Steel that doubt the feasibility of the Project.**? Respondent
notes that although the British Steel report has not been produced, there is no reason to doubt

the contemporaneous references to that report.*83

Respondent states that the record demonstrates a lack of confidence in the Project from the
Project Partners.*** Respondent argues that had the Project Partners been committed to the
Project, they would not have abandoned it when Claimant was framed with “trumped up
charges”. “*5 Respondent surmises that the real reason why the Project Partners left was
because they reviewed the November 1999 Met-Chem Report and the UEC Study that
revealed a 6-year conceptual mining program and said that the Project would not break even

for seven years, and considered that the Project was not viable.**°

Respondent argues that even if Claimant had planned to outsource the mining operations and
the transport of the ore to the plant site, he has not provided evidence of a potential contractor

or the costs of outsourcing.**”
2. Beneficiation

Respondent argues that the iron ore at Aswan was high in phosphorus and low in iron
grade.*** In support of this conclusion, Respondent relies on contemporaneous studies carried
out by Egyptian Iron & Steel Company and British Steel. * Respondent points to

contemporaneous evidence that Mr Verdier acknowledged the poor quality of iron ore at

Aswan.’

Further, Respondent argues that the beneficiation of the iron ore at Aswan was challenging.**!
Respondent argues that the UEC Study assumes that the iron ore to be fed into the blast
furnace would have 60% concentration in iron (the industry standard), but no feasibility
report has identified a method to achieve this concentration of iron in the Project.“
Respondent argues that the UEC Study assumes that the level of phosphorus (an impurity that
eventually reduces the ductility of steel produced) in the iron ore would reach 1.3%, without

providing reasons for this.*°*

Respondent submits that no satisfactory beneficiation process had been identified as of
February 2000.4 Respondent notes that the contemporaneous CMRDI reports indicate that
there was only one pilot plant testing for beneficiation that took place in 1999: half of the
sample was dealt with by CMRDI,** and the other half, sent to SGA in Germany, was
deemed to have an iron content that was too low for sintering.’ Respondent notes that Mr
Verdier suggests that SGA was meant to conduct additional tests for dephosphorisation and to
define the processes and equipment that were required for the beneficiation, but this was

never done.”

Respondent notes that the CMRDI used the wet high gradient magnetic separation process for
beneficiation, because other processes (including wet low intensity magnetic separation) were
generally not successful or were not commercially practical.*°* Respondent notes that the
result of the beneficiation test work carried out in February 2000 (on a new sample that had
lower iron content taken in mining conditions) was that more test work had to be carried out
using the wet high gradient magnetic separation process and other beneficiation processes.*”

Respondent argues that iron ore has specific characteristics and the beneficiation process used

Respondent’s beneficiation expert, Dr Willis suggests that going from lab scale to bench scale

with the test work using low-intensity magnetic separation and roasting was challenging.*”!

He notes that more iron ore would have to be fed into the beneficiation process to achieve the

same amount of product.*””

Respondent argues that the two beneficiation processes that showed potential, i.e., pilot plant
testing and lab testing, would have failed to achieve an acceptable level of quality of iron ore,

the former achieving an iron concentrate of 50.2% and phosphorus content of 1.65% and the

latter an iron content of 54.3% and a phosphorus content of 1.94%.°°

Respondent notes that the beneficiation analysis produced by Met-Chem at Claimant’s

request in June 1999 and November 1999 was also not satisfactory and is at best a scoping

study that is prepared to determine whether a feasibility analysis should be conducted.*™

Respondent emphasises that the need for additional beneficiation and metallurgical work
made the Project unviable and that the UEC Study underestimates the Project’s costs.*!° At
the 2019 Merits Hearing and in the Joint Steel Report, Dr Cappel stated that it is possible to

use 100% concentrate in the sinter, but it is not recommended.*!!

Dr Cappel notes that the silica content of the iron ore would have been high, which would
increase the slag volumes to be handled, posing problems for the operation,*"? and that the
need for sufficient slag pots and equipment to handle the large amount of slag would have

513

increased the capital expenditure.*'’ Dr Cappel also states that there were no plans for the use

of the slag, for example, in producing fertiliser.**

Dr Cappel suggests that account was not taken of the capital expenditures for lime injections.
He states in his report that the cost of this could be USD 5 million, but in the Joint Steel
Report that this would be USD 10 million.*!°

Respondent highlights that no provisions were made for the construction of a gas pipeline, for
power or for water*'® and denies that the government had committed to provide these
facilities to the Project.*'’ Respondent further notes that no arrangements were made for the
required railroad line that was to encompass at least 50 kilometres and notes that there was no
agreement that the government would build this railroad. Respondent notes that Claimant was
aware that the government did not have the finances to fund this railway line.*'* Respondent
notes that the railway line would not be a straight line, would be congested, and would require

considerable maintenance given the harsh desert climate.*!

Respondent clarifies that if the iron ore had run out, the Project could not function on

imported ore (as the Commitment Agreement provided for making steel out of the local ore)

because importing ore would be against the funding concept of the Project.*”° Respondent
notes that ADEMCO was established to manufacture the iron and steel from the Project, and
AISCO was established to run the steel operations, using iron ore mined by ADEMCO.™!
Respondent notes that AISCO’s business was dependent on the quality and quantity of iron
ore mined by ADEMCO.*” According to Respondent, if manufacturing iron and steel at
Aswan was impossible, then the Project factory would have no value, thus rendering

ADEMCO without value.*?*

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal will first deal with the appropriate method of valuation and second with the

matter of causation including the viability of the Project.

B. STANDARD AND METHOD OF ASSESSING DAMAGES.

1. Categories of loss that could be claimed under the DCF method

Claimant’s Position

Claimant explains that although at its establishment the shares in ADEMCO were registered
in his name (7%), in the name of his wife (15%), minor daughters (15% each) and friends
Messrs Khabir (2.5%), El-Bardissy (2.5%), and Badr (2.7%), and in the name of his
wholly-owned company Tradecon (2.5%), Claimant paid for all these shares and exercised
the rights and benefits deriving from these shares.** Claimant notes that Mr Badr separately
purchased 30,000 shares in ADEMCO, which does not comprise part of this claim.
Claimant further notes that Mr Shimi and his family held the remaining 37.5% of
ADEMCO’s shareholding.*”*

Claimant submits that the ADEMCO shareholding that he controlled increased to 54.3% in
April 1998 when ADEMCO’s share capital was increased,**7 moved to 80.2% when Mr

Shimi sold his shares to Claimant in July 1998,*8 and moved to 70.22% in February 2000
after Claimant transferred shares to the Project Partners and received shares from his family
members (which receipt is not challenged by Respondent).*””

Claimant agrees that ADEMCO held 60% of AISCO’s equity, which, along with Mr Bahgat’s
0.2% direct interest in AISCO, resulted in Claimant having 87.5% interest in AISCO in

total.5%°

Claimant states that international law recognises beneficial ownership, as reflected in
Mr Bahgat’s agreements with his family and friends regarding their ADEMCO
shareholding. **' Claimant argues that Respondent’s prosecutor recognised through the
criminal proceedings against him that Claimant held shares in ADEMCO though his wife,

daughters, friends, and Tradecon.*” Therefore, Respondent is now precluded from arguing

that those shares did not form a part of Mr Bahgat’s investment.**3

Claimant explains that Respondent has not contested that Mr Bahgat may claim the loss

suffered by Tradecon because it is his wholly-owned company.***

Claimant contends that Respondent misrepresents Claimant’s shareholding in ADEMCO***

and denies that he has obfuscated its shareholding in the Companies.**°

Claimant argues that Respondent cannot avoid its international responsibility by artificially
distinguishing shareholder losses from company’s losses.**” Claimant states that the Project’s
failure directly impacted the economic value of Claimant’s shareholding and argues that

Respondent’s interference with the Companies is linked to Claimant’s losses.***

Final Award
23 December 2019

Claimant suggests that the authorities cited by Respondent actually favour Claimant.
Claimant argues that Asian Agricultural Products v. Sri Lanka considered the “global” value
of the company to the shares of claimant and, therefore, supports Claimant’s case.**? Claimant
notes that Enkev Beheer v. Poland held that the claimant could only claim for the harm
suffered from the “diminution or total loss of rights derived from its shares,” which Claimant

argues mirrors his claim in this arbitration.*°

Claimant contends that Respondent ignores prevailing jurisprudence in cases such as

Sistem v. Kyrgyzstan and Koch Minerals v. Venezuela that confirms “flow-through of loss to

shareholders in cases of indirect expropriation.”™!

Respondent’s Position

Relying on prior arbitral awards, Respondent argues that shareholders are only entitled to
claim damages in an amount corresponding to the impact of the alleged breach on the value of
the shares themselves.*? Relying on Asian Agricultural Products v. Sri Lanka, Enkev Beheer
v. Poland, and the work of commentators, Respondent proposes that a calculation be made
not of the loss suffered by the company as a whole, but the difference in the value of the
shares between the alleged but for and the actual scenarios. ** Respondent alleges that
Claimant has not put the Tribunal in a position to determine the loss in Claimant’s

shareholding in the Companies. In Respondent’s words, “[t]his failure alone should be

dispositive of Claimant’s quantum case.”*4

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

Respondent argues that Claimant’s alleged shareholding in AISCO is “not substantiated”.*4°
Respondent maintains that there is no evidence to support the assumption in the Inglis Report
that, had the Project gone ahead, ADEMCO would hold 60% of AISCO’s shares and
Mr Bahgat would hold 0.5% of AISCO’s shares.*“° Respondent notes that AISCO’s articles of
association stipulate that Mr Bahgat held 0.2% of AISCO’s shares.*"’ Respondent further
notes that Claimant’s suggestion that ADEMCO held 60% of the equity in AISCO when
AISCO was incorporated, is contradicted by AISCO’s articles of association that make clear
that ADEMCO held 85.7% of AISCO’s shares upon the latter’s incorporation.** In summary,
Respondent considers that Claimant never held over 0.2% of AISCO’s shares (10.5%, when
taken with his indirect shareholding through ADEMCO).*”

Respondent explains that GAFI records the shareholding of joint stock companies such as
AISCO and ADEMCO and such companies must obtain GAFI’s authorisation when they are
founded.**° Respondent notes that GAFI recorded that Mr Bahgat had a 7% shareholding in
ADEMCO.**! Respondent notes that on 12 April 1998, according to GAFI’s documentation
and following an increase of the authorised share capital of ADEMCO, Mr Bahgat still held
7% of the share capital of ADEMCO.** Respondent notes that the description of the
shareholding in ADEMCO was amended by GAFI again on 16 July 1998 and
7 December 1998, and GAFI records reflected Mr Bahgat holding 12% of ADEMCO’s shares

553

as at February 2000 (which would amount to a 10.5% “shareholding in the Project”).

Respondent disputes Claimant’s alleged 69.5% interest in ADEMCO. ** Respondent
characterises as unreliable the ex post witness statements of Claimant alleging his 69.5%
shareholding in ADEMCO as at 2005.°* Respondent argues that the following do not
establish his 69.5% interest in ADEMCO: (i) that Claimant increased his shareholding when
Mr Shimi reduced his ADEMCO shareholding from 37.5% to 14.5%; (ii) that by

February 2000, the shares held by his family in ADEMCO were transferred to his name, thus
making Claimant the owner of 39.5% of ADEMCO and 0.5% of AISCO shares; and (iii) that
Arab Contractors, Egyptian Company for Investment and Underwriting, and Orascom
returned their shares to Claimant in 1999 and May 2014.**° Respondent states that the Share
Consolidation Report upon which Claimant relies cannot negate the contemporaneous
documentary evidence from GAFI regarding Claimant’s shareholding in ADEMCO. *”
Respondent maintains that only compelling evidence can challenge the evidence presented by

GAFI documents and Claimant has not presented such evidence.***

Respondent explains that Claimant cannot claim for losses linked to the shares of his family
members in ADEMCO as Mr Bahgat is the only claimant in this arbitration.*°° Respondent
notes that Claimant has not even produced a written agreement between himself and these
other individuals that would suggest that the apparent shareholders are not the true
shareholders.*® To establish his control over the shares of Mrs Shimi (Claimant’s ex-wife),
Respondent notes that Claimant merely relies on Mrs Shimi’s witness statement rather than
any formal contemporaneous correspondence of his payment for the shares or his agreement
with Mrs Shimi.*°! Claimant also does not explain why Mrs Shimi held shares for Claimant’s
benefit. * Moreover, Respondent observes that there is no documentary support for
Claimant’s daughters holding ADEMCO shares for Claimant’s benefit.*°? Mr Bahgat’s
guardianship over his daughters during their minority does not imply that assets and

properties held by the daughters were for Respondent’s benefit.

Respondent underlines that there is nothing on the record, not even witness statements from
Claimant’s friends, that indicates that Claimant’s friends held shares in ADEMCO for
Claimant’s benefit so that Claimant could avoid “personal exposure”.*® To the contrary, the
record suggests that Claimant’s friends were active participants in ADEMCO shareholder
meetings.*® The witness statements of Claimant’s friends, Mr Khabir, Mr El-Bardissy, and

Mr Badr that were submitted for the domestic criminal prosecution were dismissed by the

Supreme State Security Court for coming after Claimant’s friends were accused of
misappropriation of funds, implying a personal motive to provide testimony that would assist

967

them in evading charges. °°’ Further, Respondent suggests that their witness testimony

indicates that their shares belonged to both Mr Bahgat and Mr Shimi.*°*

Respondent queries why Claimant wanted to shield himself from potential liability associated
with the Project.*® The Public Prosecutor did not confirm that “relations and other persons
related” to Claimant held shares on behalf of Claimant, but said that Claimant had used a
fictitious payment of USD 30 million to MD to obtain ADEMCO shares for himself and
persons related to him.*”° Respondent clarifies that the Public Prosecutor made his comments
regarding Claimant’s shareholding in ADEMCO in the context of the criminal proceedings

against Claimant, not in relation to arbitration proceedings brought against Claimant.*”!

Respondent contests Claimant’s allegation that the shares listed in the name of the Project
Partners should be considered as Claimant’s shares because Claimant never received payment
for these shares.*” First, there is no evidence that the Project Partners’ shares belonged to
Claimant; the Shareholders’ Agreement (which included only MD and Cegelec) does not

indicate that Mr Bahgat owned the shares purchased by the Project Partners.°7*

Second, there is no evidence that Claimant held the shares belonging to the Project Partners
while he awaited payment.*” In fact, the Shareholder’s Agreement states that an inability to

make payment for the shares would result in a “waiver” of that companies’ shares.°”°

Respondent argues that GAFI approved MD holding 10% of ADEMCO and Cegelec holding
5% of ADEMCO on 16 July 1998 and that this remained unchanged on 7 December 1998.°”
Further, the 7 December 1998 GAFI resolution suggests that US Steel and Pomini are 5% and
10% shareholders of ADEMCO.*” Respondent maintains that the GAFI records are evidence

that the relevant companies were the owners of the above shareholding, not Claimant.*”
Respondent underlines that nothing on the record suggests that Claimant held the shares of
the Project Partners until they made payment.*” In fact, Respondent notes that the record
indicates that Claimant used the alleged shareholding of the Project Partners to support the

seriousness of the Project.**°

Third, Respondent contends that there is no evidence that the Project Partners did not make
payment for their shares and argues that the record suggests that MD and Cegelec made their

payments.**!

Finally, Respondent states that the Project Partners’ alleged failure to pay for ADEMCO’s
shares cannot be attributed to Respondent, but was because the feasibility of the Project had
not been established.**? Respondent highlights that the legal title of the Project Partners
should not be disregarded because they each were involved in the Project: (i) MD was
responsible for building the new steel plant, for providing staff training and technical
management, and for purchasing the majority of the steel billets products by the
Project; **3 (ii) Cegelec was responsible for building the utilities infrastructure of the
Project; (iii) US Steel was in charge of preparing studies relating to the iron ore quality and
the feasibility of the Project and of providing management services for 10 years;** and (iv)

time.*** This lack of evidence renders Claimant’s valuation of his losses speculative: had the
Project proceeded, Claimant’s shareholding could have varied from the 21.5% that the Inglis
Report uses as a basis to calculate loss**° and the Inglis Report does not account for the
impact of the one-year delay in the initiation of the project on the financial position of the
expected shareholders.*”

Respondent argues that special factors could call for the Tribunal to determine jurisdiction
over an asset that is not legally the property of Claimant, based on Claimant’s control over the

asset, however, Claimant has not presented any such factors to the Tribunal.*”!

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal will deal with the losses after having established the method of valuation.
2. Discounted Cash Flow

Claimant's Position

Claimant notes that in case of a lawful expropriation, the 1980 BIT requires “prompt,
adequate and effective compensation” and the 2004 BIT requires compensation of the “value
of the expropriated investment” determined as per “generally accepted principles of
valuation.”°°? Claimant argues that Respondent’s measures did not comply with the standards
of lawful expropriation under the 1980 BIT and the 2004 BIT, but neither BIT stipulates the
compensation available in case of unlawful expropriation. °°? Claimant highlights that

international courts have drawn a distinction between damages awarded for lawful and

unlawful expropriation.*™ Claimant notes that several tribunals have resorted to principles of
customary international law to determine the sums payable for unlawful expropriation.*°*
Thus, Claimant contends that as per the Chorzéw Factory principle, which reflects customary
international law, Respondent should for its unlawful expropriation either provide restitution
in kind, or should pay Claimant a sum corresponding to the value that restitution in kind
would bear.** Claimant explains that he has no desire to return to Egypt to pursue the Project

and that the Project has lost its partners and the support of the government.*°”

Applying the Chorzéw Factory principle, where restitution is impossible, Claimant contends
that fair market value is the commonly accepted standard to measure losses suffered as a
result of the breach of the investment treaty protections and that Respondent has not contested
this.°°* Claimant notes that the fair market value is the price that would be agreed between a
buyer and seller for Claimant’s interest in the Project as at February 2000, which would
require a comparison of the actual scenario against the “but-for” scenario that would have
existed if the impugned actions had not been committed (the Discounted Cash Flow method,

or the DCF Method).** Claimant maintains that damages should be calculated as at the date

of the expropriation and notes that Respondent does not contest this.

Claimant assumes that in the but-for scenario the Project Partners would have paid for 30% of
ADEMCO’s shares in March 2000.! The one-year delay in the kick-off of the Project is not

considered by Claimant in the valuation because Claimant had a fixed turn-key contract with

The Inglis Report assumes that if the Project had proceeded as planned, Claimant would have
directly held 35% of ADEMCO and 0.5% of AISCO and would have made further
investments in the Project. Claimant notes that he has not made any deductions for lack of
control or marketability because Claimant was the CEO of the Companies and with his 35%

argues that minority discounts should not be applied where the loss arises from unlawful
conduct. The Inglis Report proposes that Claimant be awarded the following sums in the
table below. Claimant explains that “Approach A: Absent the Respondent’s unlawful
interference, the Project would have commenced operations as planned in January 2003. This
approach therefore assumes that Egypt breached obligations under the 1980 BIT resulting in

delay in the Project” and “Approach B: The Project would have restarted in October 2006.”

suggest that the value of the Project was at least USD 230 million.©!

The Matthews Report assesses the value of the Project at February 2000 at
USD 341.2 million.° He explains that this differs from Mr Inglis’ projections because:
(i) Mr Matthews assumed the Project would begin in early 2004, rather than January 2003 and
also assumed mid-year discounting; (ii) Mr Matthews increased projected capital expenditure
to account for additional capital costs associated with beneficiation; (iii) Mr Matthews
removed all historical cash flows; and (iv) Mr Matthews increased the forecast capital

expenditure by USD 28.5 million that were identified after the UEC Study was prepared.°*?

Mr Matthews assumes that Claimant would have held 34.7% interest in AISCO because his
review of the documentation indicated that ADEMCO held 87.5% of AISCO and that the
shareholdings of Mr Bahgat’s family members and friends should be considered as part of his
shareholding.®* Accordingly, Mr Matthews calculates that Claimant’s 34.7% investment in

the Project would have been worth USD 118.3 million in February 2000.°%

Applying a 20% discount as an adjustment for lack of control and lack of marketability,
Mr Matthews assesses the fair market value of Claimant’s investment to be
USD 94.6 million.°° As Claimant had agreed to sell a 30% shareholding to the Project
Partners, the loss suffered by Claimant as at February 2000, according to Mr Matthews, is
USD 103.5 million.’ Claimant clarifies that the failure of the Project Partners to pay for their
shares in ADEMCO is not connected to any doubts they had regarding the viability of the

Project.°*

Claimant argues that DCF valuation in this case is not unduly speculative because (i) the
resources were defined; (ii) the principal capital expenditures were fixed; (iii) several studies

had confirmed the operational expenditures; and (iv) demand for production was high and

Claimant takes note that Rusoro Mining v. Venezuela rejected the DCF method in the absence
of evidence of financial performance, however, points out that the Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan
tribunal applied the DCF method even though the claimant had not commenced exploration or
production of its hydrocarbon project.” Claimant notes that the Project met all four criteria
set by Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan to be accounted for when there is no record of profitability,
namely, (i) that the investors can finance the project; (ii) that they will find exploitable
reserves; (iii) that they would be able to finance and exploit the reserve; and (iv) that it would
be possible to sell the product.®*! Moreover, Claimant notes that Vivendi v. Argentina noted
that the absence of a history of profitability does not preclude the application of the DCF
method and the likelihood of lost profits can be established where the claimant can show that

on a balance of probabilities, the investment would have produced profits.°* Claimant notes

that ADC v. Hungary relied on a contemporaneous business plan for the purposes of a
forward looking valuation, as Claimant is requesting here.**? Claimant also relies on PL v.
Poland, in which the tribunal relied on contemporaneous management projections in valuing

a newly formed bank with no track record.°™

Claimant denies Respondent’s suggestion that his lack of experience is an argument against
the application of the DCF method. Claimant underlines his extensive business experience
globally and in Egypt and the leading global partners he had attracted (several of which had

invested in the Project).

the Project and its financing.®” Claimant explains that he could have raised the funds required
to maintain his shareholding.** In any event, Claimant considers his future ability to raise
funds to be irrelevant to the fair market value analysis, as a hypothetical buyer would not be
concerned with the seller's ability to raise future funds (as it would be the buyer’s

responsibility to raise such funds).°?

Claimant argues that the financing of Claimant’s interest in the Project should not be given
credit because any gains or losses made by Claimant on funding that would have otherwise
been invested in the Project are irrelevant to a fair market value analysis.”

To address Respondent’s concerns about the precise sum invested by Claimant, Claimant
explains that his investment of USD 39.7 million in the Project was the payment to MD as
part of the USD 555 million payment for the design, engineering, manufacture and delivery of

the new plant.“

Claimant submits that the testimony of Mr MacGregor (Respondent’s quantum expert) is
unreliable. He notes that Mr MacGregor has been repeatedly instructed by Egypt. He notes
that Egypt’s instructions to Mr MacGregor were designed to create no value for the Project.”
Claimant argues that Mr MacGregor was selectively provided with materials that served the
interests of Respondent and that were out of date at the time of valuation because it made
reference to standards in January 1999. Claimant further submits that Mr MacGregor
acknowledged that contemporaneous test results and contract specifications were relevant to
the DCF analysis, but did not consider this evidence, and that the “contemporaneous
evidence” considered by Mr MacGregor was whether or not contemporaneous at all
supported Claimant’s case.°* Claimant notes finally that Mr MacGregor’s valuation of the
Project (USD 0) cannot be relied upon because it is too distant from contemporaneous and
other studies on the record of this arbitration that place the value of the Project in the

hundreds of millions.“

Claimant submits that Mr MacGregor has accepted that in the but for scenario, it must be

assumed that Claimant would have been paid for the shares by the Project Partners.™°

Claimant submits that the Parties’ experts agree on the revenue side of the DCF analysis, but
disagree as to certain costs. Claimant explains that the USD 70 million capital expenditure
cost assumed by Mr Matthews was the higher estimate of these costs that was developed by

Respondent’s CMRDI.*”

Respondent’s Position

Mr MacGregor, Respondent’s quantum expert, argues that the fair market value of the Project

is zero.

Respondent agrees that, in order to assess full compensation, tribunals generally compare the
actual fair market value of the investment as at the valuation date with the fair market value of
the investment “but for” the actions of the State.“ Respondent notes that the fair market
value is the amount for which an asset should exchange on the valuation date between a
willing buyer and seller in an arm’s length transaction, after proper marketing, but argues that
Claimant’s expert, Mr Matthews ignores that in the above definition, each party should have

acted knowledgably and prudently.*°

Respondent denies that the DCF method is widely used.°' Respondent notes that the DCF
method is based on “inherently speculative elements” because discounted cash flows can only
be recovered if they can be established with reasonable certainty.°* Therefore, according to
Respondent, the use of the DCF method by investment tribunals depends on evidence
demonstrating “the likelihood of projected cash flows actually being realized”.°? Respondent

submits that tribunals have not used the DCF approach where the data is too uncertain or

there is not a sufficient record of profitability for losses to be calculated with precision.**
Respondent notes the reality that investments can fail and that the fact that the Project was

unlikely to succeed severely diminishes Claimant’s claim.°°

Respondent notes that Mr Inglis relies on the cash flows in the UEC Study, which falls short
of a feasibility study and takes no account of the quality and sufficiency of the iron ore at
Aswan.°* Respondent argues that Mr Matthews also relies on the UEC Study and Met-Chem
Report, which fall short of being feasibility studies, to argue that the value of the Project
would have been higher in February 2000 than in 1998.°’ Respondent notes that its own
expert, Mr MacGregor, demonstrates that the UEC Study and Met-Chem Report would have
lowered the value of the Project in the eyes of a prudent investor.°* Respondent argues that a
knowledgeable buyer and seller would have recognised the above factors and that the iron ore
at the Project was of low quality.°°

Respondent points out that the BDO Report confirms that the Rusoro Mining v. Venezuela
criteria for the application of the DCF model are not met. These criteria are: a) The
enterprise has an established historical record of financial performance; b) There are reliable
projections of the enterprise’s future cash flows; c) The price at which the enterprise will be
able to sell its products can be determined with reasonable certainty; d) The project can be
financed with self-generated cash or alternatively there must be no uncertainty regarding the
availability of financing; e) It is possible to calculate a meaningful WACC; and f) The
enterprise is active in a sector with low regulatory pressure or its scope and effects must be

predictable. °°!

must be applied in this arbitration, particularly since the final investment was not received
from potential investors and (ii) UEC’s expertise cannot replace the record of financial

performance in the Project, particularly as there were flaws in the UEC analysis.°°

Second, Respondent notes that there are no reliable projections of the Project’s future cash
flows. Respondent notes that Mr Matthews relies on three contemporaneous reports, each of
which have “wildly” different valuations of the Project, and does not explain how he has used
these reports to prepare a reliable estimate of future cash flows.® Respondent argues that the
difficulties in forecasting the performance of ADEMCO are borne out in Claimant’s expert
valuation reports, whose results are so varied that they must be considered unreliable. The
Inglis Report relies on projections of future cash flows, whose net present values vary from
USD 236.7 million to USD 471.6 million between his three valuations.°’ Moreover, the
valuations conducted by Mr Inglis and Mr Matthews differ by around USD 150 million.°*
Further, Respondent argues that significant cost would have been expended on further

technical work on the Project.%

Third, for the application of the DCF method to be appropriate, there must be reasonable
certainty over the price at which the products will be sold.°” Respondent argues that the

future sale price of the steel is a moot point, given the poor quality of the ore.°”!

Fourth, Respondent argues that the financing of the Project was not certain, making the
application of the DCF method inappropriate.“ Respondent suggests that Mr Matthews, by

referring to the ability of a hypothetical seller to sell the Project, ignores Claimant’s specific

inability to raise financing.°” Respondent highlights the absence of evidence of funding for

the Project, demonstrated by the Inglis Report being based on three vastly different ranges of

capital investment ranging from USD 661 million to USD 908.4 million.°™*

Respondent notes
that there is no evidence of the intention or ability of Claimant or other shareholders to
contribute funds to the Project or of other debt financing.“ Respondent notes that
Mr Matthews does not address Claimant’s inability to raise funds; Mr Matthews states,
contrary to Claimant’s own submissions and Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan, that Claimant’s ability
to raise funds is irrelevant.°° Respondent argues that Mr Matthews’ analysis ignores that the
shareholders of ADEMCO had only agreed to undertake a shareholding of 10% or less and
that the debt financing required (USD 496.2 million) was substantial and would have been a
concern to any buyer.®”’ Respondent suggests that Mr Matthews should have accounted for
the fact that the Project Partners did not pay for their shareholding and the absence of a fixed
price in MD’s commitment to purchase billets from ADEMCO.%” Respondent suggests that
Mr Matthews should also have considered whether the commitments made by the Project
Partners were prudent.” Respondent suggests that it is not clear why Mr Matthews chose not
to rely on the purchase of ADEMCO’s shares by local entities for his valuation, given that

these were the only transactions that were concluded.”

Respondent states that Claimant’s statement that he had to invest USD 84 million in the
Project (from which we could delete USD 39.7 million invested by 2000) is not supported by
evidence, neither is the source of these funds allegedly invested by Claimant.“*! In particular,
Respondent notes that it is not clear whether the USD 39.7 million allegedly invested by
Claimant (which Claimant states represents “the overwhelming majority of his personal
wealth”) comprised expenses over and above the USD 240 million equity investment
required, or whether Claimant would need to invest a further USD 84 million over the first
two years of the Project.**? Respondent argues that it is not clear how the other shareholders
would contribute to raising funds — if Mr Shimi held 14.5% of ADEMCO’s shares he would
have had to invest USD 34.8 million and there is no evidence that Mr Shimi intended to or

could invest such a sum in the Project.

Fifth, according to Respondent, the application of the DCF method requires a meaningful
weighted average cost of capital.°** Respondent argues that the Project had key uncertainties
that adversely impact the projections necessary to value the Project. The SRK Report
considers that several “key uncertainties”, such as “the lack of confidence in the resource, the
lack of information relating to the mining project, the fact that the ability to produce a product
that could be used as feed to the smelter had (and still has not) been demonstrated, and that a
source for the limestone and coal has not yet been located,” make DCF an inappropriate
valuation methodology for this case. °° Respondent argues that it was not possible to
manufacture steel economically at the Project and therefore, there would have been
insufficient cash flows to calculate a weighted average cost of capital.’ Further, the
calculation of a weighted average cost of capital was made impossible by the uncertainty

regarding the capital structure of the Project.*

In addition to arguing that the DCF method is inappropriate, Respondent points to problems
with Claimant’s expert reports. Respondent points out the following difficulties with the DCF
calculation in the Inglis Report: (i) the amount of mineral resources in the Project can only be
“inferred”; (ii) Claimant does not show how the quality of iron ore would be increased to the
level (60%) used in its valuation or that the costs of reaching this quality of iron ore were
accounted for; (iii) Claimant does not demonstrate how the level of phosphorus in the iron
ore would be reduced to the industry standard (0.1%); (iv) the UEC Study cannot be
considered a feasibility study because it does not provide solutions to the geological and
technical challenges facing the Project; and (v) that the Project did not have sufficient
analysis to justify funding.°°

Respondent explains several problems with Mr Matthews’ report. First, Respondent argues
that Mr Matthews conflates investment and financing with the chances of profitability and,

citing its own Second BDO Report, points to projects that failed despite having substantial

investment."

Second, Respondent considers that Mr Matthews has overstated the confidence of third

parties in the Project.”

Third, Mr Matthews ignores jporaneous evid that indi that the Project’s fair

 

market value in 2000 is not equivalent to the commitments made by investors to ADEMCO in
1998 and that the investors were aware of the drawbacks of the Project. Respondent argues
that Mr Matthews incorrectly calculated the value of the Project based on the offer of
investment, a method that ignores the value of other direct shareholdings and inflates the

value of a single offer of minority shareholding.“*

Respondent explains that the Second BDO
Report discerns four types of investors: (i) the government controlled entities that each had a
5% shareholding in ADEMCO in 1998 (Mr Matthews uses these transactions to imply a value
of USD 33 million to ADEMCO); (ii) MD and Cegelec who agreed to pay USD 16 million
for 10% and USD 8 million for 5% of ADEMCO, respectively, in May and July 1998
(Mr Matthews uses these transactions to imply a value of USD 160 million to ADEMCO);
and (iii) US Steel and Pomini who committed to acquire a 10% and 5% interest in ADEMCO
for USD 2.9 million and USD 1.5 million respectively (by extrapolation, these transactions
would have implied that the value of ADEMCO was USD 29.4 million). Respondent finds
no reason why Mr Matthews relied on the second group of transactions to extrapolate the
value of ADEMCO, rather than the third group of transactions.°° Respondent highlights that
Mr Matthews has chosen to base his FMV methodology on the transactions with the Project
Partners, who never completed their purchase of ADEMCO shares and by failing to pay for
their shares, waived their shareholding in ADEMCO.” Respondent notes that Mr Matthews
refers to a proposed share sale to a Saudi Arabian investor, but points out that by

Mr Matthews’ own admission there was insufficient information about this transaction

making it an inappropriate transaction upon which to base ADEMCO’s value.*

Respondent argues that Mr Matthews’ inputs are speculative and sensitive.®® Respondent
highlights that the cost of the beneficiation process was not certain and implies that these
could be higher that the CMDRI estimate of USD 70 million, which is adopted by Mr

Matthew.”

Respondent states that Claimant’s experience, not being concentrated in the iron and steel
industry, cannot be an argument for the success of the Project.”! Mr Matthews does not
explain why he assumed the start date of the Project to be January 2004 (rather than the
January 2003 start assumed by Mr Inglis) and why he assumed 100% capacity in the first
year.”°? Respondent notes that change in the assumed start date resulted in a USD 84.1 million

703

difference between the calculations of Mr Inglis and Mr Matthews.’°’ Respondent contends

that Mr Matthews ignores the revised iron costs across the period from the valuation date.”
Respondent noted that Mr Matthews conducted his assessment on the basis that the plant
would have a 30-year life, even though the UEC Study indicated that there were sufficient
resources for 23 years.”

For the reasons set out in Paragraph 378 above, Respondent denies Claimant’s claim of

USD 8.9 million representing the value of the shares purchased by the foreign partners.”°°

Even if the Project were to be considered feasible, Claimant cannot claim the entire sum of
his but-for scenario, by incorrectly assuming that the current market value of his investments
is nil.’ Respondent notes that ADEMCO still owns the rights to the Concession (which is
still valid), and based on the UEC Study, Claimant still has 10 years remaining on the initial
Concession term and a right to renew the Concession for an additional 30 years.”° As the

owners of shares in the Companies, Claimant still owned “10.5 percent of the Project,” which

he could resume to develop or sell to an investor.” Respondent concedes that the value of the
investment in the actual scenario would require an adjustment of the price of steel rebars and
billets, the cost of beneficiation, and the cost of maintenance and upkeep.”!° However, given
advances in technology, Respondent maintains that the market value of the Project would be

similar to its original value and that Claimant’s losses would be nil.”"!

Tribunal’s Analysis

Having found that Respondent’s actions are to be qualified as indirect expropriation, the
Tribunal must now determine the relief that Claimant is entitled to as a result of that indirect

expropriation.

The starting point of the Tribunal will be the dictum of the Permanent Court of International
Justice in the Chorzéw Factory case"? where it has been stated, that where the state has acted
contrary to its obligations any award to Claimant should “. . . as far as possible, wipe out all
the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would in all

probability have existed if that act had not been committed [the status quo ante].”

The Tribunal will now establish the value of losses incurred by Claimant. Several methods are
being used in international jurisprudence on valuating investments. The Parties in particular
discussed the DCF method, the lost investment method and the valuation based on

comparables.

The Tribunal will start with the DCF method. The Tribunal notes that the DCF method is used
to determine the fair market value of an investment. The DCF method assesses the economic
value of an investment by projecting its future cash flows i.e., the stream of value that it could
generate over its life. In comparison, the lost investment method to which the Tribunal will
turn thereafter is backward-oriented, establishing the value of the investment made while

considering why such investment did not lead to the anticipated result.

Investment tribunals have been generally confident in applying the DCF method for the
valuation of investments that are going concerns. The Tribunal notes that this method requires

some speculation about the future development of the investment concerned. The speculative

element is ameliorated if and when the concern in question has a history of profitable

operation. 713

This is because, where there exists a track record of profitability, there is a
higher degree of certainty as to what the future cash flows may have been.7'* Some tribunals
have rejected the use of the DCF method where there did not exist a sufficient record of

profitability. In Meralclad v. Mexico, the tribunal found that:7'°

Normally, the fair market value of a going concern, which has a history of profitable
operation may be based on an estimate of future profits subject to a discounted cash flow
analysis. [. . .] However, where the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time
to establish a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future profits
cannot be used to determine going concern or fair market value.
Based on the above reasoning, the Metalclad v. Mexico tribunal found that a DCF analysis
was inappropriate for that case because the landfill in question was never operative and any
award based on future profits would be wholly speculative. Citing Phelps Dodge, the
Metalclad v. Mexico tribunal held that the fair market value of the project was best arrived at
by reference to Metalclad’s actual investment in the project.’!° The reasoning for the rejection

of the DCF methodology in Metalclad v. Mexico was followed in Tecmed v. Mexico.”

It is evident that ADEMCO and AISCO cannot be considered to have constituted going
concerns. When their activities came to an abrupt stop due to the arrest of Claimant and the
occupation of the site and the premises of ADEMCO and AISCO, the Companies were still at

an early stage in the exploration phase.

The Tribunal notes, however, that in some cases the application of the DCF method was
considered appropriate by investment tribunals even where the concerns in question were not
going concerns. What was common to these cases is that there were other factors that allowed
a positive assessment of the hypothetical profitability of the companies concerned. Rusoro
Mining v. Venezuela suggests that the application of the DCF method may be appropriate not

just for the valuation of going concerns, but also for enterprises that are not going concerns

but that have detailed business plans, availability of financing, records of financial
performance, predictability of performance, foreseeability of costs, and certainty of the price
and sale of the concern’s products and services.’!* In Vivendi v. Argentina™” in assessing
damages for the respondent’s breach of the fair and equitable treatment and expropriation

standards, the tribunal found that:

[I]n an appropriate case, a claimant might be able to establish the likelihood of lost profits
with sufficient certainty even in the absence of a genuine going concern. For example, a
claimant might be able to establish clearly that an investment, such as a concession, would
have been profitable by presenting sufficient evidence of its expertise and proven record of
profitability of concessions it (or indeed others) had operated in similar circumstances.

The tribunal explained that:7°

[a] claimant which cannot rely on a record of demonstrated profitability requires to present
a thoroughly prepared record of its (or others) succe: based on first-hand experience
(its own or that of qualified experts) or corporate records which establish on the balance of
the probabilities it would have produced profits from the concession in question in the face
of the particular risks involved other than those of Treaty violation.

 

 

  

Several awards exist on extraction cases (extraction of oil, gas, or hard minerals) which are of
particular interest in the dispute at hand. In Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan the tribunal found that
“[a]s a general rule assets need to qualify as a going concern and have a proven track record
of profitability in order to be valued in accordance with the DCF method,” however, the use
of DCF may be justified where the exploration of hydrocarbons is at issue because “the
determination of the future cash flow from the exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves need not
depend on a past record of profitability.”’?' The tribunal stated that “there are numerous
hydrocarbon reserves around the world, and sufficient data allowing for future cash flow

99722

projections should be available to allow a DCF calculation.”’* The tribunal however stated

that there were four steps to pass before the cash flow could be expected: (i) was claimant
able to finance the exploration for hydrocarbons; (ii) would the exploration have been
successful; (iii) would claimant have been able to finance and perform the exploitation of any

hydrocarbon reserves found; and (iv) would it have been possible to sell any hydrocarbons to

be produced.’ The tribunal found that the claimant was unable to establish that it would
have been able to acquire funding for the exploration or for the exploitation of the region; that
the record indicated that the discovery of reserves in most of the relevant area was unlikely;
and that there was nothing on the record to show that the claimant would have been able to
sell the hydrocarbons. Accordingly, the tribunal found that the claimant’s position “entail[ed]
simply too many unsubstantiated assumptions to justify the application of the DCF-
method.” 74 In Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, the tribunal awarded damages for the
deprivation of a gold mine, which had been explored, but never operated. The tribunal found

that:

[A] DCF method can be reliably used in the instant case because of the commodity nature
of the product and detailed mining cash flow analysis previously performed.
726

In Crystallex v. Venezuela,’ the claimant argued that predicting its future income from

ascertained reserves to be extracted by the use of traditional mining techniques, as was the
case with the mines involved, could be done with a significant degree of certainty, even
without a record of past production. The claimant noted that there was nothing speculative
about the damages suffered by it because it had obtained financing for the exploration phase,
that there existed proven and probable gold resources and reserves; and that Crystallex had a

proven track record of operating gold mines in Venezuela.”’ The tribunal found that:7*

[T]he Claimant has indeed proven the fact of future profitability. It is undisputed that
Crystallex did not have a proven track record of profitability, because it never started
operating the mine. However, in the Tribunal’s view, it has sufficiently established that, if
it had been allowed to operate, it would have engaged in a profitmaking activity and that
such activity would have been profitable. The Tribunal considers that this is essentially due
to the nature of the investment at stake here as well as the development stage of the project.

...gold, unlike consumer products or even other commodities, is less subject to ordinary
supply-demand dynamics or market fluctuations, and, especially in the case of open pit
gold mining as in Las Cristinas, is an asset whose costs and future profits can be estimated
with greater certainty. The Tribunal thus accepts that predicting future income from
ascertained reserves to be extracted by the use of traditional mining techniques—as is the
case of Las Cristinas—can be done with a significant degree of certainty, even without a
record of past production.

  

The Tribunal summarizes the jurisprudence as follows. Although the DCF method has been
used to value going concerns, this methodology has also been applied under certain narrowly
defined conditions to investments that are not going concerns. However, the DCF method has
been used only if factors were proven that permitted reliable estimation of the investment’s
future profits. These include the existence of detailed business plans, substantiated
information on the price and quantity of the products and services, on the availability of
financing, and on the existence of a stable regulatory environment. Even in cases involving
commodities that have predictable sale prices, before applying the DCF method, tribunals
have assured themselves of the availability of reserves, financing, appropriate methods of

exploration, and the possibility of the product being sold.

In this case, the Parties’ quantum experts agree that the DCF method is a commonly used
valuation method. However, the experts do not agree on the appropriateness of applying the

DCF method to this case.

Claimant’s expert (Mr Matthews) opines that the DCF method is appropriate for this case
because there is evidence that Claimant’s Project was viable and there is no doubt about the
technical and economic feasibility of the Project. He thinks that an established record of
performance of AISCO and ADEMCO is not necessary to value the Project, because the UEC
Study (which was prepared by a reputable company and based on large amounts of
contemporaneous industry information) is reliable. Mr Matthews states that the positive

attitude of investors suggests that the project could easily have raised financing.

Respondent’s expert (Mr MacGregor) considers that the DCF method is not appropriate to
this case because there were serious technical problems with Claimant’s project that could not
be overcome. He thinks that the existence of a record of performance is essential to the use of
the DCF method. He considers that the UEC Study does not meet the requirements of a
feasibility study. He opines that there is no evidence that the iron ore in the Project’s
concession area could be improved to the grade envisaged in the UEC Study. Mr MacGregor
does not see sufficient evidence of guaranteed financing for the Project’s total requirement of

USD 496.2 million.

Case 1:20-cv-02169 Document 1-1 Filed 08/07/20 Page 129 of 177

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

The Tribunal notes that when deciding on the appropriateness of the DCF method for
valuating Claimant’s investment, the task of the Tribunal is a limited one. The Tribunal only
has to decide whether it has received sufficient information to predict the potential economic
development of Claimant’s investment with sufficient certainty to use the DCF method for
valuating the investment. The Tribunal notes that the application of the DCF method for the
valuation of non-going concerns are the exception rather than the rule, since in most of such
cases no sufficient objective criteria can be ascertained to reduce the speculative element in

the DCF method.

The Tribunal acknowledges that specific jurisprudence exists in respect of the application of
the DCF method to non-going concerns designed for the exploration and exploitation of
natural resources. As decided in Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan, for the application of the DCF
method, it is necessary to have certainty about the availability of the resource concerned for
the whole period of the project. Claimant argued that the resources for the Project were
available, whereas Respondent took the position that this was not the case and that some of
Claimant’s exploratory activities had been undertaken beyond the limits of the area licensed.

The Tribunal will deal with the question of sufficient ore below at Paragraphs 469 et al.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that the awards in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela and Crystallex v.
Venezuela found that, due to the particularity of the gold market, there was reduced
uncertainty concerning the viability of the relevant investments, although in both cases no
going concern existed yet. This jurisprudence is guiding the decision of the Tribunal

concerning the non-application of the DCF method.

In summarizing the relevant international jurisprudence, the Tribunal concludes that the case
at hand does not meet the qualifications which allow the application of the DCF method to
expropriated non-going concerns. The Tribunal holds that the DCF method is inappropriate to
determine the fair market value of Claimant’s investment. Having established that the DCF
method cannot be used to valuate the investment of Claimant, the Tribunal considers it
unnecessary to consider the arguments exchanged between the Parties concerning which

shares in ADEMCO and AISCO belonged to Claimant and on their value.
3. Lost Investment Method

Claimant’s Position

In the Statement of Claim, Claimant argues that if tribunals have awarded compensation

based on the lost investment approach (rather than the cash flow approach), they have

In his Reply, Claimant seeks USD 39.77 million plus interest payable from February 2000
until the date of the report, which is a total loss of USD 126.4 million.”! Claimant submits

that the USD 39.77 million he claims are his own funds.”

Claimant notes that Respondent now acknowledges that USD 30 million was transferred to
MD, but challenges the source of funds.” Claimant maintains that the USD 30 million
transferred to MD came from Claimant’s personal funds: it was withdrawn by the cheques
from Claimant’s stake in an investment vehicle called Cornwood Limited (which amounted to
USD 42.7 million at the time).”4 Claimant further maintains that the involvement of
Cornwood Limited should not come as a surprise to Respondent given it has been in
possession of these cheques and that “if this had been an issue, it certainly was investigated at
the time.”” Claimant states that the money paid to Mannesmann was Mr Bahgat’s own

money, not that of Cornwood Limited.’*°

Moreover, Claimant maintains that the payment of DEM 54 million (USD 30 million or
approximately EGP 102 million) to MD is recorded in the February 2000 GAFI Report.”*” He

argues that when ADEMCO’s paid up share capital was increased, it was increased from EGP

authorities examined ADEMCO’s books, they noted that the increase in capital was with
respect to the gap between EGP 2.5 million and EGP 100 million and that there was a surplus

payment made by Claimant.””

Claimant maintains that USD 9.7 million (of the USD 39.7 million) invested by Claimant
came from his personal funds. Claimant cites the February 2000 GAFI report that
demonstrates that Claimant paid USD 4.8 million to ADEMCO and the July 2000 report of
Khodeir & Company that demonstrates that USD 4.9 million was deposited in ADEMCO’s
account as payment for the sale of Claimant’s shares in ADEMCO to Al Sharq Insurance
Company, Bank Misr, and Faisal Islamic Bank (which sums were owed to Claimant

personally and not to ADEMCO).”°

Claimant explains that although the advance payment of USD 5 million for the purchase of
the used factory was made from Mr Shimi’s account, these were Claimant’s funds. Claimant
states that this is clear from the fact that Claimant (not Mr Shimi) signed the bank transfer to
ProfilArbed.”! Claimant notes that he does not seek to recover this USD 5 million (which

was eventually returned to him).’*

Claimant notes that the Parties’ estimations of wasted costs differ by USD 4.5 million.
Claimant argues that the GAFI report does not state the source of these funds, but this does
not mean that these sums were not paid by Mr Bahgat.”* Claimant submits that there is no
doubt that he paid EGP 7.5 million for the Concessions and EGP 5 million for the land in
Aswan for the plant.” Claimant suggests that these sums could have been reflected in the

USD 4.5 million referred to in the GAFI report.”

Claimant notes that he also invested USD 73,530 in the plant for the preparation of an iron

Claimant denies that his investment was reckless and argues that he invested in the Project
based on Respondent’s encouragement and that no doubts were expressed about the Project’s
viability until the change in government in October 1999.”7 Claimant denies that his payment
of USD 30 million to MD pursuant to the First ADEMCO-MD Contract was reckless — after
the cancellation of the first contract, the sums were used towards to advance payment for the
new steel plant under the Second ADEMCO-MD Contract.”* Claimant denies that the
payment he made to MD was premature and notes that it post-dated the LOI and

encouragement to invest from the highest levels of Respondent’s government.”””

Claimant distinguishes this case from Azurix v. Argentina, arguing that the latter case

involved a maverick investor who would have made the investment irrespective of the

750

economic situation in Argentina.’ By contrast, Claimant invested based on the government’s

assurances and its experts and relied on the expertise of several foreign partners.”*!

Respondent’s Position

Respondent considers the lost investment method, i.e., calculating the total amount invested

by Claimant plus interest to the date of the award, to be inappropriate to this case.”

In any event, Respondent argues that this wasted costs method can only allow Claimant to
recover the sums that he personally invested in the Project.”* According to Respondent,
Claimant has not demonstrated that he invested USD 39.7 million in the Project
(USD 30 million as an initial payment to MD in 1998 and USD 9.7 million at various stages
of the Project).”* Respondent contends that this Tribunal must conduct its own assessment of

the damages claimed by Claimant, and must not rely on documents prepared in the different

context of the Egyptian criminal proceedings or the GAFI reports.”°>

Regarding the USD 9.7 million, Respondent notes that a GAFI report suggests that Claimant
invested only USD 30,000 in the Project (as capital and cash paid up by Mr Bahgat).7°
Respondent suggests that Claimant should produce bank statements from his own banks that
are evidence of any additional payments that he made.”°’ Respondent argues that the report by
Khodeir and Company is not sufficient to justify a wasted costs claim because the documents
on which the report is based are not identified.’”** Further, the report does not clarify whether
the shareholders paid for the increase in capital through which the sold shares were created.”*?
By stating that the issued capital of ADEMCO remained unchanged, the report, in
Respondent’s view, suggests that no payments had been made by the existing shareholders for

the new shares.”

Regarding the USD 30 million that Claimant allegedly paid MD, while there is evidence of
the sum being drawn from the account of Cornwood Limited, Respondent argues that
“nothing shows that amounts spent by this company should be considered as amounts spent
by Mr Bahgat.”’°! Respondent argues that there is no evidence that the sums invested by
Cornwood Limited belonged to Claimant, Claimant’s signature on the cheques and his being
a director of Cornwood Limited is not sufficient proof of Claimant’s ownership of funds.”
Respondent submits that the cheques submitted as evidence of the transfer (drawn on the
account of a company called Cornwood Limited) were not in the name of Claimant, Mr
Shimi, or ADEMCO and did not demonstrate that the payment had been received or made by
a shareholder of ADEMCO.”* Respondent suggests that Claimant obfuscated the source of
funds.” Respondent notes that Claimant has explained in the course of this arbitration that
Cornwood Limited was an investment vehicle set up by a Mr Parviz, but points out that
Claimant does not explain the shareholding of this company or the terms pursuant to which

the investment was made through it.” Respondent also questions how Mr Bahgat could be a

met Mr Parviz in 1993.7°°

Respondent contends that Claimant cannot rely on the conclusions of the Egyptian courts and
authorities to support the proposition that Claimant himself contributed USD 30 million to the
Project because: (i) GAFI has confirmed that ADEMCO had not established payment of
USD 30 million from the personal account of the shareholders; 7% (ii) Claimant told the
Egyptian local courts that he could not produce bank documentation because he did not want
to disclose his account information, but the Tribunal now knows that the investments in
ADEMCO’s shares were drawn from the account of Mr Shimi, not Mr Bahgat;7° (iii) the
Supreme State Security Court eventually considered that the payment of USD 30 million to
MD had been made by Claimant and Mr Shimi, not Claimant alone.” In any event,
Respondent maintains that Claimant should not be able to recover the USD 30 million, which
it considers to be a reckless expenditure made for the dismantlement of the used factory even
before the UEC Study was prepared and before the Concession was granted.” Respondent
submits that the change from a used plant to a new plant is a “symptom of Claimant’s
recklessness” and Claimant should not be allowed to recover costs expended in such a change
of plans.””' Respondent highlights that the First ADEMCO-MD Contract was rescinded

because of errors in the assumptions upon which the total price was based.7””

Respondent disputes the amount of money that was to be paid by Claimant to MD, as well as

123

how the payment was made and by whom.’”’ Respondent suggests that contemporaneous

evidence indicates that the payments for the increase in share capital were made by
Mr Bahgat and Mr Shimi.””* Respondent notes that Claimant testifies that he purchased some
shareholding from Mr Shimi, but does not provide any evidence of this payment. 7”

November 1999 as set out in his other witness statements) to present that the Project Partners
purchased all the shares in ADEMCO from him, rather than from him and Mr Shimi.7”°
Respondent notes that the shares sold to Al Sharg, Bank Misr, and Faisal Islamic Bank

belonged to Claimant and Mr Shimi, not to Claimant alone.””

According to Respondent, ADEMCO did not pay the sum of DEM 54 million to MD, “neither
directly or indirectly” as “[t]he amount was not there.”7"* Respondent argues that Claimant
cannot contend that he received shares for the DEM 54 million he paid to MD on behalf of
ADEMCO because the increase in his capital in ADEMCO only amounted to
DEM 47 million.” Respondent notes that a capital increase of EGP 90 million equates to
DEM 47.6 million, not DEM 54 million.” Respondent cites an annulment case of an
investment award in the Court of Appeal of Paris where the investment was found to have
been for the purpose of committing money-laundering and could not be afforded protection
on the basis of public policy.”*! According to Respondent, “only clean investments are

protected” in investment law and:

[N]o company . . . could accept the payment of an invoice to be made by wire transfer,
payable in German marks, by two obscure cheques in US dollars from someone who is not
a party to the contract, the Cornwood Limited company, on which we just know nothing.
This would be simply forbidden . . . The fact is that the shares he [Mr Bahgat] got in
ADEMCO, the shares which are his investment, if they were the result of a money-
laundering operation, being the payment to Mannesmann in such a bizarre way, that would
vitiate the entire thing.

We are not saying, of course, that there was money-laundering. What we are saying is that
you have enough strange elements, including the false date and the false number on the
contract, so as to prompt you to ask more questions, more supporting documents from Mr
Bahgat that he never gave to anyone, including in Egypt . . . [W]here does this money in
Ireland come from? Could it be the product of tax evasion? Of course, I am not saying it is;
I don’t know. But it is a possibility.”**

should not be rewarded for risks undertaken based on poor judgment: this would not place
Claimant in the position he might have been at, because Claimant would have lost the money

he had invested.”*

Respondent maintains that Claimant has by producing the relevant cheques, only established
that he made one payment of USD 72,530 to the CMRDI for the iron ore studies. 7°
Respondent queries why Claimant cannot produce similar documentation for the other

investments he claims to have made.7*°

Respondent submits that the fact that Mr Shimi made a payment of USD 5 million towards
the Project suggests that Claimant was not the only individual involved in the Project.’*”
Respondent finds it puzzling and suspicious that Claimant would open a bank account
containing his own funds in Mr Shimi’s name.”** Respondent argues that Claimant does not
explain why he would undertake such a scheme and notes that Claimant provides no

documentation in support of his explanation.”

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal states at the outset that its decision concerning the lost investment incurred by

Claimant was made by a majority decision.

Respondent objects to the application of the lost investment method, first, from a principle
point of view. Second, it argues that the investments, which Claimant has made, were lost
since the whole Project was not viable right from the beginning. Alternatively, Respondent
argues that the Project was not viable at 19 February 2000, the date Claimant considers as the
critical date when Claimant was arrested and the sites of ADEMCO and AISCO were closed.
Third, and related to the second argument, Respondent argues that its actions did not cause
any devaluation of Claimant’s investment. Fourth, Respondent argues that the payment made
to MD is not attributable to Claimant with the consequence that such payment cannot be
counted as an economic loss for Claimant. The Tribunal will deal with each of Respondent’s

arguments in turn.

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

As to the first argument advanced by Respondent, the Tribunal notes that the lost investment
method has been used in practice, including, for example, in Metalclad v. Mexico™® and
Copper Mesa v. Ecuador.” ! The lost investment method is an established method for the
valuation of expropriated investments. Unlike the DCF method, the lost investment method
uses inputs from the past and thus looks backward. Still, it attempts to determine the value the

investment on the relevant day, namely, the day of expropriation.

The Tribunal will now turn to the second argument of Respondent, namely, that the whole
Project was not viable from the beginning and therefore the investments made by Claimant
would have been lost without Respondent's interference or, to put it differently, Respondent’s
actions would not have caused any economic loss. The Tribunal is not convinced by the
arguments of Respondent that the Project was not viable from the beginning. The Tribunal
recalls that EGSMA published a report in October 1998 estimating the presence of
100 million tonnes of geological reserves in Egypt after having conducted studies. On this
basis, the then Egyptian government confirmed the presence of iron ore in Aswan and
declared that private sector development was welcome. The Project received incentives under
Egyptian law and the government built two roads for the Project. The inauguration of the
Project was attended by key governmental officials. The Tribunal acknowledges the argument
of Respondent that all such support and endorsement does not constitute a guarantee from the
side of the government that the project was viable. On the other hand, there is no indication
that the Project was not considered viable either. The Tribunal considers that the conduct of
both Parties, supported by relevant contemporaneous evidence, like EGSMA’s report, supply
rather credible evidence of value. That said, what matters more is whether that assumption
turned out to be true and whether the Project was viable immediately before expropriation
struck. The Tribunal turns to that issue next. As indicated above, the Tribunal must determine
whether the Project was viable on the date of expropriation, namely 19 February 2000. The

Parties disagreed on this point, both having recourse to experts.

Respondent argues that Claimant’s Project was not feasible on the date of expropriation and
therefore, Respondent did not cause any loss to Claimant. Respondent relies inter alia upon

the expert reports of Dr Armitage and Mr Fox (mining), Dr Willis (beneficiation), and

Dr Cappel (steel). ”? Claimant argues that the Project was technically feasible and
economically viable and that there was a realistic prospect of making a profit in the future,
relying upon the expert reports of Dr Joseph Poveromo (steel), Dr Kadri Dagdelen (mining),
and Mr Eric Spiller (beneficiation).”* The above-mentioned experts who testified as to
aspects of the viability of the Project after the date of expropriation made presentations and

were cross-examined at the 2019 Merits Hearing.

Three areas, each of them being essential for the viability of the Project, were discussed by
the experts, namely, the sufficient availability of ore, the beneficiation of the ore, and steel-
making. The experts also considered questions of transportation, access to power, and

financing.

Regarding the availability of ore, namely deposits which would last for the duration of the
Project, Claimant relies on the EGSMA and CMRDI reports and in particular the UEC Study
and the Met-Chem Report. The Met-Chem Report identified sufficient resources for 23 years
of production and noted a potential for identifying 67 million tonnes of reserves in the future.
Respondent, however, interprets the Met-Chem Report to say that ore had only been
identified to last for six years (see Paragraph 342). The Tribunal’s reading of the Met-Chem
Report does not support Respondent’s position. The Met-Chem Report merely stated that it
has established a preliminary six-year mine development sequence.” In the view of the
Tribunal, considering the other statements in the report, the Met-Chem Report does not

support the conclusion that there were only resources available for the period of six years.

The Tribunal takes note of the information presented by Respondent’s expert Dr Armitage
and of a study by US Steel, which question the interpretation of the exploration data and their
reliability and whether some part of the exploration was conducted outside the license area.
The latter point has been dealt with already above (see Paragraph 472). Further investigation
of the reserves were interrupted due to the arrest of Claimant and closure of the sites of
ADEMCO and AISCO (see Paragraphs 255-257). The Tribunal will deal with the question of

future exploration below, under the topic of causation.

After having assessed the expert reports and presentations, the Tribunal is convinced of the

availability of ore, which could have sustained the Project for the anticipated Project period.
The Tribunal finds the Met-Chem Report and also the UEC Study (albeit being a steel-
making rather than a mining report) convincing because the reports are based on exploration
activities on the ground. The Tribunal notes that, conversely, Dr Armitage’s report is not
based on field study at the Project site and is therefore not as convincing as the Met-Chem

Report and UEC Study.

The Parties agree that the Aswan ore has low iron content and high phosphorus content. They
disagree on the appropriate beneficiation method and in particular as to whether any
beneficiation would improve the content of iron and reduce the amount of phosphorus so that
the ore could be used for further production. A study of CRM in early 2000 showed that the

ore at the Project site had an iron content of 56%."

Further studies were planned with SGA
and Svedala, a German and a Swedish company specialised in beneficiation, respectively.
Respondent considers the results of the beneficiation as being unsatisfactory without

considering that there may have been further improvements.

Considering that the process of finding an appropriate beneficiation process was not yet
completed and that iron ore with an iron content similar to the one in Aswan had been used
successfully in other projects, the Tribunal concludes that beneficiation does not jeopardize
the technical and economic viability of the Project. The achieved results were already close to
what was considered necessary for the Project to operate successfully and Claimant has thus
established that there was quasi-certainty that the ore was of sufficient quality to support

operation.

 

As far as steel making is concerned, Respondent does not question technical feasibility (see
Paragraph 354), but, relying on the expert report of Dr Cappel, raises doubts about the
economic viability of the Project. In the view of the Tribunal, the concerns of Dr Cappel were

convincingly disputed by Claimant.

The Tribunal acknowledges that it was unclear who would pay for a gas pipeline and a
railroad, although all experts agree that such a construction was technically feasible. The
Tribunal does not consider that the expenses for constructing a railroad and a gas pipeline

would render the Project economically infeasible.

Based on the considerations above, the Tribunal concludes that, contrary to the arguments

advanced by Respondent, the Project was technically and economically viable on

19 February 2000.

The Tribunal takes note of the arguments advanced by Respondent”* that the Project
Partners’ decision not to participate in the Project demonstrates their lack of confidence in the
feasibility of the Project. Respondent surmises that the Project Partners abandoned the Project
because the Met-Chem Report and the UEC Study supported only a 6-year Project viability.
The Tribunal already has dealt with these two reports (see Paragraph 474), reading them
differently than Respondent has. The Project Partners left after Claimant was arrested by the
Egyptian authorities. Given that Claimant was the driving force behind the Project, it would
not have made sense for the Project Partners to remain after Claimant had been arrested by
the authorities. Moreover, Respondent not only arrested Claimant but also froze the accounts
of the companies and prevented employees from entering the site. There may also have been a
different explanation for the decisions of the Project Partners, namely that they did not want
to get involved in what may have looked as an internal politically motivated controversy in
Egypt: indeed while they had called a shareholders’ meeting to consider that decision before
the expropriation, they finally made their decision after Mr Bahgat’s arrest and that arrest

definitely was a relevant, causal, element in their decision to leave.

As indicated above, the Tribunal will now turn to the question of whether Respondent’s
actions on 19 February 2000 against Claimant and the Companies caused the termination of

the Project.

Apart from Respondent’s reasoning concerning the lack of viability of the Project, already
considered by the Tribunal, Respondent argues that Claimant could and should have
appointed another chairman and that it was Mr Verdier’s message to the partners that in fact
ended the economic development of the Project. The Tribunal is not convinced that the
appointment of a new chairperson would have resolved the situation that the Project was
placed in, considering that Respondent not only arrested Claimant but also took control over
the Project site, froze the assets of the Companies, and prohibited the employees from
returning to their offices. The Tribunal is also not convinced that the Project Partners ended
their association with the Project due to Mr Verdier’s message. In the view of the Tribunal,
the ending of the development project was caused by the actions of Respondent and not the

information about that event disseminated by Mr Verdier.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal has no doubt that Claimant and his investment suffered
legal harm because Claimant was arrested; because the bank accounts of Claimant and the
Companies were frozen; and because the site of the Companies had been taken over by
Egyptian authorities and the employees were not allowed to return to their offices. As
indicated above, these activities have virtually stopped all further activities of Claimant
necessary to further develop the Project. What still has to be established as indicated above is
the economic quantification of such harm. The tribunal in Copper Mesa v. Ecuador,"” which

was facing a similar factual situation, stated while referring to Vivendi v. Argentina:

Nevertheless, there is useful evidence on the record; and it is well settled that the fact that
damages cannot be fixed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss has
been incurred. In such cases, approximations are inevitable; the settling of damages is not
an exact science. . . . For this reason, rather than seeking to value an elusive loss of a
chance to the extent permissible under international law, the Tribunal here prefers to select
the Claimant's alternative valuation method of proven expenditure.

 

The Tribunal will follow this jurisprudence. In doing so the Tribunal will, as necessary, take
into account any devaluation of the investment made which is not accountable to the State

concerned, such as devaluation due to mismanagement or force majeure.

The Tribunal notes, that in his Reply, Claimant seeks USD 39.77 million plus interest payable
from February 2000 until the date of the award (as to the composition of this sum see
Paragraphs 446-455). He does not claim the USD 5 million, which was paid for purchasing

the used steel factory, since this money was returned to him.

Respondent contests that the relevant payments were drawn from Claimant’s property. As far
as the payment of USD 30 million payment to MD is concerned, Respondent raises three
objections: first, that it is not clear that the money came from Claimant, second, that the

money was received by MD and, third, that the payment was reckless.

Claimant in his Reply”*

points out that the cheques were signed by him and he explains his
relationship with Cornwood Limited as well as the objective of his financial engagement in
the latter. In his testimony,” which the Tribunal accepts in spite of contradictory evidence
also on record, especially the view of the Egyptian Supreme State Security Court in its

judgement of 11 June 2002, he emphasises what he had stated in his Reply. On both

occasions, he emphasised that Mr Shimi was not involved in Cornwood Limited.

These explanations satisfy the Tribunal that the payment to MD was made from Claimant’s
funds. Claimant stated in his testimony that the two cheques were paid out from a Barclay’s
account held by Cornwood Limited and he assured the Tribunal that this account was his
personal one. Both cheques had his signature and they were cashed as MD confirmed. The
payment was made out of Claimant’s personal funds and the fact of them being received by
MD is confirmed by the judgment of the Egyptian Supreme Security Court of 11 June
2002.8°°

Regarding Respondent’s second objection, the confirmation from MD proves to the

satisfaction of the Tribunal that the funds transferred by Claimant were received by MD.

As to the third objection of Respondent, the Tribunal notes that this payment was in fact made
before Claimant had received the license for mining. However, the Tribunal also notes that
Claimant had invested these funds based on the government’s assurances and therefore these

are not to be considered reckless as Respondent argues.

The Tribunal found it difficult to ascertain the payment of USD 9.7 million, which Claimant
claims to have made in February 2000 and July 2000 respectively to ADEMCO. These
payments were reported in the GAFI report and in the Khodeir Company report respectively.
Respondent’s objection against assigning these payments to Claimant’s payments was that
these reports could not be trusted (see Paragraph 458). Respondent’s argument has not been
substantiated to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. The Tribunal notes, however, that these
payments were not documented as the payment of USD 72,530 to CMRDI was, but they are
mentioned in the two reports referred to. The Tribunal has not received sufficient information
from Respondent regarding why these reports are not to be trusted. The Tribunal accepts that
USD 9.7 million should be added to Claimant’s expenses, which together with the payment to
MD, total USD 39.7 million.

Respondent has accepted that Claimant has paid USD 72,530 to CMRDI for the iron ore

studies. This sum has to be added to USD 39.7 million referred to above.

Respondent questions whether the payments made by Claimant were “clean investments” but
has not substantiated its indication that Claimant might have been engaged in money

laundering. Hence, this objection against the applicability of the lost investment method is

dismissed.

Finally, as indicated above (see Paragraph 467), after having established that the Project was
viable on the date of expropriation, the Tribunal must establish whether the investment made
by Claimant had been economically devalued. This investment was used to apply for the
license to mine and to produce steel, the establishment of the site of ADEMCO and AISCO,
to hire and pay employees, to undertake exploration activities whose results have been
documented, and to inquire into the options for the beneficiation of the ore. The Tribunal
cannot identify any reasons, apart from the ones discussed and discarded, that the investment
made had lost its value or part thereof. Respondent has not advanced any compelling

argument to the contrary.

Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the damages Claimant
suffered amount to USD 39.77 million. Respondent should pay Claimant compensation in this

sum.
4. Valuation based on comparables

Claimant’s Position

Claimant considers the method of valuation proposed by Respondent — valuation based on
comparables — to be “self-serving and unsuitable”.*! Claimant notes that the 136 global
projects selected without explanation by Respondent all took place after June 2004 and these

are narrowed down to six transactions that are not comparable to the Project.*°?

Claimant argues that the valuation is not credible because (i) it incorrectly excludes the value
of the steel plant;*° (ii) the valuation focusses on a small set of transactions that are not
comparable to the Project; and (iii) it does not appreciate the unique technical and economic

merits of the Project.*°

Claimant contends that Respondent’s valuation does not have jurisprudential support as

tribunals have only considered comparable valuation approaches suitable where the

transactions are genuinely or sufficiently comparable.*°>

Respondent’s Position

Respondent proposes that the appropriate method of valuation for this matter is a valuation
based on comparables.* Under this method, Respondent explains that an analysis of iron ore
project transactions is conducted, which would allow the identification of a transaction value
in USD per tonne of iron (Respondent uses the catalogue of transactions in the S&P Global
Database), and that the transaction value would then be applied to Aswan’s project
resources.*”” Respondent notes that to “ensure the accuracy of the selected comparables”, the
SRK Report chose to: (i) exclude the projects that were operating and those at the reserve
stage and (ii) focus the valuation on the 2004-2005 period.** Respondent argues that these
choices are favourable to Claimant as the former results in the projects that remained in the
pool having a higher iron concentrate and lower phosphorus and the latter results in the use of
higher prices of iron ore compared to 2000-2004 (when iron prices were lower).8” The six
transactions upon which the SRK Report was based had a median transaction value of
USD 0.19 per ton of iron ore. *'° On this basis, Respondent argues that the “absolute
maximum” valuation of the Aswan Project (of 79.68 million tonnes) should be between
USD 3.1 million and USD 6.9 million.*'' Claimant, a 12% shareholder, may therefore only
claim for a sum between USD 372,000 and USD 828,000.*!? In its Rejoinder, Respondent
highlights that the estimate of USD 3.1 million is optimistic because the resources and

reserves were not assessed at the same level of certainty as were the comparables.*!>

Respondent argues that the value of the Project should be limited to the value of the mine:
there was no methodology to make the iron ore suitable for steel production and no additional

value should be added for the hypothetical project of constructing a factory near the mine.*!*

Bahgat v. Egypt

23 December 2019

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal is not convinced of the suitability of the valuation based on the comparable
transactions method as proposed by Respondent although this method has been used in the
practice of investment arbitration. *'* The comparable transaction method determines the
project value based on transactions involving projects at a similar stage of development. It is
mostly used when the project is at an early stage of development and the DCF method cannot
be used and it is inappropriate to rely on lost investments. The problem in using this method

of comparable transactions is to identify comparable projects.

In the view of the Tribunal, the identification of the comparable projects was not convincing.
Respondent in applying this method does not reflect sufficiently that the project at hand is not
only a mining but also a steel making project. Focusing only on mining, namely on a median
transaction value of USD 0.19 per ton of ore, disregards the potential added value of the
planned steel making activities. In the view of the Tribunal, the Project’s particularity was
this combination mining and steel making with the view to reducing the costs of
transportation of ore. Claimant always emphasised that it was not the intention of this Project
to sell iron ore. The Tribunal is aware that Respondent doubts the technical and economic
viability of steelmaking but such doubts should not have influenced Respondent’s choice of

comparable transactions.
5. Violation of FET Clause under the 1980 BIT and 2004 BIT

The Tribunal has decided that the way the prosecution against Claimant was conducted and
the treatment he received from the lower courts in Egypt constituted a violation of the FET
clause in Article 2(1) of the 1980 BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal has to decide if and what
compensation Claimant should be awarded. Such a decision has to take into account that
Claimant will be compensated for the indirect expropriation, which was the result of his
arrest. The Tribunal is of the view that, considering the circumstances of the case, it is
necessary to distinguish between the methods used by the prosecution and the lower court,
which were severely criticized by the Supreme State Security Court of Egypt and the
consequences of the arrest and sentencing of Claimant. Considering that the prosecution

neglected evidence in its possession and the lower court sentenced Claimant to forced labour

  

without evidence, the Tribunal considers that Claimant should be adequately compensated. In

doing so, the Tribunal applies the general principle that internationally wrongful acts entail

responsibility and liability. The Tribunal considers the amount of USD 3 million to be

adequate.

The Tribunal has decided that not lifting the travel ban on Claimant after his acquittal, the
belated de-freezing of his assets, and the continued freezing of the assets of the Companies
constituted a violation of the FET clause under Article 2(2) of the 2004 BIT. Considering the
circumstances of the situation and referring to the reasoning set out in Paragraphs 278-282

above, the Tribunal considers compensation of USD | million appropriate.
6. Moral Damages

Claimant’s Position

Claimant argues that moral, non-material damages are compensable in international law.*!®
Article 31 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility refers to the duty to compensate
“material or moral” damages.*!’ Further, Claimant refers to the awards of prior investment

arbitration tribunals that have granted moral damages to investors.*!8

Claimant contends that this Tribunal is competent to decide the claim for moral damages
because this is an investment claim, not a human rights claim. *!? Claimant notes that

investment arbitration tribunals have held that moral damages can be claimed in investment

disputes. *?°

Claimant argues that he was imprisoned for over three years on false charges and underwent
physical and mental suffering during this period.*?! Further, he contends that his reputation

was tarnished by the Egyptian authorities.*” For these actions, Claimant seeks USD 5 million

in moral damages.**’ Claimant maintains that this is an exceptional circumstance warranting

moral damages.*™ He was kept in jail and subject to a travel ban for several months after his

him large penalties and dismissing him from positions at the Companies, also humiliated
him.*” Claimant submits that Claimant’s imprisonment also had an adverse impact on his

family.*?7

Claimant points to the similarities between his case and a recent case under the Dutch-
Vietnam BIT in which the claimant was awarded USD 10 million in moral damages: both

cases involve arrests by Respondent State.*”*

Claimant distinguishes Biloune v. Ghana (where moral damages were not granted) from the
present case, because the claimant in Biloune v. Ghana, unlike Mr Bahgat, specifically
claimed a violation of human rights and did not seek moral damages.*” Claimant reiterates
that his claim is related to the irreparable reputational loss he faced as a result of
Respondent’s measures and the fact that Respondent made no effort to reinstate Claimant’s
business and reputation upon his release.**° Claimant explains that the moral damages claim
is linked to his investment because the reputational harm was a part of the principal damage
suffered by Claimant in connection with the loss of his investment and that he has satisfied
his burden of proof so long as the injury to Claimant’s investment was caused by

Respondent’s measures.**!

Claimant distinguishes Stati et al v. Kazakhstan (in which the moral damages claim was

denied for not being exceptional) from his case, because the claimant in Stati et al v.

Kazakhstan was only imprisoned for a few months.’

Claimant considers that through his testimony he has substantiated this claim that
Respondent’s breaches of the investment protections caused Claimant’s physical pain and

suffering.*

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

Claimant does not consider his moral damages claim to be unrealistic, noting that the tribunal
in Al-Kharafi v. Libya awarded USD 30 million in moral damages to the claimant.*** Merely
because there is not a method to determine moral damages, Claimant argues, does not mean

that the damage suffered by Claimant was not real and does not deserve compensation.**

Claimant argues that Respondent has raised its objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to

award moral damages in this matter in an untimely fashion.**°

Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that the claim for moral damages fails for four reasons.

First, this Tribunal is not competent to adjudicate matters concerning human rights. §*”
Respondent notes that the tribunal in Biloune v. Ghana rejected jurisdiction over a claim for
damages related to the claimant’s detention and expulsion on the basis that its jurisdiction was
limited to the treatment of the claimant’s investment and did not extend to human rights.**
Respondent highlights that Claimant has not proved the connection between his investment

and the moral damages he claims.*” Respondent also notes that this claim in substance

remains one for human rights violations.”

Second, Respondent argues that Claimant’s circumstances are not sufficiently exceptional to
warrant moral damages.**! Respondent explains that the tribunal in Stati et al v. Kazakhstan
did not award the claimants moral damages despite finding the respondent’s treatment of the
claimants to be “severe, intentional and multi-faceted”.* Respondent argues that Claimant

has not substantiated how his circumstances were worse than those in Sati et al v.

Kazakhstan and argues that the charges against Claimant were not “false”.*

Respondent
maintains that Claimant’s moral damages claim is based on his imprisonment, which was
neither egregious, nor in violation of the norms of international law.*“* Respondent states that
Claimant does not meet the Lemire v. Ukraine test because Claimant has not shown: (i) that
Respondent contravened the norms “according to which civilized nations are expected to act”
or (ii) a complete loss of reputation and position in society, loss of business and severe
upheaval to his family.**5 Regarding the first criteria, Respondent reiterates that Claimant's
circumstances were not “exceptional”; he was prosecuted in accordance with Egyptian law
and was given a fair hearing.*“° Respondent submits that Claimant’s detention after his
acquittal was in relation to another criminal sentence and that his acquittal was in any case
based on the Egyptian court receiving incomplete information about the payment to MD.*”
Respondent maintains that Claimant has not established a causal link between the actions
alleged and Respondent.** Respondent denies a causal link between its actions and the loss of
Claimant’s reputation: the Project failed on account of its shortcomings and Claimant would
have suffered reputational loss in relation to his imprisonment for his forgery conviction in

any event.*”

Third, Respondent submits that Claimant’s moral damages claim is unsubstantiated and does
not meet the high threshold required for the award of moral damages: Claimant was able to
obtain recourse from imprisonment using the Egyptian criminal procedure system and was

eventually released.*°°

Finally, Respondent considers that the quantum of moral damages claimed by Claimant is
unrealistic and not in line with the modest damages generally awarded by investment
tribunals.**! Respondent notes that the Desert Line v. Yemen tribunal awarded the claimant
USD 1 million in moral damages as against the USD 104 million claimed, and the von Pezold

Respondent notes that

reliance on Al-Kharafi & Sons v. Libya to be misplaced because that tribunal adjudicated the

dispute (including the award of damages) under Libyan law, rather than international law.*°°

Respondent argues that Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility must be read
with Article 36, the commentary to which notes that compensation does not have an
exemplary nature and is not intended to punish the responsible State.**° Respondent highlights
that reparations in investment law take the form of the public international law principle of
satisfaction and requests the Tribunal, should it find a breach, to award Claimant satisfaction

rather than damages.**”

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal notes that there is no reference in the 1980 BIT to awarding moral damages
connected with a dispute concerning investment protection. The Tribunal further is convinced
that when the 1980 BIT was drafted the States involved had not in mind to cover damages for
human rights violations having occurred in connection with infringements on investments.
However, the Tribunal also takes note of the fact that the concern for the protection of human
rights has become a dominant consideration in all aspects of international relations, including
economic relations. The Tribunal has scrutinized the existing jurisprudence such as Desert

Line v. Yemen and von Pezold v. Zimbabwe.
The Tribunal finds that, though the events in the case might have warranted an award of

moral damages, Claimant has failed to convince the Tribunal of its competence to award such

damages under the treaties in question.

In dismissing the claim for moral damages, the Tribunal does not have any doubt that the
prosecution of Claimant, his imprisonment, and sentencing to forced labour were
disproportionately harsh and particularly degrading for Claimant. It finds the reasoning of
Respondent that the treatment of Claimant was in accordance with Egyptian law formalistic,
disregarding the circumstances of such arrest, the other measures taken and the economic
consequences of such measures. The Tribunal doubts whether the measures taken against

Claimant and his companies met international standards for criminal prosecution.

INTEREST

Claimant’s Position

Claimant argues that full reparation requires that he be paid compound interest on the award
of damages.*** He notes that Article 38(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and

commentators support his position.*°

Claimant argues that compound interest is now applied as a rule by tribunals because it
reflects economic reality and ensures full reparation. * Therefore, Claimant explains,
Mr Matthews has applied a LIBOR plus 4% interest rate compounded annually in valuing the
sums due to Claimant.**! Claimant, relying on arbitral precedent, argues that this interest rate

is not unusual and is less than the current Egyptian sovereign bond rate of 18.4%.8°*

Wasted costs 39.8 86.6 126.4

 

Claimant argues that if the Tribunal is minded to adopt the wasted costs or lost investment
approach, it should award a 10% return rate on the loss, resulting in a claim of

USD 234.1 million.8*

Claimant argues that there is no principle of international law that prohibits the awarding of
interest of a sum greater than the principal and notes that other tribunals have rejected this

argument made by Egypt.*°*

Further, Claimant submits that there is no basis to preclude him from interest for certain
periods of time, such as for his alleged delay in bringing these proceedings (which delay,

Claimant denies) and for the period during which these arbitral proceedings were bifurcated

(which Claimant points out was requested by Respondent).*°°

Respondent’s Position

Respondent does not challenge the principle of awarding interest with damages, but considers

867

Claimant’s position to be unreasonable.**’ Respondent states that Claimant’s interest claim

ignores that Egyptian law prohibits compound interest and awarding interest in excess of the
principal.** It cannot therefore be argued that Egypt consented to the award of compound
interest for investments covered by the BITs.* Respondent submits that, if at all, Claimant

should only be awarded simple interest and a sum that does not exceed the principal.*”

Respondent criticises the change in the interest rate claimed in the Inglis Report (LIBOR) and
the Matthews Report (LIBOR + 4%). *' Respondent maintains that the latter rate is

unjustified and there is no reason to award interest higher than LIBOR (which already favours

Claimant).

Respondent notes that Claimant cannot benefit from the delays that he caused.*”? Respondent
notes that Claimant waited 6 years after leaving Egypt in 2005 to bring a Notice of Dispute in
2011 and a Request for Arbitration in 2012.8 Moreover, Respondent notes that Claimant
agreed to bifurcate the arbitration and to suspend proceedings until the Finnish courts had
made a determination regarding his nationality.’ Respondent clarifies that it did not initiate
the proceedings before the Finnish courts, but that these were likely commenced sua sponte
by the Finnish authorities.*’° Given that this arbitration has faced significant delays that
cannot be attributed to Respondent, it insists that it should not be ordered to pay compound
interest at an unreasonable rate.’” Respondent, instead presents an alternative simple interest

calculation that accounts for the various delays.*”*

Tribunal’s Analysis

As far as interests are concerned, the Tribunal has to decide whether LIBOR is appropriate,
and whether to apply it as a base rate on its own, or whether to add a premium. The Tribunal
notes that originally, the Parties to this arbitration agreed to use USD 12 month LIBOR, but
Claimant argues that LIBOR plus a 4% spread is appropriate. Respondent argues that LIBOR
without a premium is appropriate, and notes this was initially accepted by Claimant’s first

expert, Mr Inglis.

The Tribunal notes that in a recent study of ICSID awards, three broad categories of interest
rates were used: base rates plus a spread (the base rate being a market rate of some kind and
usually US Treasury bill rate, or interbank lending rate such as LIBOR, EURIBOR, ROBOR,
BRIBOR); a base rate without a spread; and a number specified by the tribunal. However, in
the view of the Tribunal a tendency exists to use LIBOR. Several awards in establishing a
normal commercial rate have selected LIBOR. This is true for example for Rusoro Mining v.
Venezuela.*” As a justification for this choice, the award emphasised that LIBOR reflects the

interest rate at which banks lend to each other money and thus was commercially widely

accepted.**° The award in the case Flughafen Ziirich A.G. and Gestion e Ingeneria IDC SA v.
Venezuela emphasised that LIBOR was “universally accepted as a reference for setting
interest rates for loans, deposits and other instruments financial.” *’' The award in

RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation followed the same practice.**”

In the cases mentioned so far, an additional 4% has been added to compensate the present low
interest rates. However, the rate of LIBOR plus 2% has frequently been awarded by
investment tribunals.**? For example, the tribunal in Lemire v Ukraine found in 2011 that
LIBOR plus 2% “is a reasonable margin, which reflects the surcharge which an average
borrower would have to pay for obtaining financing based on LIBOR.”* This approach was

adopted in 2017 by the tribunal in Burlington v Ecuador.

The Tribunal will now turn to the question of whether a compound or a simple interest is
appropriate. That Tribunal notes the argument of Respondent that a compound interest is not
in conformity with Egyptian national law. This argument does not convince the Tribunal.
First, it has to be noted that investment arbitration is based upon international law as
expressed in the 1980 BIT and, second if the BIT is silent on the respective issue, on the
jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals. Respondent should be minded that it objected to the
arguments advanced by Claimant that the Tribunal should consider a violation of Egyptian
national law. That logically excludes having reference to Egyptian national law if it favours
the position of Respondent. Second, there is a clearly established trend in investment
arbitration to award compound interest for expropriations as that is deemed to be “better
reflecting actual economic realities both for the purpose of remedying the loss actually

incurred by the injured party and for the prevention of unjustified enrichment of Respondent

state.”**5 In a study of 167 published ICSID awards, 60 awarded prejudgment interest with 48
of those 60 awarding compound pre-award interest. In recent cases, from 2010 onwards, the
trend has been to award compound pre-award interest unless the claimant requests simple
interest.**° Finally, the Tribunal would like to note that in several investment cases against the
Egyptian state, compound interest has been applied, even where Egypt has argued that under
domestic Egyptian law, compound interest is not allowed. In Siag and Vecchi v. Arab
Republic of Egypt,’*’ Respondent had argued that only simple interest should be applied at a
rate of just 4% in line with domestic Egyptian law. The tribunal found that interest should be

paid on all sums of damages at the six-month LIBOR rate compounded six-monthly stating:

The Tribunal has _no hesitation in ruling that interest should run from the date of the
expropriation, and that it should be compounded. The claimants submitted that since 2000,
no less than 15 out of 16 BIT tribunals have awarded compound interest on damages in
investment disputes. Whether or not that statistic is correct, the Tribunal is certain that in
recent times compound interest has indeed been awarded more often than not, and is
becoming widely accepted as an appropriate and necessary component of compensation for
expropriation. °°

Another case to this extent is Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. SA v. Arab
Republic of Egypt.**° The Tribunal emphasised:

  
  

. .. that the provision in Egyptian law on which Respondent relies is not applicable to
claims based on the BIT, ic., public international law . . . . Regarding such claims for
expropriation, international jurisprudence and literature have recently, after detailed
consideration, concluded that interest is an integral part of the compensation due after the
award and that compound (as opposed to simple) interest is at present deemed appropriate
as the standard of international law in such expropriation cases.

In Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,**° the arbitral tribunal stated that an award of
compound (as opposed to simple) interest is generally appropriate in most modern,
commercial arbitrations. Respondent relies on SPP v. Egypt**' in support of its defences that

(i) compound interest is not appropriate, and (ii) interest may not exceed principal when

domestic law prohibits it. While the tribunal in SPP v. Egypt did not award compound interest
because of Article 232 of the Civil Code, they did explain that based on decisions of the
Egyptian Cour de Cassation and doctrinal opinion, “under Egyptian law consideration is
given to changes occurring in the price of currency ‘in which the compensation is to be
estimated’.” *°? The Tribunal discards the reference of Respondent to the Duke Energy
Electoquil Partners & Electroquil SA v. Ecuador,*”? since that case was not an expropriation
dispute, but a dispute arising from alleged breaches of agreements entered into by the parties

for electrical power generation.

In this regard, the Tribunal considers the annulment proceeding decision in Wena Hotels v.

Egypt®™ to be instructive when considering the weight of the Egyptian Civil Code:

In particular, the rules of international law that directly or indirectly relate to the State’s
consent prevail over domestic rules that might be incompatible with them. In this context it
cannot be concluded that the resort to the rules of international law under the Convention,
or under particular treaties related to its operation, is antagonistic to that State’s national
interest.

This doctrine applies in the view of the Tribunal not only to the issue of compound interest
but also to alleged Egyptian law-based restrictions on interest to which Respondent refers,
such as the issue whether the amount of interest must not exceed the principal. In that respect,

the Tribunal would like to return to the findings in Wena Hotels, which were approved by the

El Paso v. Argentina tribunal (at Paragraph 536):*°°

Particular emphasis is put on this view when the rules in question have been expressly
accepted by the host State. Indeed, under the Egyptian Constitution treaties that have been
ratified and published “have the force of law.” Most commentators interpret this provision
as equating treaties with domestic legislation. On occasions, the courts have decided that
treaty rules prevail not only over prior legislation but also over subsequent legislation. It
has also been held that lex specialis such as treaty law prevails over lex generalis embodied
in domestic law. A number of important domestic laws, including the Civil Code and Code
of Civil Procedure of Egypt, provide in certain matters for a “without prejudice clause” in
favor of the relevant treaty provisions. This amounts to a kind of renvoi to international
law by the very law of the host State.

This treaty law and practice evidences that when a tribunal applies the law embodied in a
treaty to which Egypt is a party it is not applying rules alien to the domestic legal system of

this country. This might also be true of other sources of international law, such as those
listed in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice mentioned above.
Therefore, the reliance of the Tribunal on the IPPA as the primary source of law is not in
derogation or contradiction to the Egyptian law and policy on this matter. In fact, Egyptian
law and investment policies are fully supportive of the rights of investors in that country.
The ICSID Convention and the related bilateral investment treaties are specifically
mentioned in Egypt's foreign investment policy statements.
The Tribunal will now turn to the question of whether the interest is payable during the period
after Claimant could leave Egypt until he filed the Statement of Claim and whether interest is
payable for the period when these arbitral proceedings were suspended due to the proceedings

in Finland concerning Claimant’s nationality. Respondent objects to including either period.

The Tribunal takes the view that after his imprisonment and being sentenced to forced labour
Claimant needed time to recover, to engage legal assistance, and to arrange funding for his
legal assistance. Apart from that, it was necessary for him to collect the necessary documents
for this arbitration, which were mostly left behind in Egypt. As to the period of suspension
due to the Finnish nationality proceedings, it was Respondent that triggered the Finnish
internal proceedings and was eventually proved to have been wrong in doing so. Therefore,
Respondent cannot successfully argue that it was not involved in causing this period of delay

in this arbitration.

Based on the above, the Tribunal concludes that the period between Claimant’s release from
prison and the Statement of Claim and the period of suspension of these proceedings due to
the domestic Finnish nationality proceedings are to be included in calculating interest to be

paid on the amount of compensation for the damages Claimant had suffered.

On the basis of the considerations above, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent shall pay to
Claimant interest of LIBOR plus 2%, from the date of expropriation (19 February 2000),
compounded on yearly intervals. The Tribunal additionally observes that its findings on the
appropriate interest rate are also consistent with the commercial rates referenced by the

contracting parties to the 2004 BIT in Article 6(b).

Case 1:20-cv-02169 Document 1-1 Filed 08/07/20 Page 158 of 177

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

As noted in Procedural Orders No. 2, No. 4, and in the Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal has
reserved all questions of costs for the entire arbitral proceedings (including jurisdiction,

admissibility and the merits), for determination in this phase of the arbitration.

A. RELEVANT PROVISIONS

Article 7.2(d) of the 1980 BIT provides that “the costs of the arbitration shall be shared
equally.” There is no such provision in the 2004 BIT, which incorporates by reference the
UNCITRAL Rules. Neither Party submits that the Tribunal’s decision on costs in the present
arbitration should be determined by Article 7.2(d) of the 1980 BIT. Instead, with respect to
costs, both sides have preferred to invoke the provisions of the UNCITRAL Rules throughout
the arbitration proceedings in order to claim all of their costs. This has been the case since the
2012 interim measures applications through to the two rounds of costs submissions in June
and July 2019. Claimant has argued, by reference to Respondent’s prior costs submissions,
that the Parties must be taken as agreeing that Article 7.2(d) of the 1980 BIT does not apply
and that the UNCITRAL Rules should apply instead.**’ Respondent has not rejected this

position.
Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term “costs” includes
only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be
fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

 

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other as nce required by the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witness
by the arbitral tribunal;

 

's to the extent such expenses are approved

 

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs
were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral
tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the
Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

Article 39 of the UNCITRAL Rules states in relevant part:

(1) The fees of the arbitral tribunal shall be reasonable in amount, taking into account
the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject-matter, the time spent by the
arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the case.

See Claimant’s Statement of Costs, para. 5, citing Respondent’s costs claim for interim measures,
7 December 2012.

Case 1:20-cv-02169 Document 1-1 Filed 08/07/20 Page 159 of 177

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules states in relevant part that:

(1) — Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each
of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

(2) | With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in
article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances
of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may
apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable.

The UNCITRAL Rules thus first require the Tribunal to fix the costs in its Final Award,
setting out the amounts for specific categories listed in Article 38. The rules then require the
Tribunal to exercise its discretion in apportioning the costs of arbitration. Under Article 40(1)
of the UNCITRAL Rules, there is a presumption that the unsuccessful party bears the costs of
the arbitration, subject to any determination by the Tribunal as to what apportionment may be
reasonable in the circumstances of the case. However, under Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL
Rules, with respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance, there is no such
presumption and the Tribunal is free to determine which party shall reasonably bear those

costs in the circumstances of the case.

As set out in Section II of this Final Award, in accordance with directions issued at the close
of the Merits Hearing, and in the Tribunal’s letter of 29 April 2019, Claimant filed his
Statement of Costs on 9 June 2019. Respondent, having received an extension, filed its
Statement on Costs on 25 June 2019. Both Parties submitted reply submissions on costs on 9

July 2019.

B. FIXING OF THE COSTS UNDER ARTICLE 38
In this section the Tribunal first fixes the costs of the arbitration under Article 38(a), (b), (c),

(d), and (f) (the “Arbitration Costs”), and then fixes the reasonable costs of legal

representation and assistance of the successful party under Article 38(e) (the “Legal Costs’).
1. Arbitration Costs

The Parties have deposited a total of EUR 1,160,000 with the PCA to cover arbitration costs;
ie., EUR 580,000 each. As recounted in Part II of this Final Award, Respondent failed to
make deposit payments in a timely manner, with the result that the Tribunal issued various
reminders, and ultimately called on Claimant to make substitute payments under Article 41(4)

of the UNCITRAL Rules. On 20 April 2019, in accordance with the Tribunal’s directions,

Bahgat v. Egypt
Final Award
23 December 2019

Respondent reimbursed Claimant the amount of EUR 275,000 reflecting the amount of those

substitute payments.

In accordance with Article 39 of the UNCITRAL Rules, “the fees of the arbitral tribunal shall
be reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the
subject-matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the

case.”

In June 2012, the Parties and Tribunal agreed, in signed Terms of Appointment, on the

arrangements for the Tribunal’s fees and expenses, including those of the PCA as Registry.

The Tribunal fixes the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, in accordance with Articles 38(a)
and (b), and Article 39 of the UNCITRAL Rules, and Paragraph 8 of the Terms of

Appointment, as follows:
¢ Professor Riidiger Wolfrum: EUR 235,544.52 in fees and EUR 7,917.41 in expenses;

e Professor W. Michael Reisman: EUR 207,875.00 in fees and EUR 37,654.47 in

expenses;

¢ Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia (until 30 September 2018): EUR 117,500.00 in
fees and EUR 12,157.48 in expenses; and

e Mr Laurent Lévy (from 30 October 2018): EUR 202,500.00 in fees and
EUR 10,578.94 in expenses.

In accordance with Article 38(c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and Paragraph 9 of the Terms of
Appointment, the PCA’s fees and expenses for registry services in assistance of the Tribunal

amount to EUR 212,923.41 and EUR 1,579.05 respectively.

Other arbitration costs incurred pursuant to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules and approved
by the Tribunal in the course of these proceedings, including for hearing and meeting
facilities, catering, court reporters, IT support, courier costs, bank costs, communications,

supplies, and court filing fees, amount to EUR 113,769.72.

The Tribunal considers these amounts reasonable within the meaning of Article 39(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, bearing in mind the hourly rate agreed by the Parties at the outset of the
case (EUR 500), the amount relative to the Parties’ claimed costs, as detailed in section (2)

below; the complexity and length of proceedings, which included provisional measures

requests, bifurcation of the jurisdiction/admissibility phase, separate hearings for aspects of
the merits to accommodate reconstitution of the tribunal, issuance of 16 reasoned procedural
orders and two awards. Moreover, neither Party has submitted that the arbitration costs

incurred in this case are unreasonable.

Accordingly, the total Arbitration Costs per Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules (not
including legal costs under Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules) are fixed in the amount of
EUR 1,160,000.

Apportionment of this amount of EUR 1,160,000 in accordance with Article 40(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, is addressed in Section X.B.3 below.

The Tribunal next turns to fixing the reasonable costs of legal representation and assistance of

the successful party under Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules.
2. Reasonable Costs of Legal Representation and Assistance

Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules requires the Tribunal to fix the “costs for legal
representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the
arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the
amount of such costs is reasonable.” The Tribunal sets out below the amounts of costs for

legal representation and assistance that are claimed by each of the Parties.

Claimant's Position

Claimant seeks an order that Respondent pay all the costs of the arbitration, including all the
fees and expenses of the PCA and the Tribunal, all Claimant’s reasonable costs of legal
representation and assistance (including funding costs), all the costs of his experts and
witnesses and all related expenses incurred by him.*** Claimant also requests interest on costs

at the rate of LIBOR plus 4%.

Claimant’s enumerated costs claims total EUR 787,316.50, GBP 6,884,800.53 and
USD 1,000,000. These figures include the contributions made by Claimant to the Tribunal
deposit (EUR 580,000) (which are covered by the Tribunal’s finding at Paragraph 559 above
and will not be double-counted as legal costs). The figures do not include the substantial

funding costs additionally sought by Claimant, or the post-award interest on costs, neither of

Claimant regards his legal and expert costs as “reasonable in light of the exceptional length of

these proceedings and the scope and complexity of the factual, legal, technical and valuation

issues at stake, most or all of which have been raised and contested by the Respondent.”° He

maintains the numbers are “entirely within the normal range for investment treaty arbitrations,

let alone ones which have extended for nearly a decade.”°

Claimant submits that the costs he is entitled to recover should include (i) the fees owed to his

incurred in Phase I).

former counsel (Saunders) and current counsel (Fietta) that have already been incurred but
which will become payable only on a successful recovery and (ii) success fees to Saunders
and Fietta, likewise payable only if Claimant prevails. °°’ Claimant points to Khan v.
Mongolia and Siag v. Egypt as examples where other investor-state tribunals have deemed

such fees recoverable.*°

Claimant also contends that his funding costs should be included in the recoverable costs.°”

He points out that without funding, he would have been unable to bring the claim because

Respondent’s unlawful conduct left him impecunious.

Initially, Claimant had a funding arrangement with Buttonwood Legal Capital Limited, Hong
Kong (“Buttonwood”), pursuant to which he is obliged to re-pay the sum lent
(GBP 1,342,601.38) plus 16% p.a. interest, as well as a success fee of GBP 1,539,557 + 9%
of proceeds of the arbitration, less the Buttonwood Interest. In 2017, after Buttonwood went
bankrupt, and the arbitration proceedings were delayed due to the Finnish proceedings,
Claimant later refinanced the claim with Vannin. The arrangement with Vannin is “non-
recourse” (i.e. the Claimant has no obligation to repay the funds advanced to him to pursue
the arbitration in the event he ultimately recovers no damages). The arrangement includes an
obligation on Claimant to pay a premium to Vannin, the size of which depends on the timing
and amount of any final damages and costs award, but will in any event exceed USD 22.5
million.°%

Claimant refers the Tribunal to Essar Oilfields v. Norscot, a decision of English High Court
which upheld an award of an arbitrator finding a claimant entitled to the costs of its litigation
funding.” According to Claimant, the overarching consideration for the arbitrator in the case
was “what justice requires”. Claimant adopts the following eight criteria outlined by the
arbitrator in the case underlying Essar v. Norscot and submits they all apply in his favour in

the present case:°!°

(1) the conduct of the parties; (2) the relative financial situation of the parties; (3) the losing
party has knowledge of the successful party’s financial predicament; (4) the magnitude of

alternative source of financing; (6) the losing party is aware at least that such recourse has

and (8) the successful party has contracted the funding on standard market rates and terms
for such facility.

Claimant also notes the 2017 SIAC Investment Arbitration Rules recognize that arbitral

tribunals may take into account third-party funding arrangements in rendering costs orders.!!

Claimant’s Statement of Costs describes the “waterfall”, i.e., the order in which various
recipients will be paid out of any damages and costs awards he receives in this Final Award,
starting with Vannin and ending with Mr Bahgat himself.*!?

Claimant’s Costs Reply does not take issue with the amounts claimed by Respondent for the

costs of its legal representation or assistance. Rather, Claimant focuses on arguments made

by Respondent with respect to apportionment of the costs (as to which, see Section 3 below).
Respondent’s Position

In its Statement of Costs, Respondent claims its total costs and expenses in relation to the

arbitration in the sum of EUR 1,742.803.42 and EGP 168,400.54.

“simply outrageous”.°!° Respondent does not consider Claimant’s claim for Legal Costs to be
reasonable within the meaning of Article 38(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, noting the Tribunal
may be guided by comparing the amounts of costs claimed by each side, and in assessing

whether the claim is proportionate to the amount in dispute.*"”

sunk costs claimed in the arbitration. It submits that “investment arbitration should not be the
means by which third parties foreign to the investment should reap huge sums and line their
pockets simply because they were prepared to bear the actual costs of prosecuting the
investor’s claims and because the investor chose to accept totally unacceptable and

disproportionate funding costs.”°!*

Even excluding the funding costs, Respondent observes that Claimant’s costs claim far
exceeds average costs of claimants in UNCITRAL arbitrations and is excessive in
circumstances where the case was not particularly complex.°!? It submits the legal costs

claimed should be dismissed as unreasonable under Article 38.

Respondent contends that the following categories of claimed costs do not constitute

recoverable arbitration costs:

e Success fees of counsel. Respondent submits these cannot be recovered as they are a
reward granted in consideration of success and not arbitration costs; moreover they are
not reasonable as they already coming on top of high fixed attorney’s fees.”

e Funding costs. Respondent does not take issue with Claimant’s request to reimburse
him for arbitration costs already covered by the funder (such as legal and expert fees),
but rather the funding costs set out in Section V.E of Claimant’s Statement of Costs.°?!

Respondent points out that it is unclear how amounts could be owed to Buttonwood, a
bankrupt entity, or if a premium is owed to Vannin if there is a damages award for less
than USD 100 million.°” Respondent does not accept that funding costs, in the form of
success fees, constitute costs of “legal representation or assistance” within the meaning
of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Further, the amounts of funding costs (up to
USD 80 million, assuming no payment before 2022), are far from reasonable, including
the abusive interest rate of 16% in the Buttonwood arrangement, and should be
dismissed. °*? Respondent considers that the case of Essar v. Norscot is irrelevant
because it focuses on the meaning of “other costs” in the rules (ICC) and law (English)
applicable in that case, which is not a category of costs covered by Article 38 of the
UNCITRAL Rules. Nevertheless, it addresses the factors set out in that case and

that its conduct has been cooperative throughout proceedings, and that it should not be

and irresponsible funding terms.°™*

proceedings. The EUR 162,156.10 claimed in respect of those proceedings is outside

the scope of the costs that can be awarded by this Tribunal.

Respondent accordingly requests that the Tribunal dismisses Claimant’s costs claim as

unreasonable within the meaning of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules.

Tribunal’s Analysis

In fixing the costs pursuant to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal is guided by

the elements set out in the text of that provision.

First, the provision requires the Tribunal to identify the “successful party”. Having prevailed
on jurisdiction, and most of his claims on liability, and having been awarded a sum of
damages, albeit significantly lower than the amount claimed, Mr Bahgat is to be considered
the “successful party”. The degree of his success, and the extent to which it should be taken
into account in the apportionment of costs under Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, is dealt
with in the subsequent section. For purposes of fixing the costs under Article 38(e), the
Tribunal treats Claimant as the successful party. It is therefore unnecessary to fix the costs of
Respondent’s legal representation and assistance. The Tribunal observes however, that the
amounts claimed by Respondent, as set out in the table at Paragraph 575 above, are
reasonable in the circumstances of the case. Furthermore, Claimant has made no argument

that Respondent’s costs are unreasonable in amount.

Respondent has objected to the Tribunal adding the costs for the Finnish proceedings as costs
of arbitration. The Tribunal cannot accept the statement of Respondent that Respondent was
not involved in the Finnish proceedings. It is on the record that such proceedings were

triggered by Respondent.”°

Second, Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules requires the Tribunal to identify the “costs for

legal representation and assistance if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings,
and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable.” This clause in Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules is, in the view of the

Tribunal, particularly relevant in this case.

The Tribunal notes that the costs claimed by Claimant under Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL
Rules exceed the equivalent costs of Respondent. This is mainly due to two factors, the
success fees claimed by Saunders and by Fietta, respectively, and the funding costs claimed
by Buttonwood and Vannin, respectively. The Tribunal will deal with each of these two

factors in turn.

Respondent argues that success fees are not costs for legal representation and assistance under
Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal, however, takes a different position. The

wording ‘costs for legal representation and as

 

istance’ is open for interpretation; it all depends
whether such fees are being promised in connection with legal representation or assistance,
which is beyond dispute in the case at hand. Success fees have become common in
international litigation and not considering them as costs for legal representation and
assistance would deprive a party from finding adequate legal assistance.°?’ The Tribunal
accepts that Claimant had to incur success fees to get legal assistance. Further, the Tribunal
takes note of the arbitral jurisprudence indicating that “it is not unusual for claimants to spend
more on costs than respondents given, among other things, the burden of proof.” °°
Additionally, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has not further substantiated its view that

such costs are unreasonable.

Based on the above, the Tribunal decides that the success fees due to Claimant’s legal

representatives are reasonable legal costs according to Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

The Tribunal now will turn to the third party funding, namely the costs incurred by Claimant
vis-a-vis Buttonwood and Vannin. Respondent objects to the inclusion of such costs into the
costs apportionment system under Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Respondent’s
objection raises several questions, namely, whether third party funding costs are legal costs,

whether they were introduced appropriately into the proceedings and whether they are

reasonable.

Considering the particularities of this case, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to deal with
the abstract question of whether third party funding costs are costs for legal representation
and assistance. The Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion under the UNCITRAL Rules,

decides that Claimant’s third party funding costs shall be borne by Claimant.

In the circumstances, and in light of the factors outlined above, the Tribunal considers it
reasonable to fix, for purposes of Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimant’s
reasonable costs for legal representation and assistance at EUR 207,316.50,

GBP 6,844,800.53, and USD 1,000,000.
3. Apportionment of Costs under Article 40

Claimant’s Position

Claimant claims all costs incurred by him in this arbitration proceeding.°”

Claimant observes that should he prevail on the merits of the case, following his defeat of
Respondent’s multiple jurisdictional objections in the first phase, he will have prevailed on all
material aspects of the present dispute. Thus, to the extent success is an overriding factor in
determining the apportionment of costs under both Article 40(1) and 40(2) of the UNCITRAL
Rules, Claimant should be entitled to arbitration costs and the costs of his legal
representation.*” In any event, success is not the only relevant criterion. Claimant argues that
the “egregiousness” of Respondent’s treaty violations depriving him of his investment,
keeping him in prison and freezing his and his family’s assets should also be taken into
account. Similarly, the quality of his claims, the complexity of issues, the reasonableness of
the parties’ expenses and the conduct (or misconduct) of the parties should all militate in
favour of awarding Claimant costs.°*!

In particular, Claimant recalls (a) Respondent triggered the Finnish domestic proceedings
leading to suspension of the proceedings over 3 years, (b) Egypt’s breach of the
confidentiality obligations under the UNCITRAL Rules, (c) Egypt’s late jurisdictional
objections in its Reply Memorial, (d) Respondent’s repeated last minute extension requests,

(e) Respondent’s refusal until very recently to pay its share of the deposit without reasonable

explanation.?”

Claimant rejects the allegations of Respondent in its Statement of Costs that Claimant had
engaged in bad faith. It describes this as “merely the latest in a string of unsubstantiated ad
hominem attacks upon Claimant that have characterised Egypt’s conduct throughout the
arbitration” and show “desperation of its position”.° Claimant recalls the explanations he
provided throughout the proceedings as to the origin of the payment to Mannesmann, and also

the reasons why he raised his second criminal conviction at a late stage of proceedings.°**

In response to Respondent’s arguments about the Interim Measures and Jurisdiction phases,
Claimant recalls that he acted reasonably and prevailed in both stages and it is Respondent

that should bear the costs of those phases of the arbitration.°*

Claimant rejects the characterisation of its claim on the merits and quantum as “aggressive”.
He describes his case as an orthodox and reasonable case relying on witness and expert
statements, extensive pleadings and contemporaneous evidence and legal authority. Claimant
defends his legal and expert costs as entirely within the normal range for a case of such
length. Finally, he asserts that the financial situation of Egypt is irrelevant to a cost order and
cannot be plausibly used “to deny the proper administration of justice (which requires that
Claimant be reimbursed his costs in bringing a legitimate claim).”°**

For these reasons, Claimant argues Respondent’s request that the “Claimant should bear all of
the costs of this arbitration” should be dismissed, and he maintains his request that the
Tribunal render an award ordering Respondent to pay all the costs of the arbitration, including
fees and expenses of the PCA and Tribunal, all Claimant’s reasonable costs of legal
representation and assistance (including funding costs) all the costs of his experts and

witnesses and all related expenses incurred by him, as well as interest on those costs.°°”

Respondent’s Position

Respondent’s primary position is that if it is successful in convincing the Tribunal that all of
Claimant’s claims should be dismissed without merit in this case, then Claimant should bear

all of the costs of this arbitration as these proceedings should never have been commenced

and Egypt should not have had to bear any costs to defend itself.°** In so deciding,
Respondent submits that the Tribunal should take into account the alleged bad faith of
Claimant in his attempts to hide from the Tribunal (i) the real origin of the payment at the

heart of the first criminal proceedings and (ii) the second criminal conviction.°”

Respondent notes that its costs claim includes costs relating not just to the Merits but also to
Interim Measures and Jurisdiction. In this regard, it points out that the Interim Measure phase
was a “ruse” because it was initiated by Claimant on the basis that he had no access to

documents which it turns out in the Merits phase he did have.°*°

Respondent also maintains
that the Jurisdiction phase was triggered by reasonable jurisdictional objections, as evident by
the fact Claimant did not object to bifurcation, and by the mixed results in the Finnish

courts.*4!

In any event, even if the Tribunal were to find Egypt in breach of the BIT on the merits,
Respondent maintains that in addition to taking into account the above procedural points, the
Tribunal should apportion the costs of arbitration taking into account the level of success of
Claimant’s case. Respondent describes Claimant’s legal and quantum case as “extremely
aggressive” and without the “substantiation one is to expect in investment arbitration.” °”
Thus, if the Tribunal dismisses part or most of Claimant’s legal and/or damages claims, then
costs should be divided in a way that does not “unjustifiably penalize Respondent.”
Additionally, Respondent submits the Tribunal should bear in mind the overall amount of
costs claimed by each Party, noting Respondent itself kept its costs to a “very reasonable
level” especially in light of the “financial situation the Arab Republic of Egypt has been
facing.”

Respondent stresses the “reasonableness” requirement in both Article 40(1) and (2) when it
comes to apportionment, and interprets the provisions as excluding the costs-follow-the-event
tule for legal costs, and expressly allowing the Tribunal to derogate from it for other
arbitration costs. Respondent observes that in assessing the most appropriate apportionment

of costs, tribunals devise a bespoke result, taking into account the relative success of each

party on particular arguments and quantum of claims, as well as the parties’ conduct in the
context of the arbitration proceedings (and not before — otherwise the costs award would risk

becoming a form of punitive damages).**

Respondent points to the following circumstances which must be taken into account by the

Tribunal in apportioning costs under Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules:™°

e  Respondent’s conduct was cooperative. Respondent recalls its role in locating
documents which Claimant failed to do in substantiating its claim, in informing the
Tribunal of the quantity and quality of the mineral resources with additional experts,
and in swiftly appointing a replacement arbitrator who managed to be ready for the

duled hearing in D ber 2018, and in d ing flexibility in other ways to

ensure the hearing schedule could be preserved.

e Duration of proceedings. Properly analysed, Respondent notes that the length of
proceedings is not that extended in light of the suspension for 3 years for the Finnish

proceedings, and the bifurcation of proceedings into two phases.

¢  Misrepresentations by Claimant. According to Respondent, Claimant has made false
allegations that he had no access to documents and concealed a second criminal

conviction and the origins of the USD 30 million payment to MD.

Finally, Respondent stresses that the Tribunal must take into account the relative success of
the Parties in light of Claimant’s claim of more than USD 329 million with interest plus
USD 5 million as moral damages. If the Tribunal finds no expropriation or that damages were
far below that claimed, then Claimant should not be considered as a winning party.
Claimant’s arrangement with Vannin to pay a success fee only if over USD 100 million is

telling of the true meaning of ‘success’ in this case.°"”

As discussed above in respect of Article 38, Respondent considers that certain elements of
Claimant’s costs claim in particular are so unreasonable that they should not be reimbursed
irrespective of the outcome of the case on the merits. These include (a) success fees for
counsel; (b) funding costs on terms so unreasonable, extreme, and usurious that Respondent

could not possibly have appreciated simply by having been notified of the existence of third-

party funders; and (c) costs of the Finnish proceedings to which Respondent was not party.“

Accordingly, Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss Claimant’s claim for costs

notwithstanding the outcome of the proceedings.

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal shall proceed on the basis of Articles 40(1) and 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.
These provisions read:
(1) Except as provided for in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of

such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking
into account the circumstances of the case.

(2) With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38,
paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case,
shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

The Tribunal would like to emphasise that for apportionment of Arbitration Costs per
Article 40(1), the UNCITRAL Rules express a presumption in favour of costs follow the
event / loser pays, but that the Tribunal ultimately has discretion to apportion Arbitration

Costs as it sees fit.

As to the presumption that costs follow the event, the Tribunal reiterates that Claimant
prevailed in Phase I of the proceedings and, as far as Phase II is concerned, on liability,
however, significantly less so in quantum. However, this does not alone control the Tribunal’s
final decision on costs-apportionment. Claimant was successful in claiming that Respondent
breached its international obligations. Considering the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal
reiterates that Respondent did not pay its deposits for a significant period. It had to be
reminded frequently and Claimant had to pay the shares of Respondent to allow the

proceedings to continue.

The Tribunal notes that Claimant was less successful as far as quantum was concerned and

this fact has to be reflected in the Tribunal’s decision on cost apportionment.

Based on the considerations above, the Tribunal decides that Claimant shall be responsible for
10% of the Arbitration Costs, i.e. EUR 116,000. Thus, Respondent shall be ordered to pay to
Claimant EUR 464,000, which is the total advance deposit paid by Claimant (EUR 580,000)

less the arbitration costs for which Claimant is responsible (EUR 116,000).

As for apportionment of Legal Costs under Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the
Tribunal is “free to determine” the apportionment of Legal Costs, and considers it appropriate
in the circumstances of the present case, as described above, to apply the same apportionment
to the reasonable Legal Costs of Claimant as it does to the Arbitration Costs. Accordingly,
Respondent shall be ordered to pay to Claimant 90% of the amounts in Paragraph 592 above,
ie., shall pay Claimant the amounts of EUR 186,584.85, GBP 6,160,320.48, and
USD 900,000.

C. INTEREST ON COSTS

Claimant’s Position

The Tribunal recalls that Claimant seeks interest on costs in the amount of LIBOR + 4%.

Respondent's Position

Respondent has not contested Claimant’s position set out above in Paragraph 615.

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal, in considering the circumstances of the case, decides that the interest to be paid
on the payment of the Arbitration Costs and Legal Costs is USD LIBOR + 4% compounded
annually. The Tribunal notes that USD LIBOR + 4% is the interest on costs requested by
Claimant and that this figure has not been contested by Respondent in the context of the costs

claim.
