The Claimants are AS PNB Banka (formerly AS Norvik Banka) (the “Bank”), Mr
Grigory Guselnikov, Mrs Yulia Guselnikova, Mr Alexander Guselnikov, Miss Aglaya
Guselnikova and Master Pyotr Guselnikov (the “Shareholder Claimants”) (together,
the “Claimants”). The Bank is a joint stock company incorporated under the laws of
Latvia, whereas Mr Grigory Guselnikov, Mrs Yulia Guselnikova, Mr Alexander
Guselnikov, Miss Aglaya Guselnikova and Master Pyotr Guselnikov are nationals of

the United Kingdom.
The Respondent is the Republic of Latvia (the “Respondent or Latvia”).

The Claimants and the Respondent shall be referred to together as the “Parties”.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 14 December 2017, the Claimants submitted their Request for Arbitration (“RFA”)
to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the
“Centre”) in accordance with Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 18 March
1965 (“ICSID Convention”) and Article 8 of the Agreement between the Government
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of
the Republic of Latvia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (“UK-Latvia
BIT” or “Treaty”), which was signed on 24 January 1994 and entered into force on 15
February 1995.

On 28 December 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the RFA in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the

registration.
On 14 August 2018, the Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation (“Request for

Bifurcation”).

On 16 August 2018, the Tribunal held a first session by telephone conference. On 24
August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, setting out the agreed terms
5

for the conduct of the proceeding. The Parties’ subsequent filings on the Claimants’
application for provisional measures and the Claimants’ request for the disqualification
of Deloitte Legal ZAB as counsel for the Respondent are detailed in the respective

orders addressing those issues.!

On 22 August 2018, the European Commission (“EC”) applied for leave to file a
written submission in these proceedings pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2)

(“First EC Application”). The EC requested an order from the Tribunal to:

(i) grant the Commission leave to intervene in the present proceedings;
(ii) set a deadline for the Commission to file a written amicus curiae submission;

(iii) allow the Commission access to the documents filed in the case, to the extent
necessary for its intervention in the proceedings;

(iv) allow the Commission to attend hearings in order to present oral argument
and reply to the questions of [the] Tribunal at those hearings, should [the]
Tribunal and the parties deem that useful.

On the same date, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their observations on the

First EC Application by 29 August 2018.

On 29 August 2018, the Respondent filed its observations on the First EC Application
(“Respondent’s Observations”). On the same date, the Claimants requested an

extension of time until 31 August 2018 to submit their observations.

On 30 August 2018, the Tribunal granted the Claimants’ request for an extension of
time to submit their observations on the First EC Application. On the same date, the
Respondent indicated that it did not object to the extension of time granted to the
Claimants to submit their observations on the Application and that it requested leave to
submit a brief reply to the Claimants’ observations on the Application by 5 September

2018.

On 31 August 2018, the Claimants filed their observations on the First EC Application
(“Claimants’ Observations”). On the same date, the Claimants indicated that they did

not object to the Respondent’s request for leave to submit a brief reply to the Claimants’

' Ruling on Power of Tribunal to Issue Provisional Measures Whilst Proceedings are Suspended, 24 September 2018; Interim
Decision on Application for Provisional Measures, 30 September 2018; Decision on Application for Provisional Measures, 17
April 2019.

20.

Observations and that they reserved the right to request leave to respond to the

Respondent’s reply.

On 5 September 2018, the Respondent filed its Reply to the Claimants’ Observations
(“Respondent’s Reply”).

On 10 September 2018, the Tribunal invited submissions from the Parties as to what

 

participation is essential for the Commission to make its contribution to the proceeding
in this case, as well as to any confidentiality restrictions that should be placed with

respect to such materials, if any.

On 17 September 2018, the Claimants submitted further observations on the First EC

Application.

On 5 October 2018, the Respondent submitted further observations on the First EC

Application.

On 10 October 2018, the Claimants submitted their Response to the Respondent’s

Request for Bifurcation (“Response on Bifurcation”).

By letter of 10 October 2018, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing on provisional

measures and bifurcation would be held from 12 to 14 December 2018 in The Hague.

On 16 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 which granted leave
to the European Commission to file a written non-disputing party submission

addressing, as a legal issue, whether the investor-State arbitration mechanism in the

 

Treaty remains available. The Tribunal’s Order was

 

issued expeditiously without
reasons. The Tribunal’s reasons were later provided in Procedural Order No. 3 of 30

October 2018.

By email of 23 October 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Parties had
agreed on a schedule for pre-hearing filings, with the Respondent’s Reply on
Bifurcation and the Claimants’ Reply on Provisional Measures (Balance) being due on
16 November 2018 and the Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits being due on 30

November 2018. The Respondent confirmed its agreement by email of the same date.

By letter of 25 October 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the filing of the
Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits was to be postponed until after the December 2018

hearing.
On 5 November 2018, the EC filed its Amicus Curiae Brief (“EC Amicus Brief”).

By email of 9 November 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that Mr David
Pawlak (who subsequently withdrew from the team as of 15 February 2019), and Ms
Marie Michon had joined its legal team. By letter of the same date, the Claimants
informed the Tribunal that Mr Maris Vainovskis, of Eversheds Sutherland Bitans, Riga,

Latvia, had joined their legal team.

On 16 November 2018, the Respondent filed its Reply on Bifurcation (“Reply on

Bifurcation”).
On 19 November 2018, the Respondent provided its comments on the EC Amicus Brief.

On 3 December 2018, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Bifurcation (“Rejoinder

on Bifurcation”) and their Observations on the EC Amicus Brief.

The Tribunal held a hearing on the applications for provisional measures, bifurcation,
and the disqualification of the Respondent’s counsel from 12 to 14 December 2018 in

The Hague.

By letter of 23 January 2019, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that twenty-two
Member States of the European Union (“EU”), including Latvia and the UK, had signed
a “Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 15
January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in
Achmea and on investment protection in the European Union.”? (“15 January 2019
Declaration” or “Declaration”) The Respondent’s correspondence attached that
declaration, and two related declarations from the other EU Member States concerning

Achmea dated 16 January 2019.3

2 “Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences
of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in the European Union” (Declaration of the
UK, Latvia and 20 other Member States), (“Declaration” or “15 January 2019 Declaration”), R-00256.

judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in the European Union” (Declaration of Finland,

By letter of 24 January 2019, the Tribunal advised the Parties that, subject to any
submissions from the Claimants, it believed that the Respondent’s correspondence of
23 January 2019 should be admitted to the record on the bifurcation application, and
that any further observations on the material should be made in the Parties’ post-
Hearing briefs (“RPHB” or “CPHB”). The Tribunal also invited the Parties to take up
a short extension to submit their post-Hearing briefs, from 28 January to 31 January

2019.
On 28 January 2019, the Parties consented to the extension for their post-Hearing briefs.
On 31 January 2019, the Parties respectively filed their post-Hearing briefs.

On 5 February 2019, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to object to the content of
the CPHB. Latvia alleged that the Claimants had attempted to re-plead their positions
beyond the scope of the Tribunal’s instructions for post-Hearing briefs, and requested
that the Tribunal impose appropriate consequences on the Claimants including with

respect to costs.

On 6 February 2019, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal objecting to the Respondent’s
5 February 2019 correspondence, including the Respondent’s request that unspecified
consequences be meted out by the Tribunal to the Claimants. The Claimants pointed

out that the RPHB had, inter alia, introduced several impermissible matters.

On | March 2019, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on the Respondent’s Request for

Bifurcation (“Decision on Bifurcation”), deciding as follows at paragraph 200:
Now, therefore, the Tribunal:

(i) decides to bifurcate the proceedings and deal with the
Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction based on
the alleged unavailability of the investor-State arbitration
mechanism under the UK-Latvia BIT as a preliminary matter;

Slovenia, Luxembourg, Sweden, Malta), R-00257; and “Declaration of the Representative of the Government of Hungary of
16 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in
the European Union” (Declaration of Hungary) (“Hungary’s Declaration”), R-00258.

(ii) asks that the Parties confer and attempt to reach
agreement on the dates on which the above submissions will be
made;

(iii) directs the Parties to submit agreed dates to the Tribunal

within two weeks of the date of this Decision and if the Parties

are unable to reach agreement on such dates, each side should

submit proposed dates by the same time.
On 15 March 2019, the Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal with the proposed
dates to brief the bifurcated issue. In the same letter, the Respondent also informed the
Tribunal that it understood the Claimants wished to submit their Memorial on the
Merits on 17 May 2019. The Respondent stated that, in principle, it did not object to
the submission of the Claimants’ Memorial on that date, but indicated that it was
“necessary for the Tribunal to formally suspend the proceedings on the merits thereafter
and until a decision on the bifurcated issue is rendered.” The Respondent thus requested
the suspension of the proceedings on the merits pursuant to the ICSID Arbitration

Rules, in particular Rule 41(3).

The Respondent asserted that if the case would proceed to the merits, it would need
additional time to prepare a Counter-Memorial. It also noted that the Tribunal should
factor in the equality of the Parties and the complexity of the case, and that the
Claimants failed to meet the deadline to file their Memorial on 31 October 2018, which
meant that they would have no less than 9 months between the first procedural hearing

and the filing of their Memorial.

The Respondent also asserted that, “pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4), new
time limits regarding the merits proceedings are to be fixed only ‘if the Tribunal
overrules the objection’.” In this regard, it noted the importance of proportionality in
terms of not imposing an undue burden on a party to prepare arguments that may
become entirely unnecessary. Also, the Respondent contended that it is “not to be held
responsible for Claimants’ cost of preparing their Memorial, especially if the Tribunal

agrees with the Respondent’s position on the bifurcated issue.”

On 16 March 2019, the Claimants submitted a letter in response to the Respondent’s
letter of 15 March 2019. In their letter, the Claimants confirmed that the Parties had

agreed on a schedule for submissions on the bifurcated issue. They also confirmed that

10

39,

40.

41.

42.

43.

they would submit their Memorial on the merits on 17 May 2019. The Claimants
requested that the Tribunal: (i) reject the Respondent’s request for suspension of the
proceedings under Rule 41(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules; and (ii) direct that the

Parties are to file their respective submissions on the dates set out in their letter.

On 16 March 2019, the Respondent filed a request for a confidentiality order
(“Application for a Confidentiality Order”). The Parties’ subsequent filings on the
Respondent’s Request for a Confidentiality Order are detailed in the Tribunal’s

Decision on Application for a Confidentiality Order of 3 June 2019.

On 21 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 on the schedule for
submissions on the bifurcated issue and the request for suspension of the proceeding on
the merits, ordering as follows:

(i) The schedule for submissions on the bifurcated issue, as
agreed by the parties, is confirmed. [...]

(iv) The Claimants shall file their Memorial on the Merits by
Friday 17 May 2019.

(v) The Tribunal defers any decision on the application to

suspend the proceeding on the merits for the period following

the filing of the Memorial on the Merits by the Claimants.
On 30 April 2019, the Respondent requested an extension to file its Memorial on the
bifurcated issue from 7 May 2019 until 17 May 2019 and informed the Tribunal that

the Parties agreed on a new timetable to file their submissions.

Later the same date, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request for an extension and

confirmed its agreement with the new timetable.

By email of 4 May 2019, the European Commission informed the Tribunal about two
new developments, which “may be of relevance for the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal
on its jurisdiction.” It stated that: (i) “the 28 EU Member States have issued
interpretative declarations pursuant to Article 31 VCLT on the legal consequences of
the judgment in Achmea and the applicable conflict rules with intra-EU BIT”; and (ii)
“the most solemn formation of the Court of Justice of the EU, the full court, has, in

Opinion 1/17 on CETA, re-confirmed the judgment in Achmea and clearly indicated

11

44.

45.

46.

47.

48.

49.

50.

51.

52.

that it has a broad scope of application, covering any intra-EU investment arbitration.”
The European Commission offered to update its amicus curiae brief to take into account

these new developments (“Second EC Application”).

On 13 May 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the Second EC
Application by 20 May 2019.

By email of 17 May 2019, the Claimants requested a two-day extension to file their
Memorial on the Merits, allegedly due to logistical delays. By email of the same day,
the Respondent argued that the Claimants’ request for an extension would have an
effect on the time allowed to the Respondent to prepare its Reply on the bifurcated

issue.

Later the same day, the Tribunal granted the Claimants’ request for an extension to file

their Memorial on the Merits by 21 May 2019.

On 18 May 2019, the Respondent requested an extension of time to file its Memorial

on the bifurcated issue, at the latest on the following day.

On 19 May 2019, the Respondent filed its Memorial on the Bifurcated Objection
(“Memorial on the Bifurcated Objection”), together with the Second Expert Report
on EU Law of Professor Takis Tridimas (“Second Tridimas Report”) and the

accompanying exhibits and legal authorities.
On 19 May 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the submissions on the Second

EC Application could be delayed until 24 May 2019.

On 21 May 2019, the Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits (“Memorial
on the Merits”), together with the Witness Statements of Messrs Grigory Guselnikov,
Oliver Bramwell and Georgii Guselnikov, the Expert Reports of Mr James Worsnip

and of Mr Charles Carr, as well as the accompanying exhibits and legal authorities.
On 24 May 2019, the Parties submitted their comments on the Second EC Application.

By letter of 27 May 2019, the Tribunal noted that paragraphs 83 to 225 of the
Respondent’s Memorial on the Bifurcated Issue seemed to be going to the merits. It

informed the Claimants that they were free to respond to these paragraphs in addressing

12

53.

54.

55.

56.

the bifurcated issue, and added that the Tribunal did not deem it necessary, “save insofar

as any paragraphs directly relate to any of the EU Regulations set out in paragraph 227.”

By another letter of the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties and the European
Commission about its decision on the Second EC Application. The Tribunal stated that
“the two matters to which the Commission refers have been entered into the record of
the arbitration and have been the subject of comprehensive submissions by the
Respondent State” and that the Tribunal was “of the view that [the Tribunal] is unlikely

to be further assisted by an update from the Commission in these respects.”

On 30 May 2019, the Claimants filed an application requesting the Tribunal to reverse
its Decision on Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation dated 1 March 2019, and to join
the Respondent’s EU Law Objection to the merits (“Application to Reconsider
Bifurcation”). The Claimants essentially argued that, on the basis of the Respondent’s
Memorial on the Bifurcated Objection dated 19 May 2019, the facts on the merits were
central to the EU Law Objection, and therefore it was not possible to address the EU

Law Objection separately from the merits.

The Parties’ subsequent filings on the Claimants’ Application to Reconsider
Bifurcation are detailed in the Tribunal’s Decision on the Claimants’ Application to

Reconsider the Decision on Bifurcation of 2 July 2019.

On 2 July 2019, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Application to Reconsider the

Decision on Bifurcation, ordering as follows:

(i) the decision to address as a preliminary matter the
Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction based on
the alleged unavailability of the investor-State arbitration
mechanism under the UK-Latvia BIT is maintained;

(ii) the Claimants are directed to provide, with their Counter-
Memorial on the bifurcated issue, a list of exhibits that they
intend to rely upon during the hearing on the bifurcated issue, as
the Respondent has recently done;

(iii) the Claimants are not to adduce evidence to establish it has
legitimate expectations under EU law at the hearing on the
bifurcated issue;

37.

58.

59.

60.

(iv) the Claimants are not to adduce at that hearing expert
evidence on the content of the EU law of legitimate expectations;

(v) the Tribunal will not have regard at that hearing to any
evidence by the Respondent directed to the content or existence
of legitimate expectations, including the relevant sections of
Professor Tridimas’ report;

(vi) the Tribunal confirms that it will hold its hearing on the
bifurcated issue as scheduled on 19-21 September 2019.

On 29 July 2019, the Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on the Bifurcated
Objection (“Counter-Memorial on the Bifurcated Objection”), together with the
Expert Reports of Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury (“First Neuberger Report”) and
Professor Stefan Talmon (“First Talmon Report”), as well as the accompanying

exhibits and legal authorities.

By letter of 30 July 2019, the President of the Tribunal made the following disclosure
to the Parties:

I note that the Claimants rely on an expert opinion on EU law by

David Neuberger. As he mentions, he is a member of One Essex

Court. As the parties know, I am a door tenant at those chambers,
although I live in Sydney.

David Neuberger and I are also both members of the Hong Kong
Court of Final Appeal. As only one foreign judge sits at one time,
we never sit together.

Finally, as the parties will be aware I was a member of the
Tribunal in Cube Infrastructure v. Spain to which Lord
Neuberger and the Claimants refer.

On 7 August 2019, the Tribunal asked the Parties if they would object to the presence
at the hearing of Mr Stijn Winters, a young lawyer who was working with Mr Townsend
in Washington D.C. The Parties confirmed that they did not object to Mr Winters’

presence at the hearing on the bifurcated issue as an observer.

On 19 August 2019, the Respondent submitted its Reply on the Bifurcated Objection
(“Reply on the Bifurcated Objection”), together with the Third Expert Report of
Professor Tridimas (“Third Tridimas Report”) and the accompanying exhibits and

legal authorities.

By letter of 20 August 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that on 15 August
2019, the European Central Bank, “as a primary supervisor since 4 April 2019, made a
determination that AS PNB Banka is failing or likely to fail.” It also added that “the
Single Resolution Board determined that AS PNB Banka’s failure was not expected to
have an adverse impact on financial stability in Latvia or other EU Member States and
therefore the Bank shall not be placed under resolution.” It concluded that it did not
believe that this development would have any impact on the procedural schedule for
the proceedings. The Respondent relied on press releases of the European Central Bank
(“ECB”), SRB and Financial and Capital Market Commission (“FCMC”),' all dated
15 August 2019.

By letter of 26 August 2019, the Respondent stated that it expected to cross-examine
both Claimants’ experts, Lord Neuberger and Professor Talmon, at the hearing on the
bifurcated issue. By letter of the same date, the Claimants stated that they intended to

cross-examine Professor Tridimas.

On 27 August 2019, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the

Parties by telephone conference.

On 28 August 2019, the Tribunal referred to its decision, in Procedural Order No. 5,
“to defer any decision on the application to suspend the proceeding on the merits for
the period following the filing of the Memorial on the Merits by the Claimants” and
invited the Parties to indicate, “any reason why the Tribunal should not suspend the

proceeding on the merits while the decision on the bifurcated issue is pending.”

By letter of 4 September 2019, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal suspend the
proceeding on the merits while the decision on the bifurcated issue is pending (“Second
Request to Suspend the Proceedings”). It referred to the fact that (i) “Mr. Guselnikov
and his family sold essentially all their shares in the Bank during the month of June
2019, after the submission of Claimants’ Memorial on 17 May 2019”; (ii) “on 15
August 2019, the ECB determined that the Bank was failing or likely to fail”; and (iii)

+ ECB Press Release, “ECB has assessed that AS PNB Banka in Latvia was failing or likely to fail,” 15 August 2019, R-00355;

  

S PNB Banka: SRB Decides No Resolution Required,” 15 August 2019, R-00356; FCMC Press
‘CMC, following the decisions of the ECB and SRB, suspends the provision of financial services by JSC “PNB

Banka” and decides on the unavailability of deposits,” 15 August 2019, R-00357.

the question whether the Bank is insolvent and is to be liquidated is before the Latvian

Courts, which should render a decision in September.

Based on these new facts, the Respondent argued that the Claimants’ Memorial on the
Merits of 21 May 2019 might need to be amended to take into account these new events
that occurred after the submission of their Memorial on the Merits and that the
“Respondent is not in a position to usefully respond to the claim since the Memorial,
and in particular the damages analysis, was based on assumptions that have changed
since.” It suggested “to wait until after any decision on the Bifurcated Issue for the
Tribunal to decide on an appropriate briefing schedule on the merits, which may include
requiring Claimants to provide an amended Memorial, should the case proceed to the

merits stage.”

By letter of 4 September 2019, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal reject the
Respondent’s request for suspension. It argued that “[t]he fact that the Respondent did
not apply to the Tribunal to seek the suspension of the proceedings shortly after the
Claimants filed their Memorial shows that there is no credible or pressing justification
for suspension” and that this delay should count against suspension. The Claimants also

denied that these new facts changed the Claimants’ case.

By letter of 5 September 2019, the Respondent noted that the Claimants took the
opportunity in their letter, submitted after the Respondent’s letter, to respond to the
Respondent’s letter on the same subject, raising issues as to the equality of the Parties
and stating that it stood ready to make further submissions should the Tribunal deem it

useful.

By email of the same day, the Claimants noted that the Respondent’s letter did not
constitute an application to make further submissions and argued that “there is no
reason to afford the Respondent a further opportunity to address matters which could

have been responded two months ago.”

On 9 September 2019, the Claimants’ submitted their Rejoinder on the Bifurcated
Objection (“Rejoinder on the Bifurcated Objection”), together with the Second
Expert Reports of Lord Neuberger of Abbotsburry (“Second Neuberger Report”) and
Professor Talmon (“Second Talmon Report”), as well as the accompanying exhibits

and legal authorities.

71. On 10 September 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on the Second

Request to Suspend the Proceedings on the Merits, ordering as follows:

19. The Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ contention that an
application for suspension by a party is a condition precedent to
the exercise of the Tribunal’s discretion under Rule 41(3).
Further, nothing in the text suggests that a request for suspension
should be contained in the Request for Bifurcation. In any event,
the Respondent made a request by letter of 15 March 2019.

20. There are two critical considerations which, in the
opinion of the Tribunal, guide the exercise of the discretion to
suspend in the present case. First, is the justifiable concern that
suspension will significantly delay the hearing on the merits.
Secondly, is the waste of resources involved in preparing for a
hearing in the event that the Tribunal upholds the jurisdictional
objection.

21. The Tribunal has determined that in all the
circumstances, including the proximity of the jurisdictional
Hearing, the latter outweighs the former and orders suspension
of the proceedings.

 

22. The Tribunal notes the Respondent’s contention that
recent developments may require amendment of the Claimants’
Memorial on the Merits. That is a matter for the Claimants.

23. The Tribunal indicates that it would be favorably
disposed to an application by the Claimants to lift the suspension
for the limited purpose of permitting the amendment of the
Memorial if the Claimants should choose to make such an
application.
72. On 13 September 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 concerning the

organization of the hearing on the bifurcated objection.

73. On 13 September 2019, the Claimants submitted legal authorities CL-251 through CL-

254 in accordance with Clause 6.2 of Procedural Order No. 7.

74. By email of 17 September 2019, the Tribunal made the following request to the Parties:
“The Tribunal notes that prior to states joining the E.U., it was the practice of the E.U.
to enter an Association Agreement. The Tribunal would be grateful if the parties could
indicate whether the Latvia Association Agreement contains any reference to

investment treaties and, if so, whether it could be added to the record.”

17

By email of 18 September 2019, the Claimants submitted “the 1998 Europe
(Association) Agreement between the European Communities, its Member States and
the Republic of Latvia, as published in the Official Journal of the European
Communities on 2 February 1998.5 The Claimants noted that “Article 74 of the

Agreement refers to international investment treaties.”

On the same day, the Claimants advised the Tribunal that the Parties agreed that the
Respondent would deliver its opening statement first, and that the cross-examination
would commence with Professor Tridimas’ presentation. The Claimants thus requested

that the Tribunal amend Clause 5 of Procedural Order No. 7 accordingly.

By letter of the same date, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that “on 12 September
2019, the Riga City Vidzeme District Court declared AS PNB Banka insolvent and
appointed an insolvency administrator” and that it was “now in a position to provide a
translated copy of the judgment to the Tribunal,” submitted as exhibit R-358. Mr Vigo
Krastins was appointed as the Administrator of the insolvency proceedings of AS PNB
Banka (the “Administrator”). The Respondent added that “this should not have any
incidence on the scheduled hearing on the bifurcated issue” but requested that “this
issue be addressed as a preliminary matter at the hearing, including whether the
insolvency judgement has affected Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan’s

representation of the Bank.”

Later the same date, the Tribunal issued the amended version of Procedural Order
No. 7, taking into account the Parties’ agreement on the order of appearance at the

hearing on the bifurcated objection.

By email of 19 September 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that “[t]he issue of
legal representation of the Bank should be discussed between the parties with a view to
reaching an agreed position. If the matter needs to be considered by the Tribunal, it will

be treated as an application by the Respondent and taken out of its allocated time.”

The Hearing on the Bifurcated Objection was held in Paris from 19 to 20 September

2019 (“Hearing”). The following persons were present at the Hearing:

51998 Europe (Association) Agreement between the European Communities, its Member States and the Republic of Latvia”,
Official Journal of the European Communities, 2 February 1998, CL-255.

81. | On 23 September 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to agree on deadlines for
submissions on these matters and gave three directions to the Parties for their post-

hearing submissions on the bifurcated objection, as follows:

The Tribunal wishes to receive post-hearing submissions on the following topics:
1. Directed to the Respondent:

Provide particulars of each specific EU law, or provision thereof, which, if the
proceeding goes to the merits, there is

(i) arisk and/or

(ii) on the balance of probabilities, it is likely

that the Tribunal will have to interpret that law or, alternatively, that the
Tribunal may apply the law as facts without interpreting them.

2. Directed to the Respondent: the Tribunal refers to the submission at
paragraph 31 of the Counter-Memorial on the Bifurcated Objection, including
specifically the assertion that the Tribunal “has directed” that the issue of the
application of the EU law of legitimate expectations has been “deferred to the
merits”, and to paragraph 13 of the Decision of July 2, 2019 on Reconsideration
of the Decision on Bifurcation. The Tribunal invites the Respondent to reply.

3. Directed to the Claimants: the Tribunal requests a submission on the issue of
inadmissibility.
82. On 1 October 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement on the

scheduling of post-hearing submissions on the bifurcated objection.

83. By letter of 7 October 2019, the Claimants wrote regarding the scope of the post-
hearing submissions, and requested the Tribunal to “(a.) reconsider its formulation of
the first topic [...]; (b.) withdraw the second topic from post-hearing submissions; and
(c.) clarify the scope of the requested submissions on the third topic”® (the “Request

for Clarification”).

By letter of 17 October 2019, the Claimants suggested that the Tribunal vacate the
deadlines for submissions of post-hearing briefs and invite the Parties to agree on new
deadlines to be calculated from the date on which the Tribunal will have decided on the

Claimants’ Request for Clarification on the scope of the post-hearing submissions.

On 18 October 2019, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the
Claimants’ letter of 7 October 2019 by 25 October 2019, and informed that the
Claimants could reply to the Respondent’s comments by 1 November 2019 at the latest.
The Tribunal also invited the Parties to confer on a new timetable for post-hearing
submissions to commence from the date the Tribunal resolves the Request for

Clarification.

On 22 October 2019, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan requested that the

Administrator be added to the distribution list as “a courtesy”.

On 25 October 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed
to an extension for the submission of the Respondent’s comments on the Claimants’
letter of 7 October 2019 until 29 October 2019, and that the Claimants could submit

their comments by 11 November 2019.

By letter of 29 October 2019, the Respondent submitted its comments to the Claimants’
letter of 7 October 2019. The Respondent advised the Tribunal that it opposed the
Claimants’ request that “the Tribunal reconsider, clarify or withdraw its questions for

post-hearing briefs on the Bifurcated Issue.”

By letter of 1 November 2019, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that on 24 October
2019 the European Commission issued a press release and statement concerning the
conclusion of a plurilateral agreement to terminate intra-EU BITs. The Respondent
noted that the Parties were not in a position to further comment until more information
on the agreement became available and that it was investigating whether any further
information relating to the agreement could be provided to the Tribunal and/or when it

was expected to become public.

By letter of 11 November 2019, the Claimants responded to the Respondent’s letter of
29 October 2019, and requested that the Tribunal:

21

91.

92.

93.

94.

a. defer question one to the merits phase;

b. withdraw question two, thus deferring all issues concerning
the EU law and international law of legitimate expectations to
the merits phase; and

c. confirm that the scope of the requested submissions on
question three is limited to the admissibility objections
previously raised in the Respondent’s submissions, which have
been summarised at paragraph 36 of the Claimants’ letter dated
7 October.

On 13 November 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been

unable to agree on a timetable for post-hearing submissions and suggested a timetable.

Later the same date, the Claimants requested that “the Tribunal defer any decision on
the procedural timetable for the post-hearing briefs until after it has rendered its

decision” on the Claimants’ application of 7 October 2019.

On 15 November 2019, the Claimants notified the Tribunal that they were seeking
certain disclosures and information from the Respondent regarding the plurilateral
agreement between EU Member States to terminate intra-EU BITs, referred to by the

Respondent in its letter of 1 November 2019, by separate correspondence.
On 19 November 2019, the Tribunal amended its post-hearing questions, as follows:

i. The Tribunal amends Question | to read: The Tribunal invites
the Respondent to reply further to the Claimants’ contention that
the Tribunal should treat EU law as a fact. It is a matter for the
Respondent whether it wishes to do so or not.

ii. The Tribunal maintains Question 3. It is a matter for the
Claimant whether it wishes to respond or not.

iii. In the case of each of i and ii, it is for the party requested to
determine the content, if any, of its response. The other party’s
reply should be confined to the matters raised in the first
submission. If the first party elects not to respond to a question,
no reply will be called for.

iv. The Tribunal has reconsidered Question 2 and has determined
that it does not require a submission from the Respondent. The
Question is withdrawn.

The Tribunal further drew the Parties’ attention to the award in Magyar Farming
Company Limited and others v Hungary (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/27) (“Magyar
Farming”), dated 13 November 2019, and invited the Parties to address an additional
question for the post-hearing submissions: the findings of the tribunal in Magyar
Farming with respect to the intra-EU objection submitted by Hungary. The Tribunal
also invited the Parties to reach an agreement on the scheduling of the post-hearing

submissions.

On 25 November 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had

agreed on a timetable for the post-hearing submissions.

By letter of 26 November 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that their agreed

schedule was approved.

On 4 December 2019, the Claimants notified the Tribunal of Mr Guselnikov’s ancillary
claims, arising out of the Respondent’s alleged wrongful conduct. They also informed
the Tribunal that the ancillary claims, which relate to the ongoing criminal proceedings
“that relate to the harassment and attempted extortion of Mr. Guselnikov by Mr.

Rim$éviés and his affiliates”, would be further particularised in due course.

On 9 December 2019, Mr Krastin’, the Administrator, requested access to the case file
and informed the Tribunal that Mr Vainovskis, a former counsel for the Claimants, was

no longer involved in the case and that his power of attorney had been withdrawn.

On 10 December 2019, Mr Okko Behrends, a lawyer allegedly representing AS PNB
Bank’s management, contacted the ICSID Secretariat via email. Mr Behrends attached
a Power of Attorney dated 29 August 2019 signed by two members of the board, stating
that Mr Behrends had the power “[t]o represent the interests of the Grantor in the courts
and judicial institutions of the Republic of Latvia and of the European Union.” Mr
Behrends also noted that the Administrator was not able to revoke the power of attorney

of Mr Vainovskis.

On 11 December 2019, the Tribunal invited Mr Behrends to elaborate on the scope of
his power of attorney, and whether his appearance before the Tribunal in this arbitration

falls within the scope of the power of attorney dated 29 August 2019.

By separate letters of 11 December 2019, the Tribunal invited the Administrator and
Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan to comment on the Administrator’s request and

on Mr Behrends’ email of 10 December 2019.
On 17 December 2019, Mr Krastin’ submitted a letter in response.

On the same date, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan informed the Tribunal that it
was no longer representing AS PNB Banka, but that it would continue to represent the

Shareholder Claimants.

Later the same date, Mr Behrends submitted a new power of attorney, which was signed
by three members of the board of AS PNB Banka. This new power of attorney, dated
17 December 2019, authorized Mr Behrends to represent AS PNB Banka “in any and
all matters for which the board of AS PNB Banka is the appropriate representative of
the Bank”. In the same email, Mr Behrends argued that the Administrator should not

be representing the Bank.

The Tribunal, by letter of 20 December 2019, invited the Administrator, the
Shareholder Claimants, the Respondent and Mr Behrends to file submissions on the
issue of the representation of the Bank. The Tribunal also indicated that Mr Behrends

would be included on the correspondence regarding this issue.

On 8 January 2020, the Shareholder Claimants notified the Tribunal of their intention
to file ancillary claims arising from the declaration of insolvency of the Bank and the

conduct of Latvia’s Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC).

On 24 January 2020, the Shareholder Claimants further elaborated on their ancillary

claims in their reply submission on the representation issue.

The Administrator, Mr Behrends, the Shareholder Claimants and the Respondent filed
submissions on the issue of representation. Following these submissions on 30 January
2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 on the representation of the Bank

(“Decision on Representation”). The Tribunal decided as follows:

a. The Tribunal recognises Mr. KrastinS as the representative of
the Bank for the purposes of completing submissions on the
Bifurcated Issue in answer to the Tribunal questions.

24

110.

111.

112.

113.

114.

b. Mr. Krastin’ will be given access to the submissions on the
Bifurcated Issue.

c. Until further order, the Tribunal rejects Mr. Behrends’
application to be accepted as the representative of the Bank. The
parties are directed to continue to copy Mr. Behrends on any
communication relating to the representation of the Bank.

  

d. The Tribunal accepts that both Mr. Krasting, in the exercise of
his statutory powers, and the former Directors or the current
shareholders, reflecting the separate legal personality of the
Bank, are entitled to be heard if the Tribunal rejects the
Respondent’s jurisdictional challenge on the Bifurcated Issue.

e. If that occurs, further submissions will be sought at that time.

On 30 January 2020, in response to the Shareholder Claimants’ letter of 8 January 2020,
the Tribunal informed the Parties that it took note of the Shareholder Claimants request
for leave to make an ancillary claim and that it would leave this application on hold

until it has decided on the bifurcated issue.

Also on 30 January 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to address in their post-
hearing submissions on the bifurcated issue, in addition to the issues indicated in the
letter of 19 November 2019, the following question: “What is the impact, if any, of the
UK leaving the European Union on the availability of the dispute settlement procedures
under Article 8 of the UK-Latvia BIT, as this BIT will not as from February 1, 2020 be

”

a BIT between two Member States of the European Union’

On 6 February 2020, the Administrator proposed a timetable for post-hearing
submissions. By letter of 6 February 2020, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that
the Parties had been unable to agree on a timetable for post-hearing submissions and
that it would seek the Tribunal’s leave for the Parties to file submissions on costs after

the filing of the last post-hearing submission.

On 11 February 2020, the Tribunal issued a timetable for the Parties’ post-hearing
submissions and invited the Claimants’ to comment on the Respondent’s proposal on

costs submissions.

By letter of 17 February 2020, the Shareholder Claimants confirmed that there was no

pending request or application for leave before the Tribunal in relation to the

25

117,

121.

Shareholder Claimants’ notification of an ancillary claim dated 8 January 2020 and
requested that “the Tribunal clarify that its statement in the letter dated 3[0] January
2020 was not intended to mean that the Shareholder Claimants’ Insolvency Ancillary
Claim is not properly brought before the Tribunal and that any permission to admit such

a claim is required.”

On 17 February 2020, Mr Behrends filed a proposal to disqualify all of the Members
of the Tribunal on behalf of AS PNB Banka.

On 18 February 2020, the Shareholder Claimants filed a proposal to disqualify all of
the Members of the Tribunal.

On 20 February 2020, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that pursuant to ICSID
Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended.

The Parties’ subsequent filings on Mr Behrends’ and the Shareholder Claimants’
disqualification proposals are detailed in the Decision on the Proposals to Disqualify
Messrs. James Spigelman, QC, Peter Tomka and John M. Townsend of 16 June 2020
(“Decision on the Disqualification Proposals”). In its Decision on the
Disqualification Proposals, the Chairman of the Administrative Council decided that
Mr Behrends had no standing to file a proposal for disqualification on behalf of AS

PNB Banka and rejected the Shareholder Claimants’ proposal for disqualification.

By letter of 16 June 2020, ICSID informed the Parties that the proceeding had resumed

on the same date.

By letter of 20 June 2020, the Tribunal issued its directions to the Parties regarding the
schedule for the filing of the post-hearing submissions. The Tribunal advised that the
Parties should file the first submission on 9 July 2020, the second submission on 30
July 2020 and the last submission on 13 August 2020. The Tribunal also noted that the
proceedings had been suspended for 119 days.

On 25 June 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment in their post-hearing
submissions, on the Decision on Jurisdiction in the case Addiko Bank AG v. Croatia

(ICSID Case No. ARB/17/37) rendered on 12 June 2020 (“Addiko v Croatia’).

Also on 25 June 2020, the Centre invited the Parties to indicate whether they agreed to
the publication on the ICSID website of the two decisions on provisional measures
dated 30 September 2018 and 17 April 2019, respectively, as well as the Decision on
the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation dated 1 March 2019 and the Decision on the
Application to Reconsider the Decision on Bifurcation dated 2 July 2019. To date, the

Parties have not provided their responses to the Centre.

On 9 July 2020, the Administrator filed a submission concerning the Addiko v Croatia
decision. The Administrator advised the Tribunal that this submission completed the
submission filed on 12 March 2020, in which he had already “addressed the three

questions previously raised by the Tribunal.”

On the same date, the Shareholder Claimants filed their Post-Hearing Submission dated
9 July 2020, along with a cover letter and consolidated indices of the Legal Authorities
and Factual Exhibits (the “Shareholder Claimants’ First Post-Hearing Submission”
or “SC PHS 1”). The Respondent also filed its Post-Hearing Submission dated 9 July
2020, along with a cover letter and indices of the Legal Authorities and Factual Exhibits

(the “Respondent’s First Post-Hearing Submission” or “Respondent’s PHS 1”).

On 10 July 2020, the Administrator’s submission of 12 March 2020 filed while the case

was suspended was transmitted to the Members of the Tribunal.

On 22 July 2020, Mr Okko Behrends submitted a “Statement for Submission in ICSID
Case No. ARB/17/47”.

Later on the same date, the Tribunal informed the Parties that “[u]ntil the ruling on the
bifurcated issue, the Tribunal has directed the Secretary of the Tribunal not to transmit
to the Tribunal any communications unless they are filed by, or with the consent of, the

parties to the proceeding.”

By letter of 30 July 2020, the Administrator informed the Tribunal that AS PNB Banka:
(i) considered that the Tribunal “has been sufficiently briefed on the [jurisdiction] issues
and will be in a position to take a decision based on the Parties’ hitherto submissions”;
(ii) therefore did not see the need to make further submissions at this stage, but reserved
its right to do so; and (iii) maintained its position and rejected the Respondent’s

objections in this matter.

27

129.

130.

On the same date, the Shareholder Claimants filed their Second Post-Hearing
Submission dated 30 July 2020, along with updated indices of the legal authorities and
factual exhibits (the “Shareholder Claimants Second Post-Hearing Submission” or
“SC PHS 2”). The Respondent also filed its Second Post-Hearing Submission on the
same date, along with updated indices of the legal authorities and factual exhibits (the

“Respondent’s Second Post-Hearing Submission” or “Respondent’s PHS 2”).

On 8 August 2020, the Respondent’s counsel informed the Parties and the Tribunal that

the law firm “Savoie Arbitration” changed its name to “Savoie Laporte”.

On 13 August 2020, the Administrator filed his Third Post-Hearing Submission. The
Respondent also filed its Third Post-Hearing Submission, along with updated indices
of the legal authorities and factual exhibits (“Respondent’s PHS 3”). The Shareholder
Claimants submitted their Third Post-Hearing Submission also on the same date, along
with legal authorities CL-330 to CL-335 and an updated index of the legal authorities
(“SC PHS 3”).

By letter of 1 September 2020, the Shareholder Claimants notified the Tribunal that the
Agreement for the Termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties between the Members
States of the European Union (the “Termination Agreement”), submitted as legal
authority CL-336, had entered into force on 29 August 2020. They further noted that
(i) the UK-Latvia BIT had not been terminated under Article 2 and Annex A; (ii) the
UK was not a Contracting Party; (iii) Latvia had not terminated all of its “intra-EU”
BITs; and (iv) the UK and Latvia had not sought to inform the Tribunal of “the legal
consequences of the Achmea judgment” in accordance with Article 7 and the pro forma

statement in Annex C of the Agreement.

On 2 September 2020, the Tribunal invited the Respondent and the Administrator to
comment on whether, pursuant to paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, the
Tribunal should receive this further submission and legal authority, and if so, to indicate

whether they wished to make any comments limited to the contents of the new material.

By letter of 2 September 2020, the Tribunal reminded the Parties that pursuant to
Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3), the Tribunal would have no choice but
to stay the proceeding for lack of payment if the required payment remained

outstanding when the available funds would be exhausted.

On 4 September 2020, in response to the Tribunal’s invitation of 2 September 2020,
the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it did not object to the inclusion of the
submission and additional exhibit into the record, to the extent such addition did not
further disrupt the proceedings. It also added that, should the Tribunal admit the

submission into the record, it would request a right to provide a brief response.

On the same date, the Shareholder Claimants argued that there was no basis or need for
further submissions by virtue of paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1. They also
took note of the Partial Award on Jurisdiction in Strabag, Raiffeisen Centrobank &
Syrena Immobilien Holding v. Poland, \CSID Case No. ADHOC/15/1 dated 4 March
2020 (“Strabag’’), which was made publicly available on 3 September 2020.

By letter of 7 September 2020, the Tribunal invited the Respondent and Mr Krastin’ to
file a document, within three days of the date hereof (i.e., by no later than 10
September), drawing the Tribunal’s attention to any other pertinent aspects of the
Termination Agreement and commenting (if at all) on the submission in the third
paragraph of the Shareholder Claimants’ letter. In the same letter, the Tribunal
requested the Parties to file a submission, if they wished to do so, within three days
(i.e., by no later than 10 September) and in less than five pages, on any aspect of the
Strabag decision that they believed to be sufficiently different from previous decisions

to merit the Tribunal’s attention.

By respective letters of 10 September 2020, the Administrator and the Respondent
submitted their comments on the Termination Agreement and the Strabag decision
(“Respondent’s PHS 4”). The Shareholder Claimants also submitted their comments
on the Strabag decision, together with legal authority CL-337 and a consolidated index
of legal authorities (“SC PHS 4”).

On 21 September 2020, the Centre informed the Parties that pursuant to ICSID
Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d), the Secretary-General had moved
the Tribunal to stay the proceeding for non-payment and that the Tribunal had stayed
the proceeding as of 21 September 2020.

By letter of 4 January 2021, the Shareholder Claimants informed the Centre and the
Tribunal that they would pay the outstanding amount and commented on the
Administrator’s failure to pay the Bank’s share of the requested advance.

III. LATVIA’S INTRA-EU OBJECTION

A. INTRODUCTION

149.  Latvia’s challenge to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal turns in large measure on the
decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) in Achmea and its

CETA Opinion.’ It is appropriate to summarise these two decisions at the outset.

B. ACHMEA

150. Achmea concerned a request by the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice,
Germany) for a preliminary ruling from the CJEU with respect to the interpretation of

Articles 18, 267 and 344 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”).

151. The context of the request was an arbitral proceeding involving the Slovak Republic
and Achmea BV concerning an arbitral award of 7 December 2012 rendered by the
arbitral tribunal constituted under the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT. The Netherlands-
Czech and Slovak BIT (the “Slovakia-Netherlands BIT”) entered into force on 1
January 1992. The Slovak Republic succeeded to that BIT on 1 January 1993. Article
8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT provides:

1. All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of
the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the
latter shall if, possible, be settled amicably.

2. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute
referred to in paragraph | of this Article to an arbitral tribunal, if
the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six
months from the date on which either party to the dispute
requested amicable settlement.

3. The arbitral tribunal referred to in paragraph (2) of this Article
will be constituted for each individual case in the following way:
each party to the dispute appoints one member of the tribunal
and the two members thus appointed shall select a national of a
third State as Chairman of the tribunal. Each party to the dispute
shall appoint its member of the tribunal within two months, and
the Chairman shall be appointed within three months from the

date on which the investor has notified the other Contracting
Party of his decision to submit the dispute to the arbitral tribunal.

4. Ifthe appointments have not been made in the abovementioned
periods, either party to the dispute may invite the President of
the Arbitration Institute of the Chamber of Commerce of
Stockholm to make the necessary appointments. If the President
is a national of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise
prevented from discharging the said function, the Vice-President
shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-
President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is
prevented from discharging the said function, the most senior
member of the Arbitration Institute who is not a national of either
Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary
appointments.

5. The arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure
applying the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules.

 

6. The arbi[tral] tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking
into account in particular though not exclusively:

— the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

— the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant
agreements between the Contracting Parties;
— the provisions of special agreements relating to the
investment;
— the general principles of international law.
7. The tribunal takes its decision by majority of votes; such

decision shall be final and binding upon the parties to the
dispute.*

 

152. On 1 May 2004, the Slovak Republic acceded to the EU. During 2004, it opened up its
market to private health insurance services. Achmea (Netherlands) set up a subsidiary
in Slovakia offering such services. By a law of 25 October 2007, the Slovak Republic
prohibited the distribution of profits generated by private health insurance activities.
Subsequently, the Slovak Constitutional Court held that the prohibition was

unconstitutional. Later the Slovak Republic again allowed the distribution of the profits.

155.

In October 2008, Achmea commenced arbitration proceedings against the Slovak
Republic under Article 8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT and the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules for damages caused by its legislative measures. The tribunal
determined Frankfurt am Main to be the place of the arbitration. The Slovak Republic
objected to the tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that, due to its accession to the EU,
recourse to arbitration provided for in Article 8(2) of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT was

incompatible with EU law.

On 26 October 2010, the tribunal dismissed the objection. Set aside applications before
the courts of Germany, the place of arbitration, were unsuccessful at first instance and
on appeal. By an award of 7 December 2012, the tribunal ordered that the Slovak
Republic pay Achmea damages of EUR 22.1 million. The Slovak Republic brought a
further set aside action before the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court which dismissed

the action.

The Slovak Republic then appealed to the Bundesgerichtshof. On 3 March 2016, it
requested a preliminary ruling from the CJEU under Article 267 of the TFEU. Given
the numerous BITs still in force between Member States with similar arbitration clauses
to the one in question, the Bundesgerichtshof sought a ruling on the following

questions:

(1) Does Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision
in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member
States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT) under
which an investor of a Contracting State, in the event of a dispute
concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may bring
proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal
where the investment protection agreement was concluded
before one of the Contracting States acceded to the European
Union but the arbitral proceedings are not to be brought until
after that date?

If Question | is to be answered in the negative:

(2) Does Article 267 TFEU preclude the application of such a
provision?

If Questions 1 and 2 are to be answered in the negative:

° Achmea, p:
'® Achmea,
RL-00025 (

(3) Does the first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU preclude the
application of such a provision under the circumstances
described in Question 1?

The CJEU ultimately answered the first two questions affirmatively. Consequently, it
did not need to, or proceed to, address the third question. In essence the CJEU had been
asked to assess whether Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU must be interpreted as
precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT, under which an investor from
one of those States may in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other
Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral
tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept. In addressing
that question, the CJEU first emphasised the principle enshrined in Article 344 of the
TFEU, that international agreements cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the
EU Treaties or the autonomy of the EU legal system. It was significant to the CJEU
that:

EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an

independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the

laws of the Member States, and by the direct effect of a whole

series of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and

to the Member States themselves.”
The CJEU reasoned that EU law is based on the fundamental premise that each EU
Member State shares with the other Member States a set of common values on which
the EU is founded (Treaty on European Union (“TEU”) Article 2), implying and
justifying the existence of mutual trust between Member States that those values will
be recognised and respected. In that context, Member States must, by reason, inter alia,
of the principle of sincere cooperation set out in Article 4(3) of the TEU, ensure in their

territories the application of, and respect for, EU law.

The CJEU explained that to ensure that the autonomy of the EU legal order is preserved,
the EU Treaties have established a judicial system which is intended to ensure

consistency and uniformity in interpreting EU law.!° Pursuant to Article 19 of the TEU,

161.

national courts, tribunals and the CJEU, are to ensure the full application of EU law in
all Member States and the judicial protection of the rights of individuals. The
“keystone” of this judicial system is the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in

Article 267 of the TFEU, which intends to secure uniform interpretation of EU law.!!

The CJEU assessed whether the disputes which the arbitral tribunal was called on to
resolve are liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law.'? While the
tribunal was being called on to rule on possible infringements of the Slovakia-
Netherlands BIT, in order to do so pursuant to Article 8(6), it had to “take account” of
the law in force of the contracting party concerned and other relevant agreements

between the contracting parties.

According to the CJEU, the characteristics of EU law mean that EU law had to be
regarded both as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving
from an international agreement between the Member States. On that “twofold basis,”
the arbitral tribunal could be called on to interpret or to apply EU law, particularly the
provisions concerning the fundamental freedoms including freedom of establishment
and free movement of capital.'? However, with no links with the judicial systems of the
Member States,'* the arbitral tribunal could not be classified as a court or tribunal “of
a Member State” within the meaning of Article 267 of the TFEU. It followed that a
tribunal “such as” that referred to in Article 8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT could
not be regarded as a “court or tribunal of a Member State” under Article 267 of the
TFEU, and therefore is not entitled to make a reference to the Court for a preliminary

ruling.'®

This finding was reinforced by the notion that any award would not meet the
requirements of Article 19 of the TEU, i.e., being subject to review by a court of a
Member State. Within this framework, under Article 8(7) of the Slovakia-Netherlands
BIT, the decision of the arbitral tribunal provided for in that Article is final. Further,
under Article 8(5), the tribunal was also to determine its own procedure applying the

UNCITRAL rules, including choosing its seat and consequently the law applicable to

the procedure governing judicial review of the validity of the award by which it puts an

end to the dispute before it.

162. The CJEU observed that any judicial review of the validity of the arbitral award by the
tribunal on 7 December 2012 was limited to the validity of the arbitration agreement
under applicable law and the consistency with public policy of the recognition or
enforcement of the award.'® The system of dispute resolution set up by the relevant
Member States removed from their own courts’ jurisdiction, and hence from the system
of judicial remedies which Article 19(1) of the TEU requires them to establish in the
fields covered by EU law, disputes which may concern the application or interpretation
of EU law."” This could prevent the full effectiveness of EU law.'® Article 8 thus called
into question the principle of mutual trust between the Member States and the
preliminary ruling procedure. This was deemed to be incompatible with the principle

of sincere cooperation and to adversely affect the autonomy of EU law.!”
163. Having made these findings, the CJEU held that the answer to the referral was that:°°

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between
Member States, such as Article 8 of the [Slovakia-Netherlands
BIT], under which an investor from one of those Member States
may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the
other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter
Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that
Member State has undertaken to accept.

C. CETA OPINION

164. In the present matter, the parties rely on the CETA Opinion (or Opinion 1/17) in
competing and detached ways. Latvia submits that the CETA Opinion is authority for
the proposition that the incompatibilities between EU law and the BIT are more wide-
ranging than that which can be established from Achmea alone. Taken together, it is
said, Achmea and the CETA Opinion establish that essentially all provisions of the

Treaty are incompatible with EU law.

For the Claimants, the CETA Opinion is authority for the notion that if the Tribunal has
to consider EU law as fact here, then that will not render the BIT incompatible with EU

law.

The CETA Opinion is a CJEU Opinion which post-dates Achmea. It concerned a request

for an opinion by the Kingdom of Belgium in the following terms:

Is Section F (‘Resolution of investment disputes between
investors and states’) of Chapter Eight (‘Investment’) of the
Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between
Canada, of the one part, and the European Union and its Member
States, of the other part, signed in Brussels on 30 October 2016
(OJ 2017 L 11, p. 23; ‘the CETA’) compatible with the Treaties,
including with fundamental rights?”

The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (“CETA”) is a free trade
agreement that contains rules relating to, inter alia, investment. Section F of Chapter
Eight of CETA contains Articles 8.18 to 8.45 which pertain to the establishment of a
mechanism for the resolution of investment disputes between investors and States
(“ISDS mechanism’). Article 8.27 provides for the creation of a Tribunal (“CETA
Tribunal”) upon the entry into force of the CETA. Article 8.28 provides for the
creation of an Appellate Tribunal (“CETA Appellate Tribunal”). Article 8.29
provides for the eventual establishment of a multilateral investment tribunal and
appellate mechanism, the establishment of which will end the operation of the CETA
Tribunal and the CETA Appellate Tribunal.”?

In the CETA Opinion, the CJEU found that Section F of Chapter 8 of the CETA is
compatible with EU primary law.?? The Opinion centred on the compatibility of the
ISDS mechanism with: (1) the autonomy of EU law; (2) the general principles of equal
treatment and the requirement of effectiveness; and (3) the right of access to an

independent tribunal.

In the present proceeding, the parties’ reliance focuses on points (1) and (3) above.

(1) Compatibility with EU Legal Order

The CJEU indicated that an international agreement providing for the creation of a court
responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on
the EU, is, in principle, compatible with EU law. The CETA, in so far as it provides a
process of submitting to judicial adjudication the resolution of disputes between
investors and States by means of establishing a Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and a later
multilateral investment Tribunal, may be compatible with EU law if it has no adverse

effect on the autonomy of EU law.74

In order to ensure that the autonomy of the EU legal order is preserved, the EU Treaties
established a judicial system intended to ensure consistency and uniformity in the
interpretation of EU law (see Article 19 of the Treaty on the European Union). That

system includes the preliminary ruling procedure in Article 267 of the TFEU.

The high watermark of the CETA Opinion for current purposes is that the CJEU stated

that in order to determine that the envisaged ISDS mechanism was compatible with the

autonomy of the EU legal order, it was necessary to be satisfied (which it was) that:?>

- Section F of Chapter Eight of the CETA does not confer on
the envisaged tribunals any power to interpret or apply EU
law other than the power to interpret and apply the provisions
of that agreement having regard to the rules and principles of
international law applicable between the Parties, and

- Section F of Chapter Eight of the CETA does not structure
the powers of those tribunals in such a way that, while not
themselves engaging in the interpretation or application of
rules of EU law other than those of that agreement, they may

issue awards which have the effect of preventing the EU

institutions from operating in accordance with the EU
constitutional framework.

   

The CJEU explained that, by reference to Articles 8.6-8.14, 8.18 and 8.31.1-8.31.2 of
the CETA, the power of interpretation and application conferred on the CETA Tribunal

in determining investment claims, is confined to the provisions of the CETA, and that

24 CETA Opinion, paras. 107-108. By “autonomy” of EU law, the CJEU elucidated that “that autonomy, which exists with
respect both to the law of the Member States and to international law, stems from the essential characteristics of the European
Union and its law... That autonomy accordingly resides in the fact that the Union possesses a constitutional framework that is

unique to it.

 

‘ETA Opinion paras. 109-110.

25 CETA Opinion, para. |

38

such interpretation or application must be undertaken in accordance with the rules and
principles of international law applicable between the Parties (but not under a Party’s

domestic law: Article 8.31.2).

174. The CJEU distinguished Section F of Chapter Eight CETA from the investment
agreement in Achmea. Two main differences were noted: first, in Achmea, the

agreement established a tribunal that would be called on to give rulings on disputes that

6

might concern the interpretation or application of EU law;?° and, second, Achmea

concerned an agreement between Member States in contrast to the CETA Opinion
which concerned the creation of a tribunal by agreement between the EU and a non-
Member State.”’ The principle of mutual trust with respect to compliance with the right
to an effective remedy before an independent tribunal under Article 47 of the Charter

is not applicable in relations between the EU and a non-Member State.

175. The CJEU clarified that the power of interpretation and application conferred on the
CETA Tribunal was confined to the CETA provisions, and “undertaken in accordance
with the rules and principles of international law applicable between the Parties”, was

not invalidated by Article 8.31.2 of the CETA, which provides that:?*

“in determining the consistency of a measure with [CETA], the
Tribunal may consider, as appropriate, the domestic law of a
Party as a matter of fact” and further states that, “in doing so, the
Tribunal shall follow the prevailing interpretation given to the
domestic law by the courts or authorities of that Party,” adding
that “any meaning given to domestic law by the Tribunal shall
not be binding upon the courts or the authorities of that Party.”

176. Commenting on the significance of Article 8.31.2, the CJEU notably said that:??

Those provisions serve no other purpose than to reflect the fact
that the CETA Tribunal, when it is called upon to examine the
compliance with the CETA of the measure that is challenged by
an investor and that has been adopted by the investment host
State or by the Union, will inevitably have to undertake, on the
basis of the information and arguments presented to it by that
investor and by that State or by the Union, an examination of the
effect of that measure. That examination may, on occasion,
require that the domestic law of the respondent Party be taken

into account. However, as is stated unequivocally in Article
8.31.2 of the CETA, that examination cannot be classified as
equivalent to an interpretation, by the CETA Tribunal, of that
domestic law, but consists, on the contrary, of that domestic law
being taken into account as a matter of fact, while that Tribunal
is, in that regard, obliged to follow the prevailing interpretation
given to that domestic law by the courts or authorities of that
Party, and those courts and those authorities are not, it may be
added, bound by the meaning given to their domestic law by that
Tribunal.

The fact that there is no jurisdiction to interpret the rules of EU
law other than the provisions of the CETA is also reflected in
Article 8.21 of that agreement...

Nor will the CETA Appellate Tribunal be called upon to
interpret or apply the rules of EU law other than the provisions
of the CETA. (see Article 8.28.2(a))...

The CJEU’s key relevant finding was that Section F of Chapter Eight does not confer

on the tribunals any jurisdiction to interpret or apply EU law other than that relating to

the agreement’s provisions.

Further, the CJEU addressed a concern that the CETA Tribunal might, in the course of
examining relevant facts, which may include the primary law on the basis of which the

contested measure was adopted, weigh the investor claimant’s freedom to conduct

 

business against public interests set out in the EU Treaties and Charter relied on by the
EU in its defence. This would entail making findings on secondary acts of EU law as
to whether EU measures are ‘fair and equitable’ (Article 8.10), or constitute indirect
expropriation (Article 8.12), or unjustly restrict the freedom to make payments and
capital transfers (Article 8.13). Tribunal decisions would result in binding conclusions
on the EU. The question is whether this would adversely affect the autonomy of the EU

legal order.*°

In response, the CJEU noted inter alia features in the CETA which prevent the
agreement from adversely affecting the capacity of the EU to operate autonomously
within its constitutional framework. This includes provisions regarding the choice of
the respondent," setting parameters for awards,” exceptions provided in Article 28.3.2

of CETA,* the right to regulate,*4 the obligation not to lower standards,*> the annex on

indirect expropriation*® and the exhaustive definition of ‘fair and equitable treatment’.*”

(2) Right of Access to Independent Tribunal

Regarding the compatibility of the ISDS mechanism with the right of access to an
independent tribunal, the CJEU conveyed that a consequence of Article 47 of the
Charter is that the EU must ensure that Section F of Chapter Eight of the CETA, and
any other provisions that determine the effect of Section F, guarantee that, once the
agreement is implemented, the tribunals will be accessible and independent. The CJEU
stated that that outcome is not invalidated by the fact that the envisaged ISDS
mechanism is ‘hybrid’ in nature, containing characteristics of both judicial bodies and

arbitration mechanisms.**

In the CJEU’s view, the rules establish independent, impartial and permanent
investment Tribunals. For instance, Article 8.27 provides for the establishment of a
permanent tribunal of 15 Members with a division of 3 Members hearing the case on a
rotation basis. This ensures that the composition of divisions is random and
unpredictable. Article 8.28.5 provides that the division of the Appellate Tribunal will
consist of 3 randomly appointed Members. The appeal mechanism aims to ensure the

stance.”*? Such features indicate

 

tency of the decisions of the Tribunal of first i

 

that the tribunals will essentially exercise judicial functions, in an autonomous manner,

issuing final and binding decisions.

183. The following day six other EU Member States signed substantially similar declarations

in two separate documents.*!

184. The Declaration manifests the Member States’ intentions to draw all nece:

 

ry
consequences from the Achmea judgment pursuant to their obligations under Union

law.

185, The fundamental notion conveyed in the Declaration is that Union law takes precedence
over BITs concluded between Member States.*? As a consequence, it is declared, all
investor-State arbitration clauses contained in BITs concluded between Member States
are contrary to Union law and inapplicable. The effect of this includes that an arbitral
tribunal established on the basis of investor-State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction,
due to a lack of a valid offer to arbitrate by the Member State party to the underlying
BIT.

186. The Declaration addresses fundamental freedoms. It states that when investors from
Member States exercise fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of establishment or
the free movement of capital, they act within the scope of Union law and thus enjoy the
protection granted by those freedoms and, as the case may be, by the relevant secondary
legislation, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (“Charter”),
and by the general principles of Union law including non-discrimination,
proportionality, legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations.*4 Where a
Member State enacts a measure that derogates from one of the fundamental freedoms
guaranteed by Union law, that measure falls within the scope of Union law and the

fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter also apply.*°

187. Remedies are also addressed in the Declaration. Member States must provide remedies

sufficient to ensure the effective legal protection of investors’ rights under Union law.*®

Under Article 19(1) of the TEU, every Member State must ensure that its courts or

tribunals, within the meaning of Union law, meet the requirements of effective judicial

protection.

The Declaration states that Member States and the Commission will intensify their

discussions in order to better ensure complete, strong and effective protection of

investments within the EU.

In the Declaration, the Member States undertake that they will carry out certain actions

E. THE TERMINATION AGREEMENT

190. In the 15 and 16 January 2019 Declarations the Member States stated, inter alia, that:

5. In light of the Achmea judgment, Member States will terminate
all bilateral investment treaties concluded between them by
means of a plurilateral treaty or, where that is mutually
recognised as more expedient, bilaterally.

6. Member States will ensure effective legal protection pursuant to
the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU under the control
of the Court of Justice against State measures that are the object
of pending intra-EU investment arbitration proceedings.

7. Settlements and arbitral awards in intra-EU investment
arbitration cases that can no longer be annulled or set aside and
were voluntarily complied with or definitively enforced before
the Achmea judgment should not be challenged. Member States
will discuss, in the context of the plurilateral Treaty or in the
context of bilateral terminations, practical arrangements, in
conformity with Union law, for such arbitral awards and
settlements. This is without prejudice to the lack of jurisdiction
of arbitral tribunals in pending intra-EU cases.

  

8. Member States will make best efforts to deposit their instruments
of ratification, approval or acceptance of that plurilateral treaty
or of any bilateral treaty terminating bilateral investment treaties
between Member States no later than 6 December 2019. They
will inform each other and the Secretary General of the Council
of the European Union in due time of any obstacle they
encounter, and of measures they envisage in order to overcome
that obstacle.**

47 In its separate declaration of 16 January 2019, Hungary clarified that in its view, Achmea concerned only intra-EU BITs and
is silent on and does not concern the investor-state arbitration clause in the ECT. See points 8 and 9 at p. 3 of Hungary’s
Declaration, R-00258.

That the CJEU held in Budéjovicky Budvar* that provisions laid down in an
international agreement between two Member States cannot apply in the
relations between them if the provisions are found to be contrary to the EU
Treaties.

That Member States must draw the necessary consequences from Union law as

interpreted in Achmea.

That investor-State arbitration clauses in intra-EU bilateral investment treaties
are contrary to the EU Treaties and cannot be applied after the date on which
the last of the parties to an intra-EU bilateral investment treaty became a

Member State.

That there is a common understanding between the parties to the EU Treaties

and intra-EU bilateral investment treaties that such a clause cannot serve as

 

legal basis for Arbitration Proceedings.

That the Termination Agreement should cover all investor-State arbitration
proceedings based on intra-EU bilateral investment treaties under any
arbitration convention or set of rules, including inter alia under the ICSID

Convention.
That the Termination Agreement was without prejudice to the question of
compatibility with the EU Treaties of substantive provisions of intra-EU

bilateral investment treaties.

Article 2 provides that Annex A lists the bilateral treaties which are terminated

under the Termination Agreement.

Article 4 confirms that investor-State arbitration clauses in intra-EU bilateral
investment treaties are contrary to the EU Treaties and inapplicable. As a result
of this incompatibility, as of the date on which the last of the parties to a relevant

bilateral investment treaty became a Member State, the arbitration clause

 

cannot serve as a legal basis for Arbitration Proceedings.

Article 6 provides that the Termination Agreement shall not affect concluded
arbitration proceedings or an agreement to settle an applicable arbitral

proceeding.

Article 7 provides that contracting parties which are parties to BITs on the basis
of which pending or new arbitration proceedings were initiated, must inter alia
cooperatively inform arbitral tribunals about the legal consequences of

Achmea.*>

Article 8 sets out transitional measures related to pending arbitration

proceedings.

Article 9 sets out a settlement procedure for pending arbitration proceedings.

F. THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION

196.

197.

198.

199.

It is common ground that the law applicable to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction includes
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, Article 8 of the BIT if in force, and general
international law. Latvia asserts, and the Claimants deny, that the applicable law

includes EU law.

It is also common ground that this Tribunal only has jurisdiction if Latvia had consented
to refer a dispute such as this to arbitration under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention
and under Article 8 of the BIT. It is z

 

so common ground, for purposes of the bifurcated
objection to jurisdiction (“Bifurcated Objection”), that the consent had to be extant as
at the time Latvia’s offer to arbitrate was accepted by the Claimants by expressing their
consent under Article 8 of the BIT by submitting their Request for Arbitration on 14

December 2017. Thereafter there is little common ground.

The parties are also agreed that the Tribunal can consider EU law insofar as it is

necessary for the assessment of the Bifurcated Objection.

(1) Respondent’s Submissions

On the basis of the CJEU’s decision in Achmea,* as reinforced by that Court’s Opinion
1/17, Latvia submits that EU law requires this Tribunal to find that it has no jurisdiction

and/or to declare the claim inadmissible, because there was no valid arbitration offer to

accept when the Claimants purported to do so in December 2017. Latvia’s offer to

arbitrate under the BIT became precluded by its accession to the EU on 1 May 2004.*

By “preclusion,” the Respondent, quoting Professor Tridimas, means “a conflict
between two rules...in a way that not both of them can be applied.”°? The Tribunal
must resolve the conflict that has existed between the BIT (1994) and the EU Treaties
between the UK and Latvia since 2004.

Latvia submits that the law applicable to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction includes the ICSID
Convention, the BIT and general international law. The Tribunal is required to take into
account all relevant rules of international law applicable in UK-—Latvia relations,

including EU law, on the issue of jurisdiction.**

The EU law which is required to be taken into account encompasses EU Treaties, EU
Regulations, EU Directives and CJEU judgments interpreting them.*? These are sources
of international law as conventional norms or as part of the relevant rules of
international law stemming from the EU Treaties. Latvia submits that the BIT is

incompatible with, and is superseded by, EU law.

The BIT is incompatible with EU law as determined by Achmea and Opinion 1/17, in

at least four ways:

(1) Article 8 of the BIT is precluded by EU law as a matter of principle and
specifically by Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, as authoritatively interpreted by the
CJEU.

(2) Article 8 of the BIT is precluded by EU law as a matter of fact since this
Tribunal will necessarily have to interpret or apply EU law in the present case.

*© Relevant to the Respondent’s argument on accession is its contention that as of 1992, Latvia was in the process of becoming
part of the EU. At that time, it is argued, the Baltic countries, including Latvia, were included in the EU’s PHARE enlargement
program, Subsequently, the following events ensued: in 1994, Latvia and the UK signed the Treaty, which entered into force
in 1995; on 12 June 1995, Latvia signed the EU Association Agreement which entered into force in 1998; in 1998 Latvia’s
progress report on EU accession confirmed that it signed BITs with all EU Member States except Ireland; on 1 May 2004,
Latvia acceded to the EU.

the same level as Regulations and Directives, to also be considered international law.

°! Hearing, Day 2, 32:1-33:

(3) The entire BIT is precluded by EU law since the BIT has insufficient safeguards
in its substantive provisions to ensure that the EU Member States’ right to
regulate and obligation to apply EU law will be sufficiently protected.

(4) The entire BIT is precluded because its interpretation and application can lead
to a change in the division of powers of EU institutions within the EU’s
constitutional framework.

Furthermore, Latvia asserts that the principle of primacy of EU law is an international
conflict rule. EU law must prevail in any conflict with the BIT. The same conclusion
arises from the application of the principles of lex specialis, lex posterior (EU law by
virtue of Latvia’s 2004 accession prevails over the 1994 BIT) and /ex superior (EU law
prevails over incompatible inter se international obligations between Member States),
as well as comity and the principle of systemic integration of different international

legal orders.

Alternatively, Article 8 of the BIT is suspended by Articles 59(2) and 30(3) of the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”), since the EU Treaties and the
BIT are on the “same subject matter” because the BIT covers EU law’s four freedoms

(free movement of goods, services, labor and capital).

In relation to consent to jurisdiction, Latvia insists that the Tribunal must look not only
to the ICSID Convention, but to the BIT as well. There are “two consents” which have
to be considered in this context; one under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the
other under Article 8 of the BIT. These present distinct issues. While the Respondent
does not question that the UK and Latvia are parties to the ICSID Convention, as of the
Respondent’s accession to the EU in 2004, there was no offer to arbitrate, nor was there

an offer to accept, under the BIT, once EU law had been brought in.

Latvia submits that the “irrevocability of consent” which is contemplated by Article 25
of the ICSID Convention operates only after that consent has been perfected, which it
never was in this case.°! Although there was an offer to arbitrate open by both Latvia

and the UK as of 1995, by Latvia’s accession to the EU there was no longer an offer to

Press, 2™ edn. +3009), p. 254, para. 5'

accept. By December 2017, the offer was precluded or vitiated by Latvia’s accession
to the EU.
(2) Claimants’ Submissions

208. The Claimants maintain that, by their submission of the RFA on 14 December 2017,
they accepted Latvia’s

 

anding offer of arbitration which had never been withdrawn or
suspended up until that time. At that point in time, they submit, “consent to ICSID

arbitration had been perfected”.

209. Under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, “no party may withdraw its consent
unilaterally.” Under, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, the parties’ consent to ICSID
arbitration shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the

exclusion of any other remedy.

210. The Claimants contend that EU law is a swi generis and autonomous sub-system that
does not touch upon the law and legal system by which this investment Tribunal was
constituted.” Instead, the nature of “consent” is to be determined in accordance with
the terms of the ICSID Convention against the backdrop of general international law.
Ascertaining “consent” requires interpreting and applying Article 25 of the ICSID

Convention.

211. Because it applies to a// ICSID Convention Contracting States, the Claimants state, the
meaning of “consent” must be given an autonomous interpretation under the
Convention. It does not have a malleable meaning that turns on whether the Contracting
Parties are EU Member States or not. Only rules of international law that apply to all
ICSID Convention Contracting States should be taken into account in interpreting the

ICSID Convention under Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.

212. The Claimants maintain that Latvia does not appear to assert that there is any conflict
between the ICSID Convention (cf the BIT) and EU law. In the Claimants’ submission,

this should dispose of the Bifurcated Objection. Latvia would have to show for its

purposes not only that EU law applies (which it is assumed to do arguendo), but also
that EU law invalidates the express permission of the ICSID Convention for ICSID
Contracting States to make ICSID offers in the manner adopted by Latvia. The point is

not addressed by the Respondent.

The core of the issue before the Tribunal is: “Can EU law principles be invoked to
defeat consent to arbitration?” In the Claimants’ submission, the answer is no, because
the Tribunal derives its existence from the BIT (Article 8) and from the ICSID
Convention (Article 25)°° — the “Instruments of Consent” — and not from the legal
orders of the UK, Latvia or the EU. The applicable /ex arbitri, and the law applicable
to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, is the Instruments of Consent, in addition to such
applicable rules of international law as may be necessary to apply to interpret those
instruments. That is a legal order of public international law different from the EU legal

order.

The Claimants emphasise that Latvia had the capacity to enter into the BIT pursuant to
Article 6 of the VCLT. Latvia’s consent was never impeached, withdrawn or suspended
pursuant to the procedures that must be followed under the VCLT. Nor was the BIT
terminated when the Respondent’s consent was perfected (cf Article 42(2) of the
VCLT).

The Claimants also contend that when Latvia gave its consent in Article 8 of the BIT,
it was not an EU Member State, such that there can be no question of incompatibility
with EU law.*” Moreover, by the terms of the BIT itself, Latvia’s consent is not
expressed to be revocable outside the BIT’s termination provision in Article 14. The
language of consent in Article 8 — “hereby consents” — is present tense, reflecting a
continuing consent. Article 14 then provides that the BIT’s provisions continue in force

until one Contracting State gives written notice to the other that the BIT is terminated,

G. APPLICABLE LAW
(1) EU Law as International Law
a. Respondent’s submissions

216. Latvia submits that EU law is international law. By EU law, Latvia means not only
EU treaties, but EU law generally too. EU law is a source of international law” as it
stems from particular or regional conventions mentioned in Article 38(1) of the ICJ
Statute. Latvia accepts that EU law has a dual nature and is considered as domestic law
as well, notably because of its incorporation in the domestic legal system of Member
States. At the same time, in respect to Latvia, EU law remains international law distinct

from Latvian law, including the Latvian Constitution, as is the case in Germany.

217. The status of EU law as international law is asserted to be shown by EU treaties
themselves and confirmed by arbitral decisions and publicists. EU law includes EU
regulations, directives, decisions and the CJEU’s judgments. The latter are binding

sources of EU law under Article 19 of the TEU and Article 267 of the TFEU.

218. In addition: (a) EU law is international law because it creates obligations binding on
EU Member States and on individuals;’! (b) CJEU judgments are international law;’”
and (c) the most qualified publicists confirm that acts of organs of an international

organization are sources of international law.”

regimes of international law do not exist in clinical isolation, but they interact with each

other.

 

220. Latvia asserts that international law must be interpreted in its social context.” Hence,
the BIT is not isolated from everything else. As seen in the CJEU’s Wightman decision,
for example, with respect to Brexit, the CJEU referred to provisions of the VCLT which

would be considered applicable if or when the UK leaves the EU.’’ Latvia’s core

 

submission is that the EU treaties interact with the rest of international law.

221. Latvia argues that, having established the necessary principles leading to this
submission, the Tribunal must, when interpreting Article 8 of the BIT, take into
consideration EU law, notably CJEU judgments, in order to interpret and apply the BIT.
The Tribunal must do so on the basis of what EU law conceives itself to be.”* The

Achmea and Opinion 1/17 judgments show that there is a conflict between EU law and

the BIT.

222. The Respondent's case on jurisdiction invokes the fact that, as of 1992, Latvia was in
the process of becoming part of the EU. At that time, Latvia states, the Baltic countries,
including Latvia, were included in the EU’s PHARE enlargement program.

Subsequently, the following events ensued:

(1) in 1994, Latvia and the UK signed the BIT, which entered into force in 1995;

(2) on 12 June 1995, Latvia signed the EU Association Agreement which entered

into force in 1998;

(3) in 1998, Latvia’s progress report on EU accession confirmed that it had signed

BITs with all EU Member States except Ireland;

(4) on 1 May 2004, Latvia acceded to the EU.

Latvia says that the significance of its accession to the EU is that, while there was an
offer to arbitrate open by both Latvia and the UK as of 1995 when the BIT entered into
force, after 1 May 2004, when Latvia acceded to the EU, there was no longer an offer
to accept. As to whether consent was perfected in December 2017 when the Claimants
submitted their RFA, Latvia’s response is that there was no consent at that time. This
argument is predicated on Latvia’s trajectory towards accession commencing in 1992,
and by factoring in the international law which bound the UK and Latvia at the material

time.”

b. Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants submit that EU law is a sui generis and autonomous sub-system that
does not touch upon the law and legal system by which this investment Tribunal was
constituted.*° EU law is not applicable to jurisdiction or to merits. At most, EU law

should be taken into account, but that is distinct from applying it as the applicable law.

The Claimants reject, in each respect, Latvia’s submissions on the scope of applicable
law. Specifically, they rely on an expert opinion of Lord Neuberger that the decision in
Achmea is wrong, that it is not binding on the Tribunal, alternatively that it is
distinguishable, that it is inapplicable because this case will not involve interpretation
of EU law as distinct from applying EU law as fact, relying on Opinion 1/17 and, finally

that it should not be given retroactive effect.

Alternatively, insofar as EU law is otherwise applicable to the merits for purposes of
Achmea, or to jurisdiction, that application is precluded by Article 11 of the BIT or the
MEN Clause in Article 3.

In the Claimants’ submission, Achmea does not evidence any general principle or rule

of international law on the conflict of treaties. As Professor Talmon explains, Achmea

purports only to preclude recourse to dispute resolution mechanisms as a matter of EU

law.*! It is an EU law rule. It is not an international law rule.

The Claimants contend that EU law is not applicable to, and cannot affect, the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction or admissibility, and this applies in a post-Achmea context.*?
Achmea does not bind this Tribunal as it is a decision rendered by a court within the

EU legal order, which does not sit in the same hierarchy as this Tribunal.

Even if Achmea is correct and applies, by continuing to make its standing offer of
arbitration to UK investors in Latvia by Article 8 of the BIT, the Respondent was, from
its accession to the EU in 2004, in breach of Article 344 of the TFEU and can be held

responsible by the EU and its fellow Member States for such breach.*?

(2) Articles 27 and 46 of the VCLT
a. Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants invoke Articles 27 and 46 of the VCLT for the purposes of preserving
the validity of Latvia’s consent to ICSID arbitration. The Claimants contend that Latvia
consented to arbitration and that that consent was relied on by them. A State cannot
invoke its internal laws to invalidate its consent (Article 46) or to justify its non-

performance of a treaty obligation (Article 27).

For the purposes of Article 27 of the VCLT, the decisive question is not whether EU
law is international law or domestic law, but whether EU law is “internal law” of Latvia.
It plainly is, the Claimants say, and that is precisely the consequence of EU law having
primacy over the domestic law of Latvia for the purposes of Latvian law. It must follow
that EU law operates as law that is internal to the legal system of the Member States,

qualifying as internal law for the purposes of Article 27 of the VCLT.

the Claimants also assert that, in contrast to the Sirabag Award of 4 March 2020 (CL-337), this Tribunal is not subject to any
domestic legal system and derives its jurisdiction exclusively from the BIT and the ICSID Convention, the latter being self-

contained, delocalised and transnational in nature. There

The Claimants cite Cube Infrastructure for the notion that EU law has no supremacy

over international law:**

The EU treaties are, certainly, international agreements of a kind
familiar in international law, binding as between the States
Parties; but they also function as the constitution of an
autonomous community. The rules established by EU secondary
legislation are essentially supra-national regulations rather than
part of the corpus of international law as such... Within the
system of international law, EU law does not have supremacy,
and has no hierarchical priority over the laws of non-Member
States, or over rules of international law...

 

 

Article 46 of the VCLT received less attention from the parties in their pleadings.
During the Hearing, however, Judge Tomka raised the question whether, in the context
of Article 46, consent to be bound by the BIT relates only to the BIT’s entry into force.
Dr Sinclair said that it is open to the Tribunal to interpret Article 46 of the VCLT such

that it is not limited in time.*°

b. Respondent’s submissions

In contrast to the Claimants, the Respondent maintains that EU law is not a
supranational autonomous body of law which is equivalent to domestic law for the

purposes of Articles 27 and 46 of the VLCT.

The Respondent describes the Claimants’ approach to Article 27 of the VCLT as
follows: because EU law would be implemented into, or directly applicable into,

domestic law, EU law could not be international law.

The Respondent rejects this approach because, on this reasoning, any international
treaty implemented into a domestic system would not be international law anymore, as

it has been implemented.

Regarding the Tribunal’s questioning on Article 27 of the VCLT, specifically, whether
EU law could be treated as Latvia’s “internal law” for the purposes of Article 27 of the
VCLT, Latvia’s position is that EU law is not a supra-national “autonomous” body of

law which is equivalent to domestic law for relevant purposes. Latvian law and EU law

“4 Cube Infrastructure, para. 1

are distinct.8° EU law cannot be treated as “internal law” under Article 27 of the
VCLT.*’ In this context, the Respondent relies on Article 5 of the VCLT to argue that
the EU is an international organisation and EU law is international law. The Respondent
cites Eskosol®® and Vattenfall® to confirm its position that EU law is recognised as

international law. In Vattenfall, the Tribunal said:*°

Since the ECJ is empowered by the EU Treaties to give
preliminary rulings on the interpretation of EU law, including
the EU Treaties (see Article 19 TEU and Article 267 TFEU), the
Tribunal considers the ECJ Judgment’s interpretation of the EU
Treaties likewise to constitute a part of the relevant international
law.

238. To the extent that the Claimants cite Cube Infrastructure in the Article 27 of the VLCT
context, the Respondent says that they miss the fundamental point from that case. The
point was that EU law stems from international treaties to which not all ECT Members
are a party. The Claimants are alleged to have omitted part of the paragraph being relied

on:

Any such claim to priority [of EU law over the ECT] would
challenge the basis of the ECT as a multilateral treaty,
unilaterally asserting for the EU and its Member States a right to
be treated differently from all other ECT Contracting Parties.?!

239. Here, it is argued, the only parties to the BIT are two EU Member States, which does

not raise any issues related to third parties.
240. As to Article 46 of the VCLT, Latvia contends that that Article is irrelevant.

(3) Article 42 of the ICSID Convention
a. Respondent’s submissions

241. The Respondent submits that Article 42 of the ICSID Convention applies to the
question of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, as well as to merits, and requires the Tribunal

to apply EU law to this case. Latvia cites various matters in support of this assertion,

including the Declaration, certain ICSID tribunals decisions,” and leading

242. EU law is said to apply as follows:
(1) it is agreed by the UK and Latvia that EU law is part of the law applicable to an
intra-EU BIT;%4

(2) EU law applies under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention on the basis of

 

applicable principles of international law’? (e.g. Articles 31(3)(c) and 5 of the
VCLT and conflicts rules); and

(3) EU law applies on the basis of Latvia’s conflict-of-law rules (e.g. constitutional

rules requiring that EU law prevail over other legal norms).

243. In respect of the question of merits, Latvia contends that EU law qualifies under one of

the two prongs of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention. The two ‘prongs’ are:

(1) _ the “law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including
its rules on the conflict of laws);” or

(2) “such rules of international law as may be applicable”.°®

244. The Tribunal addressed a question to the parties on the first prong above. In response
to it, Latvia stated inter alia that the terms of the first prong could include the rule of
primacy of EU law incorporated into Latvian law. In this manner, and as per EU law’s
dual aspect as international law and domestic law, EU law can be considered as “laws

of the Contracting State” including its rules on the conflict of laws.

Latvia contends that EU law is international law within the meaning of Article 42(1) of

the ICSID Convention because:

(1) EU law is part of the law “agreed” to by Latvia and the UK to be applicable to
a BIT dispute. Under Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, in interpreting the BIT, this
Tribunal “shall” take into account international agreements in force between the
UK and Latvia. Such international agreements include EU law as derived from
the EU Treaties. In this dispute, it is argued, EU law will include EU regulations
and directives on banking law.

(2) The Declaration confirms that EU law applies to the determination of this
dispute. For the same reasons, says Latvia, EU law necessarily comes within
the text of “such rules of international law as may be applicable” in the Article

42(1) definition.

b. Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants submit that the law applicable to jurisdiction is derived from Article 8
of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, not from Article 42 of the ICSID

Convention.

Article 42 of the ICSID Convention is said to expressly govern the law applicable to
the merits, and not jurisdiction.°” Article 42 applies to the “dispute”. The term “dispute”
in Articles 25(1) and 42 of the ICSID Convention means the same thing, and Article

25(1) makes clear that what is in contemplation is the substantive dispute.

The Claimants submit that Article 42 of the ICSID Convention is a choice of law rule

for the purposes of determining the law applicable to the merits, not jurisdiction.

On Latvia’s theory, say the Claimants, the default law applicable to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction would be the host State’s law. Here that is Latvian law under the second
sentence of Article 42(1). On Latvia’s theory, host states could unilaterally regulate the
law applicable to the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals. Latvia’s theory, if correct, would

defeat the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, which is the delocalisation of

investment arbitration. It follows that the law applicable to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

is not determined by Article 42.

(4) Article 31(3) of the VCLT
a. Respondent’s submissions

250. Latvia maintains that, as there is no applicable law clause in the BIT, the BIT must be
interpreted in accordance with international law. Article 31(3) of the VCLT is
specifically applicable to interpret the entire BIT. It requires that “any relevant rules of
international law” must be “taken into account.”* Just as with Slovakia and the
Netherlands BIT in Achmea, the “relevant rules of international law” applicable to UK-
Latvia relations include the EU Treaties and thus EU law. It follows that this Tribunal

should arrive at the same result as in Achmea.

251. Latvia submits that EU law, as a subset of public international law, interacts with the
general normative environment through the “master key” of Article 31(3)(c) of the
VCLT. Latvia contends that Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT must import the principle of
primacy to this case. The principle to be imported is referenced in the Declaration,”
namely, that the provision of a bilateral agreement between two Member States that is
incompatible with EU law is precluded and thus inapplicable. Latvia cites not only

Achmea and Opinion 1/17 in support of the principle to apply, but three cases

concerning intra-EU bilateral treaties (albeit not investment treaties): Matteucci,!°°

101

Exportur'®! and Ravil.!°? The proposition being advanced is that EU Member States

cannot circumvent the fundamental rules of the treaties and contract with each other to

avoid them.

°8 See also Achmea, para. 40.

® Latvia says the 15 January 2019 Declaration should be taken into account by the Tribunal under Article 31(3)(a)-(b) VCLT,

as an agreement or subsequent practice on the interpretation or application of the Treaty by the UK and Latvia, The Declaration

is also said to confirm that both the UK and Latvia accept the consequences of Achmea.

b. Claimants’ submissions

According to the Claimants, Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT cannot import EU law in the
way that Latvia seeks to do in order to revoke its consent. Article 31(3)(c) is not an
applicable law clause or a conflict clause.'°? Rather, it is concerned with the
interpretation of a specific treaty term or provision. If it were an applicable law clause
or a conflict clause, the Claimants say, then the treaty conflict rules in the VCLT would
be superfluous. However, that Article states that, together with “context,” as defined in
Article 31(2), “relevant rules of international law” shall be “taken into account” in
interpreting the treaty. Article 31 sets out the principles that the Tribunal should take

into account in ascertaining meaning through interpretation.

Yet far from asking the Tribunal to merely “take into account” EU law as a relevant
rule of international law as part of the interpretive process, the Respondent seeks to
effectively invalidate or give no meaning to Article 8 of the BIT and to Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention, by applying EU law. This is an attempt to re-write a
provision,!* not an attempt to “interpret” a provision. Latvia’s construction is
impermissible as it would directly invalidate the provisions purportedly being
interpreted. That is not a good faith interpretation in accordance with the ordinary

meaning given to the BIT’s terms.

Nor does Article 31(3)(c) give primacy to other rules of international law.'°> The
Tribunal need only “take into account” other rules of international law. The Respondent
cannot “interpret away” its consent to ICSID arbitration by application of Article

31(3)(c) of the VCLT.

rests essentially on two grounds: (1) that the 15 January 2019 Declarations cannot be
considered to retroactively withdraw Hungary’s consent to arbitration; and (2) that the

conditions of Article 30 VCLT are not met in that case.

Contrary to this, Latvia asserts that the Declarations are authentic interpretations of
intra-EU BITs!'®’ as subsequent agreements on the interpretation and application of
intra-EU BITs, and subsequent practice on their interpretation pursuant to VCLT

Article 31(3)(a)-(b). This explains the treaty law consequences of Achmea.

The Declaration i:

 

‘aid to be an agreement on the interpretation and application of
Article 8 of the BIT because it concerns the consequences of Achmea for “all” investor-
state arbitration clauses contained in BITs concluded between Member States, and
because the Declaration is signed by both Latvia and the UK.'* In this context, EU law
takes precedence over intra-EU BITs because EU law, pursuant to CJEU case law, |?
trumps provisions of international agreements applicable as between EU Member

States.

Latvia accepts that the Declarations do not directly impact the interpretation or
application of EU law.'!® However, it submits that the CJEU is the authoritative
interpreter of EU law. Factoring in this reasoning, Latvia submits that the Magyar
Farming tribunal, by considering whether the Declarations “terminate[d]”!"' the offer
to arbitrate under the Hungary-UK BIT in January 2019, failed to grasp that under EU
law the Declarations could not have such an effect. Rather the Declarations reflect the
existence, since 1 May 2004, of the preclusion of the offer to arbitrate under the intra-
EU BITs of Member States that acceded to the EU on that date (such as Latvia). The
Declarations did not themselves retroactively extinguish Latvia’s consent to ICSID

arbitration.

As will appear, Latvia relies on the Declarations, the Termination Agreement and the

EC’s notices of infringement, to assert the existence of an EU Public Policy which

allegedly precludes intra-EU BIT claims on the basis of an investor-State arbitration

mechanism.

b. Claimants’ Submissions

The Claimants contend that the Declaration was not a subsequent agreement on the
application of the BIT. The Declaration was an “inter-governmental political
declaration of the governments of the 22 Member States which signed it,”!!? as
confirmed in Eskosol.!'3 Eskosol imparts that the Declarations cannot be given such
weight so as to retroactively extinguish Latvia’s consent to arbitration.''* Member
States are not competent to provide conclusive interpretations of EU law
notwithstanding what may be purported or how they intend to apply Achmea ‘in the
future.’ Referring to Article 43 of the Statute of the Court it submits that the prerogative

to issue authoritative interpretations of EU law is conferred on the CJEU.!'>

In contending that the Declaration cannot extinguish Latvia’s consent to ICSID

"6 in addition to the

arbitration, the Claimants also rely on Professor Talmon’s report
Magyar Farming tribunal. In Magyar Farming, the claimants had accepted Hungary’s
offer to arbitrate prior to Achmea (as is the case here), finding that it was not open for
Hungary to renege on its consent.'!” The tribunal also said that even if the Declaration
could be regarded as an agreement to terminate the BIT, the consent to arbitrate, which
is perfected by the investor’s acceptance of the State’s offer to arbitrate expressed in
the BIT, could not be retroactively invalidated by a later termination of the BIT.'!* In
doing so, say the Claimants, the Magyar Farming tribunal concurred with the finding
in Eskosol.!'°

To the extent that Latvia relies on the Termination Agreement for its purposes, the

Claimants contend that the UK’s failure to sign it reinforces that the BIT is in full force

and effect. Moreover, the Termination Agreement is not relevant for the purposes of

Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.

(6) The Termination Agreement
a. Respondent’s Submissions

Latvia contends that the Termination Agreement confirms that effective legal
protection of EU investors with ongoing intra-EU BIT claims is a matter for domestic

courts of EU Member States, not for arbitral tribunals.

Latvia emphasises that on 14 May 2020, a notice of infringement was issued by the EC
to the UK for failing to remove the intra-EU BITs from its legal order. The infringement
notice allegedly confirms that EU law continues to apply to the UK during the transition
period in respect of intra-EU BITs, and so continues to preclude the application of the
BIT. The notice also confirms that the UK’s related obligation to remove intra-EU BITs
from its legal order will survive Brexit since the UK’s obligation to formally terminate
already incompatible intra-EU BITs is, for the UK, a “legal situation of the parties [EU
Member States] created through the execution of the treaty [EU Treaties] prior to its
termination” (Article 70(1)(b) of the VCLT).

Latvia notes that it has signed the Termination Agreement.'”° The fact that the UK did
not sign the Agreement, just like Austria, Finland and Sweden, does not mean that such
States are not subject to their ongoing EU law obligations in respect of intra-EU BITs.

While the BIT is not per se “terminated,” it is precluded by EU law from applying.

In Latvia’s submission, there is currently a consensus amongst EU Member States
including the UK, as reflected by the 15 and 16 January 2019 Declarations, the
Termination Agreement and the EC’s notices of infringement, that there is an EU Public
Policy precluding intra-EU BIT claims on the basis of an investor-State arbitration
mechanism. Such public policy requires EU Member States and the UK to take steps

to remove those intra-EU BITs from their legal order.

In so far as the Claimants rely on Latvia’s failure to terminate the BIT under Article 14

for their purposes, Latvia contends that triggering that termination is superfluous and

'20 Termination Agreement, RL-00362, p. 14 (also submitted as exhibit CL-316).

64

268.

269.

contrary to the intentions of the parties to the BIT, which both signed the Declaration.

Ultimately, says Latvia, the BIT is precluded by EU law.

b. Claimants’ Submissions

The Claimants highlight that Latvia has not terminated all of its intra-EU investment
treaties, for instance its treaties with Sweden and Finland remain in full force. The
Claimants submit that the state parties’ failure to terminate the BIT should be
conclusive on the Bifurcated Issue; by deciding not to terminate the BIT - albeit that
the draft of the Termination Agreement envisaged that the BIT would be terminated'*!
- the UK and Latvia have in fact expressed their intention that the BIT will remain in

full force and effect. This is despite the fact that Latvia has at its disposal the unilateral

termination mechanism under Article 14 of the BIT which it has not triggered.

The Claimants assert that the fact that the UK has not signed the Termination
Agreement reinforces that the BIT remains in full force and effect. They say further

that:

(1) The Termination Agreement is not a relevant source of law under Article

31(3)(c) of the VCLT.
(2) The EC’s notice of infringement recognises that the BIT remains in force.

(3) The signatories of the Termination Agreement recognise that Achmea did not

have the effect of terminating the intra-EU BITs.

(4) Several EU Member States, including the UK, did not agree to terminate their
intra-EU BITs.

(5) All non-EU States continue to enforce international arbitration awards based on
intra-EU BITs, showing that there is no international consensus on Achmea as

alleged.

(6) The BIT is now an extra-EU BIT, thus any comparison with Achmea is

inapposite.

H. CONFLICT RULES

270. — Latvi:

lex specialis and lex superior. EU law is contended to be, in respect of the BIT,

submits that the Tribunal must apply international conflict rules of lex posterior,

 

9 «112 1D,
posterior, '” more special!”* and superior.'*4

(1) CJEU Doctrine of Primacy
a. Respondent’s submissions

271. Latvia contends that the principle of primacy of EU law over international agreements
is a conflict rule of public international law. Latvia defines the principle as “any
provision of an inter se international agreement between two Member States that is
incompatible with EU law, for example, its principle of autonomy, will be precluded
and thus inapplicable.” The principle was established in a line of authority prior to

Achmea.'?°

272. The principle of primacy should apply to this Tribunal’s interpretation of Article 8 and
to the rest of the BIT on the basis of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT and on the agreement
of the parties to the BIT. Specifically, Latvia relies on that Article and/or on primacy

itself.

273. Latvia submits that there is no real distinction between “interpretation” and “conflicts.”
It highlights that the European Court of Human Rights (“ECHR”) has used Article
31(3)(c) of the VCLT to preclude the application of certain norms of the ECHR in light
of the international law rules of state immunity.!° There, says Latvia, the ECHR
concluded that it could use other aspects of international law outside the relevant

274, The end result, says Latvia, is that Article 8 and the rest of the BIT must be interpreted
in light of the EU Treaties. The ultimate end result is that this Tribunal has no
jurisdiction.

275. The principle to be imported is referenced in the Declaration,'?’

namely, that the
provision of a bilateral agreement between two Member States that is incompatible with
EU law is precluded and inapplicable. Latvia says the Declaration should be taken into
account by the Tribunal under Article 31(3)(a)-(b) of the VCLT, as an agreement on
the interpretation or application of the BIT by the UK and Latvia. The Declaration is

also said to confirm that both the UK and Latvia accept the consequences of Achmea.

276. Latvia says that Professor Tridimas’ evidence at the Hearing confirmed that the
addressees of primacy include any organ competent to consider or take into account EU

law, including this Tribunal.

277. In addition to applying EU law primacy as its own international law rule of conflict,
Latvia submits that it should apply in this case via the general international law
principle of /ex superior'?*, The EU Treaties set up a system whereby the international
legal order established on the basis of the EU Treaties takes precedence over
international obligations of the Member States among themselves.'”? As /ex superior,
primacy of EU law is absolute and cannot be derogated from in the relationship between

Member States.

278. Furthermore, Latvia contends that the primacy principle applies to the BIT as /ex
specialis in the context of Article 5 of the VCLT, in favour of more generalised rules

of conflict such as Articles 30 or 59 of the VCLT.'*°

'27 Latvia says the Declaration supports the notion that EU law is superior to the Treaty, citing the following passages: “Union
law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States... With regard to agreement
concluded between Member States, see judgments in Matteucci, 235/87, EU:C:1988:460, paragraph 21; and Budéjov
Budvar, EU:C:2009:521, C-478/07, paragraphs 98 and 99 and Declaration 17 to the Treaty of Lisbon on primacy of Union
law. The same result follows also under general public international law, in particular from the relevant provisions of the
Vienna Convention in the Law of the Treaties and customary international law (lex posterior).” 15 January 2019 Declaration,

Latvia’s position is that, in the context of these proceedings which involve inter-se
international agreements between Member States, and by virtue of Article 5 of the
VCLT, EU law and its primacy rule is a special law that takes priority over general
law.!3! On the sole basis of the /ex specialis principle, the principle of EU law primacy
must be applied to the BIT instead of other more general rules of conflict such as

Articles 30 or 59 of the VCLT.

b. Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants submit that the so-called EU “principle of primacy” is not an applicable
treaty conflict norm, but a judge-made rule. The rule governs the applicability of
conflicting rules by national authorities of EU Member States, primarily by national
courts.'*? There is no authority under EU law to the effect that international courts or
tribunals are the addressees of the principle of primacy, let alone that they are bound

by such a principle. For the Tribunal to rule otherwise would be a first.

The principle of primacy is an internal constitutional principle of the EU legal order.'*
The principle does not override conflict provisions under general international law, and

Latvia has not produced any decisions to the contrary.

The Claimants reject the proposition that the primacy principle, as incorporated into
Latvia’s domestic legal system, can qualify as a “conflict of laws” norm for the

purposes of Article 42.'*4

There is no inconsistency when, for example, the ECHR does not decline jurisdiction
when adjudicating claims against EU Member States, notwithstanding the “primacy”

of EU law. The ECHR determines claims under the Convention pursuant to its mandate

and finds that EU law cannot be a defence to violations of the European Convention on

Human Rights. 35

The Claimants characterise the Respondent’s invocation of the /ex specialis principle
as an attempt to circumvent the “same subject matter”!*° threshold which should be

rejected by the Tribunal.

In the Claimants’ submission, Article 11 governs any conflicts with EU norms and is
the /ex specialis found in the BIT’s express terms which prevails over EU law on
primacy.'3” Lex specialis governs only derogation from a dispositive norm (i.e. a norm
that permits derogation).!3° The Claimants contend that Article 11 does not permit
derogation, or, alternatively, it takes precedence as the relevant conflict norm within
the BIT. In any event, EU law is not more specific than the BIT. According to the
Claimants, it remains a mystery as to what “specificity” Latvia claims EU law has over

the BIT.

(2) Articles 8 and 11 of the BIT
a. Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants contend that under Article 11 of the BIT, they can, and have, opted to
elect to have the BIT provisions apply to the exclusion of other conflict rules.!*° In this
context, the Claimants reject Latvia’s assertion that the applicability of Article 11 is in

),!40

the hands of the State-appointed insolvency administrator (Mr Krastins) insisting

instead that their prior invocation of Article 11 is unaffected by his appointment.
By its terms, it is contended, Article 11 excludes the application of EU law to Article 8

of the BIT if the Claimants regard the BIT as providing more favourable treatment,

which they do on Latvia’s stance that Article 8 is precluded by EU law. The Claimants

argue that the word “treatment” in Article 11 extends to Article 8 of the BIT, the dispute

resolution mechanism.'4! Article 11 is said to be equivalent to Article 16 of the ECT.

288. The Claimants invoke Article 11 to exclude any alleged “rules of EU law” that would
allegedly deprive them of their rights under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Their
position is that Article 11 applies not only to jurisdictional issues in Article 8 of the
BIT, but it excludes EU law from applying to the merits as well. The result is the full
compatibility of the BIT with Achmea.

289. It is the Claimants’ submission that the effect of Article 11 was never addressed in
Achmea in relation to the equivalent clause there, namely, Article 3(5) of the Slovakia-
Netherlands BIT. The CJEU was asked to only rule on a narrowly defined question
which specifically concerned the compatibility of the dispute settlement provision of

the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT with EU law.!*” The CJEU never addressed Article 3(5).

290, The Claimants cite Addiko v Croatia for the proposition that a lack of an express choice-
of-law provision in an investment treaty must be deemed to constitute a choice of the

investment treaty and general principles of international law as the applicable rules, to

the exclusion of EU law.'*

291, Inthe alternative, the Claimants invoke Middle East Cement v Egypt for the proposition
that a clause analogous to Article 11 of the BIT constituted a choice-of-rule for the
merits of the dispute for the purposes of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention.'*4 The

same considerations are contended to apply here.

292. This interpretation is said by the Shareholder Claimants to be further supported by the

principle of harmonious interpretation,'*> specifically, that Latvia and the UK, in

‘41 See Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, CL-226,
paras. 85-86, 103. The Claimants say there is no reason to read “treatment” as not including the basis on which access to
dispute resolution in Article 8 of the Treaty is conferred. It is one of the most fundamental Treaty provisions for an investor.
Under Article 31 of the VCLT, in ascertaining the meaning of “treatment” the Tribunal must also consider other clauses in the
Treaty using the same term for consistency. The Claimants note in this regard the MEN Clause.

keeping in force the BIT, intended the BIT to comply with their other obligations under
international law. Here that leads to the conclusion that whether as a matter of principle,
or by application of Article 11, EU law does not form part of the rules applicable to the

merits of the dispute.

The Claimants submit that Article 11 thus governs any conflict with EU norms and is
the /ex specialis found in the BIT’s express terms which prevails over EU law on
primacy.'*° In so far as this Tribunal accepts that there is no meaningful distinction

between Article 11 of the BIT and Article 16 of the ECT, that ends the inquiry.!*7
Moreover, in so far as Latvia has argued that Article 11:

(1) says nothing about less favourable rules in order to try to distinguish Article 16
of the ECT, this a distinction without difference. Article 11 would be redundant
if the host State could apply less favourable rules notwithstanding its
undertaking in Article 11 that nationals and companies of other Contracting

States may invoke a more favourable rule;

(2) does not extend to dispute settlement because it refers only to “investments,”
the Claimants describe this as “entirely unworkable,” because the BIT expressly
includes Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and permits an investment

to be a Claimant in accordance with Article 8(2) of the BIT.'48

b. Respondent’s submissions

Latvia notes that the Claimants argue that Article 11 of the BIT, which concerns more

favourable treatment, is a conflict clause which defeats Latvia’s position. Latvia rejects

 

the argument that Article 11 is a conflict rule and makes the following submissions in

response.

146 See First and Second Talmon Reports; cf Vattenfall, para. 217; Cube Infrastructure, para. 132 (ECT context).

First, there is a substantially similar provision in Article 3(5) of the Netherlands-
Slovakia BIT, thus the CJEU in Achmea must have considered the issue. This factor

alone should be conclusive on the matter.

Second, Article 11 concerns the treatment of “investments,” not of “investors”. Article
11 cannot be used with respect to dispute settlement (Article 8), which concerns only
investors (“national” or “company”). While the Claimants’ interpretation is based on
Article 16 of the ECT, that is a very different provision because it not only gives or
offers more favourable treatment from other treaties, it also precludes less favourable

treatment from other treaties. This aspect is absent in Article 11 of the BIT. To the

 

extent that the Claimants admit that Article 16(2) of the ECT would prevent EU law
from applying, they cannot “have their cake and eat it too” by refusing to admit EU law
is connected to the BIT while recognizing that the ECT and EU law interact through
Article 16(2).

Third, Latvia contends that Article 11 cannot apply to dispute resolution provisions,
including provisions on applicable law, which are not “treatment.”!4? Treatment
provisions cannot be used to import dispute resolution rights, as that is a substantive

issue.

Fourth, Latvia contends that the Claimants have not identified any provisions that
specifically allow for the application of EU law as ‘fact’ in other extra-EU BITs of
Latvia. Even if the Claimants did so identify, says Latvia, the provisions are not
“obligations” in the sense of Article 11 of the BIT, which must refer to substantive

obligations.
Latvia makes several additional arguments including the following:

(1) An intra-EU investor/investment not having access to ISDS against an EU
Member State is not receiving “less favourable” treatment compared to an extra-

. . 5
EU investor/ investment.'*°

49 See also HICEE B.V. v. The Slovak Republic, PCA Case No. 2009-11, Partial Award, 23 May 2011, RL-00451, para. 149.
'S0 The Tribunal notes that in its First PHS, the Respondent elaborated on four reasons regarding why ISDS does not constitute
“treatment” for the purposes of the MFN provision of the Treaty. In short: (1) there are at least two instances post-1994 where
the UK and Latvia concurrently and simultaneously agreed that dispute resolution issues cannot generally be considered as
“treatment” for the purposes of an MEN; (2) there now exists a rule of customary international law pursuant to which dispute

72

(2) The Shareholder Claimants are not “in like situations” or “in like

circumstances” to those allegedly receiving more favorable treatment. !>!

(3) Article 11 applies only regarding more favorable rules that benefit Latvian or
UK nationals, but the Claimants invoke rules stemming from extra-EU BITs
that apply to non-EU nationals (i.e. having EU law apply as ‘fact’ to the merits

of an investment treaty case) and are simply outside the scope of Article 11.

4) Article 11 of the BIT does not allow the exclusion of applicable international

law.

5) Even if Article 11 of the BIT was found to be a conflict clause, it would not

prevail over the principle of primacy of EU law as it concerns only investors.

6) Should Article 11 be applicable, it can only be invoked by the Bank and Mr
Krasting (and not by the Shareholder Claimants).

7) Professor Tridimas’ expert report confirms that it is prohibited by EU law to
avoid or abuse obligations. This is further supported by CJEU case law,!*? and
the rule that EU Member States cannot contract out bilaterally or otherwise of

EU law obligations.

301. As to certain arguments raised by the Shareholder Claimants’ in their First Post-Hearing

Submissions, Latvia makes some responsive arguments including the following:

(1) Latvia disagrees that Middle East Cement v Egypt applies as a choice-of-rule
for the merits of the dispute for reasons previously invoked. Further, the case
confirms Latvia’s contention that Article 11 only applies to more favourable

rules benefiting the parties to the BIT and that it does not enable the exclusion

resolution issues are not considered as “treatment” for the purposes of MEN provisions in investment treaties, considering
State practice from 75 States; (3) this Tribunal must interpret international law following the evolution of law in time; (4)
accepting the Claimants’ argument that EU law can be applied as “fact” through the BIT’s MEN provision found in Article 3
would be contrary to EU law’s “non circumvention” rule. Respondent’s PHS 1, paras. 75-80.
'S! The Tribunal observes that this argument also applied to the BIT’s MEN provision, there being substantial overlap with
Latvia’ 's arguments in respect of that provision and the present one.

of parts of the applicable law.'*> However, should the Tribunal agree with the
Claimants, Latvia says that the EU system provides a more favourable treatment

than investment treaty proceedings, both substantively and procedurally.

(2) The Claimants’ view of the “harmonious interpretation” principle would have
this Tribunal interpret the BIT as allowing it not to apply EU law. Far from a
harmonious result, that would create a direct conflict between the BIT and EU
law, which disregards how EU law functions. Systemic integration requires the
taking into account of “any relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the parties” (VCLT, 31(3)(c)). In order to comply with this
principle, which is customary international law,'** the Tribunal must take into

account EU law and the primacy principle.

(3) Likewise, the Claimants’ argument concerning Addiko v Croatia, that the
absence of an applicable law clause in the Austria-Croatia BIT distinguishes
that case from Achmea, is wrong. As above, VCLT Article 31(3)(c) requires
that EU law be taken into account as international law stemming from the EU

Treaties.

(3) The MFN Clause: Articles 3 and 11 of the BIT
a. Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants rely on the MFN clause in the alternative to, or in conjunction with,
Article 11 of the BIT, for the purposes of seeking to benefit, in relation to jurisdiction
and admissibility issues, from the application of allegedly more favourable forms of
Article 11 in other BITs. By the MFN Clause, the Claimants submit, the law applicable
to consent to ICSID arbitration in more favourable BITs to which Latvia is a party,
which does not include EU law, should apply to Latvia’s consent to ICSID arbitration

under Article 8 of the BIT.

The Claimants submit that, if the Tribunal finds that Article 11 of the BIT does not
apply to Article 8, then they rely on other forms of Article 11 in other BITs — South

153 Citing Middle East Cement v Egypt, para. 87 (“While that provision requires the application of additional provisions
of the national law if more favorable for the investor — which the Tribunal does not find to exist in this case -, b}

it does not permit application of provisions of national law limiting any claims found by the Tribunal

to exist under the BIT.”) (emphasis is Latvia’s).

Korea-Latvia BIT, Armenia-Latvia BIT, Georgia-Latvia BIT, Czech Republic-Latvia
BIT, Hungary-Latvia BIT — by application of the Article 3 MFN Clause.

304. Article 11 is a substantive standard, and there are more favourable forms of it in other
Latvia treaties, such as Article 10 of the South Korea-Latvia BIT,'* which is clear that

both investments and investors may avail themselves of the more favourable rules.

305. In their Post-Hearing Submissions, the Claimants elaborate on their alleged entitlement,
via the MFN Clause, to invoke Article 9(5) of the Armenia-Latvia BIT,!*° for other
applicable law provisions between Latvia and a non-EU State. Article 9(5) of the
Armenia-Latvia BIT is contended to render international law applicable here to the
merits. The Claimants recognise that EU law could also apply as part of Latvian law.
However, EU law would only be domestic law, and could not give rise to any
“international public policy” concern. Nor could it trump international law (or the

underlying investment treaty) under that BIT, even if there was a conflict with EU

law, !97

306. The Claimants assert that the MFN Clause expressly applies to Article 8 of the BIT,
and, therefore, to jurisdiction and admissibility.'5* By the MFN Clause, the law
applicable to the consent to ICSID arbitration in more favourable BITs should apply to
Latvia’s consent to ICSID arbitration under Article 8 of the BIT.'® This is not using
the MEN Clause to create consent, say the Claimants. The consent exists in Article 8.
The MEN Clause extends to Article 8 and is relied on to invoke a more favourable form

of Article 11.

158 Article 10 states: “Where a matter is governed simultaneously both by this Agreement and by another international
agreement to which both Contracting Parties are parties, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Contracting Party or
any of its investors who own investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party from taking advantage of whichever
rules are more favourable to his case.” Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Korea and the Government of,

Government of Georgia for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 5 October 2005, CL-232.

160 Article XIII(7) states

The Claimants also invoke Article 3 of the BIT to rely on the rules chosen to govern

the merits of an investment claim under the Canada-Latvia BIT. They assert that Latvia

 

has, through its own express reliance on the Canada-Latvia BIT in its Memorial on the
Bifurcated Objection, recognised that, by operation of the MFN clause, Article XIII(7)
of the Canada-Latvia BIT is incorporated into the BIT.'®° According to the Claimants,
the legal position here is uncontroversial,'*! and should be common ground (although
it is not). Further, it is said to be beyond doubt that EU law is not part of international
law as between Canada and Latvia, irrespective of whether EU law constitutes
international law as between EU Member States (which is denied). Accordingly, it is
contended, if the Tribunal finds that the choice of rules applicable to the merits under
the BIT (read with the ICSID Convention) include EU law, Article XIII(7) of the
Canada-Latvia BIT is invoked as the proper choice-of-rules provision for the purposes
of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, on the basis of Article 3 of the BIT. Article
XIII(7) provides more favourable treatment to the Claimants and their investments than
that which Latvia affords to UK nationals, UK companies and their investments under

the BIT, as it excludes the applicability of EU law to the merits of an investment claim.

According to the Claimants, while Latvia tries to argue that MFN clauses do not apply
to applicable law clauses, “[t]hat is precisely the effect [of] the MFN Clauses - they
allow investors to have their disputes resolved on the basis of rules other than the rules

162

expressly or impliedly stipulated in the underlying investment treaty.”!°* Moreover:

(1) Contrary to Latvia’s arguments, there is no new rule of “customary international
law” pursuant to which the MFN Clause would not apply to “dispute resolution
issues”.'© This runs contrary to the BIT’s express language: per Article 3(3),
the MFN Clause “shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this

Agreement”, which includes the BIT’s Article 8 dispute settlement mechanism.

(2) Tribunals have recognised that express stipulations such as this must be given

effect in interpreting the MFN Clause.'*

(3) Even if there was a general customary rule on how MEN Clauses should be

interpreted (quod non), deviation of the rule by the BIT should be given effect.

(4) The Claimants reject that the question of the applicable law is a “dispute

settlement issue” as the rules applicable to the merits is a substantive issue.

(5) There is no “circumvention” of EU law in the MFN Clause. The MFN Clause
secures consistency with EU law, as it allows the resolution of investment

disputes without rendering EU law part of the applicable law.

(6) The MFN Clause enables the dispute to be determined by the standards of other

   

extra-EU investment treaties which are, on Latvia’s admission, consistent with
EU law and contain “sufficient safeguards.” Latvia fails to explain why the BIT
cannot be interpreted so as to ensure consistency with the CETA Opinion. It

plainly can, say the Claimants.

b. Respondent’s submissions

309. The Respondent’s position in relation to Article 3 and Article 11 of the BIT is that
nothing in the BIT, whether Article 3 or 11, supports a conclusion that this Tribunal has

jurisdiction. Achmea cannot be avoided.

310. The Respondent says further that it is understood among states that “treatment”
provisions cannot be used to import dispute resolution rights, as that is a substantive
issue. In support of its argument, Latvia cites the terms of CETA, Article 8.7(4) on
MEN.!® The CETA provision overrides the “for the avoidance of doubt” provision in

Article 3(3) of the BIT, which applies the MFN clause to inter alia Article 8.'% Latvia

Jurisdiction on the Respondent Objection to Jurisdiction Ratione Voluntatis (English), 26 July 2016, CL-223, para. 102.

165 Referring to CETA Article 8.7(4) on MEN, which was negotiated with both Latvia and the UK as EU Member States and,
it is submitted, should reflect the intent or practice of those states with respect to what treatment in an MFN means (“For
greater certainty”.)

66 Tn arriving at this construction, Latvia says that, consistent with Article 31 of the VCLT, it factors in the text of Article 8,
context, object and purpose, and, pursuant to Article 31(3)(c), other relevant international law. The latter includes Achmea
which is a source of international law. The end result is that there is no consent in December 2017. Latvia says that if the
Tribunal deems Achmea to be irrelevant, or does not want to apply it, that is one thing, however, Achmea is relevant and when
taking it into account under Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, the Tribunal must at least acknowledge the existence of a collision
between EU law and the Treaty. In terms of factoring in Latvia and the UK’s “intention” regarding the arbitration clause, the

 

77

311.

312.

313.

314,

contends that it became the position of the UK and Latvia when the CETA provision
was drafted that treatment in an MFN clause does not include dispute resolution
procedures. This is what the words “[flor greater certainty” mean in the CETA

provision.

It is Latvia’s position that Article 8 of the BIT is precluded under EU law because there
is no consent, and one cannot use MFN to bring in dispute resolution. Even if the
Tribunal accepted that the MFN Clause could bring in dispute resolution, the Tribunal
cannot use MFN to create dispute resolution with an investor. “You cannot create

consent in the absence of consent”.'°7

The “treatment” referred to does not include procedures for the resolution of investment
disputes between investors and states provided for in other international investment
treaties and other trade agreements. Substantive obligations in other international
investment treaties and other trade agreements do not in themselves constitute
“treatment”, and thus cannot give rise to a breach of this Article, absent measures

adopted or maintained by a Party pursuant to those obligations.

Latvia criticises the Claimants’ position on the MFN Clause as an attempt to try to
circumvent the fundamental principle that states have to consent to jurisdiction.!**

During the Hearing, Arbitrator Townsend asked Latvia’s counsel whether the
commencement date to assess the UK’s and Latvia’s intention in interpreting the MFN

clause in the context of Article 31 of the VCLT, should commence it the date the

 

BIT was signed (1994). Mr Savoie said no, arguing that, as a matter of intertemporal
law, it is proper to look at the intention of the parties generally, not being fixed in time.
There was no consent perfected in December 2017, as is clear given Latvia’s trajectory
towards accession commencing in 1992 and given the international law which bound

the UK and Latvia.’

15 January 2019 Declaration should be factored in as an agreement of the parties on the interpretation and application of the
Treaty under Article 31(3)(a). It shows what they believe should happen as a matter of law, that all intra-EU BITs are captured
by the CJEU’s findings, and, to the extent an order of priority is needed, EU Member State obligations supersede those of the

Treaty.

‘7 Hearing, Day 2, 113:15-16.

'68 See Ravil. Latvia also refers to Commission v France, which is relied on to assert that if there is a rule which says “this is
EU law”, one cannot contract around it as the MEN clause purports to do.

315, Insofar as the Claimants argue that by way of the BIT’s MFN Clause, Article XIII(7)
of the Canada-Latvia BIT is incorporated into the BIT (which provides that a tribunal
should decide issues with regard to “applicable rules of international law”), or that other

treaties are similarly incorporated, Latvia makes the following responsive submissions:

 

(1) Latvia denies that the Canada-Latvia BIT could benefit the Claimants via the
MEN Clause or otherwise, as that BIT was terminated by CETA.!”° Latvia
explains that it only referred to the Canada-Latvia BIT in its Memorial on the
Bifurcated Objection to illustrate that, at the time of Latvia’s accession to the

EU, both the substantive and procedural protections available in the BIT and

 

the EU Treaties covered the same issues, and that issues such as trade in goods
and services as reflected by performance requirement provisions, can, in

principle, be within a BIT’s subject matter.

(2) Even if the Canada-Latvia BIT was relevant for MFN purposes, and its
provisions could be incorporated into the BIT, EU law would still apply to this
case since the Canada-Latvia BIT requires application of all “applicable rules
of international law.” It is thus not limited to the applicable international law
rules between Canada and Latvia. Indeed, as between the Claimants and the

Respondent, “applicable rules of international law” include EU law.

(3) The BIT’s MEN provisions cannot circumvent the application of EU law. It is
not possible for EU Member States to enter into inter se agreements that
contract out of EU law.!7! The incompatibility of an intra-EU BIT with EU law
cannot be cured. This is only possible for extra-EU BITs given Article 351 of
the TFEU. In the intra-EU context, any incompatibility with EU law means the

offending norm is automatically precluded from application.'””

(4) While the Shareholder Claimants also argue that through Article 3 of the BIT,
they can “invoke other applicable law provisions between Latvia and non-EU
States, which equally provide for the application of international law as between
Latvia and non-EU States,” they only refer (in their Post-Hearing Submissions)
to Article 9(5) of the Latvia~-Armenia BIT and Article 9(5) of the Latvia-Georgia
BIT. As with the Canada-Latvia BIT, those treaties’ applicable law clauses refer
to “applicable rules of international law” (not to applicable international law as
between the parties to that BIT). As such, to the extent that “applicable rules of

international law” was to be transposed to the BIT, it would include EU law.

Further, the Latvia-Armenia and Latvia-Georgia BITs, in Article 9(5) of each treaty,
include the “national laws and regulations of the Contracting Party” as part of the
applicable law. Hence, if the provisions on applicable law were incorporated in toto
into the BIT by way of Article 3, EU law, as a law that is incorporated into Latvian law,

would have to be taken into account by the Tribunal, as it arose in Achmea.

THE STATUS OF CJEU DECISIONS

(1) Introduction - Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU and 2, 4(3) and 19 of the
TEU

The Respondent relies on CJEU decisions as being sources of EU law under Article 19

of the TEU and Article 267 of the TFEU. Specifically, it relies on Achmea and the

CETA Opinion 1/17.

Latvia submits that the result of the conflict between the BIT and the autonomy of EU
law stemming from Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU as authoritatively interpreted by
the CJEU in Achmea and Opinion 1/17 as part of international law applicable to the
BIT, is that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction and the claims are inadmissible.
Alternatively, Latvia invokes Article 5 of the VCLT. The effect of these authorities is

that much of the BIT, specifically Article 8, is precluded.

17-20; CIEU, Commission of the European Communities v. Luxembourg, Case C-473/93, Judgement of 2 July 1996, RL-
00149, para. 40; Third Tridimas Report, paras. 54-58.

80

319, In contrast, the Claimants: put forward an expert opinion that Achmea was wrongly
decided;'’> that distinguishes the two cases; that asserts they are inapplicable because

EU law will not be interpreted but relied on as fact; that rejects the relevance of Article

 

5 of the VCLT; that contests the retroactive effect of the CJEU decisions; and that says
that Achmea should no longer be applicable because the BIT is no longer an intra-EU

BIT.

(2) Preclusion

a. Respondent’s submissions

 

320. Latvia’s position based on Achmea is that at least Article 8 of the BIT, as an investor-
state arbitration clause in an intra-EU BIT, has been precluded since Latvia acceded to
the EU on 1 May 2004.'” The basis of the preclusion is that Articles 267 and 344 of
the TFEU must be interpreted in light of the principles of mutual trust, sincere
cooperation!”> and judicial protection found in Articles 2, 4(3) and 19 of the TEU. The
Respondent says that CJEU judgments are sources of EU law under Article 19 of the
TEU and Article 267 of the TFEU.

321. The Respondent’s position based on Opinion 1/17'7° is that the incompatibilities
between EU law and the BIT are more wide-ranging than that which can be established
from Achmea alone. Taken together, Achmea and Opinion 1/17 establish that

essentially all provisions of the BIT are incompatible with EU law.

322. There is an incompatibility between the BIT and EU law in that Article 8 requires this

7

Tribunal to “interpret or indeed to apply” EU law,!”7 namely, a large number of

directives in respect of EU banking law.!”* This conflicts with the autonomy of EU law.

323, Latvia submits that for an “incompatibility” to arise between EU law and the BIT, there
is no need for “actual conflict.” The “potential” undermining of the effectiveness of EU
law is sufficient.!”? As per Achmea: the fact that a tribunal “may be called on to interpret
or indeed to apply EU law” is sufficient.'*° In this case, unlike in Achmea, the risk of
actual conflict is submitted to not only be possible, but actual, considering that this

dispute concerns banking law.

324. This Tribunal is not a court/tribunal of a Member State and cannot make a preliminary
reference to the CJEU. Nor is its award subject to control by a court or tribunal that
could make such a reference. As such, there would be no opportunity for the EU legal
system to correct any error of the Tribunal, which undermines the full effectiveness of

EU law.

325. Latvia further submits that Opinion 1/17 confirms that the BIT’s substantive provisions,
which include Article 8,'*! are incompatible with, and precluded by, EU law. Article 8
is incompatible with EU law, according to Latvia, as it does not contain important
safeguards to the autonomy of EU law. In contrast, CETA’s Chapter 8 has several
provisions ensuring that, while EU law may be taken into consideration as a fact, it is

not applicable law and cannot be interpreted or applied as such.!*?

326. Latvia submits that Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with EU law on the same basis
as Article 8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT, because of the absence of the availability
to the Tribunal of the preliminary ruling procedure in Article 267 of the TFEU.

327. The Respondent contends that the arbitration clause in this case, which only provides
for ICSID arbitration, is more incompatible with EU law than the arbitration clause in

Achmea, which allowed for a limited review of the award before an EU court. Even that

limited review was deemed insufficient by the CJEU to adequately protect the
autonomy of EU law. The CJEU still held there that the investor-state tribunal was not
a “court” in the EU for the purpose of the EU Treaties.'*? It was material, says Latvia,
that it was impossible to request a preliminary ruling under Article 267 of the TFEU.'**
Here, the ICSID tribunal is further removed from the EU legal order than an
UNCITRAL tribunal seated in Frankfurt, Germany.

328. The Respondent also invokes Article 19 of the TEU to argue that the Claimants benefit
from the right to effective legal protection under that Article, being able to pursue their
claim subject to the control of the CJEU (as confirmed by the Declaration).'*° The
Respondent says that under EU law, the CJEU is vested with the exclusive prerogative
to offer authoritative interpretations of EU law. As enabled by Article 5 of the VCLT,
the EU Treaties clearly establish this right of the CJEU in Article 19 of the TEU. It is
submitted that the protection of this exclusive right of the CJEU to offer such
interpretations of EU law lies at the core of the principle of autonomy of EU law, which
must be respected as a matter of international law, not only because Article 5 of the
VCLT allows the EU to do so, but also because it represents the clear will of EU
Member States. Latvia submits that the CJEU, as final and binding interpreter of EU
law pursuant to its powers granted under Article 19 of the TEU, has developed the
principles of primacy and autonomy which are clearly “rules of the organization [the

EU]” on treaty law.

329. Latvia submits that investment treaty tribunals including Vattenfall have held that
primary and secondary EU law, as interpreted by the CJEU, is international law. If the
EU law is not a source of international law proper, it is part of relevant international
law relating the Treaty’s interpretation.'** The EU Treaties take precedence over
international obligations of the Member States amongst themselves, such as the Treaty.

This is consistent with CJEU case law, Article 19 TEU, and the primacy principle as

'S3 Achmea, para. 49.

'S4 Achmea, para. 49.

'85 On this point, the Respondent cites the 15 January 2019 Declaration in support which itself cites the Judgment
in Associagdo Sindical dos Juizes Portugueses, C-64/16, EU:C:2018:117, Judgment, 27 February 2018, paras. 31 to 37.
Regarding the CJEU, Article 19 of the TEU provides: “1. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall include the Court
of Justice, the General Court and specialised courts. It shall ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the
law is observe:
'86 Vattenfall, paras. 141, 148 (“Since the ECJ is empowered by the EU Treaties to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation
of EU law, including the EU Treaties (see Article 19 TEU and Article 267 TFEU), the Tribunal considers the ECJ Judgment’s
interpretation of the EU Treaties likewise to constitute a part of the relevant international law.”).

recognised in the Declarations, in addition to Declaration 17 to the Lisbon Treaty in

2007.

The EU Treaties take precedence over international obligations of the Member States
amongst themselves, such as the BIT. This is consistent with CJEU case law, Article

19 of the TEU, and Declaration 17 to the Lisbon Treaty of 2007.

Latvia submits that the Declaration should also be taken into account under Article
31(3)(a)-(b) of the VCLT, as an agreement on the interpretation of the BIT by the UK
and Latvia, or their subsequent practice in its application establishing their agreement

regarding its interpretation.

Latvia contends that the Declaration confirms that the UK and Latvia accept the
consequences of Achmea, namely that the provision of a bilateral agreement between

two Member States that is incompatible with EU law is inapplicable and precluded.

b. Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s arguments, in various respects.

The Claimants do not accept that the consequence of consent having been given in
breach of EU law (which they deny) is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. Achmea does
not convey that that is the consequence. The Claimants rely for their argument on the

following opinion of Lord Neuberger:!*”

In particular, I do not agree that breach by Latvia (or the UK) of
the “rules internal to the EU as an international organization,
which govern the relationship between the Member States and
the EU as a creature of international law”, such as TFEU Articles
267 and 344, in offering arbitration to the Cl.
consequence of depriving the Tribunal of jw
international law. The consequence, if Achmea is correct and
applies here, seems to be that, by continuing to make its standing
offer of arbitration to UK investors in Latvia by Article 8 of the
UK-Latvia BIT, Latvia was from its accession to the EU in 2004
in breach of Article 344, and can be held responsible by the EU
and its fellow Member States for such breach. But that does not
alter the fact that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the
arbitration agreement that Latvia and the Claimants actually
made. If, for instance, there had been a treaty between Latvia and
another country which included a provision that Latvia would

  

'87 Second Neuberger Report, para. 32.

84

335.

336.

337.

not agree to arbitrate investor claims, that would be an
international arrangement binding on Latvia, but it could not
invalidate the present arbitration agreement, even though the
agreement would be a violation by Latvia of the treaty with the
other country. I do not see why the fact that Latvia has made
such a Treaty with the UK, of which the Claimants are nationals,
along with 27 other countries should justify a different result.

Further, the Claimants insist that the alleged “‘incompatibilities” between EU law and
the BIT are of the Respondent’s own making. Latvia could have notified other ICSID
Contracting States that it does not consent to ICSID arbitration for certain classes of
disputes under Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention (such as e.g. banking disputes),
but it has not done so. Latvia could also have insisted on the exhaustion of local
remedies as a precondition of recourse to ICSID arbitration, under Article 26 of the
ICSID Convention. This would have allowed a “judicial dialogue” between its domestic
courts and the CJEU pursuant to Article 267 of the TFEU. Yet it has not done so. The
fact that Latvia has not made use, even today, of these provisions of the ICSID
Convention corroborates that its consent to ICSID arbitration in the BIT remained intact

upon its accession to the EU.

The Claimants submit that, even if Achmea stood for the preclusion of the application
of the BIT “as a matter of EU law”, that would not evidence that the application of the
BIT is precluded as a matter of public international law. It is perfectly possible, say the
Claimants, as is recognised in the jurisprudence of the CJEU, that EU law precludes
the application of a legal instrument whereas public international law simultaneously
mandates its application.'** Achmea does not deprive investors of the rights derived

from the BIT under international law.

The Claimants clarify their position and confirm that they do not say that Article 11 of
the BIT prevents “preclusion” of Article 8 of the BIT for the purposes of EU law (the
issue in Achmea). The Claimants’ argument is that, notwithstanding any preclusion,
Article 8 of the BIT remains applicable for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and general international law. The Claimants emphasise that this issue was

not contemplated by the CJEU in Achmea, and the issue has to be decided here.

Further, if the applicable law in this case (cf Article 8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT)
under the Respondent’s reasoning is Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT or Article 42 of the

ICSID Convention, then it is those provisions that are precluded, and not the BIT.

The Claimants reject Latvia’s reliance on the Declaration. They cite Professor
Tridimas’ expert report'*? for the purposes of arguing that the Declaration cannot add
anything to the Achmea judgment, since Member States are not competent to provide
conclusive interpretations of EU law notwithstanding what may be purported or how
they intend to apply Achmea ‘in the future.’ The prerogative to issue authoritative
interpretations of EU law is conferred on the CJEU.'” The Declaration is a self-serving
and irrelevant expression of the Respondent’s views (even if shared by the UK) and

nothing more.

(3) Autonomy
a. Respondent’s submissions

Flowing from Achmea, Latvia submits that there is an incompatibility between the
autonomy of EU law and Article 8 of the BIT, as Article 8 would require this Tribunal
to “interpret and apply” a large number of resolutions and directives, particularly as

implemented in respect of EU banking law.

Opinion 1/17 on the compatibility of the CETA’s investment chapter with EU law
recalls that the autonomy of EU law will be sufficiently protected in circumstances set
out at paragraph 119 of the Opinion.'®! Factoring in Opinion 1/17, Latvia asserts that

there are certain additional conflicts presented by the BIT and the autonomy of EU law.

One such conflict is that essentially the entire B/T (as an intra-EU BIT) is in conflict

with the autonomy of EU law. As the CJEU said in Opinion 1/1 7,!°2 EU Member States,

 

or the EU, can conclude investment protection treaties, but there need to be adequate
substantive safeguards to protect the autonomy of EU law. According to Latvia,
referring to Opinion 1/17, the CETA has the following safeguards which were held

sufficient: general exceptions (para. 152), the right to regulate is confirmed (para. 154),

'89 Second Tridimas Report, para. 268.

'% Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 26 October 2012, RL-00123, Article 43,

there is an obligation not to lower standards (para. 155), there is an annex on indirect
expropriation (para. 157) and fair and equitable treatment being exhaustively defined
(para. 158). There are no such substantive safeguards in the BIT. In their absence, the
BIT’s substantive provisions are incompatible with, and precluded by, EU law. Further,
whereas Article 8 (and Article 9) of the BIT is incompatible with EU law for failing to
contain important safeguards to the autonomy of EU law, CETA’s Chapter 8 has several
provisions ensuring that while EU law may be taken into consideration as a fact, it is

not applicable law, and cannot be interpreted or applied as such.'%>

The Respondent submits that a further conflict is raised in Opinion 1/17, namely, a
threat to the autonomy of EU institutions specifically (or balance of institutional power
within the EU), here the ECB as joint supervisor, and the BIT does not ensure that that

risk is sufficiently protected.!%4

The FCMC has requested, because of inter alia this ICSID proceeding, a change of
supervision. The Respondent says that it is clear that this proceeding has had an effect

on the institutional power balance within the EU system.

The Respondent highlights that Advocate General Wathelet in Achmea recognised that
an intra-EU BIT arbitration under the ICSID Convention would threaten the autonomy
of EU law.'°> Latvia contends that the incompatibility of an intra-EU BIT with EU law
will be more important in an ICSID arbitration than an UNCITRAL one, as ICSID
proceedings have no connection to domestic courts, which prevents any request to the

CJEU for a preliminary ruling, even on annulment.

During the Hearing, Arbitrator Townsend asked Latvia’s counsel whether Opinion 1/17
would make the ICSID Convention incompatible with EU law. The Response of
Latvia’s counsel was “no,”!°° because CETA allows for claims to be submitted under

the ICSID Convention and Rules as well as the ICSID Additional Facility Rules and

the UNCITRAL Rules. The CJEU in Opinion 1/17 must have considered the issue.
Moreover, Achmea never ruled that the UNCITRAL Rules were incompatible with EU
law. Nor can the ICSID Rules be incompatible with EU law in and of themselves, since
another instrument of consent is needed, be it a contract, an investment treaty or

investment law.

b. Claimants’ submissions

347. The Claimants maintain that the principle of autonomy of the EU legal order, which
Latvia identifies as the principle allegedly infringed by its offer to arbitrate this dispute
in accordance with the ICSID Convention, is not a conflict rule of public international
law. Achmea does not support the existence of such a rule.'*” The principle of autonomy
is a principle of the constitutional system of the EU. This is also said to be confirmed

by the CETA Opinion.'*

348. The Claimants assert through authorities including Kadi and Eskosol, that while the EU
legal order is of a transnational dimension,'” and while the EU has primacy over the

national laws of EU Member States, it does not prevail over independent rules of

international law.?°°

349, The Claimants note Latvia’s reliance on the CETA Opinion,”*! which Latvia cites for
the purposes of arguing that safeguards for the substantive interpretation of investment

treaty provisions are necessary to preserve the autonomy of EU law.

350. However, even if the CJEU’s findings in the CETA Opinion applied to treaties
concluded by Member States, it would still not follow that the powers conferred upon
this Tribunal are precluded by EU law. This Tribunal derives its existence and its

powers from the Instruments of Consent.

'7 The Claimants argue that Achmea suggests the opposite, namely, that an infer se international agreement between two
Member States might apply irrespective of whether they are contrary to EU law.

(4) International Organisations - Article 5 of the VCLT
a. Respondent’s submissions

Latvia emphasises the following words from Article 5 of the VCLT in its submissions:

The present Convention applies to any treaty which is the

constituent instrument of an international organization and to

any treaty adopted within an international organization without

prejudice to any relevant rules of the organization.
Latvia invokes Article 5 of the VCLT, which it says reflects general international
law,” for the purposes of confirming the legitimacy and superiority of “rules of the

organization” i.e. the EU, which include CJEU judgments interpreting the EU Treaties.

Article 5 of the VCLT establishes that the relevant EU rules will apply, to the exclusion
of the other VCLT rules where there is a conflict, to treaties that constitute an
international organisation or rules that are adopted within an international organisation.
Article 5 of the VCLT applies “without prejudice” to any relevant organisational treaty
rules, including the “primacy principle”, which extends to inter-se international
agreements between EU Member States. The CJEU’s role is to interpret and apply EU

law in the relationship between Member States and their nationals.7°

Accordingly, it is contended, when examining whether there was a valid offer to
arbitrate from Latvia that could be accepted by the Claimants under Article 8 of the
BIT, the Tribunal must interpret and apply EU law which is the /ex superior in
comparison to the BIT. Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT requires the Tribunal to take into
account the EU Treaties and EU law, while Article 5 of the VCLT confirms that
relevant rules of the law of treaties supersede the other VCLT rules whether as a matter

of interpretation, application or conflict.

b. Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants reject Latvia’s arguments on the basis that the BIT and the ICSID

Convention are not constituent EU instruments, nor were they adopted within the EU.

20s

The BIT was adopted outside the EU, at a time when only one party was a Member
State. Indeed, each of the Instruments of Consent predates Latvia’s accession to the EU,

and the EU had no role in their conclusion.

Citing Professor Talmon’s reports and material therein, the Claimants argue that a
treaty qualifies as being adopted within the EU when it is adopted “by an organ of the

organisation,” not when it is adopted just by two Member States.*** Further, the
relevant rules of the organisation apply and take precedence over the general rules of
the VCLT “only within the self-contained legal order of the international

organization.”?°>

The Claimants submit that the ICSID Convention is not a constituent instrument of the

EU. It is of the ICSID.

Likewise, the BIT is not a treaty enacted within the EU as an international organisation.
Instead, it is a treaty that can be construed as being enacted within the context of the

ICSID, as a result of the reference to ICSID dispute settlement.

(5) The Authority of Achmea and Opinion 1/17

As the Tribunal has noted above, the Claimants assert that Achmea and Opinion 1/17,
even if accepted as applicable law, do not result in depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction
under the BIT on the basis of the answers for which they contend to the following four

questions:
a. Is Achmea Distinguishable?

b. Is Opinion 1/17 Distinguishable?

c. Will the Tribunal Interpret EU Law or Apply it as Fact?

d. Do Achmea and Opinion 1/17 Apply Retroactively?

364,

a. Is Achmea Distinguishable?
(i) Claimants’ Submissions

The Claimants’ position is that the Instruments of Consent and this arbitration are

clearly distinguishable from Achmea on at least three grounds.

First, and, critically, the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT provided for arbitration under the
UNCITRAL Rules, whereas this Tribunal is constituted under the ICSID Convention.
A Tribunal constituted under the UNCITRAL Rules will be anchored in, and derive its
existence from, the domestic legal system of its seat; its /ex arbitri will be domestic
law. This Tribunal is not subject to any domestic legal systems and derives its existence

from public international law.2°°

Secondly, Achmea is applicable law-specific. Unlike the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT, the
BIT does not contain an analogous applicable law provision, thus the rationale of
Achmea does not apply?*’ While Latvia says that EU law is applicable under Article 42
of the ICSID Convention or Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, the law applicable to this
dispute is the BIT (Articles 11 and/or 3), not EU law. Further, EU law does not contain
any rules on the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals. In addition, if Latvia was correct that
Articles 42 of the ICSID Convention and Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT were applicable
law provisions so as to render EU law applicable to the merits and Achmea applicable
to the BIT, then those Articles, not the BIT, would be contrary to and “precluded” by
EU law.

Achmea did not address any provisions of the relevant BIT other than the dispute
resolution clause. It does not impose an obligation on this Tribunal to decline
jurisdiction which pertains to a different BIT under the self-contained ICSID

208 and in circumstances where this

Convention, which is delocalised from EU law,
Tribunal is not called upon to apply EU law to the merits. Further, applying Achmea to
disrupt the carefully crafted arrangement under the multilateral ICSID Convention

would impact upon the rights of third contracting states under the ICSID Convention?”

206 Similarly to the Cube Infrastructure Tribunal: see Cube Infrastructure, para. 144

207 In this regard, the Claimants note that the Strabag tribunal did not need to consider whether, in light of the absence of an
applicable law provision, Article 8 of the Austria-Poland BIT is a provision “such as” Article 8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands
BIT.

208 See e.g. Cube Infrastructure, paras. 144-146.
2 Cf Vattenfall, paras. 155-156; Eskosol, para. 125; see also UP and C.D v Hungary Award.

91

365.

Even if Achmea stood for the preclusion of the application of the BIT “as a matter of
EU law”, that would still not evidence that the application of the BIT is precluded as a
matter of public international law.?!° Nothing in Achmea conveys that any rule or

principle stated therein would be a rule or principle of public international law.”!!

366. The Claimants submit that Achmea does not demonstrate the existence of a conflict rule

of public international law. The Achmea award was annulled by the Bundesgerichtshof

on German law grounds, not on public international law grounds.?!?

The principle of
autonomy of the EU legal order, which Latvia identifies as the principle allegedly
infringed by its offer to arbitrate this dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention,
is not a conflict rule of public international law. The Bundesgerichtshof also held that

213

the Achmea judgment “does not constitute a general rule of international law.

367. At most, say the Claimants, Achmea supports the proposition that Member States and

their courts have a duty, for the purposes of EU law, not to continue to apply inter-State
agreements that are contrary to EU law. Such a duty, if it existed, and if it applied
mutatis mutandis to the BIT, does not apply to this Tribunal. It does not follow from
Achmea that agreements that have actually been applied, despite being “precluded”,

would not be “applicable” for the purposes of public international law.

368. Thirdly, in their Fourth Post Hearing Submissions, the Claimants emphasised that the

BIT is no longer an intra-EU BIT, thus any comparison to Achmea is inapposite. If
Article 8 of the BIT is “suspended”, as Latvia contends, then it should be “revived” as

the alleged incompatibility is resolved.?!*

(ii) Respondent's Submissions

369. In Achmea the CJEU held that an investor-state arbitration clause found in an intra-EU

 

BIT “such as” the one found in Article 8(6) of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT was
incompatible with the principle of autonomy of EU law as well as with the principle of

215

loyal and sincere cooperation between EU Member States.*'” Latvia contends that

because Article 8 of the BIT is a provision “such as” Article 8(6) of the Slovakia-
Netherlands BIT,?'* it is precluded on the basis of Achmea.

In Achmea, the CJEU found an incompatibility between Article 8 of the Slovakia-
Netherlands BIT and the autonomy of EU law, because the applicable law provision in

the BIT required the tribunal to rule based on “the law,” “taking into account” both “the

law in force in the Contracting Party concerned” (Slovakian law) and “the provisions
of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties.”?!”
For the CJEU, a tribunal constituted under the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT would be

required to interpret and/or apply EU law on this “twofold basis”.?!®

The Respondent contends that in this case, the second aspect of such “twofold basis”
(“other relevant Agreements between the Parties”) is applicable because Article
31(3)(c) of the VCLT requires exactly the same,”!” i.e., to take into account relevant
rules of international law applicable in the relationship between the UK and Latvia,

including “Agreements” in force between the UK and Latvia such as the EU Treaties.

 

Accordingly, Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with EU law on the same ba S
Article 8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT, because of the absence of the availability to
the arbitral Tribunal of the preliminary ruling procedure found in Article 267 of the

TFEU.

In the Respondent’s view, the fact that this case is an ICSID arbitration is not a

distinguishing factor which justifi

 

s a finding that Article 8 of the BIT is not precluded
by EU law. To the contrary, that Article 8 of the BIT only allows for ICSID arbitration
renders Article 8 more incompatible with EU law than Article 8 of the Slovakia-
Netherlands BIT. While the latter allowed for limited review of the award before an EU
court, such review was deemed insufficient by the CJEU in Achmea to adequately
protect the autonomy of EU law. The investor-state tribunal there was still held to not
be a “court” in the EU for the purpose of the EU Treaties.””° It was material in Achmea

that it was impossible to request a preliminary ruling under Article 267 of the TFEU.”!

al

Here, the ICSID tribunal is further removed from the EU legal order than an
UNCITRAL tribunal seated in Frankfurt, Germany.

The Respondent submits that this case cannot be distinguished from Achmea on the

basi

 

s that Article 8 of the BIT has no applicable law clause. For an incompatibility to
arise between EU law and the BIT, actual conflict is not necessary, only the potential

222

undermining of the effectiveness of EU law is necessary.*”* Since this is an EU banking
dispute, Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with the autonomy of EU law in the same

fashion as there was an incompatibility in Achmea.

Latvia states that the Declaration confirms that the UK and Latvia accept the
consequences of Achmea, namely that the provision of a bilateral agreement between

two Member States that is incompatible with EU law is precluded and thus inapplicable.

b. Is Opinion 1/17 Distinguishable?
(i) Claimants’ Submissions

The Claimants submit that the CJEU in the CETA Opinion was making pronouncements
on the consequences of international agreements concluded by the Union, not by

Member States.

According to the Claimants, the CETA Opinion does not apply to ICSID Tribunals
notwithstanding Latvia’s assertions to the contrary. Latvia says that in the CETA
Opinion, “the CJEU held that safeguards for the substantive interpretation of
investment treaty provisions are necessary to preserve the autonomy of EU law”, and
that “[t]he threat to the autonomy of EU law will exist where interpretations of the EU
and its Member States’ international obligations risk forcing Member States to change
conduct that was otherwise compatible with EU law and the investment treaty
provisions”. In support of this contention, Latvia cites the following finding of the

CJEU:?3

If the Union were to enter into an international agreement
capable of having the consequence that the Union — or a
Member State in the course of implementing EU law — has to
amend or withdraw legislation because of an assessment made

by a tribunal standing outside the EU judicial system of the level
of protection of a public interest established, in accordance with
the EU constitutional framework, by the EU institutions, it
would have to be concluded that such an agreement undermines
the capacity of the Union to operate autonomously within its
unique constitutional framework.

In response, the Claimants say that the underlined words above clarify that the CIEU
made pronouncements on the consequences of international agreements concluded by
the Union, not by the Member States. Even if the CJEU’s findings apply to treaties
concluded by Member States, it would still not follow that the powers conferred on this
Tribunal are precluded under EU law. The Tribunal derives its existence from the
Instruments of Consent. Its powers, express or implied, stem from the Instruments of
Consent. Similarly, Member States’ obligations to enforce ICSID awards, and to
comply with recommendations for provisional measures by ICSID Tribunals, are based
on the ICSID Convention. Latvia’s obligations to that effect are owed to all ICSID
Contracting States and to ICSID itse/f. They squarely fall under Article 351 of the
TFEU.™

The Claimants reject the suggestion that their claims threaten or can alter the autonomy
of EU institutions. This arbitration has not interfered with the ECB’s conduct, nor with
the FCMC’s conduct. To the contrary, the ECB’s and FCMC’s conduct resulted in the

Bank’s operations being suspended.

In so far as Latvia argues that this Tribunal can “threaten” or alter the autonomy of EU
institutions in reliance on the CETA Opinion, the Claimants reject this. The CETA
Opinion is authority that tribunals outside the EU legal order cannot make awards that
might prevent EU institutions from operating in accordance with the EU constitutional
framework. The CJEU confirmed this in opining on the compatibility of the ISDS
mechanism of the CETA:?*

On the other hand, since those Tribunals stand outside the EU
judicial system, they cannot have the power to interpret or apply
provisions of EU law other than those of the CETA or to make
awards that might have the effect of preventing the EU

 

24 The Claimants rely on Third Tridimas Report, para. 52 (“Article 35 1(1) seeks to ensure that international law obligations

undertaken by the Member States vis-d

's third countries before they acceded to the EU remain valid under EU law.”). The

 

e

 

Claimants submit that Latvia’s agreement to confer express and implied powers on ICSID Tribunals constitutes such an
obligation which is preserved by Article 351 of the TFEU even for the purposes of EU law.

institutions from operating in accordance with the EU
itutional framework.

 

It is the Claimants’ submission that this statement applies mutatis mutandis to the

present Tribunal. Unlike the Tribunal in Achmea, this Tribunal stands outside the EU

 

judicial system. This Tribunal’s award will not be issued under any domestic law, and
it will not prevent any EU institution from operating in accordance with the EU

constitutional framework.

The Claimants submit that even if the Tribunal considers that Article 11 of the BIT is
insufficient to render EU law inapplicable, Article 8 of the Canada-Latvia BIT, for
instance, is availing, since that Article provides that “{a] tribunal established under this
Article shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and
applicable rules of international law”.?”° As Latvia itself confirms, the Canada-Latvia

BIT “would not allow for the interpretation or application of EU law.”””

(ii) Respondent's Submissions

Latvia asserts that it stems from Opinion 1/17 that the autonomy of EU institutions,
such as the ECB, within their competences, cannot be threatened or altered by
investment treaty tribunals. The facts of this case clearly establish an incompatibility
between the BIT and EU law. Opinion 1/17 holds that there will be a threat to the

autonomy of EU law where:??*

the envisaged ISDS mechanism ... does not structure the powers
of [investment treaty] tribunals in such a way that, while not
themselves engaging in the interpretation or application of rules
of EU law other than those of that agreement, they may issue
awards which have the effect of preventing the EU institutions
from operating in accordance with the EU constitutional
framework.

According to Latvia, there will be such a threat in any investment treaty claim in the
banking sector concerning Eurozone banks, as such banks are jointly supervised by the

national supervisor and the ECB under the SSM Regulation and SSM Framework

6 For the avoidance of any doubt, the Claimants note that their reliance on the Canada-Latvia BIT is residual, and is relevant

only in the event the Tribunal rejects their reliance upon the South Korea-Latvia BIT, the Armenia-Latvia BIT and the

 

jeorgia-

Latvia BIT in the context of the law applicable to jurisdiction and the admissibility of their claims.

Regulation,””’ and a claim regarding such banks may change the allocation of powers
between the national supervisor and the ECB. The Respondent submits that the change

of the Bank’s

 

supervisor in the middle of the present proceedings crystallized such a

threat.

The Respondent elaborates that an award on the merits in this case would very likely
prevent EU institutions, notably the CJEU, from operating within the EU’s
constitutional framework. That is because a number of questions at issue are likely to

be directly within the CJEU’s jurisdiction itself. There is also no explicit limit to what

 

remedy the Tribunal may order,?°° while in CETA’s investment chapter, the powers of

the investment court are limited to granting compensation.?*!

Moreover, there is a much greater risk here that, without guidance on the interpretation
of ‘fair and equitable treatment,’ an annex on ‘indirect expropriation’ and general
exceptions applicable to all obligations, the BIT will be interpreted in a manner more

threatening for the autonomy of EU law than CETA’s investment protections.

c. Will the Tribunal Interpret EU Law or Apply it as Fact?
(i) Claimants’ Submissions

The Claimants submit that to the extent that EU law is relevant it can only be relevant
as fact. However, a consideration of EU law as fact does not render the BIT
incompatible with EU law, as confirmed by the CETA Opinion. The CETA Opinion
confirms that consideration of EU law as fact does not engage Achmea.?** Nor will it

breach Article 344 of the TFEU, as confirmed in Eskosol2**

As stated earlier, nor is there inconsistency, say the Claimants, when, for example, the
ECHR does not decline jurisdiction when adjudicating claims against EU Member

States, notwithstanding the “primacy” of EU law.

law, does not engage Achmea.

389. A consideration by this Tribunal of EU law as fact, relevant to considering whether
there have been violations of the public international law standards in the BIT, also

does not breach Article 344 of the TFEU, as confirmed in Eskosol.2**

(ii) Respondent's Submissions

390. Latvia’s argument is that EU law applies to the merits in this case. It is directly
applicable to banking. In its Memorial and Reply on the Bifurcated Objection, the
Respondent set out a detailed list of EU law which it says may have to be interpreted
or applied to the merits in this case. The Respondent asserts that EU law may also arise

in respect of corruption allegations.

391. The Respondent highlights that while the Claimants allege various breaches of the BIT,
the underlying situation nevertheless concerns mostly the FCMC’s regulation of the
Bank. To examine the merits of the case, the Tribunal will have to interpret and apply
at least a number of EU Regulations and EU directives, Latvian law implementing the
EU directives, and the EU SSM Regulation and ECB SSM Framework Regulation.2*°
The banking factor leads to the conclusion that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction and that

ible.

 

the claim is inadmi

to certain criminal offences. Article 83(1) of the TFEU empowers the EU to adopt
directives providing minimum harmonisation for serious crimes, including corruption.

d. Do Achmea and Opinion 1/17 Apply Retroactively?
(i) Claimants’ submissions

In opening submissions at the Hearing, counsel for the Claimants, Dr Sinclair,
submitted that the Claimants, through their lodgement of the RFA on 14 December
2017, accepted Latvia’s standing offer of arbitration which had never been withdrawn
or suspended up until that time. At that point in time, he contended, “consent to ICSID
arbitration had been perfected”.?7

Nevertheless, Latvia seeks to assert that its consent was somehow retrospectively
“precluded,” and precluded when Latvia joined the EU in 2004 by virtue of the
judgment in Achmea. Latvia’s argument was said to be “based on a legal fiction.”** In

the Claimants’ submission:??

The Vienna Convention does not allow a state to invoke a legal
fiction, the declaratory retroactive theory of law, in order to
declare that consent previously given is no longer valid,
especially in the context of an ongoing litigation proceeding.

The Claimants’ submission is that EU law principles cannot be invoked to defeat

 

consent to arbitration because this Tribunal derives its existence from Article 8 of the
BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention,” not from the legal orders of the UK,
Latvia or the EU. The declaratory approach is inconsistent with Article 25(1), which

prevents the unilateral withdrawal of consent to ICSID arbitration.2"!

The Claimants maintain that pursuant to Article 69(2) of the VCLT, even if EU law
applied to Article 8 of the BIT, as Latvia asserts, to declare Article 8 invalid would not
deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. Pursuant to Article 69(2) of the VCLT, where acts

have been performed in reliance on a treaty in good faith before the invalidity was

invoked, they are not considered unlawful simply because of the treaty’s invalidity.°

397. The Claimants also invoked Article 42 of the VCLT which provides:

(1) The validity of a treaty or of the consent of a State to be bound
by a treaty may be impeached only through the application of the
present Convention.

(2) The termination of a treaty, its denunciation or the withdrawal of
a party, may take place only as a result of the application of the
provisions of the treaty or the present Convention. The same rule
applies to suspension of the operation of a treaty.

398. In opening submissions, counsel for the Claimants submitted, in the context of Latvia’s
reliance on the proposition that the BIT or relevant provisions thereof were only

suspended, not terminated, that:

Article 42 of the Vienna Convention confirms that Latvia’s
consent to be bound by the treaty may be impeached only
through the application of the Vienna Convention itself and
whether it withdrew such consent must also be assessed under
the Vienna Convention Rules. Latvia’s consent ...has not been
impeached or withdrawn or suspended in accordance with the
standards and procedures that must be followed in the Vienna
Convention.....”243

  

 

399, Counsel for the Claimants also asked rhetorically: “How can a right be suspended with

retroactive effect?”

400. The Claimants emphasise that the alleged lack of consent was not manifest in the text
of the BIT, nor was it apparent in the contemporaneous conduct of the EU and Member

States.

401. In this regard, the Eskosol tribunal indicated that it was not until the Achmea decision

at the earliest, that it could have been said that investors were placed on notice about

the risks of relying upon Member States’ apparent consent in BITs.?4°

The Claimants contend that the “rules of EU law” cannot deprive UK nationals and
companies of their direct rights under the BIT and the ICSID Convention citing for
instance Wirtgen at paragraphs 254-256.74° The Claimants note that international law

does not condone the deprivation of an individual’s acquired rights.” They also rely

 

on Burgoa (which Latvia also relies on) for the proposition that rights conferred on
individuals are not affected by the EU law rules on pre-existing international

agreements.”*

According to the Claimants, from Latvia’s accession to the EU in 2004, until after this
dispute commenced, at no time did it indicate that it regarded Article 8 of the BIT as

incompatible with EU law. Nor did it seek an EU court opinion on the matter.

On the contrary, Latvia consented to arbitration in Article 8 of the BIT, and that consent
was relied on by the Claimants as perfected by the Notice of Arbitration. Under Article
25 of the ICSID Convention, “no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.” Counsel

for the Claimants submitted:

Article 25(1)...excludes the retroactive application of any later

effort by any means, by judicial, by executive, by legislative, or

by treaty means to withdraw that consent.””4°
Further Article 26 of the ICSID Convention provides that the parties’ consent to ICSID
arbitration shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the
exclusion of any other remedy. The Claimants contend that this rule imposes an
obligation on all contracting parties to the ICSID Convention to decline jurisdiction
once an ICSID arbitration has been commenced.?*° Moreover, invoking Achmea to
disrupt this arrangement would impact the rights of many other Contracting States

under the ICSID Convention.?*!

With respect to the Declaration, the Claimants contend that it cannot extinguish

Latvia’s consent to ICSID arbitration. They rely on the expert report of Professor

These matters were referred to above in the Declaration section.

(ii) Respondent's Submissions

During openings, President Spigelman asked Latvia to consider in closing submissions
whether the Tribunal, on a jurisdictional issue, should acknowledge the retrospective
effect of the CJEU’s judgment in Achmea under the various provisions of the VCLT

which reflect the general principle against retrospectivity.°>

Mr Savoie responded in closing that the Tribunal should note Professor Tridimas’ oral
presentation that the CJEU can indicate in a judgment that it does not have retrospective
effect, but it did not do so in Achmea.?™4 The CJEU’s interpretation applies through
time, he submitted, confirming that Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU as interpreted in
light of Articles 2, 4(3) and 19 of the TEU preclude investor-state arbitration clauses in
intra-EU BITs.

 

55 The Respondent said further that the issue of retroactivity which is
raised by Article 28 of the VCLT concerns the application of a treaty before its entry
into force. It was contended that this is a different matter to the interpretation issue
under consideration.?%°

Professor Tridimas’ submission was that EU law permits retroactive revocation of
consent. At the hearing, Arbitrator Townsend asked him whether the doctrine of
primacy of EU law permits retroactive revocation of the standing underlying consent

to arbitrate under the ICSID Convention. Professor Tridimas responded as follows:?°”

The answer is...yes, it does... how do we get there? We get there
because the obligations that flow for Member States when they
act by concluding international agreements between them, these
obligations are derived by the EU treaties.

How do we know about them? We know about them when the
European Court of Justice interprets those treaties. So it is a
matter of interpretation of the treaty. The orthodox view goes,
this interpretation is conducted by the European Court of Justice
because the Member States have given to it the exclusive power

102

to do so under Article 344. The European Court of Justice does
not make the law. It tells us what the law -- how the law ought
to have been understood since the provision which it interprets
came into force. So the judgment applies ex tunc and not ex
nunc.

Now, to alleviate that, the adverse consequences that might be
created, the Court of Justice in some cases limits the retroactive
effect of its rulings, and it has done so in some cases. So it did in
a case, for example, decided back in the 1990s, about pension
rights. It came to the conclusion that certain pension rights are
covered by the principle of gender equality, and that had
enormous economic repercussions because it meant that pension
funds had to pay out monies to female workers which were not
covered by contributions, and simply there wouldn’t be enough
money in the kitty.

So what the Court of Justice did was to say the ruling cannot be
taken advantage of by anyone who has not brought proceedings
before the judgment was delivered. So it is a kind of different
form of perspective of the ruling as it could be understood in US
law.

The rules that apply on this is that a party to the proceedings -- I
was going to say a party to the proceedings must ask for it, but I
think I may be wrong, I think the Court of Justice might do that
in its own motion in some cases. But the case law states that the
court can only do it in the judgment where it delivers, as it were,
a novel ruling. It cannot do it subsequently. It cannot come in
another judgment and say: my previous judgment will now only
apply prospectively. Which begs the question, why did the court
not do it in Achmea? My view on that is because I don’t think
Achmea is an innovative judgment. I think Achmea flows from
the previous -- from a long line of cases that go back to 1963,
essentially, but which have been developed particularly in the
2000s, going back to the Opinion 1/91, that's the first one where
the court took issue with alternative dispute resolution systems,
so I think what we experience is an incremental development of
the case law, but I don’t think that the ruling in Achmea could
be said to be unpredictable.

410. On the question of acquired or vested rights, Latvia rejects the Claimants’ invocation

of the doctrine.2** According to the Respondent, the doctrine is inapplicable to the

Claimants’ present situation since the question of “vested rights” and how such rights

258 Latvia notes the doctrine was also invoked by the Eskosol (RL-00189, para. 226) and Addiko v Croatia tribunals (CL-287
or RL-00419, para. 290).

103

may be protected by international law arises only after a change of the applicable legal

regime, for example through a succession of States or through a change of

sovereignty.” Here, the intra-EU Objection, as it applies to whether the Claimants
could invoke the BIT in December 2017 in respect of an investment made in Latvia in

2013, has nothing to do with the continuity of rights following a change of legal

regimes. The change of regime occurred on 1 May 2004, when Latvia acceded to the

EU, well before the 2013 investment. This is aside from Latvia’s argument that Mr

Guselnikov was a Russian national in 2013, becoming a UK national in 2015. Further,

Latvia asserts that there is no universal rule of international law preventing the ex tunc

applications of law,”® which is consistent with the EU law rule that incompatible inter

se agreements between Member States become incompatible as of the time that all
relevant States become Member States. Latvia also cites a 2017 study to argue that there
is no general or regional rule regarding respect for acquired rights.?°!

411. Latvia also refers to Addiko v Croatia for the proposition that the Addiko tribunal failed
inter alia to consider or accept that a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of EU law
applies retrospectively as “it clarifies and defines the scope of the rule of EU law in
question as it ought to have been understood and applied from the time of its coming
into force.” According to Latvia, the text “in force at any given time” in Article 11(2)
of the Austria-Croatia BIT,?® should have been interpreted as meaning EU law (or the
legal acquis of the EU) in force between Austria and Croatia during the time they are
both EU Member States, including the preclusion of rules incompatible with EU law

found in inter se agreements in force between Austria and Croatia as EU Member

States. Latvia concludes that the Addiko tribunal’s interpretation was thus contrary to

the law applicable to the Austria-Croatia BIT.

In oral submissions, Latvia highlighted that the Claimants advanced several arguments
in relation to certain VCLT provisions which concern the validity of a treaty (the

BIT).” Latvia opted not to put forward arguments about the validity of the BIT.

(6) Lex Posterior - Articles 59(2), 30, and 65(1) of the VCLT
a. Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent submits that if the Tribunal does not decide to apply directly primacy
or Achmea or EU law, then the Tribunal can find that it is without jurisdiction on the
basis of Articles 59 and 30 of the VCLT. Latvia does not assert that the BIT is

terminated, only that it is suspended.

Latvia cites Article 59(2) of the VCLT for the proposition that the earlier BIT is
suspended, because that was the intention of the same parties to it who also concluded
a later treaty (EU Treaties) relating to the “same subject matter”.?* The BIT’s subject
matter is the same as the EU Treaties’ since the BIT’s protection touches on the free
movement of goods, capital, services and labor, while covering not only existing
investments but also the right to establishment. Latvia says that the BIT’s subject matter
is the same as that of the EU Treaties since the BIT is entirely subsumed by EU law
regulation of the internal market, through the applicable four freedoms (freedom of

movement of goods, services and capital and the freedom of establishment of persons).

Latvia also submits that the BIT and the EU Treaties are on the same subject matter,
since the BIT was adopted in the context of the 1992 PHARE program for the

enlargement of the EU.

Latvia asserts that there are incompatibilities with the entire BIT based on Achmea and
Opinion 1/17.° The State parties’ intention is said to be clear that the BIT has been
suspended in operation as proved by the Declaration, which states that in light of

Achmea, the EU Member States will take steps to terminate intra-EU BITs. Latvia has

265

Latvia states that the travaux préparatoires of the VCLT as well as State practice and opinion of EU Member States (notably

of Latvia and the UK) support this interpretation: /5 January 2019 Declaration, R-00256, fn. 1.

266

In its Memorial, Latvia says that at least Articles 2-6, 8, 9, 11 and 14 of the BIT are incompatible with EU law, and without

these provisions, there is essentially nothing left in the Treaty.

also signed the Termination Agreement and the UK is still subject to its ongoing EU
law obligations in respect of intra-EU BITs. In any event, the BIT is precluded by EU
law from applying.

The Respondent emphasises that the criterion of “same subject matter” in Article 59
and Article 30°57 cannot be interpreted too strictly. Otherwise the criterion is
unworkable. The Respondent amplifies its argument by stating that the text of “relating
to” in the context of Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT concerns a question of a connection
between two or more things, such that a stricter test would not be appropriate.7°*

In relation to Article 30 of the VCLT, the Respondent says that there is an
incompatibility involving Article 8 of the BIT because of the EU law rule which
provides that one cannot respect EU law if one offers to arbitrate an intra-EU dispute.

Latvia first cites the Achmea Arbitral Tribunal in support of this argument:

More importantly, it is difficult to see how Article 30 could
deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction based upon the Parties’
consent derived from Article 8 of the BIT (whether operating the
first stage, second stage or both), even if there may be
circumstances in which a true incompatibility between the BIT
and EU law ai Any such incompatibility would be a question
of the effect of EU law as part of the applicable law and, as such,
a matter for the merits and not jurisdiction.

 

 

The one exception would be if Article 8 of the BIT, which
provides for arbitration between the investor and the State,
were_by itself incompatible with EU law. It could not be
incompatible when the BIT was made; but it might be argued
that it is incompatible with the CSFR Association Agreement,
the Association Agreement, the Accession Treaty or the Lisbon
Treaty. If that were so, that would, at least arguably, deprive
the Tribunal of jurisdiction.

There is, however, no rule of EU law that prohibits investor-
State arbitration."

267 Article 30 concerns the priority between particular provisions of earlier and later treaties relating to the same subject matter.

419, The Respondent then refers to the Achmea judgment for the rule of EU law which it
relies on, namely, that Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, interpreted in light of Articles
2, 4(3) and 19 of the TEU, preclude investor-state arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs.

420. The Respondent asserts that, contrary to the Claimants’ arguments that there can be no
conflict between the BIT and the CJEU judgments for the purposes of Articles 30 or 59
of the VCLT because CJEU judgments are not “provisions” of an earlier treaty, the
Achmea judgment and Opinion 1/17 interpret and apply provisions of the EU Treaties.
As such, they are reflective of the provisions of the EU Treaties and derived from

international convention law.?”

421. Inso far as the Claimants contend that Latvia’s failure to adhere to the required Article
65(1) of the VCLT notification procedure is problematic in this context, the Respondent
asserts that the conditions of Article 65(1) of the VCLT are superseded by the

agreement of the parties to the BIT as reflected in the Declaration or otherwise fulfilled.
b. Claimants’ submissions

422. The Claimants reject Latvia’s arguments on Articles 59 and 30(3) of the VCLT.

423, Article 59 concerns termination and suspension of a treaty. Suspension is at issue. The
Claimants say that Article 59 does not support Latvia’s case that Article 8 (or the whole

BIT) was suspended because, factoring in the text of Article 59, there is no conflicting

later treaty. The EU law “principle of primacy” is not a later treaty.

424, Article 59 is also concerned with a conflicting later treaty as a whole, not a mere

 

particular provision. Contrary to Latvia’s position, the BIT and EU law do not govern

> 271

the same “subject-matter”,”’' and, further contrary to Latvia’s position, the test of

“same subject matter” is to be “strictly” interpreted.?”” The Claimants emphasise that

the TFEU concerns the functioning of the European Union, while the BIT concerns the

270 Jt is also emphasised that the BIT and EU Treaties are on the same subject matters, notably since the BIT was adopted in
the context of the 1992 PHARE program for the enlargement of the EU.

27| The Claimants cite several cases as to why Articles 59 and 30 do not apply. E.g.: Marfin; Rupert Joseph Binder v. Czech
Republic, UNCITRAL Case, Award on Jurisdiction, 6 June 2007, CHB 5-302 (“Binder”); European American Investment
Bank AG v. The Slovak Republic, PCA Case No. 2010-17, Award on Jurisdiction, 22 October 2012, RL-00074 (“EURAM v
Slovak Republic”); WNC Factoring Ltd (United Kingdom) v. Czech Republic, UNCITRAL, Award, 22 February 2017, RL
“ 1d”); Wirtgen; UP and C.D v Hungary, United Utilities.

protection and promotion of investments.””> Ultimately, since Latvia has not identified
a conflicting, incompatible later treaty as required by Article 59, Article 59 does not

support its case.

425. Further, for there to be a suspension under Article 59, once the two conditions of Article
59(1) are met (that all parties to the earlier treaty conclude a later treaty and it relates
to the same subject matter), Article 59(2) may apply to suspend the earlier treaty only
where there is an intention that that treaty is not abrogated but just suspended. Here, the
Claimants take issue with any suggestion of an intention to suspend the BIT. The

Declarations made no reference to suspending the BITs,?” and the UK and Latvia

 

cannot retroactively issue authoritative determinations as to whether the BIT and EU
law covers the same subject matter in order to modify and amend the BIT.??> The

Achmea judgment also does not spell out or prescribe the consequences for any treaty.

426. The Claimants maintain that even if EU law and the BIT govern the same subject
matter, the Respondent fails to demonstrate incompatibility for the purposes of Articles
59 and 30 of the VCLT between EU law and the BIT. That is because there will be a
conflict only when two (or more) treaty instruments contain obligations which cannot
be complied with simultaneously.2” That is not the case here, as any alleged
incompatibilities between EU law and the Instruments of Consent can be reconciled by
the exclusion of EU law from the law applicable to the merits pursuant to Article 11

and/or Article 3 of the BIT.

427. Moreover, no appropriate action has been taken by Latvia to suspend the BIT in

accordance with the notification procedure required by Article 65(1) of the VCLT.

428. Article 30(3) of the VCLT also requires that the later treaty concern the same subject

matter and that it conflicts with the earlier treaty. The same problems that befall

273 There are said to be substantive and procedural protections in the Treaty that are wider than those afforded by the TFEU
and not replicated in EU law: e.g. the right without exhaustion of local remedies to have recourse to ICSID arbitration against
a Member State. The Claimants add that the fact the Treaty ‘touches on’ subjects (four freedoms) which might be governed
by EU law is not the same as the Treaty governing the same subject matter as EU law. The Claimants assert that various awards
support the view that the EU treaties and BITs do not relate to the same subject matter: Binder, para. 61; EURAM v Slovak
Republic, para. 61; Achmea Arbitral Tribunal Award on Jurisdiction, para. 161; WNC Factoring Ltd, para. 298; Wirtgen, para.
253.

27 The Claimants say the contrary is true. The Declarations state that only the investor state dispute settlement provisions are
inapplicable. That is not the same as saying all the treaties are suspended.

430.

Latvia’s arguments in relation to Article 59 are contended to apply to Article 30(3): i.e.
Latvia has not identified a later conflicting/incompatible treaty, the primacy principle
is not a treaty rule, there is no intention to suspend the BIT, and there is no suspension
because the mandatory notification procedure under Article 65 of the VCLT was not

followed by Latvia.

Even if EU law potentially applied, whether there is an actual incompatibility can only
be determined later in the proceedings when the Tribunal has a full and proper
appreciation of the nature of the claim and the extent to which the Tribunal might have

to interpret and apply EU law.

(7) Harmonious Interpretation

a. Claimants’ Submissions

The Claimants submit that, insofar as the BIT’s text allows an interpretation which is
consistent with other international obligations assumed by Latvia, that interpretation
must be followed. Even on Latvia’s theory that EU law (and Achmea) comprise public
international law obligations in conflict with the BIT, Latvia cannot explain why the
BIT’s correct interpretation should result in a conflict as opposed to avoiding
conflict.2”” For the Claimants, the principle guiding the Tribunal’s interpretation of the
BIT must be that Latvia and the UK, in keeping in force the BIT, intended it to comply
with their other obligations under international law. This principle has been articulated

as follows:

a. The ICJ in Right of Passage:

It is a rule of interpretation that a text emanating from a
Government must, in principle, be interpreted as producing and
as intended to produce effects in accordance with existing law
and not in violation of it.7*

Reports 1957, p. 125 (“Right of Passage”) CL-286, p. 142.

109

b. The Magyar Farming tribunal:

If apparently conflicting treaty provisions can be interpreted in
such a way that they are compatible with each other, this
approach is the first to be chosen.?”
431. The Claimants’ argument on harmonious interpretation surfaces in several places in its

submissions including:

(1) EU law is not applicable to merits: The Claimants submit that EU law is not
part of the rules applicable to the merits by virtue of the parties’ choice of law.
Article 11 of the Treaty constitutes the agreement of the UK and Latvia on the
scope of the rules applicable to the merits for the purposes of Article 42 of the
ICSID Convention. EU law does not apply by virtue of the Claimants’ objection
to any less favourable EU law being applied to their investments, which is
reinforced by the principle of harmonious interpretation. Professor Tridimas’
evidence is that the principle of harmonious interpretation is a principle of EU

law 280

Even if the Tribunal accepts that EU law is part of the applicable international
law, and that EU law prevents this Tribunal from proceeding to determine the
merits, the question is “whether there is a possible interpretation of the Treaty
(and the choice of applicable rules) which allows the Tribunal not to apply EU

law.”28!

The Claimants insist that there is no ambiguity and that Article 11 should be
given effect. Even if there were ambiguity here, it must be resolved to ensure
the harmonious co-existence of the BIT and EU law. Here, that would mean
accepting as a matter of principle, or by applying Article 11, that EU law does

not form part of the rules applicable to the merits of the dispute.

(2) No Conflict Between BIT and EU Treaties: Without prejudice to the Claimants’
submissions that the BIT does not share the same subject matter as the EU
Treaties, the Claimants contend that there is no conflict between the two given

the principle of harmonious interpretation and the presumption of compatibility.

There is a conflict only when two treaty instruments contain obligations which
cannot be complied with simultaneously. Here any alleged incompatibility can
be reconciled, in particular by accepting the Claimants’ submission that EU law

does not apply to the merits.2*?

432. Furthermore, citing Magyar Farming, the Claimants maintain that:?°

(1) the Tribunal must engage in harmonious interpretation unless there is an

outright conflict between the treaty provisions.

(2) the treaties are not in conflict, consistent with the view that the Magyar Farming
tribunal took when it failed to see a conflict between Article 8 of the Hungary-

UK BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.

(3) Ifthe Tribunal decides otherwise, however, the question would be whether it is
reasonably within the Tribunal’s power to harmoniously interpret the Treaty in

a way that it is compatible with EU law.

(4) If so, the Tribunal must engage in such reconciliatory interpretation under
international law and must read the BIT in a manner that it complies with EU

law.

b. Respondent’s Submissions

433. Latvia notes that the Claimants’ view of the “harmonious interpretation” principle
would have this Tribunal interpret the BIT as allowing it not to apply EU law. Far from
a harmonious result, Latvia submits, that that would create a direct conflict between the

BIT and EU law, which disregards how EU law functions.

434. Rather than focusing on the principle of “harmonious interpretation” as described by
the Claimants, Latvia emphasises the principle of systemic integration." The principle,
says Latvia, allows for the harmonious interpretation of international law amongst the
orders of different international organizations where this is possible, as well as comity
between international jurisdictions. Here, the principle requires the taking into account

of “any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the

parties” (VCLT, 31(3)(c))°**. In order to comply with this principle, which forms part
of customary international law,?** the Tribunal must take into account EU law and the

primacy principle.

435. Insofar as the Claimants cite the principle of harmonious interpretation which the
Magyar Farming tribunal referred to in its award, Latvia asserts that the principle
cannot be used to avoid EU law obligations either through their domestic law or through

bilateral treaties amongst themselves.

436. Further, harmonious interpretation is only possible if the interpretation of both norms

results in possible co-existence. An extra-EU BIT may be interpreted in a manner which

is consistent with Opinion 1/17. This is not possible for intra-EU BITs.”*”

437. Inits Third Post-Hearing Submissions, Latvia expands on its rejection of the Claimants’
invocation of the harmonious interpretation principle, focusing on their alleged
presumption of compatibility between the BIT and EU law. Latvia submits that even if
there existed such a presumption of compatibility, it would be rebutted by a real conflict

which exists between the BIT and EU law. In support of this submission, Latvia cites

1288

the Magyar Farming tribunal and reports of the ILC on Fragmentation of

International Law.?*°

438. Latvia asserts that conflict is to be understood broadly, citing jurists who define it as
meaning that two treaties cannot be reconciled; even a latent inconsistency will
suffice.?°° In the face of a clear conflict, says Latvia, between an intra-EU BIT and the

superior, posterior and more special EU law rules:

(1) harmonious interpretation must yield to the application of conflicts rules; and

(2) _ the proposition advanced by the Claimants that insofar as the BIT’s text “allows

 

an interpretation which is consistent with other international obligations

assumed by Latvia, that interpretation has to be followed” is to be rejected.

In Latvia’s submission, one cannot view the EU Treaties in a vacuum without
considering the EU institutions they create, including the CJEU’s role within the EU
Treaties and its case law (on Achmea, Opinion 1/17 and primacy to inter se
agreements), in addition to the Declaration and Termination Agreement . According to

Latvia, the intra-EU BIT cannot be consistent with its and the UK’s EU law obligations.

J. EC SUBMISSIONS

443.

The EC filed an Amicus Brief in the matter dated 5 November 2018. This Brief was
summarised in the Decision on Bifurcation of 1 March 2019 at paragraphs 73 to 89.

Accordingly, a briefer treatment is appropriate at this time.

The EC addresses the issue whether the investor-state arbitration mechanism in the BIT
remains available. It also comments briefly on whether there are any related

implications of Brexit.

According to the EC, judgments of the CJEU contain an authoritative and binding
interpretation of the relevant provisions of Union law for all EU Member States and
any investor established in those states, as well as the Tribunal. In support of this

position, the EC cites MOX Plan?! and Iron Rhine?”

The legal consequence of Achmea is said to be that Latvia’s offer and the corresponding
offer of the UK to investors from the other Contracting Party to enter into investment

arbitration has not been valid since 1 May 2004, when Latvia acceded to the EU.

449.

The EC contends that, contrary to the view taken by the ICSID tribunal in UP and C.D
Holding v Hungary, Achmea is relevant to this proceeding because it stands for the
notion that any intra-EU investment arbitration is precluded by the general principle of
Union law of autonomy, Article 19 of the TEU, and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.
In this regard, the differences identified in UP and C.D Holding between an
UNCITRAL arbitral tribunal with its seat in Germany and an ICSID tribunal? are

irrelevant.

According to the EC, the state parties’ ratification of the ICSID Convention does not
suffice to establish consent to arbitration here. The legal foundation for the consent is

Article 8 of the BIT, and not Article 25 of the ICSID Convention alone.

This Tribunal, submits the EC, must assess the existence of valid consent to arbitration
under the BIT in order to confirm or decline jurisdiction. That inquiry should lead to
the conclusion that consent was never validly given ab initio, because the request for

arbitration was filed after Latvia’s accession to the EU.

The conflict in relation to Article 8 of the BIT is said to be self-evident because EU law
(Achmea) precludes such a clause. Moreover, there are two possible rules on conflict
of laws that may apply to the present matter. Both avenues are said to support the same

conclusion, namely, the preclusion by EU law.

The first conflict avenue is the primacy of EU law as codified in Declaration 17 to the
Treaty of Lisbon.2*4 EU law is said to have primacy not only over domestic law of
Member States, but also international treaties concluded between two Member States.
Regarding the latter, Article 351 of the TFEU establishes that EU law takes precedence
over international treaties concluded between Member States regardless of whether

they were concluded before or after EU accession.”

Second, and alternatively, the conflict rules of the VCLT (Articles 59 and 30(3) VCLT)

are said to also lead to the conclusion that EU law prevails over the BIT.2°° EU law

covers the same subject matter as the BIT, thus Article 59 of the VCLT applies to the
relationship between EU law and the BIT. Further, Article 30(3) also applies because
there is a conflict between an earlier and a later treaty. In this context, the “same subject
matter” requirement and “conflict” are one and the same thing.”°” The EC rejected the

contrary views on this issue of the Eastern Sugar tribunal as being “too narrow.”?%*

450. The EC submitted that Brexit has no implications on the present issues. This is because
consent to arbitration had to be present when the arbitration started, ie. when the
request for arbitration was filed. In the EC’s view, there was no valid offer for

arbitration from Latvia.

451. Subsequent to the EC’s filing of its Amicus brief, the EC later wrote to the Tribunal on
4 May 2019 offering to update its Brief further in light of the Declaration and the
issuance of the CETA Opinion.

452. After reviewing the parties’ submissions on the EC’s offer, the Tribunal, on 27 May
2019, conveyed to the parties and the EC that since the Declaration and the CETA

Opinion were already on the record and the subject of comprehensive submissions by

 

Latvia, the Tribunal did not require further assistance from the EC2”

On 30 July 2020, for the avoidance of doubt, the Bank maintained its submissions made

before Mr Krastin

 

ppointment as Administrator. It also reiterated out of caution that

it accepts Latvia’s offer to arbitrate in the matter.*”

In relation to the tribunal awards cited, the Bank has asserted as follows:

Q)

Q)

As to Magyar Farming, the Bank observed that an ICSID tribunal found that it
must assess its own jurisdiction under principles of international law and not
exclusively under EU law. In that case, the tribunal assessed whether a conflict
existed between the EU treaties and the BIT pursuant to the VCLT. Based on
that assessment the tribunal determined that Article 8 of the UK-Hungary BIT
(1987) contained a valid offer to arbitrate. The tribunal also found that the
Declarations were irrelevant to the jurisdictional question and could not
retroactively invalidate or render inapplicable the offer to arbitrate which had

been accepted by the Claimants.

As to Addiko, the Bank commented that the tribunal’s rejection of Croatia’s
jurisdictional objection is relevant to the present case. Addiko is contended to
stand for the proposition that treaties whose applicable law was limited to the
terms of the treaties themselves and general principles of international law, are
compatible with Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU according to Achmea. The
Bank says that the Addiko tribunal found support for this reading of Achmea in
the distinction drawn between the interpretation and application of EU law as
part of the applicable law on the one hand, and its consideration as fact on the
other. The CJEU reinforced this distinction in Opinion 1/17. The Addiko

tribunal also found that even if, arguendo, Achmea did not hinge on the

 

applicable law of the BIT, it would not apply to pre-Achmea cases, since at that
time, any alleged incompatibility of intra-EU BIT arbitration with the TFEU
was not manifest (see also Articles 46 and 69 VCLT). The relevant time for
determining consent is the date of the registration of the request for arbitration.
Finally, Addiko was invoked for the notion that the Declarations cannot

invalidate the existing consent to arbitrate.

offer which does not exist.” Respondent’s PHB 3, p. 11

(3) Strabag is said to stand for the proposition that the EU Treaties, Achmea and
Declaration cannot “trump over the methods of interpretation” in Article 31(1)
of the VCLT or “amend the text of the treaty.” The Bank contends that the
ordinary meaning of the text of Article 8 of the Austria-Poland BIT, in light of
its context and purpose, left no interpretive doubt for the Strabag tribunal. The
same interpretation should apply here for Article 8 of the BIT. The Bank also
invokes the finding that the conflict provisions in Articles 30(3) and 59(1) of
the VCLT did not apply, consistent with investment arbitration case law which
has consistently found that the EU Treaties (specifically the TFEU) do not deal

with the same subject matter as intra-EU BITs.

In respect to the UK leaving the EU, the Bank submits that this has no impact on the
availability of the dispute settlement procedure of the BIT. Neither the UK nor Latvia
has terminated the BIT, which remains in full force and effect under public international

law.

Moreover, the BIT is no longer an intra-EU BIT, thus its arbitration clause can no longer
be challenged on the ground that it conflicts with the principle of equal treatment. Nor

can unlawful discrimination be established under EU law.

In relation to the Termination Agreement, the Bank agrees with the Shareholder
Claimants that the Termination Agreement does not apply to pending proceedings

under the BIT. The BIT has not been terminated.

On the question of admissibility, the Bank has endorsed the submissions of the

Claimants in their Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder.

IV. TRIBUNAL ANALYSIS

461.

The Respondent’s Intra-EU Objection raises two distinct, but overlapping, issues. First,
a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Secondly, the alleged inadmissibility of
the claims sought to be made by the Claimants. As the summary of submissions has
shown, many of the grounds advanced by Latvia in support of its objection apply to
both aspects of its objection. As will appear below, the Tribunal does not find it
necessary to deal with all of the grounds so advanced in order to determine the
jurisdictional challenge. As set out below, admissibility was not the subject of the

Tribunal’s bifurcation order.

A. JURISDICTION

462.

463.

464.

465.

466.

It is common ground that the law applicable to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction includes
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, Article 8 of the BIT if the BIT is in force and not
suspended, and general international law. Latvia asserts, and the Claimants deny, that

the applicable international law includes EU law.

It is also common ground that this Tribunal only has jurisdiction if Latvia had consented
to refer a dispute such as this to arbitration under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention
and Article 8 of the BIT and that consent remained valid after Latvia’s accession to the

EU.

It is further common ground, for purposes of the Bifurcated Objection, that the consent
had to be extant at the time Latvia’s ‘offer’ to arbitrate was accepted by the Claimants

who, accordingly, added their consent, on 14 December 2017.
Thereafter there is little common ground.

Chapter II of the ICSID Convention is entitled “Jurisdiction of the Centre”. It

relevantly provides:

Article 25

(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting
State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting
State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of
another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute
consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have

118

given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent

unilaterally.

(2) “National of another Contracting State” means:

(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting
State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on
which the parties consented to submit such dispute to
conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which
the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of
Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not
include any person who on either date also had the
nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and

 

(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a
Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute
on the date on which the parties consented to submit such
dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical
person which had the nationality of the Contracting State
party to the dispute on that date and which, because of
foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as
a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of
this Convention.

(3) Consent by a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting
State shall require the approval of that State unless that State
notifies the Centre that no such approval is required.

(4) Any Contracting State may, at the time of ratification,
acceptance or approval of this Convention or at any time
thereafter, notify the Centre of the class or classes of disputes
which it would or would not consider submitting to the
jurisdiction of the Centre. The Secretary-General shall forthwith
transmit such notification to all Contracting States. Such
notification shall not constitute the consent required by
paragraph (1).

  

 

Article 26

Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall,
unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to
the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may
require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial
remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this
Convention.

467. The consent of the State required by Article 25 was contained in Article 8 of the BIT:

(1) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(hereinafter referred to as “the Centre”) for settlement by
conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the

119

Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals
of Other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March
1965°° any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party
and a national or company of the other Contracting Party and a
national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning
an investment of the latter in the territory of the former.

(2) A company which is incorporated or constituted under the law
in force in the territory of one Contracting Party and in which
before such a dispute arises the majority of shares are owned by
nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall in
accordance with article 25(2)(b) of the Convention be treated for
the purposes of the Convention as a company of the other
Contracting Party.

(3) If any such dispute should arise and agreement cannot be
reached within three months between the parties to this dispute
through pursuit of local remedies or otherwise, then,
national or company affected also consents in writing to submit
the dispute to the Centre for settlement by conciliation or
arbitration under the Convention, either party may institute
proceedings by addressing a request to that effect to the
Secretary-General of the Centre as provided in Articles 28 and
36 of the Convention. In the event of disagreement as to whether
conciliation or arbitration is the more appropriate procedure the
national or company affected shall have the right to choose. The
Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall not raise
as an objection at any stage of the proceedings or enforcement
of an award the fact that the national or company which is the
other party to the dispute has received in pursuance of an
insurance contract an indemnity in respect of some or all of his
or its losses.

 

(4) Neither Contracting Party shall pursue through the diplomatic
channel any dispute referred to the Centre unless:

(a) the Secretary-General of the Centre, or a conciliation
commission or an arbitral tribunal constituted by it, decides
that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre,
or

(b

the other Contracting Party shall fail to abide by or to
comply with any award rendered by an arbitral tribunal.

It is also relevant to note Article 14 of the BIT which provides:

Article 14
Duration and Termination

This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten years.
Thereafter it shall continue in force until the expiration of twelve
months from the date on which either Contracting Party shall
have given written notice of termination to the other. Provided
that in respect of investments made whilst the Agreement is in
force, its provisions shall continue in effect with respect to such
investments for a period of twenty years after the date of
termination and without prejudice to the application thereafter of
the rules of general international law.

The concept of what is or is not “jurisdictional” has long eluded definition. Justice Felix
Frankfurter once described the idea of jurisdiction as “a verbal coat of too many
colours”.* On another occasion he referred to the “morass” into which one can be led
by “loose talk about jurisdiction” and concluded that “‘jurisdiction’ competes with
‘right’ as one of the most deceptive legal pitfalls”.*°> The Tribunal will apply the word
jurisdiction in the sense of the Tribunal’s authority to consider the claims submitted to

it and to rule on them.

The critical step in the establishment of the jurisdiction of the Centre, and thus of the
Tribunal, is the existence of consent by both parties to a dispute at the time a Request
for Arbitration is submitted to the Secretary-General under Article 36 of the

Convention.

It is conventional to refer to the jurisdictional requirement of consent by the parties to
submit a dispute to arbitration in terms of a standing offer by the State, which is
accepted by the complainant investor. This contractual metaphor is supported by the

reference in the Preamble of the ICSID Convention:

Recognising that mutual consent by the parties to submit such
disputes to...arbitration...constitutes a binding agreement.

Latvia’s case on jurisdiction turns on the proposition that, under EU law, both the UK.

and Latvia were precluded from maintaining their consent to arbitration in Article 8 of

° United States v LA Tucker Truck Lines Inc., 344 US 33, 39 (1952).
3°5 City of Yonkers v United States 320 US 685, 695 (1944).

121

474,

475.

the BIT, indeed were precluded from maintaining the BIT in force in substantial part,
as and from Latvia’s accession to the EU on 1 May 2004. Accordingly, Latvia contends,
there was no consent to arbitrate by Latvia from that time, with the effect that there was

no “offer to arbitrate” when the Claimants purported to accept it.

According to Latvia the time from which the apparent consent ceased to constitute an
offer to arbitrate was based on the fact that, under EU law, the decision of the CJEU in
Achmea, which clarified the impact of the EU law on bilateral investment treaties

concluded between the EU Member States, took effect retroactively.

This Tribunal must commence its analysis with the Instruments of Consent on which
the Claimants rely as conferring jurisdiction upon it. The Tribunal accepts the principal
contention of the Claimants that, for purposes of the Bifurcated Objection, this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction turns on whether there was consent by Latvia on the basis of
Article 8(1) of the BIT for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, at the
time the Claimants added their consent under Article 8(3) of the BIT on 14 December
2017, by filing a Request for Arbitration. The Tribunal notes that in its consideration
of the BIT it is bound to apply the relevant provisions of the VCLT which is applicable
to the BIT. Latvia acceded to the VCLT on 4 May 1993 while the United Kingdom
ratified it on 25 June 1971. According to Article 4 of the VCLT it applies to treaties
which are concluded by States after its entry into force with regard to such States. The
BIT was signed on 24 January 1994, i.e., subsequently to the entry into force of the
VCLT for the United Kingdom and Latvia.

The critical words in Article 8 - “hereby consents” - reflect a standing consent. Article
14 expressly provides that the BIT will continue in force until terminated in accordance
with its terms. It provides 20 additional years of protection for investments made prior

to termination, without prejudice to the rules of general international law.

The Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ submission*” that Article 14 defines the period
for which Latvia’s consent will remain open for an investor to add its consent and thus

complete the requirements of Article 25(1).

122

477.

478.

As set out above, Latvia has put forward a number of distinct arguments to support its
contention that there was no consent by it at the time the Claimants purported to add

their consent. The Tribunal will consider those submissions below.

However, the starting point, which Latvia has to overcome, is that the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction is based on the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT to which
the Tribunal has referred. It is not derived from the legal orders of the EU, or Latvia, or
the UK. The ICSID Convention creates a legal order of public international law
different from the EU legal order. The extent to which EU law may impinge on the

jurisdiction of an ICSID Tribunal turns on the specific mechanisms that Latvia invokes.

B. ACHMEA

479.

480.

481.

Latvia relies principally on the judgments of the CJEU in Achmea, as reinforced and
extended by the Court in Opinion 1/17. Although both these decisions were handed
down after 14 December 2017, under EU law they take effect ex tunc and represent
interpretations of the scope and application of the EU Treaties from the time they came
into force with regard to the States concerned. Latvia’s position is supported by the

Amicus Brief of the European Commission.

This Tribunal, as the Claimants submit, is not bound by decisions of the CJEU and does
not operate in the same authoritative hierarchy as that Court. However, both the UK.
and Latvia, at 14 December 2017, were subject to EU law and were bound by the
interpretation of the EU Treaties by the CJEU.

The Tribunal notes Latvia’s invocation of the decision of the tribunal appointed
pursuant to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (“UNCLOS”) in the MOX
Plant’ case. Latvia submitted that once the Tribunal has decided that EU law applies
and should prevail, this Tribunal should follow the MOX Plant tribunal and not hear
the claims on the basis of comity with the CJEU.*°* However, there is a fundamental

difference between UNCLOS and the ICSID Convention.*”

Articles 281 and 282 of UNCLOS expressly permit States parties to agree to an
alternative form of dispute resolution. This was a critical consideration in the decision
in that case, where there was a real possibility of proceedings being instituted in the
CJEU, which could hold that it had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the dispute. On
the basis of comity, the UNCLOS tribunal determined that it should not proceed but
should instead suspend proceedings awaiting “a clearer picture of the position regarding

European Community Law and possible proceedings thereunder”.*!°

The position under the ICSID Convention is the opposite. Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention provides, with effect from the time of acceptance of an offer to arbitrate by
a Contracting State: “Consent to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless
otherwise stated, be deemed to be consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any

other remedy”.

Lord Neuberger expressed the view, contested by Professor Tridimas, that the CJEU
decision in Achmea was in error. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants, in response to

Latvia’s reliance on the Declaration, referred to Article 43 of the TFEU as

 

stablishing
that only the CJEU can give authoritative interpretations of EU law.*!! Further,
Professor Talmon accepted that Achmea was correctly decided as being in line with

earlier decisions.*!”

 

As a matter of comity, this Tribunal accepts the decisions of the CJEU as the

authoritative interpretations of the EU Treaties,

 

sa matter of EU law, for purposes of

the issues before it.

The Claimants submit that both Achmea and Opinion 1/17 are distinguishable. They
rely on the reasoning by a number of investment treaty tribunals which have found that

they had jurisdiction to hear claims arising under intra-EU investment treaties

notwithstanding those decisions.*' Some have applied that reasoning after the CETA

Opinion2"4

As the Claimants point out, there are significant distinguishing features between the
facts of this case and those in Achmea. There is a fundamental difference between an
ICSID arbitration and an arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules, such as the one at
issue in Achmea. The /ex arbitri of the latter is the domestic law of the seat, which in
Achmea was within the EU, in Germany. The /ex arbitri of an ICSID arbitration, which
has no seat, is international law. Indeed, the ISDS clause considered in Achmea also
made specific provision that the applicable law included the law in force of the
Contracting Party concerned, i.e., Slovakia. As the Claimants submitted, there is no

equivalent, express applicable law clause in the UK-Latvia BIT.

Article 8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT at issue in Achmea has been set out above at

paragraph 151.

These aspects of Achmea give rise to a question as to why the case was a suitable vehicle
for determining that the protection of the preliminary ruling procedure to the CJEU was
a fundamental aspect of the autonomy of the EU judicial system. It was by such a

reference that the case was before the CJEU.

Nevertheless, these distinguishing characteristics do not detract from the content of the
constitutional principles applied by the CJEU to the specific facts of the case. These
were the principle of primacy and the principle of autonomy. The latter principle was
determinative with respect to Article 8 of the Slovakia-Netherlands BIT. Both are

principles of EU constitutional law.
As the CJEU said in Opinion 1/09, referring to the long-standing principle of primacy:

It is apparent from the Court’s settled case-law that the founding
treaties of the European Union, unlike ordinary international
treaties, established a new legal order, possessing its own
institutions, for the benefit of which the States have limited their
sovereign rights...The essential characteristics of the European
Union legal order thus constituted are in particular its primacy

over the laws of the Member States and the direct effect of a
whole series of provisions...>!>

The CJEU held in the CETA Opinion: “That autonomy accordingly resides in the fact

that the Union possesses a constitutional framework that is unique to it.”>!° Professor

 

Tridimas agreed: “Autonomy must be understood within the above constitutional

footprint”.3!’ These comments reflect the dual character of EU law discussed above.

Further, in both Achmea and the CETA Opinion, the CJEU held that an infringement of
autonomy would occur when there was the mere possibility that a tribunal would
interpret and apply EU law.*!® This approach also manifests the constitutional

dimension of the principle.

Professor Tridimas noted, that the principle of autonomy - the determinative principle
in Achmea - is a recent development. He identified the definitive adoption of the
principle, despite earlier references, as having occurred in Opinion 2/13 preventing the
EU from itself becoming a party to the European Convention on Human Rights and

Fundamental Freedoms.

 

According to him, “essential character of the powers of the EU and its institutions must
remain unaltered”.>'? Subjecting the EU to the jurisdiction of the European Court of
Human Rights, the CJEU concluded, impinged on the role of the CJEU as the final
arbiter of EU law. Professor Tridimas further noted that such impingement “affected
the autonomy of EU law and interfered with the exclusivity of the CJEU jurisdiction
under Article 344 TFEU”*”° He described that case as “the turning point” for the

principle of autonomy.*?!

The Tribunal notes that in Opinion 2/13 the CJEU stated that the principle that “an

international agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the Treaties or,

se

consequently, the autonomy of the EU legal system” had been established in prior

cases.*2 The Court identified the precedents.*?7

The Tribunal has reviewed these cases and finds in each of them statements of the kind
referred to in Opinion 2/13. They may not have been central to the decision in those
cases, however, Professor Tridimas may be understating this prior consideration as

“references”.

In each of these cases the CJEU was concerned only with EU law, as such. That is most
clear in Kadi where the international obligations that the CJEU declined to enforce were
based on the United Nations Charter. As the CJEU put it in that case, even in the case
of the Charter:

... the obligations imposed by an international agreement cannot
have the effect of prejudicing the constitutional principles of the
EC Treaties >

This judicial history may well have legal implications e.g. for a legitimate expectations
case under EU law, as argued by the Claimants. However, in the light of Article 26 of
the ICSID Convention, prohibiting withdrawal of consent, it cannot affect the
jurisdiction of a Tribunal once consent has been perfected. None of the prior cases,

including Achmea itself, involved a treaty provision of this kind.

As a constitutional court, the CJEU does not apply the VCLT when interpreting the EU

Treaties. As Professor Tridimas put it:

 

In interpreting EU law, the ECJ places emphasis on systematic
and teleological interpretation, focusing on the objectives of the
Treaties, the dynamic character of EU law and the evolution of
the EU legal order. This approach has led the ECJ to reach results
which could not be supported solely by reference to the text of
Treaty provisions.*?>

505.

A principle of constitutional law derived from such a process should be applied at a
level of generality that overcomes factors that might otherwise restrict the precedential

effect of a Court’s reasoning.

The words from Achmea, that are the subject of focus in this respect, give rise to the
question whether Article 8 of the BIT is a clause “such as” that considered in

Achmea.*°6

Those words must be understood in the full context of the CJEU reasoning.
It is difficult to give so flexible a formulation the precision and weight it has been asked
to bear. That is particularly so because the words “such as” were contained in the
specific question put to the CJEU by the German Bundesgerichtshof. All the CJEU was

doing in Achmea was answering the question it was asked.

With respect to the learned tribunals that have distinguished Achmea, this Tribunal is
of the view that the constitutional principles actually applied by the CJEU in that case
did not turn on the /ex arbitri under the UNCITRAL Rules and the applicable law
provision in the BIT there under consideration. The principle of autonomy, specifically
the protection of the preliminary ruling procedure by the CJEU, is the fundamental
basis of the decision. In this respect, Article 8 of the BIT answers the description of a

provision “such as” the ISDS clause in Achmea.

As a matter of EU law, on the materials before the Tribunal, Achmea is not
distinguishable. What the effect of the decision is on the law applicable to this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction is a distinct matter. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction does not derive

from EU law.

The dual character of EU law in relevant respects is fundamental to the application by
this Tribunal of the decisions of the CJEU. Notwithstanding that we accept such
decisions as statements of EU law, we cannot accept that the reasoning of those
decisions, which abjures reliance on the customary international law principles of treaty
interpretation as codified in the VCLT, represents the correct method of interpretation
of the BIT as a matter of international law. With respect to the central jurisdictional

question before us - did Latvia consent to arbitration - we have to determine the issue

326 Achmea, e.g. paras. 18, 20, 31, 43, 49, 55, 58, 60, 62.

128

509.

in accordance with principles that are not constrained by the constitutional dimension

of EU law.

The CJEU’s holding that granting consent in the form of an ISDS clause is “precluded”
- to adopt the terminology of the CJEU and of Latvia - creates an obligation on the part
of Latvia under EU law. Nothing in the materials before the Tribunal suggests that any
such obligation takes effect on the obligations of member states to third parties without

further steps.

The fact that Latvia may be in breach of its legal obligations under EU law is not, in

and of itself, determinative of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. As Lord Neuberger put it:

Wrongful consent nonetheless constitutes consent, and in order

to establish jurisdiction, consent (whether rightly or wrongly

given) is all that is required.>?”
Latvia contends that its offer to arbitrate had been retrospectively vitiated by reason of
the fact that the CJEU’s decision in Achmea took effect from the date of the accession
of Latvia to the EU. As noted above, the CJEU has the power to make its decisions take

effect prospectively, but did not do so in Achmea. That is the effect under EU law.

However, in determining its jurisdiction this Tribunal is not bound to apply EU law and
is not obliged to give the decision, notwithstanding its “international legal character”,
retroactive operation. That is particularly the case where, as here, the CJEU interpreted

the EU Treati

 

s on principles which cannot be adopted in an international arbitration.
The “constitutional framework” part of the dual characterisation of the EU Treaties

appears to have been the dominant element in its approach.

C. CETA OPINION

510.

To a substantial degree, the CETA Opinion reinforces Achmea. That is so particularly
with respect to the autonomy of EU law. Some of the Court’s reasoning extends the
principles relied on in that case to encompass other aspects of the EU institutional

structure, most relevantly with respect to the ECB.

327 First Neuberger Report, para. 20.

129

Si.

512.

513.

514.

515.

The following passage from the CETA Opinion was relied on by Latvia as describing

the kind of threat to the autonomy of EU law that Latvia perceives this case to present:

the envisaged ISDS mechanism ... does not structure the powers
of [investment treaty] tribunals in such a way that, while not
themselves engaging in the interpretation or application of rules
of EU law other than those of that agreement, they may issue
awards which have the effect of preventing the EU institutions
from operating in accordance with the EU constitutional
framework.***

Latvia relies on the CETA Opinion to extend the preclusive effect of EU law beyond
Article 8 of the BIT to encompass, as well, the substantive protections in Articles 2-6,
11, 14 and possibly the whole BIT. It submits that the BIT does not include a range of
the provisions of the CETA which the Court found to constitute “safeguards” of the

autonomy of EU law and its institutions.

Many of these “safeguards” involve the provisions which prevent a CETA Tribunal
from making awards of the character that States and the EU have criticised over recent
years with respect to the jurisprudence developed by investment treaty tribunals. That
includes perceived intrusion into State powers to regulate, the scope of the FET
standard, the existence of a remedy for indirect expropriation, the power to make orders

other than compensation and other such matters.

The Tribunal does not consider these “safeguards” relevant to the jurisdictional issue
of consent. Even to suggest, if that is what is being done, that consent may be
conditional on particular behaviour, would undermine the effectiveness of the consent
itself. These ‘conditions’ are not appropriate restrictions on the exercise by a tribunal

of its jurisdiction.

There are also structural differences between the CETA and the BIT. Specifically, the
CETA provision for an appeal on both fact and law confirms the role of the CJEU and,
in that respect, reinforces Achmea. Further, provision for the EC to be joined as a party

and the existence of a joint Committee to issue clarifications are said, respectively, to

38 Opinion 1/17, para. 253.

130

ensure that EU law will be appropriately applied and that the autonomy of the EU legal

order will be preserved.*”?

516. In these respects also the Tribunal finds that these differences do not impinge on the

issue of consent. They are directed to the exercise of jurisdiction, not to its existence.

D. APPLICABLE LAW
(1) EU Law as International Law

517. The Tribunal received evidence and submissions directed to answering the question: Is

EU law International law? The answer to that question does not assist the determination

 

of the Intra-EU objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. In many respects the
answer is obviously: “Yes it is.” EU law, as Latvia accepted, has a dual character: it is
both international law and domestic law. Furthermore, as we have indicated, the EU

Treaties also serve as a constitution for the closely integrated polity known as the EU.

518. That a law can have a dual character as both domestic and international is confirmed
by the decision of the ICJ in the Advisory Opinion on the Unilateral Declaration of
Independence in respect of Kosovo. The request before the court was expressed in terms
of whether the Declaration was in accordance with international law. The Court rejected
a submission that the interim “Constitutional Framework”, promulgated by a regulation
of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Kosovo, was

“an act of an internal law rather than an international law character.”>*°

 

519, The Court observed that as the “Constitutional Framework” was adopted pursuant to

the authority of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), it derives its binding force

from the binding character of resolution 1244 (1999) and thus from international law.

In that sense it therefore “possesses an international legal character.”>>!

520. The Court went on to hold:

At the same time, the Court observes that the Constitutional
Framework functions as part of a specific legal order...which is
applicable only in Kosovo and the purpose of which is to

regulate,..., matters which would ordinarily be the subject of
internal, rather than international, law...The Constitutional
Framework therefore took effect as part of the body of law
adopted for the administration of Kosovo...The institutions
which it created were empowered by the Constitutional
Framework to take decisions which took effect within that body
of law ...35

Professor Tridimas referred to this opinion for the proposition that international law
may establish a constitutional framework without that framework losing its character
as international law.*** The Tribunal accepts that proposition. However, the Professor
goes on to derive from this premise the further proposition that constitutional principles
of EU law, such as the principle of primacy (an integral part of EU law), are also

principles of international law, because EU law is a specific branch of international law.

522. This second proposition does not take into account the way the ICJ adopted a dual

523.

  

33-7

characterisation of the Constitutional Framework. The issue it was determining in its
Advisory Opinion on the Unilateral Declaration of Independence of Kosovo was
whether the Constitutional Framework could be characterised as international law at
all, so that it fell within the law applicable to the question asked by the General
Assembly when it requested the advisory opinion. However, it also held that the

Framework took effect within the Kosovo legal order as internal law.
The reasoning of the Vattenfall tribunal in the following passage is persuasive:

145. However, this autonomous or constitutional nature of the
TEU and the TFEU does not exclude them from the purview of
international law. As mentioned in Article 38(1)(a) of the Statute
of the International Court of Justice, any kind of international
convention “whether general or particular”, constitutes
international law.

146. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the finding of the
tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary that “EU law is international
law because it is rooted in international treaties.

... It would be more exact to say that the corpus of EU law
derives from treaties that are themselves a part of, and governed
by, international law, and contains other rules that are applicable
on the plane of international law, while also containing rules that

526.

operate only within the internal legal order of the EU and, at least
arguably, are not a part of international law; but for present
purposes the Electrabel formula suffices.

147. Instead of excluding EU law from the purview of
international law, tribunals that have considered the relationship
between EU law and the ECT have attempted to resolve
conflicts, if any, between them. They have done so, for example,
by (i) endorsing harmonious interpretation, (ii) prioritising
international law over EU law, or (iii) finding that there is no
conflict that requires resolution.

148. Since the ECJ is empowered by the EU Treaties to give

preliminary rulings on the interpretation of EU law, including

the EU Treaties (see Article 19 TEU and Article 267 TFEU), the

Tribunal considers the ECJ Judgment’s interpretation of the EU

Treaties likewise to constitute a part of the relevant international

law.
This Tribunal needs to further consider whether the “E/ectrabel formula suffices” for
the BIT as it did for the ECT under consideration in Vattenfall. That is to say whether
the relevant principles the Tribunal has to consider in this case “operate only within the
internal legal order of the EU.” That question did not arise in Vattenfall, because the
EU is itself'a party to the ECT. The Tribunal has accepted the submission that the CIEU
decisions at the centre of this case have a dual character. The Vattenfall tribunal did not

deal with this alternative.

The Tribunal does not accept that CJEU decisions are international law of the same
character as the Treaties. It accepts the formulation in Electrabel, endorsed in
Vattenfall, that CJEU decisions are “applicable on the plane of international law’. This
distinction is of significance for the application of conflict rules, as we have to consider

a conflict between a treaty and judicial decisions.

As we have noted, CJEU decisions are not based on principles of interpretation,
codified in the VCLT, applicable to treaties, but on a teleological approach applicable
to constitutional law. As further discussed below, we do not identify a conflict between
the BIT and the EU Treaties. The conflict arises from an incompatibility between the
BIT and the CJEU’s interpretation of those Treaties by application of the teleological

approach.

133

527.

528.

529.

530.

531.

532.

The issue before the Tribunal is whether Latvia’s membership of the EU, as it contends,
had, in effect, an automatic impact by rendering inapplicable (to use only one of many
terms deployed in the case in this respect) the consent to arbitrate contained in Article

8 of the BIT. If so, did that inapplicability take effect before 14 December 2017?

The answer to this question turns on the impact of the CJEU decisions in Achmea and
Opinion 1/17, the reasoning of which the Tribunal has accepted to be capable of such
application. The Tribunal is here concerned with determining whether EU law is
applicable to determining jurisdiction. Whether it is applicable to the merits is a distinct

issue 34

These CJEU decisions establish that, if there is a mere possibility that a tribunal will
interpret or apply EU law, then it is “precluded” by EU law from assuming its
jurisdiction. That proposition is not determinative of the issue before the Tribunal,
unless EU law is otherwise applicable law for purposes of jurisdiction. Such a test of
conflict may be appropriate to resolve a conflict for constitutional law purposes. It is
not appropriate to resolve a conflict in international law. The Tribunal was not

presented with any text or precedent to suggest that it could be.

We will consider below the several alternative routes by which Latvia contends EU law

becomes applicable to preclude the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The starting point for this analysis, as indicated above, is that, as the Tribunal is not
part of the EU legal structure, EU law is not determinative of its jurisdiction, unless
made so by a provision of law which is applicable. A number of contextual matters are
pertinent to an assessment of the routes put forward by Latvia by which EU law is said

to preclude the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

First, Latvia does not challenge before this Tribunal the ICSID Convention itself,
specifically Articles 25 and 26. Nor, despite certain observations expressing doubts by
Advocate-General Wathelet in his Opinion presented to the CJEU in Achmea, has the

CJEU expressed any view in that regard.

334 The Tribunal will deal with the issue of applicable law for the merits in that context.

533.

534.

535.

536.

537.

539,

540.

541,

Furthermore, neither the EU nor any EU State, including Latvia, has expressed any
doubt or qualification about the validity of EU Member State being a party to the ICSID

Convention. That position is also reflected in the Declaration on which Latvia relies.

Neither Latvia nor, on the materials before the Tribunal, any EU Member State
subjected its ratification of the ICSID Convention to a reservation with respect to intra-

EU disputes.

Latvia did not avail itself of the possibility to “state” that its consent under the ICSID
Convention did not operate to the exclusion of an “other remedy” under the first

sentence of Article 26. Although such a statement does not constitute a reservation.

Nor did Latvia require the exhaustion of local remedies under the second sentence of

Article 26.

Further, neither Latvia nor, on the materials before the Tribunal, has any EU Member
State made use of the express provision under Article 25(4) to lodge a notification that
it would not agree to submit intra-EU disputes, or some other category, such as banking

regulatory disputes, to the jurisdiction of ICSID.

Nor has Latvia, either before 14 December 2017 or since, given Notice of Termination

of the BIT under Article 14 thereof.

The Declaration upon which Latvia relies, which asserts an obligation on both Latvia

and the UK to terminate the BIT, was not implemented by Latvia and the UK.

In any event, th I these pre dings, Latvia has not d that the BIT has
been terminated. It contends that the BIT was suspended upon Latvia’s entry into the
EU. This proposition was originally put in terms that any incompatible section of the

BIT is “inapplicable for the duration of its incompatibility” >>>

(2) VCLT Article 5

Latvia invokes Article 5 of the VCLT for the proposition that decisions of the CJEU

“may override (as /ex superior) general rules of the law of treaties”. This Tribunal,

335 Respondent’s Memorial on the Bifurcated Objection, para. 241.

135

Latvia submits, should accept the decisions of the CJEU as lex superior. *°

quently it ck ised CJEU jud as lex specialis.*>7 Article 5 provides:

Subs.

The present Convention applies to any treaty which is the
constituent instrument of an international organization and to
any treaty adopted within an international organization without
prejudice to any relevant rules of the organization.

542. Latvia’s case is based on the proposition that CJEU judgments create “rules” of the EU
as an international organisation. The principles of primacy and autonomy are said to be
such “rules”.7*8 This proposition is supported by Article 19 of the TEU, which makes
CJEU judgements binding and therefore creates obligations. And “an obligation
establishes rules”.**° No authority for this elision from “binding” via “obligation” to
“rules” has been cited. The Tribunal finds Professor Talmon’s rejection of this approach

convincing.

543. First, Professor Talmon notes that Article 5, in terms, applies to the constituent
instrument of the organisation and any treaty adopted within the organisation. It does
not apply to bilateral treaties adopted outside the EU framework.*“° This is supported

341

 

by the commentary he quotes.**' However, the focus of Latvia’s submissions is not on

the BIT but on alleged “rules” developed by the CJEU under the EU Treaties.

544. Secondly, and of direct relevance, he states: “Court rulings are not ‘relevant rules’”

They interpret existing rules, but they are not rules themselves.*4”

545, The Tribunal accepts Professor Talmon’s opinion and rejects Latvia’s invocation of
Article 5. Specifically, the Tribunal rejects Latvia’s invocation of the Article to
characterise the principles of primacy and autonomy as “rules” of the EU as an

“organisation” and, accordingly, entitled to prevail or serve as a conflict rule.

(3) ICSID Convention Article 42(1)

Latvia relies on Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention to argue that EU law is
applicable not only to the merits, but also to the question of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Article 42 provides:

(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such
rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence
of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the
Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on
the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as
may be applicable.

(2) The Tribunal may not bring in a finding on non liquet on the
ground of silence or obscurity of the law.

(3) The provisions in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prejudice
the power of the Tribunal to decide a dispute ex aequo et
bono if the parties so agree.
The Tribunal will consider the application of this Article to the merits in that context.
The Tribunal upholds the Claimants’ contention that this provision has no application

to the issue of jurisdiction “4

The text is clear. The introductory words are: “The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in
accordance with...” The Article proceeds on the basis that the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal has been enlivened. It applies, and applies only, to the legal basis on which
the tribunal should “decide the dispute”. That is clearly a reference to the decision on

the merits.

This conclusion is reinforced by the contrast between the reference to the law “agreed
by the parties,” in the first sentence and the reference to “the law of the Contracting
State party to the dispute” in the second sentence. Similarly, the reference to
“applicable” international law picks up the word “apply” in the first part of the second
sentence. As Professor Talmon put it: the word “parties” refers to the parties to the

dispute, not to the parties to the BIT.*4°

550. The focus on the actual dispute in Article 42(1) is apparent from paragraphs (2) and (3)
of that Article and from the structure of the Convention. First, as the Claimants contend,
the word “dispute” is a reference back to the “dispute” in Article 25, which is directed
to the substantive issues. Secondly, the immediately preceding Article 41 is expressly
directed to the issue of jurisdiction. It allows a tribunal to deal with an objection to its
jurisdiction as a preliminary issue or to join it to the merits, in particular if it considers

that it does not have an exclusively preliminary character or is closely linked to the

 

issues. Article 41 provides:

Article 41:

(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.

(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is
not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons
is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be
considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to
deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits
of the dispute.

551. Both parties relied on the same leading Commentary on the ICSID Convention in

support of their submissions.*“°
552. The Claimants relied on this passage:

The prevailing view, that Art. 42 does not address questions of
jurisdiction, was reaffirmed in the Decision on Jurisdiction in
CMS y. Argentina.” The Tribunal held:

“88. Article 42 is mainly designed for the resolution of disputes
on the merits and, as such, it is in principle independent from the
decisions on jurisdiction, governed solely by Article 25 of the
Convention and those other provisions of the consent instrument
which might be applicable, in the instant case the Treaty
provisions. However, the argument of the Republic of Argentina
has merit in so far as the parties can agree to a different choice
of law applicable also to jurisdictional questions. The very
option the investor has under the Treaty to submit a dispute to
local jurisdiction also involves to an extent a choice of law
provision, as local courts will apply mainly domestic law. In

such a case, domestic law might apply together with the Treaty
and Convention or separately.”*4*

553. The Respondent relied on the subsequent reference:

Other tribunals have confirmed that the law applicable to the
tribunal’s jurisdiction were the provisions of the BIT and Art.
25. A minority of tribunals have recognized a role for the host
State’s domestic law [i-e. a source of law found in Article 42 of
the ICSID Convention] in determining jurisdiction.”

554. On the bas

That approach has been reinforced by subsequent precedents.*°° Furthermore, five

 

is of the textual analysis above, the Tribunal prefers the “prevailing view”.

years after the second edition of his Commentary was published, Professor Schreuer

appeared to accept that the “prevailing view” was now generally accepted. He wrote:

Tribunals have held consistently that questions of jurisdiction
are not subject to the law applicable to the merits of the case.
Questions of jurisdiction are governed by their own system
which is defined by the instruments containing the parties’
consent to jurisdiction.**!

555. The instruments of consent in this case, as the Claimants contend, are Article 25 of the

 

ICSID Convention and Article 8 of the BIT. As the Tribunal has indicated above, these

provisions govern the centrality of consent as a jurisdictional issue.
556, The Tribunal notes Latvia’s reliance on a passage in Tidewater:

[A]n ICSID tribunal determining its jurisdiction is not required
to interpret the instrument of consent according primarily to
national law, but rather has to take into account the principles
of international law. The next question naturally is to determine
which principles of international law are applicable.>**

557. In Tidewater the issue of jurisdiction under Article 25(1) did arise, in part, under

national law, because the relevant consent was contained ina local statute, not ina BIT.

argument put forward by the State, which the tribunal rejected on the facts.

559. The Tribunal finds the reasoning of the tribunal in Vattenfall convincing. Specifically,

considering the “applicable” principles of international law, the Tidewater

| made no reference to Article 42.

it agrees with the following passage:

118. Article 42(1) likewise only concerns the law applicable to
the merits of a dispute. The phrase “decide a dispute” points to
the application of those rules of law in order to decide the dispute
between the parties, and the ordinary meaning of that phrase
(pursuant to Article 31 VCLT) is that it refers to the substantive
dispute between the parties.

119. Under the ICSID Convention, a jurisdictional objection is
clearly demarcated from the merits of the dispute. When Article
42(1) refers to the applicable law when the Tribunal “decides a
dispute”, it therefore does not include a decision on any
jurisdictional objection. The view that Article 42 ICSID
Convention addresses the substantive law only, and not
questions of jurisdiction or procedure, is also held by Professor
Schreuer, whose commentary is relied upon by Claimants.**°

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty
shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble
and annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made
between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion
of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties
in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and

There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding
the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its
provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty
which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding
its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established
that the parties so intended.
Both the heading of the Section and the heading of the Article make it clear that every
part of Article 31 is concerned with interpretation, in the sense of determining the
meaning of a particular section of an international treaty. Each of the provisions
employs the word “shall”, indicating that they are all mandatory and must be considered

together.

The Tribunal agrees with the conclusion of the tribunal in Vattenfall when refusing to
apply Article 31(3)(c) in the manner submitted by the EC in that case. The starting point

for interpreting the BIT is paragraph | of Article 31, and not paragraph (3)(c) thereof.>**

Paragraph (3)(c) of Article 31 refers to matters that must “be taken into account” for

the purposes of determining the meaning of the BIT under consideration in these

358 Vattenfall, para. 153.

proceedings. Latvia’s approach would have the effect of writing Article 8 (and more)
out of the BIT completely. The Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ submission that such

cannot be the result of a process of interpretation. *°°

Latvia must look elsewhere for a conflicts clause. The Tribunal does not understand
that it was put that, in some way, membership of the EU could qualify the natural and
ordinary meaning of the word “consent”, whether in the ICSID Convention or in the

BIT. Insofar as it is suggested to have such effect, the Tribunal rejects the suggestion.

There is no ambiguity in the words “hereby consents” in Article 8. Nothing in the
relevant context suggests a qualified meaning. The meaning of the word must be
interpreted in the context as it existed at the time of the BIT, subject to each of the three

parts of subparagraph 3 of Article 31.

Nor does Latvia receive any support from the application of the full range of principles
of interpretation in Article 31. Indeed, to the contrary, the “object and purpose” which
Article 31(1) requires the Tribunal to apply, are to the contrary. They are to be found

in the Preamble to the BIT which reads as follows:

Desiring to create favourable conditions for greater investment
by nationals and companies of one State in the territory of the
other State;

  

Recognising that the encouragement and reciprocal protection

under international agreement of such investments will be

conducive to the stimulation of individual business initiative and

will increase prosperity in both States.
In any event, for the reasons the Tribunal has advanced above with respect to Article 5
of the VCLT, a decision of the CJEU is not a “rule” of international law within the
meaning of Article 31(3)(c). The Treaties contain such rules. The Tribunal will take

them into account below on the issue of incompatibility.

With respect to jurisdiction, the Respondent relies on Articles of the EU Treaties,
particularly: TFEU 267, 344, TEU 2,4,7 and 19, in the manner set out in the

359 See Vattenfall, para. 154.

Submissions section. It contends that the Tribunal should apply judgments of the CJEU

interpreting those Articles as obstacles to the exercise of jurisdiction in this case.

Contrary to Latvia’s case based on Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, culminating in the
conclusion of preclusion, this Tribunal cannot reach the result for which Latvia
contends. It has to apply the VCLT to the interpretation of the EU Treaties and the BIT.
As the evidence and submissions before the Tribunal from both sides made clear, the

CJEU did not apply the VCLT in the authorities relied on by Latvia.

The Tribunal cannot approach the Treaties as if it were a Constitutional Court by
adopting a teleological approach. It has to apply the VCLT, relevantly Article 31. Doing
so does not lead to any qualification of the meaning of “consent” in the ICSID
Convention or in the BIT in any relevant way. The Tribunal agrees with the conclusion
of the tribunal in Landesbank that any preclusion by force of EU law which must be
“taken into account” in accordance with VCLT Article 31(3)(c) “could not prevail over
the ordinary meaning of the text” of Article 8 of the BIT interpreted in good faith and

in its context, as required by Article 31.5
Latvia’s reliance on Article 31(3)(c) does not assist in supporting its objection.

(5) The Declaration and the Termination Agreement

Latvia also invokes Article 31(3)(a) and (b) in connexion with the Declaration and, to

some extent, with the Termination Agreement.

The first thing to note about the Declaration and the subsequent Termination Agreement
is that these documents do not state that they are directed to interpretation or application
of intra-EU bilateral investment treaties as international law. Moreover, there is no

reference in either to Article 31(3)(a) or (b) of the VCLT.

The Declaration and its subsequent implementation are directed to acknowledging the
binding force of the CJEU decision in Achmea and establishing an agreed process for
bringing Member States into compliance with that ruling. That includes the steps

Member States will take with respect to any investment treaty proceedings and the

3 Landesbank, para. 164.

143

575.

576.

577.

578.

termination of existing BITs. It also includes a commitment to extending protection of

investments under EU law.

As the Tribunal has indicated above, Article 31 of the VCLT is concerned with
interpretation. The Declaration is not. Latvia’s invocation of the word “application” is
closer to the mark.*°' However, as Professor Talmon said, the Declaration is not
concerned with how the BIT is to be applied. It asserts that it cannot be applied at all.

3 He refers to the reasoning of the WTO Appellate Body:

In our view, the term ‘application’ in Article 31(3)(a) relates
to the situation where an agreement specifies how existing
rules or obligations in force are to be ‘applied’; the term does
not connote the creation of new or the extension of existing
obligations that are subject to a temporal limitation and are
to expire
The Tribunal accepts this approach and concludes that the obliteration of a provision in

a treaty would not constitute an “application” of the Treaty.

The Declaration refers at one point to the absence of a “valid consent”. The document
then proceeds on the basis that, as a matter of EU law, consent should not have been
granted because the ISDS clause was “inapplicable”. (Equivalent to the CJEU’s
“precluded”).

The Tribunal accepts Professor Talmon’s conclusion that the Declaration is a statement
of the effect of EU law on Member States. It does not address the position of the BIT
as a matter of international law. As he notes, there is one footnote reference to general
public international law, the VCLT and the lex posterior principle.** That footnote

provides support for the text which rts that “Union law takes precedence over BITs

 

concluded between Member States.” It consists of two sentences. The first sentence
refers to two CJEU decisions and Declaration 17 to the Lisbon Treaty. That supports

the text. The next sentence, referring to international law, commences with the words:

“The same result follows under general international law....” It is clear that the
document is directed to the position under EU law. The reference to international law

is supportive but secondary and not the purport of the document.

The Termination Agreement carried into effect the intention expressed in the
Declaration to terminate intra-EU BITs. In addition to Achmea it referred to another
decision of the CJEU for the proposition that an agreement between Member States
cannot apply if the provisions are contrary to EU law.*® In terms of its import as a
matter of international law, this Agreement takes the matter no further than the

Declaration. The focus is on compliance with EU law.

In any event, the UK is not a party to the Termination Agreement. Latvia is a party.
However, the BIT in these proceedings was not in the list of BITs scheduled for
termination and has not been terminated. The Tribunal notes that the EC has issued an
infringement notice to the UK for failing to terminate its intra-EU BITs. That is not

relevant for the issue before the Tribunal.

Article 31(3) requires the Tribunal to take into account the matters therein. We repeat
that this is a process of interpretation. Deleting a clause in its entirety cannot be
described as interpretation. In any event, having taken these matters into account the
Tribunal concludes that they do not have the effect of depriving the Tribunal of its

jurisdiction over this dispute.

E. INCOMPATIBILITY

582.

(1) The EU Treaties
The principal provisions to establish incompatibility, relied on by Latvia, are TFEU

Articles 267 and 344:

Article 267

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have
jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:

(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

365 Budéjovicky Budvar.

145

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions,
bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;

Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a
Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a
decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give
judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a
court or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions
there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or
tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.

If such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or
tribunal of a Member State with regard to a person in custody,
the Court of Justice of the European Union shall act with the
minimum of delay.

Article 344

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of
settlement other than those provided for herein.

Those provision are to be interpreted in the light of TEU Articles
2, 4(3) and 19:

583. TEU Articles 2, 4(3) and 19, in turn, provide as follows:

Article 2

The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity,
freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for
human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to
minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a
society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance,
justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.

Article 4(3)

Pursuant to the principle of sincere cooperation, the Union and
the Member States shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other
in carrying out s which flow from the Treaties.

   

 

The Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general
or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out
of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the
Union.

146

The Member States shall facilitate the achievement of the
Union’s tasks and refrain from any measure which could
jeopardise the attainment of the Union’s objectives.

Article 19

1. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall include the
Court of Justice, the General Court and specialised courts. It
shall ensure that in the interpretation and application of the
Treaties the law is observed.

 

Member States shall provide remedies sufficient to ensure
effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law.

N

. The Court of Justice shall consist of one judge from each
Member State. It shall be assisted by Advocates-General.

The General Court shall include at least one judge per Member
State.

The Judges and the Advocates-General of the Court of Justice
and the Judges of the General Court shall be chosen from
persons whose independence is beyond doubt and who satisfy
the conditions set out in Articles 253 and 254 of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union. They shall be
appointed by common accord of the governments of the
Member States for six years. Retiring Judges and Advocates-
General may be reappointed.

3. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall, in
accordance with the Treaties:

(a) rule on actions brought by a Member State, an institution
or a natural or legal person;

(b) give preliminary rulings, at the request of courts or
tribunals of the Member States, on the interpretation of

Union law or the validity of acts adopted by the
institutions;

(c) rule in other cases provided for in the Treaties.

ions draws attention to a history of doubts

about the validity of BITs under EU law.*% Professor Tridimas reinforces this

367

 

ance to the Tribunal. It consists of:

The fact that in 2004 the EC instituted proceedings asserting that some BITs of
three Member States were inconsistent with EU law. These contentions were
upheld by the CJEU. However, the cases concerned BITs with third States and
involved challenges of specific provisions. They had nothing to do with the intra-

EU objection and are of no relevance to the consent to arbitrate.

There are a number of references to doubts within the EC about the continued
efficacy of intra-EU BITs commencing with an internal memorandum in 2006.

The Executive branch, however, does not determine legality.

The point was taken in an intra-EU investment treaty case by the Czech Republic
that commenced in 2004.°°* The arbitral tribunal rejected the State’s submission

ion. The tribunal had before it the EC document

 

that the BIT terminated on ace
of 2006 which expressed the opinion that the ISDS clause would not operate
where EU regulations existed. However, the authors expressly stated that
accession did NOT automatically terminate intra-EU BITs and it would be
necessary to terminate such agreements in accordance with their terms. It added

that termination would not have retroactive effect.

Reliance was also placed on the fact that some Member States terminated their
intra-EU BITs. The Czech Republic commenced doing so in 2005 but had not
completed that process, including its BIT with Latvia, at the time of these

proceedings.*°

3 “1998 Europe (Association) Agreement between the European Communiti

e Ireland terminated its BITs in 2012 and Italy did so in 2013. The EC formally
requested five Member States to terminate all intra-EU BITs between them. It is

not clear why these states were asked and others, including Latvia, were not.

e Ofsome 150 intra-EU BITs in existence in 2004, the date that Latvia submits its
BIT with the UK was “suspended”, a substantial majority were still in force in the
subsequent years. That continued to be the case at the time Achmea was handed
down. On the materials before the Tribunal, those that had been terminated were

done in accordance with their terms.

The EC has been concerned for some time that bilateral investment treaties between
Member States potentially cut across its regulation of commercial transactions within
the EU, particularly the principle of a single market. Nevertheless,the predominant view
of the Member States rejected the idea of incompatibility. Only a small proportion of

intra-EU BITs had been terminated prior to Achmea.

Nothing in the prior history suggests that the opinion that the arbitration clause was
inconsistent with EU law was held by Member States, other than the Czech Republic,
and much later Slovakia in the context of the Achmea arbitration, nor widely held

within EU institutions, at or about Latvia’s accession in 2004.

Indeed, the Association agreements, including that of Latvia,>”’ encouraged prospective
Members to enter into BITs in preparation for joining the EU. There was no suggestion

that adherence to such treaties may need to be reviewed after accession.
As Counsel for the Claimants put it:

The EU would not encourage Latvia to enter into BITs with their
specified durations, with their binding legal commitments, with
their sunset clauses, if there were any understanding that they
might shortly become illegal upon accession.>7!

The Tribunal finds that the predominant opinion prior to Achmea was that expressed by

Advocate General Wathelet in that case. In a careful analysis, referring to CJEU case

Latvia,” Official Journal of the European Communities, 2 February 1998, CL-255, Article 74.

law, he concluded, most relevantly, albeit with an expression of doubt about the ICSID

Convention, that:

e Article 344 of the TFEU did not prevent references to arbitration between

individuals and Member States.*””
¢ As the BIT is not itself EU law, Article 344 does not apply.”

591. That this was the dominant view at the time of Latvia’s accession to the EU is confirmed
by the fact that neither Latvia, nor on the materials before the Tribunal, any of the other
new Member States, exercised the right under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention to
require the exhaustion of local remedies. It appears to the Tribunal that Achmea would

have no application if that had occurred.

(3) CJEU Interpretations

592. Notwithstanding its reliance on the language of Article 344 of the TFEU, Latvia accepts
that the Tribunal may interpret the Treaties for purposes of this jurisdictional objection,

on the principle of competence/competence.

593. The primarily relevant incompatibility arises from the preclusion under EU law of the
investor-State dispute settlement mechanism found in Article 8 of the BIT, as
determined in Achmea. The CETA Opinion broadens the application of the scope of

incompatibility, but it does not impinge on the issue of consent in a different way.

594, This Tribunal cannot simply transpose the interpretations of the EU Treaties in these
decisions into this arbitration. As noted above, they were not developed on the basis of
applying the VCLT principles of interpretation, which it has to apply. Specifically, the
Tribunal cannot apply a test turning on the mere possibility of incompatibility creating
a conflict, which is the test applied by the CJEU in Achmea. There must be an actual

incompatibility.

595. The principle of harmonious interpretation, invoked by the Claimants, and the cognate

principle of systemic integration, referred to by the Respondent, only apply if the two

laws said to be in conflict derive from the same source. The international law element
of the dual characterisation of EU law satisfies that condition. It is appropriate to apply

that principle here.

The issue for the Tribunal is whether Latvia’s express written consent by way of treaty,
in the form of a standing offer, was no longer in existence at the time the Claimants
accepted it. Consent is a positive act requiring deliberate conduct. Harmonious
interpretation of Article 8 of the BIT requires the same kind of conduct for removal of
the consent that had been given. A judicial decision that, by force of another set of legal
obligations, concludes that the consent should never have been given, is not of that

character. The obligation not to grant consent is not self-executing.

It is pertinent to note that the Tribunal is dealing with an offer made to a third party to
the BIT itself. Such a third party accepted the standing offer prior to the definitive
decision precluding the making of the offer as a matter of EU law. That is the only fact

it needs to take into account on jurisdiction.

The Preamble of the VCLT states fundamental principles which the Tribunal bears in
mind. It states: “Noting that the principles of free consent and of good faith and the
pacta sunt servanda rule are universally recognised.” The same principles of good faith
and pacta sunt servanda are embodied in Article 26. Giving the CJEU decisions
retroactive effect in the present circumstances, would violate each of these principles.
The Tribunal finds that the retroactive effect of these CJEU decisions is ineffective in

international law.

There is a certain incongruence in Latvia’s case when it submits that something that is
“precluded” is only “suspended”. However, there is an understandable reason for
adopting that position, turning on the sunset clause in Article 14 of the BIT. The

Tribunal has not been invited to interpret and apply that provision.

The two provisions which were the subject of the reference to the CJEU in Achmea
were Article 344 of the TFEU, pursuant to which Latvia undertook not to refer a dispute
concerning the interpretation or application of the EU Treaties, and Article 267, which
established the preliminary ruling procedure for the interpretation of the EU Treaties.

Nothing in the language of those provisions impinges directly on Latvia’s express

151

605.

consent. The interpretation of both Articles must take into account the context,

including the other Articles which Latvia invokes.

The Tribunal finds, by application of the rules of treaty interpretation, as codified in the
VCLT, unaffected by constitutional principles of interpretation, that Article 344 of the
TFEU, in its context, is directed to disputes concerning the interpretation or application

of the EU Treaties. It is not concerned with investor-state disputes under the BITs.

Applying the same approach to treaty interpretation, Article 267 of the TFEU, in its
context, concerns the preliminary ruling procedure to be followed by a court or tribunal
of a Member State. It does not apply to a tribunal created pursuant to an agreement
governed by international law between a national of a Member State and another

Member State.

Further, the consequences of the breach of the EU law obligations on which Latvia
relies is not the subject of any express provision to which the Tribunal’s attention has
been drawn. Nothing in the materials before it suggests that a breach renders the consent
void as distinct from voidable. The very word used by the CJEU - “precluded” - does
not suggest that past, inconsistent conduct is set aside. It suggests that such conduct

constitutes a breach of an obligation, with consequences that have to be determined.

The relevant incompatibility or conflict, to be resolved by application of conflict rules
which the Tribunal can apply, is between the express words of a bilateral treaty and
decisions of a Final Court of a regional organisation and its international legal order

created by the Treaties.

The Tribunal has accepted that decisions of the CJEU have a dual characterisation:
international and domestic/constitutional. The combination leads it to adopt the
terminology suggested by the ICJ in Kosovo discussed above. CJEU decisions have an
“international legal character”, or in the Electrabel/Vattenfall formulation “applicable
on the plane of international law”. That is, in the Tribunal’s view, sufficient to require
resolution of the actual conflict thus created, by application of the relevant conflict rules

of international law.

CONFLICT RULES
(1) Lex Superior/Primacy

Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT was one of the bases on which Latvia contended that EU
law should operate as /ex superior.>™ As the Tribunal has said, that Article concerns
interpretation and does not contain a conflict rule. The Tribunal has also rejected the

invocation of Article 5 of the VCLT for this purpose.

Latvia also contends that the EU principle of primacy is a conflict rule of international
law which precludes any international agreement between Member States that is
incompatible with EU law. It invokes the principle of /ex superior. That characterisation

adds nothing but a label to the EU law primacy submission.

Latvia invokes Declaration 17 annexed to the Lisbon Treaty on 7 December 2007. This
statement in fact suggests the opposite conclusion. It limits the doctrine of primacy of
the Treaties to “the law of Member States”. There is no suggestion in Declaration 17

that it extends to inter-se treaties.

Latvia refers to several CJEU precedents: Matteucci, Exportur and Ravil>, These
cases do support the proposition that, in the case of a conflict with EU law, the EU
treaties prevail over prior bilateral agreements between Member States. Professor
Tridimas refers to another CJEU precedent where a statement to the same effect was

made.37°

Professors Tridimas and Talmon have expressed conflicting opinions on whether the
EU law principle of primacy is addressed to international agreements of Member States,

as well as to the internal legislative, executive and judicial organs of such States.

Professor Talmon quotes a number of statements in CJEU judgments which appear to
treat agreements between Member States as national law. He concludes that there is no
authority which expressly refers to the principle of primacy in its application to

international agreements.>77

616.

The three cases relied on by Latvia do not deploy the word “primacy.” Nor does the
additional authority referred to by Professor Tridimas. But the effect of the reasoning
is precisely that. In the case of a conflict with EU law, EU law prevails over a prior

bilateral agreement between Member States.

Professor Talmon accepted in cross-examination that these cases established that
obligations under the bilateral treaties were suspended in EU law, but maintained that
this was because EU law treated such treaties as national law.*”* In the event, Professor
Talmon accepted that a bilateral treaty may have been part of the EU legal order, but it

was also part of the international legal order.>”

The Tribunal accepts that a bilateral agreement between EU Member States that is
inconsistent with EU law is ineffective as a matter of EU law. However, that is
insufficient to characterise primacy as a conflict rule of international law applicable in
the case of a prior bilateral agreement. This is another example of the difficulties which

arise from dual characterisation.

The Respondent’s submissions in this respect are to the same effect as those dismissed

by the Tribunal in Vattenfall. This Tribunal agrees with what was stated therein:

Respondent identifies no principle of public international law, or
even of EU law, which would permit the Tribunal to interpret the
words of the ECT, being its foundational jurisdictional
instrument, so as to give priority to external treaties (the TFEU

and the TEU), and a court judgment interpreting those treaties.*°°

 

The judgments of the CJEU have an “international legal character”, to use the
terminology of the ICJ in Kosovo. They are not, however, of a superior status in
international law to a treaty between sovereign States. Nor are they of superior status
to the source of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The ICSID Convention is one of the most
widely adopted international regimes including, as far as the Tribunal is aware, all the

Member States of the EU with the exception of Poland.

(2) Lex Specialis

617. Latvia invokes the concept of a “special self-contained regime” as set out in the ILC

381

Fragmentation Report’™' as a form of /ex specialis. It submits that the system of

institutions and rules created by and pursuant to the EU Treaties is such a regime.

618. Nothing in the analysis of the ILC suggests that what the authors had in mind was
applicable to an integrated, wide ranging set of treaties and institutions that created a
new closely integrated polity. All of the examples given in that part of the Report had
a specificity capable of characterisation as /ex specialis. The Report refers to “rules and
principles concerned with a particular subject matter” and “rules and principles that

>» 382

regulate a certain problem area None of the examples given are of the breadth and

diversity of matters within the EU.

619, Other than this “regime” point, the natural application of the concept of lex specialis
leads to the conclusion that investment treaty protection was more specific than the
breadth of the EU regime. The authorities that come to that conclusion are

convincing.**

620. The Tribunal notes Latvia’s contention that the primacy principle applied to the BIT as
lex specialis, in the context of Article 5 of the VCLT, in favour of more generalised
tules of conflict such as Articles 30 or 59 of the VCLT. For the above reasons the
Tribunal rejects Latvia’s invocation of Article 5. The EU law principle of primacy is
neither more nor less “special” than the BIT. It is relevant only if it applies to make EU

law entitled to predominance. The Tribunal discusses this contention below.

(3) Lex Posterior

621. In this respect the parties refer to the following provisions of the VCLT:

Article 30 relevantly provides:

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations,
the rights and obligations of States Parties to successive
treaties relating to the same subject-matter shall be determined
in accordance with the following paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not
to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty,
the provisions of that other treaty prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to
the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or
suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty
applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible
with those of the later treaty.

Article 59 provides:

1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties
to it conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject-matter
and:

(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise
established that the parties intended that the matter should
be governed by that treaty; or

(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible
with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not
capable of being applied at the same time.

2. The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in
operation if it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise
established that such was the intention of the parties.

622. Articles 65 and 67 relevantly provide:

Article 65

1. A party which, under the provisions of the present
Convention, invokes either a defect in its consent to be bound
by a treaty or a ground for impeaching the validity of a treaty,
terminating it, withdrawing from it or suspending its operation,
must notify the other parties of its claim. The notification shall

156

indicate the measure proposed to be taken with respect to the
treaty and the reasons therefor.

2. If, after the expiry of a period which, except in cases of
special urgency shall not be less than three months after the
receipt of the notification, no party has raised any objection,
the party making the notification may carry out in the manner
provided in article 67 the measure which it has proposed.

4. Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall affect the rights
or obligations of the parties under any provisions in force
binding the parties with regard to the settlement of disputes.

Article 67

1. The notification provided for under article 65, paragraph 1,
must be made in writing.

2. Any act declaring invalid, terminating, withdrawing from or
suspending the operation of a treaty pursuant to the provisions
of the treaty or of paragraphs 2 or 3 of article 65 shall be carried
out through an instrument communicated to the other parties.
If the instrument is not signed by the Head of State, Head of
Government or Minister for Foreign Affairs, the representative
of the State communicating it may be called upon to produce
full powers.

623. The requirements for termination and, relevantly, for suspension of a treaty are
reinforced by Article 42(2) of the VCLT which provides:
The termination of a treaty, its denunciation or the withdrawal of
a party,...may take place only as a result of the application of the

provisions of the treaty or of the present Convention. The same
rule applies to suspension of the operation of a treaty.

624, It is also pertinent to note Article 72 of the VCLT which provides:
1. Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwise

agree, the suspension of the operation of a treaty under its
provisions or in accordance with the present Convention:

157

625.

626.

627.

628.

629,

(a) releases the parties between which the operation of the
treaty is suspended from the obligation to perform the treaty
in their mutual relations during the period of the suspension;

(b) does not otherwise affect the legal relations between the
parties established by the treaty.

2. During the period of the suspension the parties shall refrain
from acts tending to obstruct the resumption of the operation of
the treaty.

All of these Articles appear in Part V of the VCLT headed “Invalidity, Termination and
Suspension of the Operation of Treaties”. The Part also makes detailed provision for

many aspects of, relevantly, suspension of parts of a treaty.

The idea that later law generally supersedes earlier law is a well-established principle
in most legal systems. As the Tribunal has identified a conflict between EU law and the

BIT, the /ex posterior principle is potentially applicable.

Latvia invokes the JLC Fragmentation Report which, in one comment, appears to have
particular resonance for the position of a treaty between two Members States of the EU,
which came into force between them before one of them became a Member State. The
Report said:

The /ex posterior principle is at its strongest in regard to

conflicting or overlapping provisions that are part of treaties that

are institutionally linked or otherwise intended to advance

similar objectives (i.e. form part of the same regime).>*4
This is a different point to the regime point the Tribunal has considered under /ex
specialis. It is not focused on characterising EU law. It is directed to drawing out the
implications of the ‘institutional link.’ Such a link exists because both parties to the
BIT have obligations and receive the benefits as the Members of the EU. The Tribunal
notes the contrast between the concept of advancing “similar objectives” and the “same

subject matter” formulation of Article 30 of the VCLT, which it discussed below.

Latvia relies on Article 59(2) and submits that the BIT is s

 

spended, rather than

terminated under Article 59(1). This interpretation would avoid the lengthy sunset

“4 ILC Fragmentation 18 July Report, RL-00316, para. 14(26).

634,

period upon termination for which Article 14 of the BIT provides. Although Latvia,
and the EC, submit that Article 14 is also precluded, that issue was not part of the case
before the Tribunal.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that the BIT is suspended. First, the procedure expressly
laid down in the VCLT for suspension of a treaty was not followed. There was no
notification, in writing, identifying the grounds for suspending the BIT, with reasons
under Articles 65(1) and 67(1). Specifically, there was no Instrument signed by the
Head of State, Head of Government or Minister of Foreign Affairs or other expressly

authorised person, as required by Article 67(2).

Further, there was no opportunity for the UK to object to the suspension and invoke the
procedure for settlement under Article 65(3) and the further detailed procedures for

determining the dispute set out in Article 66.

In the interests of legal certainty with respect to obligations undertaken by a State in a
treaty, these procedural steps are mandatory. Article 65(1) states that the State “must
notify” and what the notification “shall indicate”. Similarly, Article 67(2) requires a
suspension to be set forth in a formal instrument. The mandatory nature of this
procedure is put beyond doubt by Article 42(2) which state that suspension can “take
place only” in accordance with the VCLT or the particular treaty. There is no

suspension provision in the BIT.

Secondly, in order to apply Article 59(2) it must “appear” from the later treaty, or be
otherwise established, that the parties actually intended that the earlier treaty should
stand suspended. There is virtually nothing before the Tribunal by way of evidence, or
indeed submission beyond assertion, to suggest that that was the intention of Latvia and
the UK at the time that Latvia joined the EU, about seventeen years ago. Apparently,
the Tribunal is to draw that inference, primarily from decisions of the CJEU which all
Member States of the EU have to respect. The two States have the obligation to respect
a decision of the court, but that is not evidence of intention. An obligation is not an

intention.

No such intention appears from the EU Treaties themselves. Further, the Tribunal does
not accept that an inference of such an intention can be drawn from the materials before

it, particularly an inference of an intention to take effect at the time Latvia joined the

638.

639,

EU. The Tribunal has set out above the very limited number of Member States which
terminated intra-EU BITs by that time. Even assuming that was done for legal reasons,

neither Latvia nor the UK did so.
The Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent’s reliance on Article 59.

Alternatively, Latvia invokes Article 30 of the VCLT, set out above. As Article 30(3)
states, this Article can apply if Article 59 does not. Article 30 shares an important
element with Article 59. Each is triggered by a finding that the two treaties must “relate
to the same subject matter”. However, contrary to Article 59, there is no mandatory
procedure for invoking Article 30. Nor is there a need to identify a relevant intent. The

ultimate test is one of incompatibility.

As indicated above, the Tribunal cannot apply the CJEU’s approach that even a possible
incompatibility is sufficient. That approach appears to be derived from the
constitutional element of the Court’s reasoning. It is not an approach that is appropriate

for the interpretation of compatibility in Article 30(3).

The Tribunal notes the Respondent’s submission that Article 30 is concerned with
incompatibility and the same subject matter element is not a pre-condition to its
application.**5 This argument cannot be reconciled with the structure of the Article. The
first paragraph establishes the requirement expressly and states that rights and
obligations are to be established in accordance with the next two paragraphs. If the
authors wished to establish a test of incompatibility simpliciter that would have been

an easy drafting task.

The interpretation of the words “same subject matter” is, as the detailed analysis in the
first ILC Fragmentation Report shows, a complex matter. It cannot be approached
merely on the basis of dictionary definitions of the words. The ILC concluded that a
strict interpretation is “neither a necessary nor a reasonable interpretation” of the

words.** That is so for the reasons set out at length earlier in the first Report.**”

643.

The ILC notes that a treaty may often be classified in multiple ways and indicated that

a focus on the word “same” would result in a treaty being applied on a basis that was:

crucially dependent on how it would classify under some
(presumably) pre-existing classification scheme of different
subjects. But there are no such classification schemes.
Everything would be in fact dependent on argumentative success
in pigeon-holing legal instruments... .***

 

The Tribunal rejects Latvia’s submission that there is no difference between
interpretation and conflicts. The JLC Fragmentation Report on which this proposition
is based does not say that they are the same. The learned authors indicate that the
process of determining whether a conflict exists is not just an exercise in logical
reasoning. It involves interpretation of the two treaties said to be in conflict.**? The
Tribunal is of the view that determination of whether there is a conflict involves two
stages. The scope of each of the two treaties in issue must be determined by a process

of interpretation. Only after that is done can any relevant incompatibility be identified.

The Claimants invoke a substantial body of precedent, focussed on investment treaty
cases, which applies a strict interpretation of the words “same subject matter”. In those
cases, the trigger is confined, in different but cognate terminology, to treaties which
have the same general objective and, as it is sometimes put, “share a degree of general

comparability”.*°° A number of these cases expressly reject the proposition that
391

 

investment treaties share the same subject matter with EU law.

One aspect of this substantial body of case law is that none of the cases focus on the
words “relating to”, indeed few even mention it as relevant terminology. All focus on
“same subject matter”. However, the words “relating to”, as the Respondent submits,

involve a broad set of possible connections. The Tribunal is of the view that a focus on

648,

the word “same” is too restrictive if it fails to take account of the potential breadth of

the words of connection.

Precedents from investment treaty case law are not binding on later tribunals. There is

no doctrine of stare decisis in this sphere of legal discourse. As a matter of comity and

 

in order to ensure a high degree of certainty of the law, normally a substantial body of
prior decisions that appears to represent a shared view will be treated with appropriate
respect. However, a Tribunal is not subject to any restriction if it comes to a clear view

that a line of precedent requires modification.

The Tribunal has before it a number of analyses of the overlap between protection of

investments under the BITs and under EU law. Advocate-General Wathelet set out

 

considerable detail on this issue in his Opinion before the Court in Achmea.**” There

are also some detailed academic writings.*> The EC published a statement in support

of this approach.>*

No doubt drawing on these materials, Latvia’s submissions focused on three aspects of
the EU which it contended showed a substantial degree of overlap between EU law and
the BIT. First, it identified the requirements of a single market and the means by which
that is enforced, notably by the principles against discrimination between Member
States. Secondly, and overlapping with the first, the existence and application of the
four freedoms guaranteed by the TEU: freedom of movement of goods, services, capital
and persons. Thirdly, protection of the right to property under the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

The objective of the BIT set out in the Preamble the Tribunal has quoted above, is the
promotion of cross-border investment. The EU single market and the four freedoms

have a similar purpose within the borders of the EU.

Further, the Tribunal accepts that there is substantial overlap between the protections

available under the four freedoms and the Charter with respect to expropriation

protection under the BIT and, in view of the EU law on legitimate expectations, with

the fair and equitable treatment standard. However, these are matters going to merits.

If Latvia is correct that the same subject matter threshold is met, the issue with respect
to jurisdiction is compatibility under paragraph 3 of Article 30. The CJEU has
determined that Article 8 is not compatible with EU law. As we have set out above, this
Tribunal has to determine such issues for itself by application of the principles of treaty
interpretation without the teleological approach adopted by the CJEU. That Court’s
determination of the exclusivity of its own jurisdiction, notably the preliminary ruling

procedure, is also a manifestation of such constitutional interpretation.

The Tribunal appreciates the jurisprudential process by which the CJEU determined the
scope of its authority. However, it is not bound by the CJEU’s approach. When
determining incompatibility the Tribunal is focused on the simplicity of the relevant
word---“consent”. That word finds its origins in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.
BIT Article 8 is the means chosen to express that consent in the particular context of

the BIT.

The relevant conflict, as the Claimants submitted, is not between the EU Treaties and
the BIT. It is between the EU Treaties and the ICSID Convention. Where the latter
expressly permitted a reservation for the exhaustion of local remedies, the principle of
harmonious interpretation should be applied with the effect that there is no

incompatibility between the two dispute resolution processes.

The Tribunal is reinforced in this interpretation by the fact that so few intra-EU BITs
were terminated prior to Achmea. It is not clear that those who terminated those treaties
believed there to be an incompatibility. A significant majority of States did not believe

there was.

The Tribunal rejects an interpretation of the EU treaties which, in effect, not only
requires exhaustion of local remedies under the guidance of the CJEU, but precludes
the recourse to an international tribunal offered by the BIT to an investor who feels

unable to vindicate his rights in the national courts.

Further, unlike the CJEU, the Tribunal does not accept that the mere possibility that a

tribunal will reach a result that an EU court would not reach is sufficient. The judiciaries

163

655.

656.

657.

658.

of all legal systems sometimes have to apply foreign law. The exercise of that
jurisdiction sometimes leads to divergent outcomes. That is simply a manifestation of
the fact that there is no international court with global jurisdiction. For the same reason,
there is no warrant for any court or tribunal to refuse to exercise its actual jurisdiction.
Indeed, many ICSID tribunals and annulment committees have emphasized the duty of
a tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention to exercise the jurisdiction entrusted

to it

Aspects of the scope of EU law may arise on the merits, pursuant to ICSID Article 42.

It is not appropriate to comment on that in this Decision.
The principle of lex posterior has no application to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

(4) BIT Articles 11 and 3

The Claimants invoked the ‘more favourable treatment clause in Article 11 of the BIT
and also the MFN clause in Article 3. In view of the conclusions the Tribunal has
reached on the Claimants’ primary submissions, it is unnecessary to deal with these

alternative cases.

(5) VCLT Articles 27 and 46

The Claimants invoke VCLT Articles 27 and 46. These Articles provide:

Article 27
A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as
justification for its failure to perform a treaty. This rule is
without prejudice to article 46.

Article 46

1. A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound
by a treaty has been expressed in violation of a provision of
its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties as
invalidating its consent unless that violation was manifest and
concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental
importance.

2. A violation is manifest if it would be objectively evident to
any state conducting itself in the matter in accordance with
normal practice and in good faith.
The Tribunal notes that Article 46 applies to “consent to be bound by a treaty”. It

accepts the Respondent’s submission that this Article is not relevant.

Article 27 is one of two Articles in a section entitled “Observance of Treaties”. The
other, Article 26, asserts the principle of pacta sunt servanda: every treaty is binding

and must be performed in good faith.

Article 27 turns on the concept of “internal law”. This raises an unusual issue in a

context where the EU Treaties have a dual character.

 

The Respondent’s submissions and Professor Tridimas’ evidence proceeded on the

ion of EU

  

basis that the issue under Article 27 was a choice concerning the characterise

law as “international law” or “domestic law”. The Professor described the choice as

 

“binary”.°*° That customary distinction is not of assistance in the case of a law which

 

may be either or both.

Article 27 does not expressly put forward such a choice. It applies if the appropriate
characterisation is “internal”. Such questions of characterisation cannot be answered in
the abstract by attaching a label. They require an analysis of the particular

circumstances in which they arise.

The issue before this Tribunal is how to characterise the law which is said to have the
consequence that the express offer to arbitrate in Article 8(1) of the BIT ceased to exist.

This has not been an easy task.

Professor Tridimas, whilst rejecting the position that EU law was “internal”, also set
out the mechanism by which EU law became binding on Latvia. He notes that both the
UK and Latvia are dualist nations which require the incorporation of international law
into domestic law. The UK did so by the European Communities Act 1972 and Latvia

did so by adding three provisions to its Constitution in 2002.57

Professor Tridimas also said:

. subject to isolated exceptions, the courts of Member States
adhere to the principle of primacy but derive its normative
foundations not from EU law but the provisions of the national
constitution which establishes the legal basis of EU membership.
From the perspective of national courts, EU law is a derived legal
order, its binding effect anchoring in the domestic legal
system.>%
Prima facie, this process answers the description of “internal law”. However, as the
Respondent submitted, this would imply that any international agreement made
applicable by local legislation would lose its status as international law. Indeed, that
would be the case for all international treaties in dualist nations. That is not a reasonable
interpretation of Article 27 in which the concept of “internal law” is counterposed with

performance of treaty obligations.

In a case, such as the present, where the same law is capable of being characterised as
either international or internal, it is necessary to identify the nature of the application
of the law in the particular circumstances. As we have indicated above, the Tribunal is
of the view that the relevant principles in Achmea are a manifestation of EU

constitutional law. As such, it is an internal law within the meaning of Article 27.

The question before this Tribunal is not, however, whether an international agreement
loses its status as international law, but whether the EU Treaties, as they apply within
the EU, override purely international obligations undertaken by Member States. Within
each Member State, those treaties have, as Professor Tridimas puts it, a “binding effect
anchoring in the domestic legal system.” Once anchored in the domestic legal system,
however, Article 27 prevents them from being invoked as justification for a state’s

failure to perform a treaty.

G. CONCLUSION

670.

For the above reasons the Tribunal rejects Latvia’s case that EU law operates as

applicable law on the issue of jurisdiction. It also rejects Latvia’s submissions that there

672.

is any conflict rule which could have the result that EU law could prevail over the terms

of the BIT, specifically with respect to Article 8, as a matter of international law.

The fact that Latvia may be in breach of its legal obligations under EU law is not, in

and of itself, determinative of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. As Lord Neuberger put it:

Wrongful consent nonetheless constitutes consent, and in order

to establish jurisdiction, consent (whether rightly or wrongly

given) is all that is required.>”
The Tribunal finds that Latvia’s consent, contained in Article 8, has not been
suspended, superseded or vitiated in any way. The offer contained therein was open to
acceptance by the Claimants at the time they accepted it by filing the Request for
Arbitration.

V. SCOPE OF THE BIFURCATION

A. THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

675.

 

(1) Claimants’ Submissions

The Claimants contend that the Respondents’ case on admissibility, in whole or in large
part, is beyond the scope of the bifurcated issue defined in the Tribunal’s Decision on
Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation dated 1 March 2019 (the “Decision on
Bifurcation”) and its Decision on Application to Reconsider the Decision on

Bifurcation (the “Reconsideration Decision”) of 2 July 2019.

Prior to the Tribunal’s Decision on Bifurcation, no EU law admissibility objections had

been raised by Latvia.

The Decision on Bifurcation expressly confined the scope of bifurcation to

jurisdictional issues.4°

arbitration mechanism under the UK-Latvia BIT as a preliminary matter”) (emphasis is Shareholder Claimants’).

681.

The first admissibility objection was raised in Latvia’s Memorial on the Bifurcated

Issue (May 2019). The Claimants delineate this as the “Applicable Law Admissibility

 

Objection.”

The Applicable Law Admissibility Objection is to the effect that the claim is

inadmissible on the basis of EU law, i.e. that:

... this Tribunal must find that, on the basis of EU law, which is

incompatible with and supersedes the Latvia-UK BIT, it lacks

jurisdiction over the present dispute, and, why, in addition, the
4s

claim, ible on the merits because it is luded by
EU law.

 

 

...considering that the applicable law to the merits of the dispute
is EU law, the present claim is inadmissible. This is so because
EU_law_precludes Member States from allowing _ the
interpretation and application of EU law from being made by an
international arbitral tribunal with no connection with the EU

legal order, such as an ICSID tribunal.*'

 

The Applicable Law Admissibility Objection was further particularised in Latvia’s
August 2019 Reply, which based the objection on the “international public policy of
the [EUP4

The Tribunal’s Reconsideration Decision reiterated that Latvia’s preliminary objection

concerned the Tribunal’s “jurisdiction.”4°

What the Claimants termed “Belated Admissibility Objections” were then raised by
Latvia at the September 2019 Hearing.“ As will appear, the Claimants submit that
these admissibility objections cannot be dealt with in the current bifurcated phase (if

any can be, which they deny), as being, inter alia, abusive.

The Claimants’ primary argument in response to Latvia’s admissibility objections is

that all of Latvia’s EU law admissibility objections were not before the Tribunal before

its Decision on Bifurcation, so that none of them could have informed the decision to
bifurcate. The Claimants contend that a ruling on admissibility is distinct from, and

presupposes a prior affirmative ruling on, jurisdiction.“ It follows that all the EU law

 

admi:

 

ibility objections, which are not objections to jurisdiction, but are objections to
admissibility, were not ordered to be bifurcated, are not to be dealt with as preliminary
matters, and remain joined to the merits, to be dealt with after the Tribunal’s

jurisdictional determination.

682. The Claimants say that the reference at paragraph 149 of the Decision on Bifurcation

 

to sub-issues which “may also lead to a decision on the admissibility standard, capable
of affecting the continuation of these proceedings,” does not undermine their argument
since: (1) the Tribunal never held that a decision on the admissibility standard is capable
of “affecting the continuation of these proceedings” upon the conclusion of the
bifurcated phase, let alone where proceedings on the merits are suspended and
pleadings on the merits are thus excluded; and (2) admissibility objections can only be

raised by a respondent.*””

683. The Claimants submit that the absence of any admissibility objections being brought

before the Tribunal prior to the Decision on Bifurcation explains why their Counter-

 

Memorial on the Bifurcation Objection (July 2019) did not address admissibility. In

these circumstances, it would be inconsistent with the Decision on Bifurcation (and
later procedural directions), and irregular, to dispose of the EU Law Admissibility

Objections at this phase. The EU Law Admissibility Objections should be dealt with at

the merits phase.*°*

684. In the alternative, the Claimants submit that only the Applicable Law Admissibility
Objection was timely. The rest (Belated Admissibility Objections) are procedurally

unfair/abusive and cannot be dealt with at the Bifurcated phase. They must be dismissed

or deferred to the merits.

(2) Respondent’s Submissions

685. The Respondent submits that its admissibility objection is part of the Bifurcated

Objection for three main reasons.

686. First, in Latvia’s Request for Bifurcation (3 August 2018), it framed all of its objections
as both jurisdictional and admissibility objections. The Claimants have thus been on
notice since then that all the objections could have a dual jurisdiction and/or

admissibility character. For instance:

(1) Section III of Latvia’s Request characterized all its objections as both

jurisdictional and admissibility.“

(2) Latvia’s 14 August 2018 Request for Bifurcation described all objections,

including the intra-EU Objection, in the same manner.*!°
(3) The same is clear from the rest of Latvia’s bifurcation pleadings.*"!

687. Second, the Decision on Bifurcation shows that the Tribunal accepted that Latvia’s plea
on its intra-EU objection may have a dual character going to jurisdiction and
admissibility. The Tribunal explicitly cited paragraph 5 of Latvia’s Request at
paragraph 33 and held that all issues relating to the intra-EU objection could raise dual

jurisdiction and admissibility standards.‘!

Preliminary Objections to the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction and/or Admissibility of the Claim, 3 August 2018, para. 71 (“Respondent
hereby notifies the Tribunal of its intention to make at least the five following preliminary objections and that it intends to

Bifurcated Issue}”) (Emphasis is Latvia’s).

  

 

 

 

 

 

     

 

170

688. Third, the Claimants’ argument that the admissibility objection does not form part of
the Bifurcated Objection on the basis that the Tribunal cannot rule on admissibility

before ruling on jurisdiction should be rejected because:*!

(1) The Claimants’ reliance on the Tribunals’ 30 January 2020 decision is
misplaced as the relevant passage did not concern the scope of the Bifurcated
Issue.4!4

(2) The Claimants’ reliance on Micula to argue that “a ruling on admissibility is

dis

so 15

 

inct from and presupposes a prior, affirmative ruling on jurisdiction
misrepresents that decision. Paragraph 63 of Micula states: “If a tribunal finds
a claim to be inadmissible, it must dismiss the claim without going into its

merits even though it has jurisdiction.”

(3) Nowhere in Micula did the tribunal say that to rule on admissibility there must

be a prior ruling on jurisdiction.*!°

(4) Objections to jurisdiction and admissibility can be presented at the same time

as shown in numerous cases.*!”

(5) Joining the admissibility objection to the merits would be inefficient and

wasteful of significant resources.

689, The Respondent thus contends that it raised its admissibility objection in a timely
fashion and rejects the counterargument that any new admissibility objections included
in Latvia’s Reply were belated under the ICSID Rules. Latvia rejects the Claimants’

attempt to dissect its admissibility objection into a “belated” part. The essential point,

September 2008, CL-319 (“Micula”), para. 63. Referring to SCPHS 1, para. 9.

416 Latvia states that the tribunal just explained that admissibility and jurisdiction are different concepts: jurisdiction pertains
to “the ability of a tribunal to hear a case,” admissibility “aims at the claim itself,” which means that a tribunal should rule on
admissibility only when it can hear the case.

417 See e.g. Gavrilovic and Gavrilovié d.o.o. v. Republic of Croatia, \CSID Case No. ARB/12/39, Award, 26 July 2018, RL-
00167, paras. 404, 411-413; Supervision y Control S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica, CSID Case No. ARB/12/4, Award, 18

populaire, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/3, Decision, 12 July 2006, RL-00457, para. 58.

171

 

according to Latvia, is that it “made only one admissibility objection.”"!® That
admissibility objection is that:4!°

the claim is precluded by EU law and as such it would be against
EU law (and thus EU international public policy) for this
Tribunal to entertain the claim on the merits.

690. The “fundamental incompatibility” Latvia asserts it relies on is EU law’s preclusive
effect over an intra-EU BIT claim, as outlined in Achmea and buttressed in Opinion
1/17. These matters were advanced as jurisdictional or admissibility objections in its

Memorial on the Bifurcated Objection*” and further specified in its Reply.*?!

691. According to Latvia, the timeliness of its admissibility objection is reinforced not only

by the Decision on Bifurcation, but the Tribunal also has a discretion to raise

422

admissibility as an issue of the Tribunal’s own motion.*** This is consistent with the

principle that it should ensure the integrity of its own proceeding.

692. Latvia submits that an ICSID tribunal may dismiss a claim on admissibility grounds
without examining the merits of the case.*” There would not be any “annullable error”
in so doing. As long as the grounds of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention are not

fulfilled, there would be no annullable error.

B. TRIBUNAL ANALYSIS

693. The actual decision to bifurcate was expressed in these terms in the Decision on

Bifurcation:

“(200 (i)] The Tribunal decides to bifurcate the proceedings and
deal with the Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction based on the availability of the investor-state
arbitration mechanism under the UK-Latvia BIT as a
preliminary matter.”

Resolution, November 2005, RL-00461, p. 607.

172

694,

695.

696.

As is apparent, the decision does not extend to any objection based on admissibility.
The Tribunal did not bifurcate five other objections in the Respondent’s Request. Nor
did it bifurcate the alternative objection to the admissibility of claims in the Request for
the one matter it did bifurcate. This appears from the background context and the

Decision on Bifurcation.

The Respondent expressly stated in the first paragraph of its Request for Bifurcation of
14 August 2018 that the purpose of the request was “that its jurisdictional and
admissibility objections be heard as a preliminary matter and separate from the merits.”
The Respondent introduced the list of topics which it requested to be bifurcated as
objections to “jurisdiction and/or admissibility.”“”4 Relevantly, the Claimants repeated

the use of both terms in their Response to the Request.*”°

The reasoning of the Tribunal in the “Conclusion and Directions” section, leading up

to the decision, makes the intention clear:

[193] For the reasons explained above, the arbitration
proceeding is bifurcated to permit the Tribunal to consider, as a
preliminary issue under Rule 41 ICSID Arbitration Rules, the
Respondent’s objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal based
on the decision of the CJEU in Achmea. All other objections to
jurisdiction are reserved to be considered at the merits stage, if
it reaches the merits stage.

 

[199] It seems to the Tribunal that it would be most efficient to
receive the following submissions before the hearing on
jurisdiction in the following order:

b. The Respondent’s submission on its objection to the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal based on the decision of the CJEU in
Achmea.

426 As noted above,

c. The Claimants’ response to the Respondent’s Achmea
objection

d...”

It is the case, as the Respondent points out, that the Tribunal made reference to the
Respondents’ submissions on admissibility in the Decision on Bifurcation. Those
submissions were directed to the Claimants’ procedural fairness objection to the
Tribunal hearing the admissibility issues raised by the Respondent. However, such

references are also pertinent for determining the scope of what the Tribunal bifurcated.

At paragraph 33, the Tribunal listed the matters which the Respondent applied to be
heard as preliminary issues and described them as “objections to the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.”

At the commencement of the Analysis section at paragraph 137, the Tribunal noted that
the Respondent sought a preliminary determination of “five jurisdictional or,
alternatively, admissibility, objections...”47°

After identifying the principal jurisdictional issue as whether the CJEU decision in
Achmea meant that there was no consent to arbitration, the Tribunal set out at paragraph
149 a long list of legal sub-issues which, the Tribunal said “can affect the conclusion
on this jurisdictional issue”, the Tribunal added: “Some of the sub-issues may also lead
to a decision on the admissibility standard, capable of affecting the continuation of these

proceedings.”

As is apparent, the Tribunal fully understood the scope of the Respondents’ request for

bifurcation. It deliberately confined its ruling to the intra-EU objection to jurisdiction.

This was reinforced in the Tribunal’s Reconsideration Decision rejecting the
Claimants’ Application to Reconsider the Decision on Bifurcation. The Tribunal ruled
at paragraph 19(i): “the decision to address as a preliminary matter the Respondent’s
objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction based on the alleged unavailability of the

investor-State arbitration mechanism under the UK-Latvia BIT is maintained.”

 

ive” was the Respondent’s word, an error.

174

703.

704.

The Respondent’s Applicable Law Admissibility Objection is effectively the same as
its objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, just presented under a different label. Both
objections assert that, “because EU law precludes Member States from allowing the
interpretation and application of EU law from being made by an international arbitral
tribunal with no connection with the EU legal order,” the Tribunal has no jurisdiction
to hear the Claimants’ claims and that those claims must be declared inadmissible. The
Respondent put forward no reasons for a finding of inadmissibility that added to or
differed from those advanced on the jurisdiction issue. The Tribunal notes that it may
have to form a view on EU law if asked to do so under Article 42 of the ICSID

Convention.

All other objections to the admissibility of the Claimants’ claims are reserved to the

merits phase of this arbitration.

VI. COSTS

705.

706.

707.

708.

The Tribunal received submissions on costs from the parties.

Under Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Convention the Tribunal has the power
to order costs only at the time of rendering the Award. Since the Tribunal has not made

an Award, it will reserve all issues of costs until it does so.

The Tribunal will determine the appropriate allocation of costs in its Award, taking into
consideration, in addition to its decision on the merits, the number of interlocutory
applications made up to this point, the extent to which such applications may have
caused delays to the proceedings, and whether those applications raised issues which

will arise again during the merits phase.

The submissions on costs made at this stage will be of assistance when the Tribunal has
to determine costs. The Parties may refer back to these costs submissions when they
make their final costs submissions at the conclusion of the merits phase; there will be

no need to duplicate them.

175

VII. DECISION
709. For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides that:
(1) the Intra-EU Objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is rejected;

(2) the issue of costs incurred by the Parties to date is reserved and will be addressed

in the final Award; and

(3) the proceedings shall continue to the next phase in accordance with the
procedural schedule to be determined by the Tribunal in a procedural order to

be issued.
