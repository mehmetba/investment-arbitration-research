Decision by the Tribunal
on a request of the Claimant
concerning the filing of the Respondent's
Counter-Memorial and its annexes

in
ICSID Case ARB(AF)/97/1

1. The Tribunal has:received from the Claimant a letter dated February 20,
1998 (subsequently supplemented by a later dated February 23, 1998)
complaining of failure of the Respondent to file with its Memorial on the due
date translations into English of all pertinent documents, The Claimant
requested that “the Respondent's counter-memoria! should be declared late,
incomplete and not accepted” and “[a]t the very least, all of the annexes (other
than Annex One, which is contained in both the English and Spanish versions of
the first volume of the counter-memorial), should be disregarded since they have
not been fully and timely filed.” The Claimant invokes Article 33 of the

Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules (“the Arbitration Rules”).

2. The Respondent, by a letter to the Tribunal dated February 26, 1998,
acknowledged that “certain Spanish to English translations [were] outstanding
and the four expert reports have not been translated from English to Spanish,”
but submitted that its filing should be deemed complete as filed on February 17,

1998, The Respondent filed the remaining Spanish to English translation on

February 27, 1998, At that date the only documents still untranslated were a
nuniber of documents originally in English that had not been translated into

Spanish. The Respondent invokes Article 49 of the Arbitration Rules.

3, The Tribunal has considered the views of the parties as expressed in
letters to the Tribunal from the Claimant dated February 20, 23 and 27 and

March 6, 1998 and from the Respondent dated February 26 and March 13, 1998,

4. The members of the Tribunal have consulted together. The Tribunal is of
the view that the sanction of non-acceptance of the Counter-Memorial would in
the circumstances be excessive. Moreover, the Tribunal considers that it is not
appropriate to exclude documents from consideration in the case solely on the
ground that they have been filed no more than 10 days late. The Tribunal has
been unable to. identify significant, if any, harm suffered by the Claimant by

reason of the delay in the filing of the translations.

5. The Tribunal wishes to emphasize that although procedural
considerations are important in proceedings such as these, an excessively

technical approach to such matters is not appropriate.

6. The Tribunal consequently rejects the request made by the Claimant in its

letter of February 20, 1998,

7. The Tribunal must, therefore, now determine whether a Reply and a

 

Rejoinder should be filed by the Claimant and the Respondent respectively. To
this end, the Tribunal now requests the observations of the Claimant on this
matter, including, if a Reply is sought, an indication of the period required by
the Claimant for preparing this pleading. Those observations should be filed by
c.0.b. on Monday, April 6, 1998. They will immediately be communicated to the
Respondent, whose observations thereon are requested by c.o.b. on Thursday,

April 9, 1998.
