I. INTRODUCTION

A. THE CLAIMANT

1. The investor acting as claimant in the present arbitration is Philip Morris Asia Limited (“PM
Asia” or the “Claimant”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Hong
Kong pursuant to the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance on 8 November 1994,' with its

registered address at Level 28, Three Pacific Place, 1 Queen’s Road East, Hong Kong.

2. The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Mr. James
Mendenhall, Ms. Marinn Carlson, and Mr. David Roney of Sidley Austin LLP; Mr. Joe Smouha
Q.C. and Mr. Salim Moollan of Essex Court Chambers; and Mr. Simon W. B. Foote of
Bankside Chambers.

B. THE RESPONDENT

3. The respondent in this arbitration is the Commonwealth of Australia (“Australia” or the

“Respondent”, a sovereign State.

4. The Respondent is represented by Mr. Simon Daley P.S.M., Ms. Catherine Kelso, Mr. Simon
Sherwood, and Ms. Laura Armstrong of the Australian Government Solicitor, Mr. Justin T.
Gleeson S.C., Solicitor-General of Australia, Mr. Bill Campbell Q.C. of the Attorney-General’s
Department, Mr. Anthony Payne S.C. of Sixth Floor Selborne Wentworth Chambers; Mr. James
Hutton of Eleven Wentworth Chambers; Mr. Samuel Wordsworth Q.C. of Essex Court

Chambers; and Prof. Chester Brown of 7 Selborne Chambers.
c. BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE

5. A dispute has arisen between PM Asia and Australia (together the “Parties”) in respect of the
Respondent’s enactment and enforcement of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 201] (the “TPP
Act”) and the implementing regulations known as the Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations
2011 (the “TPP Regulations’) (collectively the “Plain Packaging Measures”). The Claimant
commenced arbitration in relation to this dispute pursuant to the Agreement between the
Government of Hong Kong and the Government of Australia for the Promotion and Protection

of Investments dated 15 September 1993 (the “Treaty” or “BIT”).

Claimant's Notice of Claim, para. 21.

PCA 157710 1

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

The Claimant describes itself as the regional headquarters for the Asia region of the Philip
Morris International group of companies (“PMI Group”).? PM Asia owns 100% of the shares
of Philip Morris (Australia) Limited (“PM Australia”), a holding company incorporated in
Australia, which in turn owns 100% of the shares of Philip Morris Limited (“PML”). PML is a
trading company incorporated in Australia, which engages in the manufacture, import,
marketing and distribution of tobacco products for sale within Australia and for export to New
Zealand and the Pacific Islands.> According to the Claimant, PML has rights with respect to
certain intellectual property in Australia, including registered and unregistered trademarks,
copyright works, registered and unregistered designs, and overall get up of the product
packaging.‘ It is the Claimant’s contention that its entire business, and that of PML and PM

Australia, rests on its intellectual property, and in particular on the recognition of its brands.*

The Claimant alleges, inter alia, that “[t]he plain packaging legislation bars the use of
intellectual property on tobacco products and packaging, transforming [the Claimant’s
subsidiary in Australia] from a manufacturer of branded products to a manufacturer of
commoditized products with the consequential effect of substantially diminishing the value of
[the Claimant’ s] investments in Australia”.

The Claimant seeks declaratory and compensatory relief from the Respondent for breach of its
obligations under the Treaty and for causing it significant financial loss. In particular, the
Claimant seeks an order that the Respondent “(i) take[s] appropriate steps to suspend
enforcement of plain packaging legislation and to compensate [the Claimant] for loss suffered
through compliance with plain packaging legislation; or (ii) compensate[s] [the Claimant] for
loss suffered as a result of the enactment and continued application of plain packaging
legislation”.” The amount in dispute is described in the Notice of Arbitration as “an amount to

be quantified but of the order of billions of Australian dollars”.®

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s claims on the merits. In addition, the Respondent raises
three preliminary objections relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of

the Claimant’s claims. Following a hearing on the question whether the Respondent’s

Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

preliminary objections were suitable for consideration at an initial stage, before any
consideration of the merits, the Tribunal ordered the bifurcation of the proceedings such that
only two preliminary objections would be addressed in a first phase: the Respondent’s objection
that the Claimant’s investment was not properly admitted in the host State (“Non-Admission of
Investment Objection” or “First Objection”); and the Respondent’s objection that the
Tribunal was barred from considering the Claimant’s claim because the dispute had arisen
before the Claimant had obtained the protection of the Treaty as a result of restructuring its
investment in PML or because the Claimant’s restructuring constitutes an abuse of right.

(“Temporal Objection” or “Second Objection’).

The present Award is interim in the sense that the matter of costs has yet to be dealt with, and

may be designated “Interim Award (final save as to costs)”.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The present case has given rise to sixteen procedural orders, each containing its own recitals of
relevant procedural events, which are published on the website of the PCA. This section

therefore constitutes an abridged summary of the course of the proceedings.

COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION AND FIRST PROCEDURAL MEETING

On 22 June 2011, the Claimant served upon the Respondent a Notification of Claim in

accordance with Article 10 of the Treaty.

As the Parties did not reach a settlement of their dispute within the three-month period from the
date of the Notification of Claim, the Claimant served a Notice of Arbitration dated
21 November 2011 on the Respondent, submitting the dispute to international arbitration under
the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as revised
in 2010 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”) in accordance with Article 10 of the Treaty and pursuant to
Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Rules. By its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant informed the
Respondent of its appointment of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as the first arbitrator.
Professor Kaufmann-Kohler’s address is Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler, 3-5, rue du Conseil-Général,

P.O. Box 552, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

In the Notification of Claim dated 22 June 2011 and the Notice of Arbitration dated

21 November 2011, the Claimant proposed Singapore as the place of arbitration.?

On 21 December 2011, the Respondent provided a Response to the Notice of Arbitration
pursuant to Article 4 of the UNCITRAL Rules, in which the Respondent described its
jurisdictional objections and stated that it would “request that jurisdictional objections be heard

in a preliminary phase of the proceedings”.'°

On the same date, the Respondent informed the Claimant of its appointment of Professor
Donald M. McRae as the second arbitrator. Professor McRae’s address is 57 Louis Pasteur St.,
Room 340, Ottawa, Ontario KIN 6N5, Canada.

On 15 May 2012, in accordance with Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Secretary-General
of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”) appointed Professor Karl-Heinz Béckstiegel
as the presiding arbitrator. Professor Béckstiegel’s address is ParkstraBe 38, 51427 Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany.

On 7 June 2012, having received comments from both Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. | which sets out, inter alia, the applicable procedural rules, Tribunal’s fees and

expenses, language, and the Tribunal’s immunity.

By letters dated 27 June 2012, responding to the Tribunal’s invitation to consult with each other
in relation to the standard of confidentiality, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was
committed to transparency and did not agree with the Claimant’s proposal that the hearings be
held in camera, and the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties disagreed on the
standard of confidentiality applicable to the proceedings but that discussions on the matter were

ongoing.

On the same date, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it “propose[d] to continue to
consult with the Claimant on the matter of a timetable, including the issue of a bifurcated
procedure”. By letter of the same date, the Claimant set out its position that procedural economy
and expediency would not favour bifurcation but that “should the Tribunal not be minded to
refuse bifurcation at this point, PM Asia considers that the question of whether there should be
bifurcation ought to be argued and determined only following full memorials from each

[P]arty”.

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

By letter dated 10 July 2012, the Respondent proposed that there be an exchange of brief written
submissions with regard to whether the proceedings should be bifurcated or not, and that,
following such submissions, the issue of bifurcation would be ready for determination at the

first procedural meeting in Singapore (“First Procedural Meeting”) or shortly thereafter.

By letter dated 11 July 2012, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s proposal and reiterated
that, should the Tribunal not refuse bifurcation at this stage, the issue of bifurcation should only

be argued and determined following the delivery of full Memorials by each Party.

By letters dated 16 July 2012, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were unable to agree
either on the desirability of bifurcation or on the timing and procedure for the Tribunal to
determine this particular issue. Accordingly, each Party set out its proposed timetable. On the
same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to discuss the procedure for
reaching a decision on bifurcation at the First Procedural Meeting and that no further

submissions on the issue of bifurcation would be required before the Meeting.

By letter dated 24 July 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that no agreement had been
reached between the Parties concerning the standard of confidentiality and requested, in
accordance with Article 28(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, that the First Procedural Meeting be
held in camera and that “all documents created or held by or on behalf of the Tribunal
concerning this proceeding, including any transcript of and any other records concerning the

[First] Procedural Meeting, be kept confidential”.

By letter dated 25 July 2012, the Respondent agreed that the First Procedural Meeting be held in
camera and that all documents held by the Tribunal be kept confidential except for those
already in the public domain. This arrangement was approved by the Tribunal the following

day.

By letter dated 26 July 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had proposed to the
Claimant that London be the place of arbitration, and indicated that the Claimant had

nonetheless maintained that Singapore be the place of the arbitration.

On 30 July 2012, the Tribunal held the First Procedural Meeting, during which the Parties
reiterated their respective proposals for the place of arbitration and presented oral arguments in
support of their proposals. The Tribunal also discussed with the Parties the regime of
confidentiality that should apply to the arbitration, the procedure for considering whether certain
jurisdictional objections should be considered in a separate, preliminary phase, and various

other procedural points.

PLACE OF ARBITRATION, CONFIDENTIALITY REGIME AND BIFURCATION OF PROCEEDINGS

On 3 August 2012, after consultation with the Parties at the First Procedural Meeting, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 which set out a timetable for the Parties to file further
written submissions relating to the place of arbitration, confidentiality, and bifurcation of

proceedings.

On 13 August 2012, 17 August 2012, 27 August 2012, and 3 September 2012, the Parties
exchanged submissions on the place of arbitration in accordance with the timetable set out in

Procedural Order No. 2.

On 13 August 2012, the Respondent also filed its submission on the issue of bifurcation in
response to the Claimant’s submission dated 30 July 2012. By letter dated 15 August 2012, the
Claimant requested the Tribunal to clarify the scope of the Parties’ submissions on the issue of
bifurcation and, if needed, to require the Respondent to recast its submission accordingly. On
16 August 2012, the Tribunal confirmed that the Parties’ submissions should be limited to the

timing and procedure for reaching a decision on the bifurcation of the proceedings.

On 20 August 2012, 27 August 2012 and 3 September 2012, respectively, the Parties exchanged

further submissions on the issue of bifurcation.

By letter dated 12 September 2012, the Parties set out their positions on confidentiality. By
letter dated 17 September 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to continue their efforts to reach
an agreement on the applicable standard of confidentiality and set out a timetable for further
submissions in this regard. The Parties, accordingly, submitted their respective proposals for a
Procedural Order on confidentiality on 28 September 2012 and provided their comments on the

proposal of the other Party on 5 October 2012.

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

On 26 October 2012, the Tribunal, in Procedural Order No. 3, decided in accordance with
Article 18(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules that Singapore was the place of arbitration.

On the same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which it defined the procedure

leading up to a decision on bifurcation.

On 30 November 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 regarding confidentiality. It
held, inter alia, that the Tribunal’s awards, decisions and orders shall be published by the PCA,
subject to prior redaction; that all hearings, meetings and conferences shall be held in camera
and their transcripts be kept in confidence; and that each Party shall be free to render its written

submissions public, subject to appropriate redactions where applicable.

On the same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 regarding outstanding procedural
matters relating to communications and submissions, evidence, hearings, language and

translations.

Following a change of the Claimant’s counsel of record, by letter dated 3 December 2012, the
Claimant requested an extension of the deadline for the filing of the Statement of Claim to

28 March 2013.

By letter dated 12 December 2012, the Respondent noted that, if the Claimant’s request for an
extension were granted, a corresponding extension should also be granted for the filing of the

Statement of Defence.

By letters dated 12 and 14 December 2012, the Respondent and the Claimant acknowledged that
it would be necessary to identify a new date for the filing of the Claimant’s submissions on the

aspects of bifurcation not covered in previous submissions.

On 31 December 2012, after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 7, in which the Tribunal set out a revised timetable for the filing of submissions. Pursuant to
this revised timetable, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim on 28 March 2013; the
Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence on 23 October 2013; and the Claimant

submitted its Opposition to Bifurcation on 26 November 2013.

On 20 and 21 February 2014, a hearing on bifurcation was held in Toronto (“Hearing on

Bifurcation”). Present at the Hearing on Bifurcation were:

On 14 April 2014, following the Hearing on Bifurcation, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 8, deciding to bifurcate the proceedings in two phases and that two preliminary objections
should be considered in an initial phase of the proceedings. The first phase of the proceedings
was to deal with the Respondent’s Non-Admission of Investment Objection and the Temporal
Objection. A third objection raised by the Respondent was to be joined to the merits in the event
that the first and second objections were not upheld by the Tribunal and the proceedings

continued.

DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, SUBMISSIONS AND HEARING ON PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

On 16 May 2014, after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9
regarding the timetable for the first phase of the bifurcated proceedings, and in which the
Tribunal confirmed that the hearing on preliminary objections would commence on 16 February

2015 (“Hearing on Preliminary Objections”).

On 7 July 2014, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, together

with accompanying exhibits, witness statements and expert reports.

On 28 July 2014, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 9, each Party submitted to the other Party a
reasoned application for the production of documents (“Request to Produce’), limited to
material relevant to the Non-Admission of Investment Objection and Temporal Objection as set

forth by the Respondent in its Statement of Defence.

On 15 August 2014, after the Parties consulted with each other with a view to amending certain
aspects of the process for document production, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the
Parties had agreed to exchange privilege logs listing any documents that a Party wished to
withhold on grounds of legal impediment or privilege (“LPP”) or special political or
institutional sensitivity (“SPIS”) and informed the Tribunal that the Parties had failed to reach
agreement on a timetable for the exchange of such privilege logs. A timetable was proposed for

the Tribunal’s consideration.

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

On 20 August 2014, the Claimant responded to the Respondent’s letter by noting that the
Respondent’s proposed timetable was unworkable in view of the breadth of the Respondent’s
document requests. The Claimant therefore proposed an alternative timetable for the Tribunal’s

consideration.

On 22 August 2014, the Respondent conveyed to the Tribunal that it was prepared to narrow its
document requests and confirmed that, while the Claimant’s proposed timetable potentially left
little time to incorporate certain documents into the Respondent’s Reply, the Respondent was

prepared to agree to the Claimant’s timetable in order to avoid extended arguments.

On 26 August 2014, the Tribunal adopted a modified timetable for the proceedings in the form
of Procedural Order No. 10, in which the Tribunal decided that the Parties were to “limit the
requests that they will submit in their Redfern Schedules to those documents that are absolutely
necessary for the limited purpose of dealing with the preliminary objections to be addressed at

the Hearing on Preliminary Objections in February 2015”.

On 8 September 2014, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 10, the Parties submitted to the
Tribunal in the form of two separate Redfern Schedules all Requests to Produce that they

maintained despite the other Party’s objections.

On 19 September 2014, the Claimant expressed concerns about what it perceived as an overly
broad character of the Respondent’s Requests to Produce and presented a proposal to limit the

scope of the Parties’ Requests to Produce.

In its reply of 22 September 2014, the Respondent noted that “[it] does not agree to the
Claimant’s proposal for the production of documents relating to control” and requesting “that
the Tribunal... decline to make an order reflecting this proposal”, while expressing its
agreement to limit the scope of e-mails that the Parties were required to review, subject to

certain qualifications.

On 23 September 2014, the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 11, decided, on a document-by-
document basis on the Parties’ Requests to Produce and provided general procedural direction in

respect of document production.

On 20 October 2014, in accordance with the timetable set out in Procedural Order No. 10, the
Parties exchanged privilege logs listing any documents that a Party wished to withhold on LPP
and SPIS grounds.

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

On 27 October 2014, the Parties exchanged objections in respect of the other Party’s privilege

claims, and on 31 October 2014, the Parties responded to the other Party’s objections.

By letter dated 6 November 2014, the Claimant submitted its unresolved objections to the

Respondent's privilege claims to the Tribunal.

Similarly, on 7 November 2014, the Respondent submitted its unresolved objections to the

Claimant’s privilege claims.

On 10 November 2014, the Claimant objected to redactions of documents which the Respondent

had produced on 6 November 2014 based on privilege grounds.

On 14 November 2014, in Procedural Order No. 12, the Tribunal ruled on these unresolved

privilege claims."

On 1 December 2014, the Respondent filed its Reply on Preliminary Objections together with

accompanying exhibits, witness statements and expert reports.

On 9 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, concerning access by the

Claimant to a set of documents that the Respondent considered sensitive.

On 12 January 2015, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections in rebuttal of
the Respondent’s Reply on Preliminary Objections together with further evidence upon which

the Claimant wished to rely.

On 16 January 2015, the Tribunal sent a draft procedural order regarding details of the Hearing

on Preliminary Objections to the Parties inviting them to comment thereon.

By letter of the same date, the Respondent objected to the admissibility of new expert evidence
on Australian law adduced by the Claimant, namely the legal opinion of Justice Ian Callinan

Q.C. (“Callinan Report”) addressing the Respondent’s First Objection.’

By letter dated 19 January 2015, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s request to exclude
the Callinan Report and requested the Tribunal, as a matter of procedural fairness, to allow it to

file the said Report.

By letter of the same date, the Claimant sought leave from the Tribunal to introduce into the
record a recent Award in the arbitration, namely, Renée Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v.

Republic of Peru.°

On 20 January 2015, Procedural Order No. 14 was issued, in which the Tribunal denied the
Respondent’s request to exclude the Callinan Report from the record and permitted the

Claimant to introduce the Gremcitel Award.

By letter dated 22 January 2015, the Claimant submitted the Gremcitel Award, along with
commentary explaining its relevance. By letter dated 25 January 2015, the Respondent

submitted its response to Claimant’s arguments in relation to the Gremcitel Award.

On 26 January 2015, the Parties submitted notifications of the witnesses and experts whom they
wished to examine at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections. The Parties also submitted a
chronological list of all exhibits and their comments on the draft procedural order that had been

circulated on 16 January 2015.

By letter dated 26 January 2015, the Respondent, following the Tribunal’s decision in
Procedural Order No. 14, sought leave from the Tribunal to file a short expert report by way of
rebuttal to the Callinan Report. By letter of the same date, the Tribunal acceded to the
Respondent’s request and pointed out that the said expert report was to be strictly responsive to

the Callinan Report.

By letter dated 27 January 2015, the Claimant, in response to the Respondent’s letter and the
Tribunal’s decision of 26 January 2015, noted that it regretted that it did not have the
opportunity to respond to the Respondent’s application in relation to a rebuttal expert report
before the Tribunal issued its decision on this matter. The Claimant, therefore, reserved the right
to ask the Tribunal to reconsider whether it would allow the Respondent’s rebuttal expert report

after having reviewed it.

On 29 January 2015, the Respondent filed the expert report of The Hon. Roger Gyles A.O. Q.C.

focusing on questions of Australian law, by rebuttal to the Callinan Report.'*

On 4 February 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 regarding details of the

of relevant facts.

On 10 February 2015, the Parties provided the PCA with a list of attendees at the hearing, and
after consultation with each other, the Parties established a detailed scheduling proposal in
relation to the witnesses and experts whom they wished to cross-examine. On the same date, the
Claimant submitted a short additional statement by Justice Callinan, strictly limited to replying

to the issues raised by The Hon. Roger Gyles A.O. Q.C.

On 15 February 2015, the Respondent submitted a further statement from The Hon. Roger Gyles

Parties should have an opportunity to submit post-hearing briefs, should they wish so, and that

the Parties shall consult with each other in respect of any corrections to the hearing transcripts.

and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America,'> and Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater

Caribe, C.A. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.'®

On 26 March 2015, in response to Respondent’s letter of 23 March 2015, the Claimant did not
oppose the Respondent’s request to submit the two legal authorities, namely, the Apotex Award
and the Tidewater Award. By e-mail of the same date, the Tribunal admitted these two awards

into the record.

On | April 2015, the Claimant sought leave from the Tribunal to submit an additional legal
authority, namely, the Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility in Bilcon of Delaware v.

including the number one selling brand of cigarettes, Marlboro.’ PMI owns dozens of
subsidiaries and affiliates around the world (referred to as the PMI Group) and manages its
business in different regions,“ including in Asia, where the Claimant has its regional
headquarters.?>

The Claimant was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1994 and has been doing business in Hong
Kong since that time.*° On 17 March 1954, the PMI Group began operations in Australia
through PM Australia?” Before restructuring, PM Australia was owned by US-based Philip
Morris group companies until 1998, followed by Swiss-based Philip Morris group companies
for over 12 years.”* Before PML was incorporated in 1967, PM Australia carried on the PMI
Group’s business in Australia and had done so since PM Australia was incorporated in 1954. In
May 1967, PML was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of PM Australia, after which
PM Australia ceased to carry out operational activities in Australia or elsewhere.?? PM Australia
was, and remains, the owner of PML. In turn, PML operates the PMI Group’s Australian sales
of tobacco products in Australia, selling mainly international brands, licensed from other Philip
Morris companies located in Switzerland and the United States.”

The Claimant alleges that it has controlled and managed all strategic, budgetary and investment
decisions of the Australian subsidiaries, namely, PM Australia and PML, since 2001. Until
February 2011, both PM Australia and PML were owned by Philip Morris Brands Sarl (“PM
Brands Sarl”), a Swiss company forming part of the PMI Group.*!

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

According to the Claimant, the PMI Group has been engaged in a group-wide restructuring
process “to reduce costs and improve efficiencies by streamlining its legal entity structure,
rationalizing business process, centralising activities, and developing shared services”? The
restructuring plan also took into account the political risk that PMI was facing in several
countries including Australia with the proliferation of new regulations on packaging and
marketing of tobacco products. Since the possible relationship of steps taken by the PMI
Group to restructure its investments in Australia with the introduction of the Plain Packaging
Measures forms the basis of two of the Respondent’s preliminary objections, these facts will be

set out in detail below.

THE WoRK OF THE NATIONAL PREVENTATIVE HEALTH TASKFORCE (NPHT)

Australia first considered plain packaging in 1995. However, Australia initially recommended
further investigations to be made. The Claimant contends that Australia refrained from adopting
any Plain Packaging Measures in light of its treaty obligations and lack of evidence that plain
packaging would be effective in reducing tobacco consumption.

On 27 February 2005, the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco
Control (“FCTC”) entered into force for Australia. Under the FCTC, States Parties are under an
obligation to develop and implement “tobacco control measures, including measures to

Li the p ity of tobacco p to mislead about the health effects of

smoking and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship”.*>

In December 2007, shortly after being elected, the Australian Labor Party Government of Prime
Minister Kevin Rudd launched the National Preventative Health Taskforce (“NPHT”).*°

On 9 April 2008, Australia’s then Minister of Health and Ageing, The Hon. Nicola Roxon MP.

announced the establishment of the NPHT to “provide evidence-based advice to government

and support the development of a National Preventative Health Strategy” (“NPHS”).*”

On 10 October 2008, the NPHT published a discussion paper entitled “Australia: The Healthiest
Country by 2020”. The paper proposed targets for the prevention of obesity, tobacco and
alcohol, including in particular the reduction of the prevalence of daily smoking to 9% or less
by 2020. To meet this target, the paper suggested to “[f]urther regulate the tobacco industry with
measures such as ending all forms of promotion including point-of-sale display and mandating
plain packaging of tobacco products”.**

On 2 January 2009, PML participated in the NPHT consultation and stated, among other things,
that “plain packaging was unnecessary, unsupported by evidence, and unlawful”. On the same

day, the NPHT consultation closed.”

In April 2009, shortly before the NPHT delivered its report to the government, Australia’s
Department of Health and Ageing (“DoHA”) examined the feasibility of a Tobacco Control Act
through which plain packaging would be introduced.” Accordingly, DoHA prepared a draft
Regulated Impact Statement (“RIS”) and submitted it for review to the Office of Best Practice
Regulations (“OBPR”) which is the independent government agency responsible for ensuring
that “Australian legislation and regulations rest on solid evidentiary foundation”. This proposal
together with the Tobacco Control Act, however, failed because the draft RIS lacked “proper

analysis and substantiation for plain packaging”.*!

On 30 June 2009, the NPHT issued a report on the NPHS, listing a series of important actions,
including to “[e]liminate the promotion of tobacco products through design of packaging”,”” and
“[m]andate standard plain packaging of all tobacco products to ensure that design features of the

pack in no way reduce the prominence or impact of prescribed government warnings”.“? The

NPHT also issued a “Roadmap for Action”, which underlined that plain packaging was

RESPONSES TO THE NPHT’S WORK AND THE CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA

In August 2009, Senator Steven Fielding introduced the Plain Tobacco Packaging (Removing
Branding from Cigarette Packs) Bill 2009 (the “Fielding Bill”) in the Australian Senate, which

proposed to remove “brands, trademarks and logos from tobacco packaging”.*°

On | September 2009, Health Minister Roxon launched the NPHS, and released a technical
paper on tobacco entitled “Australia: The Healthiest Country by 2020”, which proposed to

“[rJequire all tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging”.*°

On 9 October 2009, in response to the Health Minister’s launch of the NPHS on | September
2009, Allens Arthur Robinson, wrote to Health Minister Roxon to express the PMI Group’s
concern about the unconstitutionality of plain packaging and the Fielding Bill which sought to

introduce a form of plain packaging.**

Australia introduce Plain Packaging Measures. PMI, the parent company of the PMI Group,

In February 2010, the popularity of Prime Minister Rudd’s Government (the “Rudd

Government”) dropped, as evidenced by several opinion polls in Australia.*!

In March 2010, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stated that the Fielding
Bill “did not represent government policy and that there was no government plan to introduce
plain packaging legislation”.*

In April 2010, DoHA prepared another RIS draft and submitted it to the OBPR for review. The
OBPR rejected the draft because it failed to provide any credible evidence that plain packaging

would be effective in reducing smoking.**

Meanwhile, in April 2010, IP Australia, the government agency responsible for intellectual
property, had raised serious concerns regarding plain packaging in the context of the Fielding
Bill and the NPHT. According to the Claimant, IP Australia was unaware of Prime Minister
Rudd’s decision to adopt the plain packaging law. In other words, the Claimant alleges that
Prime Minister Rudd’s Government decided to pursue plain packaging without consulting, or

On 19 April 2010, Health Minister Roxon stated that the Australian Government was
considering additional measures in line with NPHT’s recommendations including plain

packaging for tobacco products to address the harmful effects of smoking.

On 23 April 2010, an IP Australia internal e-mail revealed that DoHA had just learnt of Prime

Minister Rudd’s intentions to publicly announce the plain packaging initiative.*°

On 29 April 2010, Australia’s Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Health Minister Roxon, jointly
announced major tobacco control reforms to give effect to the recommendations of the NPHT
including the Government’s introduction of plain packaging legislation to mandate plain
packaging of tobacco products by 1 July 2012.°’ In addition, the features of the Plain Packaging

Measures were announced, which were similar to those subsequently expressed in the TPP Act.

At that time, Australia had not released a formal response to the NPHT’s final report.**
Accordingly, several opposition Senators described this announcement as “a politically driven
decision”.** The then-Opposition Leader Tony Abbot MP criticised Prime Minister Rudd’s plain
packaging proposal. The Claimant suggests that Prime Minister Rudd’s announcement was
“simply a statement of intent” and that the political situation at that time in Australia made it

impossible to foresee the ultimate fate of the plain packaging policy as a very high probability.°!

On 30 April 2010, PML reiterated its opposition to plain packaging by contesting the “legality
and efficacy” of plain packaging in a submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation

Committee regarding the Fielding Bill.

By the end of April 2010, the Respondent alleged that the PMI Group had progressed with its
intention and planned strategy to bring a claim under the Treaty if Australia proceeded with its
decision to implement Plain Packaging Measures and to restructure the PMI Group to get a
“corporate vehicle with standing” to bring the claim. The Respondent contends that despite
opposition from the PMI Group, the Australian Government adhered to its decision to introduce

Plain Packaging Measures.

From April to June 2010, the Australian Government started to implement its plain packaging
decision. Through DoHA, the Government had engaged a consultant to market-test the design

of graphic health warnings and plain packaging.

On 11 May 2010, the Rudd Government published its formal response to the NPHT’s final
report, detailing its commitment to the introduction of plain packaging. In particular, it stated
that “[t]he Government will remove one of the last remaining vehicles for the advertising of
tobacco products by developing legislation to mandate plain packaging for tobacco products

from | January 2012 with full implementation by 1 July 2012”.

On 31 May 2010, in a media release regarding increased funding for Quitline, Health Minister
Roxon reiterated that the Government was committed to the introduction of Plain Packaging

Measures.

media release, Health Minister Roxon stated that the Government would legislate plain

packaging.*

On 24 June 2010, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Julia
Gillard. At her first press conference, Prime Minister Gillard indicated “a willingness to revisit
the policies of the Rudd Government”.”°

The Respondent explained that in the weeks following the change in Government, the process
of implementing Plain Packaging Measures was carried in a methodical, diligent and resolute
manner without Australia wavering from its decision. The Respondent dismissed the Claimant’ s
allegations that PMI Group had “good reason” to think that Plain Packaging Measures would
never be implemented in Australia because Prime Minister Rudd “had developed a reputation
for announcing ambitious proposals and later backing down”.”! The Respondent maintained that
there was, at all relevant times, every reason to expect that the Australian Government’s

decision to introduce plain packaging would be brought to fruition in due course.”

On 7 July 2010, the Australian Government published a timetable for the implementation of its
decision to introduce Plain Packaging Measures. The timetable showed that plain packaging
legislation would be ready for introduction before 30 June 2011, and would be fully

implemented by 1 July 2012.”

On 17 July 2010, three and a half weeks after assuming leadership, Prime Minister Gillard
called for an early federal general election on 21 August 2010.” On 19 July 2010, the House of

Representatives was dissolved.”°

Measures. Franchise Partners expressed the view that:

Outcome of plain packaging is dependent on who wins the election and most experts

seem to believe that a labour (sic) government under Julia Gillard is likely to go ahead

with PP [plain packaging] plans and based on history most governments have got a

second term in office so likelihood of Labor (sic) victory is high.”°
In a response e-mail of 29 July 2010, PMI noted that “there are no indications that a newly
elected [Labor] Government will set aside the pursuit of plain packaging as articulated by the
former Prime Minister”.””
After the 2010 election, the Government continued to pursue its legislative agenda and none of
the minor parties or independent Members of Parliament, save one, indicated that they opposed

or even were considering opposing the Plain Packaging Measures.”

In August 2010, PML cited and relied on the timetable for planning purposes in its 2011-2013
Original Budget/Long Range Plan (“OB/LRP”). The document, in the Respondent’s view,
evidences that the Claimant’s planned BIT strategy was complete and approved at the highest
levels of the PMI Group by August 2010.”

On 11 August 2010, Health Minister Roxon complained about the Coalition’s “lack of support
for the Labor Party’s plain packaging proposal”.*°

On 16 August 2010, the Coalitions’ Shadow Health Minister, Peter Dutton, stated that “[w]e
haven’t seen any legislation from the Government. So really apart from a press release, we don’t

know what it is the Government’s asking us to sign up to”.*!

In the same period of time, PML’s senior management presented its annual OB/LRP, which set

on the Australian market remained unchanged.*

On 21 August 2010, Australia held a federal election, and no party achieved an absolute
majority. The Labor Party and the Opposition Coalition which had criticised plain packaging

had an equal number of seats in the House of Representatives.**

On 26 August 2010, the Parliament discontinued its consideration of the Fielding Bill.“

THE PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING AND PLAN TO INTRODUCE PLAIN PACKAGING MEASURES

In early September 2010, PMI restructured the ownership and functions of many of its affiliates
around the world thereby eliminating redundant legal entities. In particular, the restructuring
placed PMI Group’s operating affiliates in various jurisdictions under the administration of PM

Holland.*°

The decision to restructure ownership of the Australian subsidiaries as part of this global process
was documented in an internal memorandum dated 2 September 2010, which stated that the
goal of the restructuring plan was “to further streamline PMI’s corporate structure”.** The
Claimant notes that the justifications provided in the internal memorandum for the restructuring
proposal (to “streamline” or “rationalise” the corporate structure) were identical to the purpose
for the restructuring in the Claimant’s notification to the Treasurer (the “FATA notification” or
“Foreign Investment Application”)*’ several months later (to “refine PMI affiliates’ corporate

structure in the Asian region”).**

Consequently, two Dutch holding companies within the PMI Group—Philip Morris

company, Park 1989 B.V., which was then transferred to PM Holland.® This was followed by
the transfer of PM Australia from PM Brands Sarl to PM Holland, accomplished by transferring
PM Australia to the Claimant and in parallel, transferring the Claimant to PM Holland. As a
result, the Claimant became the direct owner of PM Australia and the indirect owner of PML.

On 13 September 2010, Health Minister Roxon acknowledged the uncertainty over whether
there was political support for plain packaging in the newly elected Parliament, and stated that
she hoped that the Coalition would support Plain Packaging Measures but voiced concern that

the Coalition had “sort of [drawn] back” from supporting the measure.”

On 14 September 2010, following weeks of negotiations, Prime Minister Gillard formed a Labor
Party-led minority government (“Minority Labor Government”). However, the Minority
Labor Government did not have sufficient votes to pass legislation including the proposed (but
not yet drafted) plain packaging legislation.» According to a report from the Department of
Parliamentary Services, “the number of votes that the Government may have on most matters

On 20 September 2010, the Managing Director of PM Australia, Mr. Boissart, wrote a letter to

the Assistant Treasurer which read, in part, as follows:

Former Prime Minister Rudd announced in late April that he would introduce legislation
requiring cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging by mid-2012. This decision was taken
without any consultation with the industry or the retail community and no commitment to
following normal regulatory impact assessment processes. It was also taken without any
recognition that Australian states and territories have moved to ban the retail display of
tobacco products. [...] (emphasis added)

 

 

On 24 September 2010, DoHA prepared minutes for Health Minister Roxon (the “September
2010 Minutes”), at her request, to update her on the implementation of the Plain Packaging
Measures. On the same day, PMI Group received legal advice concerning Plain Packaging

On 23 November 2010, DoHA prepared minutes for Health Minister Roxon (the “November
2010 Minutes”) which stated that the purpose of the “targeted consultations on plain
packaging” with the tobacco industry including the PMI Group was not to engage in a debate
about the Australian Government’s decision to introduce Plain Packaging Measures but rather
to give the tobacco industry an opportunity to comment on aspects of the implementation

process.!°!

On 26 November 2010 and 14 January 2011, DoHA held individual consultations with the three
major tobacco companies in Australia, including PML, during which the tobacco companies, in
particular, the representative of PML, indicated their opposition to the “excessive regulation”
through Plain Packaging Measures.'

On 9 December 2010, DoHA briefed Health Minister Roxon again about the implementation of
Plain Packaging Measures generally (the “December 2010 Minutes”).'°> The December 2010
Minutes to which a letter, addressed to Prime Minister Gillard, was attached, stipulated that
Minister Roxon agreed to the “drafting of legislation for public exposure, prior to making a
request for the measure to be included on the legislation programme for introduction during the

Winter 2011 sitting period”.!

Between 13 and 21 January 2011, in the lead-up to the restructuring, PMI Group exchanged e-

concerning investment treaty protections for the Group’s operations in Australia”.!°°

On 14 January 2011, DoHA met with representatives of the tobacco industry including with

[2011] and that the legislation would not be introduced into the Australian Parliament before the
winter 2011 sittings.!°°

On 18 January 2011, three days before the PMI Group applied to the FIRB for approval of its
proposed restructuring, PMI Group’s legal counsel provided it with legal advice concerning

investment treaty protection for its investment in Australia.!°”

On 21 January 2011, Australian legal counsel for the PMI Group, Allens Arthur Robinson, filed
the Foreign Investment Application regarding the proposed change in ownership of PM
Australia and PML with the Treasurer requesting approval of the restructuring under the
FATA. The Foreign Investment Application refers to the statutory notices,’ and to
documents that the PMI Group and in particular PM Asia had provided, including most
importantly the Foreign Investment Review Board Letter (“FIRB Letter”) dated 21 January
2011. The Foreign Investment Application stipulated that the transfer was for the purpose of
“refining PMI affiliates’ corporate structure in the Asian region”."!° It also stated the seller’s
nationality (Swiss) and the identity and nationality of the Group’s ultimate parent company
(PMI, United States).!"! The Foreign Investment Application further provided that the Claimant
“[was] not aware of any reason why the [rJestructur[ing] would be contrary to the Australian
national interest” because the “[rJestructur[ing] does not result in any change in ultimate control
of PM Australia or PML, as both before and after the [rJestructur[ing], those entities will remain
indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of PMI”.!!?

Subsequently, in January 2011, the Foreign Investment Application was first considered by
| an officer of the Foreign Investment and Trade Policy Division of the Treasury

(“FITPD”), and no national interest concerns were raised.!3

While the Foreign Investment Application was pending before the Treasury, Minister Roxon

“made available for discussion and debate” before it is introduced in Parliament. She also noted
that “if it is passed by the [P]arliament”, the Plain Packaging Measures would be in force as
from 1 July 2012.14

On 10 February 2011, PMI’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Louis Camilleri,
addressed Australia’s decision to introduce Plain Packaging Measures at a conference call with
analysts. In his remarks, Mr. Camilleri recognised that Australia had a “strong intent” to
implement Plain Packaging Measures and stated that “plain packaging doesn’t make any sense
and we’ll fight plain packaging in every way possible”.!5

On 11 February 2011, the Treasury responded to the Foreign Investment Application with a
formal letter stipulating that, “there are no objections to this proposal in terms of the

Government's foreign investment policy” (“No-objection Letter”).!"°

On 17 February 2011, PMI Group indicated that it had suddenly realised that it may be exposed
to substantial tax payments in Hong Kong if the restructuring occurred as described in the
Foreign Investment Application. As a result, the PM Australia transaction went from one of
mere “contribution” where PM Asia paid nothing to acquire PM Australia to one where it
acquired it for substantial value.!!”

On 23 February 201 mo the Claimant formally

acquired PM Australia and PML when PM Brands Sarl transferred its shares from PM Australia
to the Claimant.''’ On the same day, PML wrote to Health Minister Roxon stating that PML
“strongly opposes” Australia’s proposal for plain packaging." Furthermore, at a presentation
given in New York by the Chief Financial Officer of PMI, Australia’s Plain Packaging

Measures were raised once more and it was stated that “[w]e will vigorously oppose any such

INTRODUCTION OF THE TOBACCO PLAIN PACKAGING BILL 2011

On 6 April 2011, the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 (“TPP Bill’) was introduced into the

Australian Parliament.'?!

On 7 April 2011, the Minority Labor Government released for public consultation an Exposure
Draft of the TPP Bill 2011 (which would become the TPP Act 2011) along with a consultation
paper.’ Meanwhile, Australia received a number of submissions from interested parties
opposing plain packaging, including from the Coalition, which opposed plain cigarette
packaging.'*> The Coalition’s Shadow Health Minister noted that “there are a lot of question
marks around this”.'*4

On 8 April 2011, the Minority Labor Government notified the draft plain packaging legislation
to the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) at an “early appropriate stage” (when amendments
and comments could still be made).'?° On the same day, Health Minister Roxon suggested that
plain packaging involved “some level of experiment” and that the Plain Packaging Measures, on
their own, probably would not stop addicted smokers.'° In April 2011, the Australian
Government released its trade policy statement which expressly made a link between Investor-

State Dispute Settlement (“ISDS”) clauses and the Respondent’s plain packaging proposals.'?”

On 17 May 2011, Coalition leader, Mr. Tony Abbott, expressed concems that the proposed
plain packaging legislation could be “counterproductive in practice”.!?8

On 22 May 2011, three months after the Claimant acquired the Australian subsidiaries, Health
Minister Roxon criticised the Coalition for failing to support Plain Packaging Measures. The
Health Minister did not respond when she was asked whether the Minority Labor Government
would have sufficient votes to pass the plain packaging legislation without the Coalition’s
support.!”° Rather, Health Minister Roxon admitted that the Government had a “very big fight
on [its] hands” in Parliament over the plain packaging proposal.!°°

On 24 May 2011, the Australian press reported that “there were indications that some Coalition
Members of Parliament were prepared to cross the floor to vote with federal government on

plain packaging’

On 26 May 2011, another article stipulated that “plain packaging would likely pass the House
regardless of what Coalition Leader [Mr. Abbott] decides”, and explained that the Minority
Labor Government had secured the votes it needed to pass the legislation.!*

On 22 June 2011, PMI approved the transfer of its Malaysian and Taiwanese entities to PM
Asia as part of its ongoing efforts to refine PMI affiliates’ corporate structure in the Asia

On 6 July 2011, the TPP Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Health

Minister, who, on the same day, also delivered the second reading speech for the Bill.'*°

On 19 September 2011, having received the Notice of Claim, the Attorney-General’s

Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

On 30 July 2012, at the First Procedural Meeting, the former Solicitor-General of the
Commonwealth reiterated the preliminary objections of the Respondent; in this context, no
submission was made in relation to the Foreign Investment Application or the No-objection

Letter.'3

On 31 July 0) the FITPD sent a letter to the Attorney-General’ s

Department of Australia reiterating, according to Claimant, that no objections were raised

against the proposal and, therefore, the No-objection Letter was valid.'*

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE RESPONDE!
PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

 

The Claimant asserts that it has met all the jurisdictional requirements to bring its claim against
Australia in this arbitration. First, the Claimant submits that, as a company incorporated under

145 Second,

the laws of Hong Kong at all relevant times, it is a covered investor under the Treaty.
the Claimant considers that it satisfies the “investment” requirement under Article I(e) of the
Treaty since it owns or controls assets in the form of direct shareholding in PM Australia and
indirect shareholding in PML; PML’s brands and its portfolio of brands as a whole; and PML’s
ownership and/or licence of intellectual property rights.'4° Third, the Claimant asserts that its
investments have been admitted by Australia subject to its laws and investment policies, and
therefore its investments are legal under the host State’s law.'*” Fourth, the Claimant states that
there is a dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent in relation to the Plain Packaging
Measures, which have substantially diminished the value of the Claimant’s investments in
Australia, and that the Claimant has thus satisfied the dispute resolution provisions in the

Treaty.'4*

As noted above, the Respondent advances three preliminary objections, relating to the

Tribunal’ s jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the Claimant’s claim.'“? The First Objection is

 

in which Mr. Pellegrini asserts that the transfer of ownership of PM Asia from PM Brands Sarl to PM
Holland occurred at approximately the same time as the restructuring in February 2011.

that the Claimant’s purported “investment” has not been admitted by the Respondent in
accordance with Article 1(e) of the Treaty, which provides that an investment must be admitted
by Australia “subject to its law and investment policies as applicable from time to time”.'*° The
Second Objection is that the Claimant’s claim falls outside the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty
because it relates to a pre-existing dispute, or, alternatively, that the Claimant’s claim amounts
to an abuse of right because it has sought to restructure its investment to gain Treaty protection
over a pre-existing or reasonably foreseeable dispute.'*' The Third Objection is that neither the

shares in PML nor PML’s assets constitute investments for the purposes of the Treaty.'°?

The Tribunal has deemed the First and Second Objections suitable for consideration in a
preliminary phase. The legal arguments presented by both Parties in respect of each objection
are summarised in detail in the following sections. Both bifurcated objections centre on the
question whether, in the period between Australia’s announcement of a decision to introduce the
Plain Packaging Measures and the enactment of these measures into legislation, the Claimant
properly became an investor in Australia when it acquired equity in PML in the context of a

corporate restructuring in 2011.!%3

In addition, the Claimant raises an argument that, in its view, “eliminates every objection raised

by the Respondent in this preliminary phase of the arbitration”,

ie., it has continuously
“controlled, managed, and supervised PML’s business” since 2001,'°° such that it should qualify
as an investor in Australia since that date regardless of the 2011 restructuring. Given the nature
of the Claimant’s defence, the Tribunal considers it expedient to address this contention at the

outset, before turning to the Parties’ views on the two specific jurisdictional objections.

Finally, the Tribunal summarises the Parties’ positions on the burden of proof in respect of the

bifurcated preliminary objections.

A. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT HAS EXERCISED CONTROL WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE
1(e) OF THE TREATY SINCE 2001

1. The Meaning of “Controlled”

188. The Parties disagree with respect to the meaning of the term “controlled” in Article I(e) of the
Treaty. Whereas the Claimant contends that oversight and management control is sufficient, the
Respondent believes that a showing of a legal and economic interest in the investment is

required for the purpose of establishing control.

Article 1(e) of the Treaty reads as follows:

“investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one
Contracting Party and admitted by the other Contracting Party subject to its law and
investment policies applicable from time to time...

For the purposes of this Agreement, a physical person or company shall be regarded as
controlling a company or an investment if the person or company has a substantial interest
in the company or the investment.

(a) The Meaning of the Term “Controlled” in Accordance with Article 31 VCLT
189. The Parties are in agreement that Article 1(e) of the Treaty is to be interpreted in accordance
with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”).'°° The Article
provides as follows:
Article 31
General rule of interpretation

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be
given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to
the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connection with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the
conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument
related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of
the treaty or the application of its provisions;

'6 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, 1155 UNTS 331 (entered into force on 27 January

1980).

PCA 157710 36

(b

any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the
agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the
parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.

The Claimant’s Position

190. Applying Article 31 of the VCLT to the Treaty, the Claimant argues that the concept of

191.

“substantial interest” is not determinative of the meaning of “control” under the Treaty.
According to the Claimant, “substantial interest” is one way, but not the only way, to prove
“control”.!57 The Claimant asserts that the Treaty language “shall be regarded as controlling a
company or an investment” does not mean that control can only be found “in the presence of, or
requires a substantial interest”.!** The drafters of this Treaty, in the Claimant’s view, could have
chosen a different wording had they intended “substantial interest” to be the only way to prove

control.!*?

Furthermore, the Claimant criticises the Respondent’s attempt to “make ‘substantial interest’ the
exclusive definition of control” on the basis that the Respondent does not provide a clear
definition of substantial interest but simply implies that it means substantial ownership
interest.'© Substantial control does not always require ownership, the Claimant explains,
because “the word ‘ownership’ does not appear in the wording of the phrase” and “control is
distinct from ownership under the Treaty”.'°' According to the Claimant, as a result of the
ordinary meaning of Article 1(e) of the Treaty, in particular the word “or”, the Treaty provides
that “ownership and control are two distinct and independent bases” for establishing a protected
investment.’ The Claimant maintains that neither dictionary definitions of control nor the
ordinary meaning of control in the corporate context link control to ownership.'® Rather, “the
ordinary meaning of ‘control’ focuses on the ability of one entity or person to direct the actions

of another”.!“ The Claimant explains that its “management control—pursuant to which it
managed, directed, superintended, governed and oversaw the Australian subsidiaries—fits this
definition”.'® In any event, whether or not “substantial interest” is the exclusive definition of
“control” under Article 1(e), the Claimant maintains that “[t]he ordinary meaning of ‘substantial
interest’ includes management control” and that “if a supervising entity manages every aspect of
a business” then “that supervising entity has a substantial interest in the business”.'°

For the purposes of defining Article I(e) within a particular treaty context, the Claimant
disputes the Respondent’s reliance on the meaning of “investment” as solely referring to
economic contributions of a certain duration involving some element of risk. According to the
Claimant, “Article 1(e) of the Treaty defines ‘investment’ to mean ‘every kind of asset, owned
or controlled by investors of one Contracting Party and admitted by the other Contracting
Party’”.'°7 Moreover, the definition provided by the Respondent refers to the criteria set out in
Salini v. Morocco—an ICSID case that was never intended to establish a universal definition of

“investment” in investment treaties but refers, at most, to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.'*

The Claimant refers to the Holderness Report as stating that, “in the context of multinational
corporations, it is common practice for control—but not necessarily ownership—of certain
subsidiaries to be delegated to another subsidiary within the same corporate family”.!® The
separation of ownership and control is, according to the Claimant, “one of the defining features
of the corporation that distinguishes it from other organizations”.!”? The Claimant cites the
Holderness Report as stating that, “the key feature of control is not financial interest, but rather
the existence of performance measurement and evaluation, and incentive and disincentive
systems that allow the controlling entity to ‘determine the management of corporate

resources’”.'7!

According to the Claimant, in International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico,'” the
tribunal defined control in a corporate setting as “the power to effectively decide and implement
the key decisions of the business activity off an enterprise...”.'% Similarly, the tribunal in
Bilcon of Delaware v. Canada confirmed “that ownership is not necessary to establish control
of an investment”. According to the Claimant, in Bilcon of Delaware v. Canada, the tribunal
was concerned with the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1139 which “is analogous to Article
1(e) of the [Treaty]”.'° The Bilcon Award involved a claimant that “did ‘not formally hold any
equity in any relevant entities of the Bilcon group’”. '° According to the Claimant, “[a]lthough
Mr. Clayton did not exercise any formal control of the relevant entities, the tribunal decided to
look at evidence of informal control—unrelated to ownership—to establish jurisdiction”. '”’ The
Bilcon tribunal stated that “the evidentiary record does not exclude any reasonable possibility
that [the claimant] exercised indirect control in other—less formal—ways”.!78

The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s interpretation of International Thunderbird
Gaming Corporation vy. Mexico as establishing that control is linked to the expectation to
receive an economic return. Contrary to the Respondent’s view, the Claimant emphasises that
“the Thunderbird tribunal did not conclude that an economic return is a necessary condition to
establish control”.! The Claimant emphasises that in the Thunderbird Award, the tribunal
reasoned that “‘[c]ontrol can also be achieved by the power to effectively decide and implement
the key decisions of the business activity of an enterprise’ without the legal capacity to
control”.!*° According to the Claimant, “the nature of [its] control is comparable to that
exhibited by the investor in [the] Thunderbird [Award]” on the ground that the Claimant was
responsible for the approval of PML’s major business decisions and significant investments and
was directly involved in the overseeing of the implementation of PML’s business plans, the

approval of significant expenditures and payment of dividends, as well as the appointment of

top level management in the Australian subsidiaries.'*! These factors, viewed collectively,

support the Claimant's position.'*?

In support of its assertion that oversight and management can suffice to establish control for the
purposes of enjoying treaty protections, the Claimant refers to the findings of the tribunal in
S.D. Myers v. Canada.'* According to the Claimant, the S.D. Myers tribunal confirmed that,
“control can exist independently of ownership”.'** In $.D. Myers v. Canada, the tribunal was
concerned with the relationship between a claimant corporation, SDMI, and the subject of the
dispute, a separate company called Myers Canada. SDMI did not own any equity in Myers
Canada, but both companies were owned by the same four brothers, one of whom was,
according to the Claimant, also the “CEO” or “President” of SDMI.'*° The Claimant asserts that
the S.D. Myers tribunal “relied on the testimony of the President of SDMI that he controlled
Myers Canada in his role as President of SDMI, even though SDMI did not own equity in
Myers Canada and that there was no legal agreement ‘set[ting] out the respective
responsibilities and obligations’ of the companies”.'*° When the respondent State sought to set
aside the decision, the Federal Court of Canada “strongly endorsed the [A]ward” and made a
finding that “[t]he meaning of ‘controlled directly or indirectly’ is its ordinary meaning. In this
case, the tribunal found that SDMI controlled Myers Canada. “This control was not based on the
legal ownership of shares, but on the fact that Mr. Dana Myers controlled every decision, every
instrument, every move by Myers Canada, and Mr. Myers did so as chief executive officer of
SDMI”.'*? The Claimant also refers to the decision in Perenco v. Ecuador—a case in which the
claimant did not possess legal title to the shares in question on the date of consent to the
arbitration. According to the Claimant, the tribunal held that jurisdiction was proper because the
treaty covered investments “owned or controlled” by French nationals, and the French claimants
exerted indirect control over the Ecuadorian investments at issue.'** The tribunal in Perenco v.

Ecuador stated that it would not take a “formalistic approach to the question of control”.'*°

The Claimant disputes that its interpretation of “control” runs counter to the object and purpose
of the Treaty.'® In response to the argument that the Claimant’s interpretation of control would
not require assets, funds and technology transfer, the Claimant notes that its “position does
contemplate that the investor manages the development of investments in Australia, authorises
new investments and controls decisions related to the transfer of assets, funds, expertise”.!°! The
Claimant dismisses the Respondent’s requirement of “exposure to risk” on the basis that the
Treaty does not contain such a requirement.’ In any event, the Claimant disputes the
Respondent’s assertion that it did not assume any risk of the investment’s failure since the
Claimant “had a significant interest in the economic performance of the Australian
subsidiaries”.!° Finally, the Claimant does not find it problematic to allow multiple claims
related to “controlled” investments, since, in the Claimant’s view, this resembles the situation of
“possible multiple claims over ‘owned’ investments”.'** In any case, the Claimant considers
there to be only “three PMI entities” that “could be understood as having exercised ‘control’ of
PM Australia and PML in the pre-2011 period”.'> The Claimant criticises the Respondent’s
position that it should not incur obligations to an unknowable class of investors, arguing that
“Ta] [S]tate’s unilateral offer to arbitrate disputes with all investors of the other contracting
party, be they known or unknown, is a core element of an investment treaty”.!°° Australian law

does not require the notification of all foreign investments.!””

According to the Claimant, the purpose of the Treaty is to “create favourable conditions for
greater investment by investors of one Contracting Party in the area of the other”.!°* In the
Claimant’s view, regardless of whether there is ownership of an investment, protecting the
actors who make investment decisions and who are held accountable for those decisions, will
promote investment and advance the purpose of the Treaty.'°? The Claimant maintains that

interpreting the Treaty as covering PM Asia would recognise that the Treaty “incentivizes

investment by reducing legal and political risk”.? This is because ”[w]hen an entity like PM
Asia is held accountable for investment decisions made in Australia—even if that entity does

not own the investments—legal and political risk will strongly influence its decision making”.?°!

The Claimant relies on supplementary means of interpretation to support its definition of Article
1(e) of the Treaty as entailing “control” by oversight and management.” Thus, the Claimant
cites the travaux préparatoires of the Treaty as recording that “officials of the Australian
government [had] reported internally regarding the final version of the [Treaty] [that] ‘[w]e
insisted [on] elements that were central to all of our IPAs, such as... a definition of investment
that included the notion of control as well as ownership”. According to the Claimant, the
Respondent “rejected suggestions from Hong Kong that the Treaty should cover only ‘directly
and indirectly’ owned investments”. The Claimant concludes that the travaux préparatoires
show that the Respondent “wanted Article 1(e) to protect assets that were controlled, but not

necessarily owned, by investors”.2”

The Claimant also relies on the language in other Australian investment treaties to argue that a
substantial interest is not the only way to establish control.? Contrary to the Respondent’s
view, the Claimant asserts that the tribunal in Nova Scotia Power Inc. v. Venezuela did not
disregard treaty practice as such but merely mentioned that “looking at prior treaty-making
practice requires caution”.””’ The Claimant notes that the tribunals in Churchill Mining v.
Indonesia and Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan found that a contracting party’s treaty practice can be
considered as a “supplementary means of interpretation”.°* The Claimant points to the
Respondent’s investment treaties with Argentina and India as well as the Model Bilateral
Investment Treaty at that time, which demonstrate a consistent approach in favour of the

Claimant’s interpretation of control.”

The Respondent's Position

201.

202.

Referring to the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article I(e) of the Treaty, the Respondent
contends that, “Article 1(e) partly states that an investor ‘shall be regarded as controlling ... a
company or an investment if the [investor] has a substantial interest in the company or the
investment’”.?! As drafted, this mandatory language in Article 1(e) defines the meaning of
control exclusively by reference to “substantial interest”.?!! No other activity will, according to

the Respondent, establish control.

Having a “substantial interest” means, according to the Respondent, “that the putative investor
must have a right or power over an asset which is sourced in a legal arrangement, and which is
capable of being exercised in some significant way that affects the economic returns from and

disposition of the asset’ The meaning of substantial interest as an economic interest can,

according to the Respondent, be derived from the “context of the term ‘control’” in the

213

Treaty.*!° Thus, “[t]he context provided by the term ‘investment’ militates against the
interpretation of ‘control’ contended for by PM Asia—namely that of management and
oversight—‘“[because] ‘investments’ are understood as an economic contribution of a certain
duration which involves some element of risk”.'* The Respondent refers to Articles 2(2), 3(1)
and 8(1) of the Treaty which “apply to ‘investments and returns’ of investors” where the term
“returns” means “the amounts yielded or derived from an investment” such as profits or
dividends.”5 The Respondent also refers to Article 6(1) of the Treaty, which provides that
investors should be compensated for any loss suffered.”'® According to the Respondent, in the
absence of any substantial economic interest in the investment, the Claimant “could not have
suffered any financial loss” and thus “would not be entitled to any compensatory damages”.”!”
Therefore, in light of the context of the provisions of the Treaty, control over an investment

must entail an economic relationship. The Respondent recalls that, “in the period 2001-2011,

PM Asia did not have any expectation of ‘an economic return’ from its asserted ‘control’ of PM

Australia and PML”?!

According to the Respondent, the determinations of other tribunals support its assertions
regarding the need for an economic relationship. Thus, the tribunal in /nternational Thunderbird
Gaming Corporation v. Mexico “linked ‘de facto control’ with ‘the expectation to receive an
economic return’”.?!° Similarly, in Romak SA v. Uzbekistan, the tribunal stated that, “the term
‘investments’ under the treaty has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor
resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over

a certain period of time and that involves some risk”.”°

According to the Respondent, the definition of “control” suggested by the Claimant “is

inconsistent with the object and purpose of the [Treaty]”.”?! The Respondent argues that
oversight and management control would not require assets, funds or technology transfer
between Hong Kong and Australia. This would frustrate the purpose of the Treaty to “promote
investment, economic co-operation and mutual prosperity ‘between the Contracting Parties’”.””
The Claimant’s contention that protecting actors who actually make investment decisions would
promote investments, is, in the Respondent’s view, not supported by the text of the Treaty.”
Similar to its assertions with respect to the context provided by Articles 2(2), 3(1), 6(1) and 8(1)
of the Treaty, the Respondent submits that the purpose of the Treaty does not allow actors who

do not suffer any economic loss to bring a claim.?”4

The Claimant’s interpretation of control would, the Respondent emphasizes, “lead to a
multiplication of possible claimants in respect of the same investment”, including at least FTR
Holding SA, PMI and PM Asia.”*> According to the Respondent, the very risk of creating
uncertainty as to which entity may be considered an “investor” and what constitutes an

“investment” under the treaty led the tribunal in Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia to reject the test of

“control” based on the exercise of management functions alone.””° Similarly, the Respondent
stresses that “information about the detail of management practices within a corporate group is
generally not available publicly” and that the Claimant’s interpretation of “control” as
equivalent to such internal management practices would expose the Respondent to “obligations

2 227

[owed] to an unknowable class of investors”.

The Respondent refers to the travaux préparatoires as “clearly demonstrat[ing] that Australia
and Hong Kong regarded the need for a ‘substantial interest’ as the sole criterion of control”.””
According to the Respondent, Hong Kong was initially unwilling to agree to the inclusion of
“control” but agreed on the basis that it was defined by reference to the concept of “substantial
interest”.”° The Respondent asserts that the discussion of “substantial interest” by the Treaty
drafters was not, as the Claimant asserts, by reference to direct or indirect ownership, but rather
in order to distinguish “full” ownership and having a “substantial interest” which nonetheless
confers control. **°

The Respondent takes issue with the Claimant’s reference to other Australian investment
treaties in support of its interpretation of Article 1(e) on the grounds that the text of other
treaties is irrelevant to the interpretation of this Treaty and that “prior treaty-making practice” is
also irrelevant as “supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32” of the VCLT, as
confirmed by the tribunal in Nova Scotia Power Incorporated v. Venezuela.”*! Furthermore, the
Respondent notes that in any event the Claimant “has failed to establish a consistent [Treaty]

232

practice” by Australia.

The Respondent disputes the relevance of S.D. Myers v. Canada for establishing that “‘control’
can exist separately from ‘ownership’”. 77 According to the Respondent, the decision in S.D.
Myers v. Canada turned on the fact that the NAFTA defines “investment of an investor” as an

“investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor”.>4 The Respondent also

highlights that, unlike in the Treaty, Chapter 11 of NAFTA does not contain any clarification on
what is meant by the term “control”, for example by reference to “substantial interest”.?*°
According to the Respondent, there are also significant factual differences between S.D. Myers
v. Canada and the present dispute.?*° Specifically, unlike in S.D. Myers v. Canada, the Claimant
here did not “direc[t] the actions of PML”, “derive a profit from PM Australia’s/PML’s

business”, “contribut[e] to the capital of PML”, “provid{e] PML with any speciali[s]ed technical

know-how” or “regularly work together” with PML.?*”

Similarly, the Respondent disputes the relevance of the Bilcon Award for three reasons. First,
the Bilcon of Delaware v. Canada claim was brought under Chapter 11 of NAFTA “which does
not contain a test for control such as that found in Art I(e) of the [Treaty]’.?** Second, the
Bilcon tribunal, according to the Respondent, “held that the state of the evidentiary record did
not permit it to make a determination as to the issue of ‘control’”.?* In contrast, in the present
dispute, the Claimant “has had ample opportunity ... to make good its assertions”.“° Third,
although the claimant in Bilcon of Delaware v. Canada “had no ownership interest in Bilcon of
Delaware, it seems there was evidence that he ran the business and had made a financial
contribution, and it is possible that there was an agreement conferring rights of control on

Mr. Clayton”.*4' The Respondent states that none of these factors are present in this case.?4?

(b) The Meaning of the Term “Controlled” in Light of other Arbitral Awards

The Respondent's Position

210.

Even if “significant interest” does not exclusively define the meaning of “control” under the
Treaty, the Respondent refers to a number of cases where the meaning of “control” was, in its
view, established to mean something more than management practices.? For example, the

Respondent refers to the findings of the arbitral tribunal in Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia where

“control” was linked with “legal capacity to control”, and in turn defined by reference to “the
percentage of shares held”.?* The Respondent cites the Aguas del Tunari tribunal as stating that
“the word ‘controlled’ is not intended as an alternative to ownership since control without an
ownership interest would define a group of entities not necessarily possessing an interest which
could be the subject of a claim. Jn this sense ‘controlled’ indicates a quality of the ownership
interest” 2°

In Vacuum Salt v. Ghana, the ICSID tribunal determined that “a total absence of foreign
shareholding would virtually preclude the existence of [foreign] control”.““° The Respondent
acknowledges that the fact pattern in Vacuum Salt v. Ghana was different to the present case
since, in Vacuum Salt v. Ghana, the tribunal was concerned with determining whether a

Ghanaian company was controlled by an individual.’

However, the Respondent asserts that the
relevance of Vacuum Salt v. Ghana is that “the tribunal rejected an assertion of control in
circumstances where the supposed controller exercised a far greater level of influence over a
corporate entity than PM Asia supposedly exercised over PM Australia or PML”.* The
Respondent recalls that the Claimant “held no shares in PM Australia or PML” nor any “legal

rights conveyed in instruments or agreements” in the period between 2001 and 2011.”

The Respondent also refers to International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico in
which the tribunal held that a number of factors, viewed collectively, justified the finding that
the claimant controlled the relevant minority-owned subsidiaries. These factors, according to the
Respondent, were: (i) that the claimant held more than 30% of the share capital in the
subsidiaries; (ii) the claimant “expected an economic return on its investment in the
subsidiaries”; (iii) the “key officers of [the claimant] and [the subsidiaries] were one and the
same”; and (iv) “the initial expenditures, the knowhow of the machines, the selection of
suppliers, and the expected return on the investment were provided or determined by [the
claimant].”?° The Respondent submits that “[i]n contrast, none of these factors were present in

the relationship between PM Asia and PM Australia/PML prior to February 2011”.75!

The Respondent accepts that “control” may be established in certain other circumstances, for
example, where there is a formal agreement to this effect—as was the case in AJG Capital
Partners, Inc. v. Kazakhstan2** The Respondent emphasises, however, that no equivalent

formal agreement exists in the present case."

Nevertheless, although AJG Capital Partners,
Inc. v. Kazakhstan entailed a different fact pattern to that which characterises the present
dispute, the Respondent maintains that the case “nonetheless provides an example of what is
necessary in order to establish ‘control’ [and that t]he existence of certain management practices

is not enough”.?**

The Claimant’s Position

214.

215.

256

258

The Claimant asserts that the cases cited by the Respondent do not support its assertion that
there is a generally accepted meaning of “control”. “Nothing in the decisions does or could
supersede the plain text of the Treaty, the travaux préparatoires, and arbitral jurisprudence, all
of which align on the core point: management control is an independent basis for jurisdiction,

distinct from ownership, under Article 1(e) [of the Hong Kong-Australia BIT]”.?*

The Claimant disputes the relevance of the decision in Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia on the basis
that the relevant treaty in that case did not contain “owned or” as an alternative to
“controlled”.?** In contrast to the present case, the Claimant notes that the tribunal in Aguas del
Tunari focused on the question of whether the actual exercise of control was a necessary
element in addition to the legal capacity to control.” In the Claimant’s view, the tribunal found
only that legal capacity to control is sufficient to establish control; the tribunal therefore “did
not find that actual control by itself is insufficient to meet the standard of control” as suggested
by the Respondent.”* The Claimant emphasises that the Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia case also
contradicts the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant did not control the Australian

subsidiaries pursuant to Article 1(e) of the Treaty because “PMI ultimately controlled the

Claimant”. According to the Claimant, the finding of the Aguas del Tunari tribunal found that

“[t]he BIT does not limit the scope of eligible claimants to only the ‘ultimate controller” 2°

The Claimant also explains that Vacuum Salt v. Ghana does not help the Respondent because it
addresses issues that are very different from the present case, such as the meaning of “foreign
controlled” under the ICSID Convention and the involvement of “an individual’s person
property, not an investment within a corporate family”. The Claimant points to the tribunal’s
finding that, for the purpose of establishing control, “a tribunal... may regard any criterion
based on management, voting rights, shareholding or any other reasonable theory as being
reasonable for the purpose”.”*' The Claimant stresses that in Vacuum Salt v. Ghana, the
claimant presented “exceedingly thin” evidence in support of its assertion of control, and the
Vacuum Salt tribunal therefore asserted that “[i]t is significant that nowhere does there appear to
be any material evidence that [the claimant] either acted or was materially influenced in a truly
managerial rather than technical or supervisory vein... Nowhere in these proceedings is it
suggested that [the claimant]... was in a position to steer, through either positive or negative
action, the fortunes of Vacuum Salt”.2°? The Claimant maintains that, unlike the investor in
Vacuum Salt v. Ghana, it “has exercised significant ‘control’ over the investment within the
plain meaning of that term”, that the evidentiary record in this case is “bursting with evidence of
Claimant’s control of the Australian subsidiaries” and that the relevance of Vacuum Salt v.

Ghana should therefore be rejected.”

The Claimant reiterates that International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico in fact

supports the Claimant’s position.”

In the Thunderbird Award, the tribunal interpreted the term
control “in accordance with its ordinary meaning” and held that “[c]ontrol can also be achieved
by the power to effectively decide and implement the key decisions of the business activity of
an enterprise” absent legal capacity to control.? The Thunderbird tribunal then examined the
facts and determined that the claimant exercised de facto control over the investment and

therefore “controlled” the investment for the purposes of jurisdiction under NAFTA.” The

Claimant agrees with the Respondent that there were a series of factors that led the Thunderbird
tribunal to its conclusions.” The Claimant emphasises that both Parties agreed these factors are
to be “viewed collectively—i.e. that no individual factor is dispositive or necessary”. 78 This is
significant for the Claimant’s position in this case since, “on any ‘collective’ view of the
evidence, Claimant’s exercise of control of PML is undeniable”. Thus, according to the
Claimant, the evidence in the present case satisfies the Thunderbird tribunal’s formulation of
“control”?

As regards the AIG Capital Partners, Inc. v. Kazakhstan decision, the Claimant considers it
“entirely irrelevant” because there is no similar legal agreement between the parties in the

present case”.?” The A/G Capital Partners tribunal, the Claimant emphasises, “takes no

position on whether management control can qualify as control under an investment treaty”.?”!

In the Respondent’s view, “[e]ven if PM Asia’s assertion that “oversight and management
control’ qualifies as ‘control’ under Article 1(e) of the Treaty is correct (which it is not), PM
Asia has failed to demonstrate that it did in fact exercise such ‘control’ over PM Australia and
PML before the restructur[ing]”.””? The Respondent supports this assertion on the following
basis: (i) the evidence demonstrates that any control over PM Australia and PML was exercised
regionally by PMI; (ii) Mr. Pellegrini’s responsibilities in respect of PM Australia and PML
were limited and insufficient to amount to “control”; (iii) there was no delegation of control
from PMI to PM Asia; and (iv) PM Asia’s asserted “control” is inconsistent with the PMI

Group’s application to FIRB.*” These assertions are set out in more detail below.

With respect to whether PM Asia or PMI controlled PM Australia and PML before the
restructuring, the Respondent asserts that the documentary evidence provided by the Claimant is

“sparse, incomplete and inadequate” and argues that any control over PM Australia and PML

was in fact exercised by “the ultimate parent company, PMI”.?" According to the Respondent,
PMI assigned specific individuals to Hong Kong to oversee decisions concerning the Australian
subsidiaries who “acted in their capacity as part of a PMI structure, not in their capacity as
officers of PM Asia”.?”>

To elaborate on its arguments, the Respondent disputes that one of the Claimant’s primary
functions has been the oversight of PMI affiliates in Asia on the grounds that the PMI Annual
Report for 2008 does not even mention PM Asia and that Mr. Pellegrini is described therein as
the President of the “Asia Region”, consistently with his profile on the PMI website.?” The
“only contemporaneous document” provided by the Claimant, the Respondent notes, does not
suggest that PM Asia personnel has anything to do with the restructuring process.” The
Respondent also contests the Claimant’s alleged “various appointments of PML’s senior
management”, arguing that, “the documentary evidence establishes no link between such

appointments and PM Asia officeholders acting in that capacity”.?”*

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s evidence only indicates that various officers at
PML reported to “individuals holding positions in the PMI ‘Asia Pacific Region’, and not to PM
Asia”.”” The Respondent emphasises that, “documentary evidence, witness testimony and [the
Claimant’s] own organizational structure” establish that “what was important for the personnel
at the Australian subsidiaries in their reporting lines was the ‘region’”.”*° Thus, the Respondent
points out that the Claimant “has not established that the actions undertaken by Mr. Pellegrini
with respect to the Australian subsidiaries were done either in the capacity of President of PM
Asia (which he was not), or as a director of PM Asia (which he was). The documentary

evidence is consistent with him exercising powers as President of the Asia Region of PMI’.5!

Respondent stresses that this does not alter the fact that “those managers and directors are

The Respondent points to further documentary evidence to support its assertion that PM Asia
did not provide oversight of the Australian subsidiaries. As regards PML’s financial
performance and budget, the Respondent emphasizes that the documents produced by the
Claimant concern a market strategy review meeting in 2003 and only show that “PM Asia was
responsible for organizing, and providing feedback from, that meeting” but not control of

ion that it is the CEO of PMI

 
 

PML.”*3 The Respondent points to Mr. Pellegrini’s own admi
who finalises PML’s budget and concludes that, “ultimate decision-making power rested with
PMI’.?* Addressing the approval of PML’s capital expenditures, the Respondent emphasises
that, contrary to the Claimant’s assertion, Mr. Pellegrini gave his approval in his role within
PMI and the expenditures were approved in accordance with a PMI policy.”*> Furthermore, the
person “who gave the ultimate approval for PML’s payment of dividends”, the Respondent
notes, was “a PMI officer”.?°°

With respect to Mr. Pellegrini’s responsibilities, the Respondent submits that the limited
responsibilities of individuals like Mr. Pellegrini “would still not amount to ‘control’ by PM
Asia”.s7 The Respondent relies on Professor Lys’s expert report to argue that, “the final
decision was often made by [Mr. Pellegrini’s] supervisors within PMI”.*** The Respondent cites

*° Where the Claimant

 

several examples to demonstrate Mr. Pellegrini’s limited responsibilities
insists that it controlled PML’s major business initiatives and budgets through reviewing and
approving PML’s OB/LRP since 2001, the Respondent asserts that Mr. Pellegrini’s evidence
was in fact that “PMI ‘finalised the numbers’ on PML’s [OB/LRP] ... [and that] Mr. Pellegrini
would review the budgets against a standard provided to him by PMI’.2” As to the Claimant’s
assertion that it “directed PML’s branding and marketing strategy”, the Respondent asserts that
“Mr. Pellegrini agreed that decisions concerning international brands had to be approved by
PMI in Lausanne”. *! As to the Claimant’s assertion that PML managing directors reported to
and worked under the supervision of the Claimant’s President, Mr. Pellegrini, the Respondent

asserts that “the evidence shows that much of the reporting was directly to ‘central function’

personnel in Lausanne, and only indirectly to Mr. Pellegrini on a ‘dotted line’ basis”.??
According to the Respondent, this “in no sense... establish[es] ‘control’ of those departments of
the Australian subsidiaries”.°°? The Respondent states further that “PMI’s RACI tables? make
it clear that Mr. Pellegrini’s ability to approve [capital] expenditure was restricted, and even in
those limited cases in which Mr. Pellegrini was involved in approvals, anything above USD
25 million also required approval from someone higher up in PMI”.”® Finally, the Respondent
notes that any approval of the Australian subsidiaries’ dividend payments had to be approved by
the “director Treasury PMI”.?°°

The Respondent refers to the facts in S.D. Myers v. Canada to emphasise its position that
“control” cannot be established through an “intermediate company”. According to the
Respondent, in S.D. Myers v. Canada, “the CEO of SD Myers was the ‘authoritative voice’ and
‘directing mind and controller’ of both companies, who ‘directed and controlled every decision
of Myers Canada’. In the present case, there are manifest limitations on Mr. Pellegrini’s ability

to make decisions in respect of the Australian subsidiaries”.?%”

 

The Respondent asserts that del d control is not p d under any i treaty when
the delegator does not qualify as an investor, because “any control being exercised is not that of
PM Asia as the delegate, but that of the delegator”.°* The Respondent explains that “delegated
control—which is revocable at will by the company exercising actual control—cannot be
sufficient to establish “control” for the purposes of Article 1(e) of the Treaty and is not
protected when the delegator is not an “investor” under the [Treaty]...[since] PMI [is] an entity
not protected by the [Treaty]”.2 The Respondent refers to the evidence of Professor Lys as
stating that, “delegated control is meaningful from an economic point of view only where the

delegate is more than a mere caretaker for the delegator”. >

“Asia region” rather than “PM Asia”.*° Referring to Mr. Pellegrini’s testimony, the Claimant
asserts that he “was and remains the President of PM Asia”.*!° The Claimant explains that
Mr. Pellegrini’s title refers to “Asia region” because “PM Asia is the headquarters for PMI’s
Asia region” and “[o]versight and supervision of PMI affiliates in the Asia region is one of PM
Asia’s primary functions”.*!! The Claimant reiterates that secondments to PM Asia were
arranged on the basis that PM Asia had the right to supervise and define the duties and activities
of the “Expatriates”.*!? According to the Claimant, “Respondent has been unable to refute the
fact that Mr. Pellegrini regardless of his title, works on behalf of PM Asia (as proven by his
employment letter and his position as the senior director of PM Asia) and that he had his staff at
PM Asia control the Australian subsidiaries (as proven by the documentary evidence of PM
Asia’s management control of the Australian subsidiaries covering many years)”.*!7

The Claimant contends that it “has controlled the composition of PM Australia’s and PML’s
Boards, approved PML’s budgets and strategy, authorised PM Australia’s dividend payments,
overseen PML’s marketing and sales plans, approved the introduction of new brands in
Australia, and evaluated and approved the evaluations of PML’s key offices”.*"* In this regard,
the Claimant refers to the witness testimony of its President, Mr. Pellegrini, and that of the
Managing Director of PML, Mr. John Gledhill. The Claimant also explains that it exercised
control over PML since at least 2001 by overseeing its senior staff; directing its budgeting and
business planning processes; requiring PML to secure the Claimant’s approval for certain
expenditures, including capital investments; and requiring approval for other business decisions,
including developing and launching new products, discontinuing products, changing product
packaging, adjusting recommended retail prices, and developing marketing plans.*!° The
Claimant has also exercised control by virtue of the fact that the Claimant’s President appoints
or approves the appointment of the senior managers of PML who then become board

members.*!®

With respect to Mr. Pellegrini’s responsibilities, the Claimant refers to the “employment
contracts of Messrs. Gledhill and Boissart” and reiterates that PML managing directors reported
to and worked under the supervision of Mr. Pellegrini.*'’ According to the Claimant,
Mr. Pellegrini “completed the annual performance reviews of the Managing Directors of PML”,
“fixed the salaries of PML employees” and “set the annual bonuses of PML staff”.*!* Moreover,
“t]he employment contracts and personnel announcements for other key PML management”,
the Claimant argues, indicate its control over PML.*! To further support its position, the
Claimant provided what it characterises as “[i]nternal organizational and reporting line

documentation from 2009”.*°

The Claimant insists that it controlled PML’s major business initiatives and budgets through
reviewing and approving PML’s OB/LRP since 2001.*”! In addressing the Respondent’s
concern over the OB/LRP process, the Claimant refers to the agendas for the 2008, 2009 and
2010 regional OB/LRP reviews in Hong Kong and Mr. Pellegrini’s account of the review
process for PML’s 2010 OB/LRP.*” The Claimant also points out that “PML was also required

to submit revised budget forecasts to Claimant each month”.*?*

Various examples of PML initiatives that were approved by the Claimant in 2009 demonstrate,
according to the Claimant, that it directed PML’s branding and marketing strategy.** In the
context of approvals of PML’s major expenditures and capital investments, the Claimant
considers any distinction between approvals made by the Asia Region and those by PM Asia
“meaningless”.**> According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s argument concerning the PMI
policy for the approval of expenditures is “unhelpful” because the fact that the expenditure
approval process has been standardised across the company has nothing to do with the
Claimant’s approval.*”° Similarly, the Claimant maintains that the fact that PMI approval was

required for large expenditures does not affect the Claimant’s approval in this context.*?” As

regards the approval of dividend payments, the Claimant contends that the requirement of
multiple approvals does not change the “critical fact... that PML dividend payments required

Claimant's approval” 25

The Claimant counters the Respondent’s assertion that PM Asia’s executives acted on behalf of

PMI instead of PM Asia on the grounds that the position of “President Asia Region” is a

position with PM Asia, and that both employment letters Po

worked on behalf of PM Asia.*° The Claimant also points out that Mr. Pellegrini was not only
seconded to PM Asia in 2003 but also appointed to PM Asia’s board of directors.**° Hence, “the
fact that Mr. Pellegrini was part of PMI’s global management team”, the Claimant suggests, “is
fully consistent with his role as President of PM Asia’”.**!

The Claimant states that the legal arguments of the Respondent, namely “that if Claimant
controlled the Australian subsidiaries, then it must have been exercising the powers of a
shareholder”, turns on a “factual question”: “Did Claimant exercise powers held by PML
shareholders?” The Claimant asserts that it did not, and that the Respondent’s legal argument
must therefore fall away.*** The Claimant’s arguments are, in summary, that the Respondent
“blurs the distinction” between the activities of PML employees and members of PML’s board
of directors to the effect that it appears as though Mr. Pellegrini acted with the powers of a PML
shareholder.*** The Claimant rejects this mischaracterisation of the powers of PML employees.
For example, the Claimant refers to Mr. Pellegrini’s First Witness Statement, wherein
Mr. Pellegrini confirms that he had no power to remove directors from PML’s board of
directors and could not have exercised powers equivalent to a shareholder.*** The Claimant also
asserts that while “Claimant has the authority to approve the appointments of individuals to
functional roles such as PML’s Director of Finance or Director of Marketing”, this does not

mean that the Claimant had the power to appoint individuals to PML’s board of directors.*° As

set out in Mr. Pellegrini’s Second Witness Statement, “PML’s board appoints individuals to
PM’s board of directors and fills any vacancies”.**’ The Claimant also states that while
Mr. Pellegrini did fix salaries and bonuses of individuals in their roles as PML personnel, “[this]
says nothing about Claimant’s power to set remuneration for individuals in their capacities as
PML board members”.*** The Claimant stresses that it “did not have the latent power to, and
never purported to, set compensation for directors acting in their capacities as board members

before February 2011.3

The Claimant disputes the relevance of the Respondent’s contention that delegated control is not
protected under any Treaty when the delegator does not qualify as an investor because that
control can be revoked at will.“° According to the Claimant, the Treaty “speaks only of
‘control’ not ‘revocable’ or ‘irrevocable’ control”.™! Furthermore, the fact that a higher level
entity within the PMI Group could have revoked the Claimant’s control over the Australian
subsidiaries is irrelevant: “[t]he undisputed fact is that Claimant’s control was never
revoked”.*? According to the Claimant, “[i]f an investor has control when the host [S]tate takes
adverse action, that is sufficient for purposes of jurisdiction. It does not matter under Article

1(e) whether that control could have been revoked by a higher entity”.

Treasurer about the “agreement by virtue of which he or she acquires a substantial shareholding
in an Australian corporation” in order to “avoid a criminal offence’”.** In the Respondent’s
view, the Claimant either did not have control over the investment or had control but failed to
satisfy the notification requirement.”

The Respondent counters the Claimant’s argument that it equates the meaning of substantial
interest under the Treaty and under Australian law, emphasising that its position is entirely
based on sections 26(2), 5(1) and 11(2)(d) of the FATA.™* According to the Respondent, “[a]
person exercises the ‘rights attached to a share’ if that person exercises powers that are held by
the shareholder”, including the power to “dismiss a director-level employee”, the power to
“appoint directors at a general meeting” and the power to “review the remuneration of
directors”.*”

As regards section 38 of the FATA, the Respondent notes that the effect of a failure to notify is
that the agreements between the PM entities by virtue of which it is said PM Asia had control of
the Australian subsidiaries are not automatically invalidated, which does not “prevent inquiry

into the legal validity of acts purportedly done under the FATA”.3°°

establishing control.**! The Claimant contends that the Respondent also “incorrectly equates the
meaning of ‘substantial interest’ under the Treaty and under Australian law”.3>?

In any event, the Claimant argues that the notification requirement does not affect the admission
of its investment because section 38 of the FATA states that “[a]n act is not invalidated by the

fact that it constitutes an offence against this Act”.*°

In the Claimant’s view, it did not exercise powers held by PML shareholders as the Respondent
suggests. First, the Claimant notes that Mr. Pellegrini did not and “could not remove directors
from PML’s board of directors”.**4 Secondly, “[nJeither Claimant nor Mr. Pellegrini ever
claimed to have appointed individuals directly to PML’s board of directors before February
2011”.°° Thirdly, contrary to the Respondent’s view, the Claimant only reviews the
remuneration of PML employees but not directors.**° As far as section 38 of the FATA is

ion

 

concerned, the Claimant maintains that “FATA violations have no legal effect on the admis
of an investment” as explained in more detail in the Claimant’s arguments regarding the Non-

Admission of Investment Objection.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENT HAS BEEN ADMITTED UNDER AUSTRALIAN LAW
AND INVESTMENT POLICIES

The Parties differ in respect of the admission of PM Asia’s investment in Australia pursuant to
Australian law and investment policies. The Claimant submits that the admission requirement
under Article 1(e) of the Treaty is satisfied, whereas the Respondent is of the view that the
Claimant’s investment—its acquisition of shares in PM Australia—has not been admitted
because the PMI Group’s application to the Australian Government in January 2011 was false
or misleading.**” Accordingly, the Respondent contends that PM Asia’s investment enjoys no

protection under the Treaty.***

1. Meaning of “admitted by the other Contracting Party subject to its law and
investment policies”

Article 1(e) of the Treaty provides, in relevant part, as follows:

“investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one

 

Contracting Party and admitted by the other _C Party subject to_its law and
investment_policies applicable from time to time, and in particular, though not
exclusively...

The Respondent's Position

246.

247.

248.

249.

The Respondent submits that Article 1(e) of the Treaty preserves the customary international
law position that a State has a sovereign right to determine the terms on which it admits foreign
investment. Therefore, the issue of whether a Hong Kong investment is admitted in Australia is

ultimately a matter for Australian law and investment policy.**”

The Respondent argues that Article 1(e) of the Treaty effects a renvoi to Australian law “for an
assessment of the existence and consequences of the alleged contraventions of local law”. It
disagrees with the Claimant that these consequences should additionally be assessed by
reference to international law. Relying on the Tribunal’s finding in Fraport v. Philippines, and
on the interpretation of Article 1(e) in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, the Respondent
explains that whether the Claimant’s investment is admitted under the Treaty is a question of
Australian law and investment policies, and if the putative investment is not admitted, the

360

consequence, as a matter of international law, is that the Treaty does not protect it.°°’ Every

technical breach of Australian law, therefore, will invalidate the admission of the investment.**!

Further, the Respondent emphasises that Article 1(e) of the Treaty makes admission subject to
both the “law” of the host State and its “investment policies”. The Respondent explains that
Article 1(e) is not limited to some form of illegality or legal invalidity as a matter of Australian
law. Otherwise, the words “investment policies” would be redundant. Article 1(e) of the Treaty,
according to the Respondent, requires the admission to be free from material non-compliance

with those policies.

Finally, the Respondent submits that Article 1(e) of the Treaty is concerned with establishing
access to the protection of the Treaty and Article 10 of the Treaty confers jurisdiction on the
Tribunal and mandates it to decide the relevant issues of Australian law and _ policy.
Accordingly, in the Respondent’s view, it is for the domestic decision-maker to decide on
admission for the purposes of Australian law and it is for a “BIT tribunal” alone to decide on

admission issues falling under the Treaty.**

Statement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 13. See also Claimant’s Amended Statement of Claim, para. 275,
where PM Asia accepts that the investment must be “legal” under the host State law at the time it is made
(Article 1(e) of the Treaty however requires compliance with both law and investment policy).

The Claimant’s Position

250.

251.

The Claimant contends that the proper standard against which the admission of its investment in
the host State must be determined is international law. The Claimant adds that domestic law of
the host State also “feeds into the inquiry but does not control it’. This determination, the
Claimant submits, must be made independently of the parties’ choice of law applicable to the
merits of the dispute.*® Relying on the decision in Fraport v. Philippines, the Claimant
construes Article 1(e) of the Treaty such that it effects a renvoi to local law “for an assessment
of the existence and consequences of the alleged contraventions of local law, with those
consequences then having to be assessed by reference to international law”.*°

The Claimant, accordingly, argues that the Respondent’s objection to the admission of the
Claimant’s investment must be analyzed from a public international law perspective. While
Australian law should be taken into account, the Claimant notes that a technical violation of
domestic law will not suffice to exclude an investment from the scope of the Treaty’s
protection.” Relying on decisions of the tribunals in Quiborax v. Bolivia and Teinver v.
Argentine Republic, the Claimant submits that it falls to the Respondent to prove that the

Treaty’s requirement has not been met.**

The Respondent explains that section 26 of the FATA requires prospective investors to furnish a
notice to the Treasurer for certain types of transactions provided it complies with the prescribed
form as set out in the FATA Regulations. The form requires basic details about the person
acquiring shares, the Australian company and information about the shares being acquired.3”

The Respondent adds that the required content of the notice is stipulated in its foreign
investment policies. In particular, Australia’s Foreign Investment Policy, which provides policy
guidance on the application of the national interest test, and the “How-to-Apply”’—Business
Proposals guide (“How-to-Apply Guide”), should be complied with. The How-to-Apply Guide
particularly states that “in addition to the relevant statutory notice”, applications for acquisitions
of shares “must include” information on “parties to the proposal, the type of proposal, the
consideration, the reasons for the proposal... from viewpoints of the vendor, target and

purchaser, and a brief description of the purchaser’s future intentions for the business. ..”.37!

investor to make a self-serving judgment that information it does not want to bring to the
attention of the Government can be omitted.>”” While rejecting the distinction made by the
Claimant as to the terminology of whether the regime is standard-based or disclosure-based,
the Respondent clarifies that the How-to-Apply Guide requires provision of information

information” >”

The Respondent states that, pursuant to the FATA and an “Instrument of Authorization” made
by the Treasurer (authorising Treasury officials holding identified positions to approve PM
Asia’s investment)?” the Treasurer can make an order prohibiting an investment if he is
satisfied that the proposed investment would be contrary to Australia’s national interest.7%> In
order for such an assessment to be made, the Claimant was in effect required to provide a

statutory notice and supplementary information stating, inter alia, the reasons for the acquisition

and how the investment could impact Australia’s national interest.7”° The Respondent notes that

it is a criminal offence for foreign investors to mislead the Treasurer.”

In Respondent’s view, the fact that the Foreign Investment Policy and the How-to-Apply Guide
are not mandated under FATA does not mean that those policies lack legal status or that non-
compliance with those policies bear no consequences. The investment policies, as Mr. Callinan
pointed out, impose mandatory non-legislative requirements and are vital in considering
whether the Foreign Investment Application was misleading.*” Accordingly, the Respondent
submits that misleading information can invalidate the notice even if it was not required by the

legislation.”

The Respondent submits that the Foreign Investment Application contained false or misleading
information because the Claimant failed to meet the requirements of the FATA.**? According to
the Respondent, “false” must not be equated with “intentionally untrue”. Relying on Australian
jurisprudence, the Respondent explains that “misleading conduct” may be established when
objectively conduct as a whole has a tendency to lead a person into error. For example, it may
occur when a person tells a half-truth, even if its general conduct may be honest and reasonable;
or when a person remains silent with respect to material information; or when the expression of
an opinion carries with it a representation that the opinion is held on reasonable grounds and

there are no such reasonable grounds.**!

Taking into account Mr. Gyles’ first report, the Respondent clarifies that under Australian law, a
representation or non-disclosure of information may be misleading even though the recipient
(here, a junior agent of the Treasurer) might have been able to find out the truth by making

further enquiries.**

389

The Claimant agrees with the Respondent that the required content of the Foreign Investment
Application is provided in the FATA and its corresponding regulations. However, the Claimant
submits that the required content of the Foreign Investment Application rests on only “basic,
objective facts about the identity of the purchaser, the target and the transaction” and that its
form is equally basic and objective. This does not prevent the Treasurer from obliging the
investor to furnish further information, but the Respondent did not exercise such power.** As
for the content of the “notice”, the Claimant notes that section 26(2) of the FATA requests
investors to provide a statement of the investor’s “intention to enter into [the] agreement” by

virtue of which the investor would acquire a substantial interest in an Australian corporation.**°

Moreover, the Claimant asserts that the guidance provided in the Foreign Investment
Application is “brief, high-level and generalized”,**’ and since the Foreign Investment Policy
has no statutory effect, the “supplementary information” requirement is not mandatory. In
addition, the Claimant notes that the statement in the Foreign Investment Policy is legally
inaccurate because, first, the FATA does not require “applications” to be made, it merely
requires that notice be given to the Treasurer, and, second, the proposals need not be detailed;
an investor is only required to provide basic information.***

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s argument that the How-to-Apply Guide is a mandatory
and clear document. In the Claimant’s view, the How-to-Apply Guide inaccurately describes the
FATA; it uses vague and high-level language, the meaning of its terms is ambiguous, it has no

legal effect and it is not binding under Australian law.**° Accordingly, the Claimant submits that

the fact that information contained in a foreign investment application does not conform to the
How-to-Apply Guide does not make the information provided by an applicant false or
misleading. *°

The Claimant also submits that the regime established by the FATA and Australia’s foreign
investment policies is a statement-based regime and not a disclosure regime. Pointing to alleged
contradictions in the Respondent’s position as expressed at the Hearing on Preliminary
Objections, the Claimant argues that, in these circumstances, an investor that is trying to
reasonably interpret what information the Respondent is seeking by its policy cannot be
criticised.’

Further, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has changed its argument in relation to the
“false or misleading” standard imposed by section 136.1 of the Criminal Code in the course of
the proceedings and now states that, “no allegation is made of a contravention of that section”.
The Claimant, therefore, argues that the Respondent has invoked different standards including
“misleading or deceptive”, “truthful and complete”, and “accurate and complete”, leaving it
unclear which of these standards the Claimant allegedly contravened.*”?

The FATA and the Regulations mandate four conditions that the Claimant submits it has met.
First, the Claimant argues that it openly disclosed that the acquirer would be a multinational
tobacco company incorporated in Hong Kong and that it might avail itself of the Treaty in the

its activities are perfectly legal in Australia and that PM Australia and PML’s business in the

Claimant argues that its investments were made openly and it had duly notified the Respondent
of its intention to acquire shares of PM Australia,*° with proper notice given to Australia’s
Foreign Investment Review Board, the government body responsible for the Respondent’s
investment treaties.**° The Claimant directs the Tribunal to Mr. Hinton’s expert report, in which

Mr. Hinton notes that a proposal made by a foreign investor from a country that has signed a

The Respondent submits that there were several points that the Claimant failed to state
accurately in the Foreign Investment Application. As a result, the Foreign Investment
Application did not accurately reflect the prospect that the restructuring might enable the

Claimant to make claims under the Treaty.

First, the Claimant did not disclose that it intended to bring a claim against Australia under the
Treaty if the Australian Government implemented the Plain Packaging Measures—a
circumstance that the Respondent terms the “BIT intention”.*” Rather, the Claimant stated only
that PM Asia “does not intend any change in the direction of the business” of the Australian
subsidiaries.”

Second, it was not stated that the true purpose of the Claimant’s investment was to “place the
PMI Group in a position where, assuming that Australia proceeded to enact the legislation
implementing plain packaging, a member of the group, PM Asia, would be able to bring a claim
under the Treaty seeking orders requiring Australia to repeal [P]lain [P]ackaging [Measures]
and/or pay substantial damages”.°' Rather, the Claimant stated that the purpose of the
restructuring was “to refine PMI affiliates’ corporate structure in the Asian region”. The
witness statements relied upon by the Respondent evidence that the PMI Group was aware of

the political risk it was facing in light of the Plain Packaging Measures and thus took account of

the available Treaty protection for its Australian investments during its restructuring? This

circumstance is termed the “BIT reason”.

Third, the Claimant did not reveal that a reason for, or a purpose of, the investment was to allow
for “nationality planning” and that the BIT intention and BIT reason would be directly relevant
to assessing whether the investment was contrary to Australia’s national interest because, if the
claim were successful, it “could affect Australia’s capacity to carry out its announced public
policy and/or affect its economy and community”. Rather, the Claimant stated that “[f]rom a
national interest perspective, we note that the [rJestructur[ing] does not result in any change in
ultimate control” of the Australian subsidiaries, and that “our client is not aware of any reason
why the [rJestructur[ing] would be contrary to the national interest... principally because the
[rJestructur[ing] is an internal restructur[ing]”.“°> This circumstance is termed the “BIT impact

on national interest”.

As a result of the failure to disclose the Claimant’s BIT intention, BIT reason and BIT impact
on Australia’s national interest, the Foreign Investment Application was false or misleading as
to PM Asia’s intentions and reasons.*°

The Respondent also points out that the FIRB letter stipulated that the restructuring would not
result in any change in ultimate control of PM Australia or PML, implying that the proposed

or “ r ization” that does not raise

was a “

national interest issues.”

The Respondent further submits that the two Treasury officials who processed the Foreign
Investment Application conducted an initial examination to identify issues bearing upon
Australia’s national interest. The FIRB annual reports stated that such applications were usually
decided by way of a “no-objection letter” issued by Treasury officials under a limited authority

and without any personal consideration by the Treasurer—a process well known to Australian

foreign investment professionals regularly acting for prospective investors on FATA

applications.48

In the event that the application raised “special circumstances” or “uncertainty” as to the
national interest test at the stage of the initial screening or triage, the matter would have been
elevated for determination by the Treasurer’s himself (on the advice of FIRB). In such a case,
the Treasurer would have prohibited the investment, or approved it subject to conditions that
would have prevented the Claimant from bringing a claim under the Treaty in respect of Plain
Packaging Measures. The fact that the application was not elevated implies that the
Respondent was unaware of the misleading statements and could not have inferred their
existence. In addition, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that Australia should
have known for itself or that such information was public knowledge because it only came to
know about the Claimant’s BIT intention and BIT reason when Mr. Pellegrini admitted them in
evidence with the Amended Statement of Claim.”

The Respondent rebuts the Claimant’s assertion that the two Treasury officials who processed
the Foreign Investment Application were actually aware of the BIT intention and BIT reason
and submits that the Respondent only became aware of such information in late March 2013.4"
The Respondent adds that neither of the two Treasury officials who considered the Foreign
Investment Application is available to give evidence. However, the Respondent argues that the
minutes prepared by the two Treasury officials evidence that PM Asia’s reason for the proposed
investment was “to simplify the administrative structure of the Asia Pacific region of Philip
Morris” and that the proposal “did not appear to raise any issues which could be considered as
contrary to the national interest’.“"? The Treasury officials were entitled to assume that the
Foreign Investment Application complied with Australia’s detailed and longstanding disclosure
requirements because the application was prepared by experienced foreign investment lawyers,
who presented the transaction as a “simple, straightforward corporate restructuring that did not

raise national interest issues”.4"

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s argument that it did not need to reveal the BIT reason
because the ability to bring a claim against Australia under the Treaty in respect of the
announced Plain Packaging Measures was a mere “motivation” and not a “reason” for the
restructuring. In response, the Respondent argues that “motivations” for a restructuring should
not be treated differently from “reasons” since the two are indistinguishable. The Respondent
explains that the Claimant put forward as its “reasons” the refining of its corporate structure but
its “motivation” was to put it in a position to make a claim against Australia so as to defeat or
neutralise plain packaging legislation once adopted by Parliament. The Respondent submits
that, if this were the consequence of the Claimant’s argument, then the Tribunal would be
compelled to consider whether this was “a case of sharp practice”. The Respondent infers that
the Claimant held back the “reason” or “motivation” because, if revealed, it would risk the
defeat of its strategy under the Treaty.*!

The Respondent also denies that it was unreasonable to expect the Claimant to reveal its “BIT
strategy”. The Respondent submits that any reasonable person would find it relevant to the
national interest if a proposed investment exposes a country to a claim or seeks to defeat a
legislative measure. The Respondent further submits that the Claimant cannot ask the Tribunal
to find that its answers in the Foreign Investment Application were truthful when it declines to
produce those persons who made the underlying decisions. The Respondent infers that the
person(s) authorising the Foreign Investment Application either “did not care to turn their mind
to the truth of the statements therein”, or quite deliberately misled the Treasury officials into

approving the Foreign Investment Application under their authorisation.*!5

With regard to the Claimant’s assertion that exposing Australia to a BIT claim cannot be
considered to be contrary to the national interest, the Respondent submits that this contention
fails to take account of the crucial role that admission plays under the Treaty. The Respondent
adds that it may, lawfully, adopt the policies on admission that best suit its national interest. In
the Respondent’s view, it is not obliged to give an investor that opposes a measure that the
Australian Government has decided to implement a new basis upon which to bring a claim
against it. Non-admission in these circumstances is not illegitimately “thwarting litigation”, but
simply declining to assume a fresh obligation that will lead to an identifiable suit in the

future.‘!°

Finally, the Respondent argues that the evidence of Mr. Hinton should be rejected. Being a
senior officer at FIRB many years before the events in question, he never worked with former
Treasurer Swan and cannot therefore second-guess what the latter would have done regarding
the proposal. Moreover, since he is not an Australian lawyer and cannot give an expert opinion
on the application of Australian law to the Foreign Investment Application.*"’ Instead, the

Respondent adduces the testimony of Mr. Wilson, an actual member of the FIRB.

In short, the Respondent points out that (1) BIT issues were not routinely considered as part of
the initial examination of proposed investments under the FATA; (2) the existence of a treaty
was not considered a factor in favour of the proposed investment against the national interest;
(3) Treasury statements contained no BIT issues; (4) although there is a unit within FITPD
advising the Treasurer on general investment and trade-related policy matters, it is separate from
the two review units that carry out the initial examination of foreign investment applications
under FATA and therefore, Mr. Hinton’s claim that FITPD has knowledge of the Treaty is true
but insignificant; and (5) Treasury officials who carry out initial examinations of proposed
investments cannot make their own investigations and must rely on accurate information from

prospective investors.*"*

The Claimant’s Position

281.

The Claimant argues that in order to assess whether its statements were misleading in respect of
the prospect of a BIT claim against Australia, one must have regard to the context in which the
statements were made.*!” In the instant case, the relevant context includes the long-standing and
highly-publicised differences between Philip Morris and the Australian Government in relation
to plain packaging; Philip Morris’ public statement that it would defend its right to use its
intellectual property if the plain packaging legislation were to be enacted; a statement from
Australia’s Minister for Health to the effect that the Respondent would assess the enactment of
the plain packaging legislation in light of the Respondent’s domestic and international
obligations; and the fact that the Treasurer is responsible for both notifications of investments

under the FATA and for giving advice on investment agreements.*”°

The Claimant also submits that its statement could not be misleading because the Treasurer had
full cognisance of the relevant facts, including the existence of the Treaty and the nationality of
the acquirer.*?! Importantly, in the Claimant’s view, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate
that the Claimant’s statement have led the Treasurer to make a decision he would not otherwise
have made.*”?

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that it was not aware of the BIT reason at the
time the Foreign Investment Application was submitted. The Claimant observes that at the
Hearing on Preliminary Objections, the Respondent admitted the Treasury’s knowledge that the
Claimant’s ownership of the Australian subsidiaries would give the Claimant “the right to

access dispute resolution provisions under the BIT”.47

Relying on the testimony of Mr. Pellegrini, the Claimant argues that the Respondent was aware
of PMI’s plans to oppose plain packaging, and establishes that it did not make a decision to
pursue a claim under the Treaty until June 2011.4 The Claimant adds that the Respondent must
indeed have been unaware of the BIT intention because there was no such intention. The
Claimant admits that it was well aware of the possibility of a claim in the future if a contingent
event would occur over which the Claimant would have no control, but the Respondent at no
point in time requested the Claimant to disclose contingent possibilities. The Claimant therefore

concludes that the Foreign Investment Application is valid.47°

The Claimant also considers that it accurately stated its “reasons for the proposal” and that these
were in line with Philip Morris’ own internal view, that is, to “refine” or “streamline” the
corporate structure of the group in the Asian region.*?’ The Claimant notes that the reasons
stated in its Foreign Investment Application were in line with the contents and level of detail of

notifications under FATA generally received by the FITPD.** The Treasury approved its

Foreign Investment Application without suggesting that the reasons were somehow inadequate

or too general and without requesting further information from the Claimant.’

 

In line with the ing in the Autor Ci ionada de Venezuela v. \ la decision,
the Claimant submits that its Foreign Investment Application clearly and accurately stated that
Claimant was a tobacco company incorporated in Hong Kong, thus providing the Respondent
with all the information required to assess the jurisdictional consequences of the contemplated
share transfer. The Claimant also relies on the Callinan Report to argue that the Respondent’s
failure to take into account facts that it knew when assessing the Foreign Investment
Application does not and cannot make the notification misleading.*”

The Claimant submits that, contrary to the Respondent’s contention, it was not required to
identify all the motives for its corporate restructuring and that the reason for the proposal should
instead focus solely on the transaction.**! The Claimant refers to a Ministerial statement made in
the context of the conclusion of the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement 2004 in
which Australia’s Minister for Trade publicly declared that internal corporate reorganisation
gives rise to no concerns under foreign investment policy and that minimising their screening

would be desirable."

Relying on a letter from Fs the Claimant notes that Australia’s Treasury does not
view intra-group restructuring as contrary to national interest as long as there is no change in the
ultimate holding company. Hence, the Respondent has not shown that the Claimant’s
restructuring raised the kind of serious concerns that have led the Treasurer to prohibit foreign
investments in the past.‘ The Claimant also refers to the Hinton Report to confirm
; position and further notes that the onus was on the Respondent to request

additional information, which it did not, on the corporate restructuring.

Relying on findings in the Hinton Report, the Claimant states that it was not incumbent upon the

Claimant to make mention in its notification to the Treasury that it might engage provisions of

the Treaty in the future.*** This, according to the Claimant, is not relevant to the Treasury’s
assessment of the national interest and was accordingly not something that needed to be

included in the Foreign Investment Application.4%°

In fact, the Respondent could not have lawfully prohibited the Claimant’s investments with a
view to barring the BIT claim. Such conduct would raise serious policy and legal issues and
would constitute an abuse of statutory power.**’ The Claimant also points to the fact that there
has been no divestment of Claimant’s investments—an indication that there were no grounds for

prohibiting the investment at the time or at present.***

Additionally, the Claimant affirms that it truthfully and genuinely stated its view in respect of
Australia’s national interest.” The Claimant submits that it is “nonsensical” on the part of the
Respondent to suggest that the Claimant was required to guess the reason why the investment

might or might not be considered to be contrary to national interest.”

The Claimant also observes that there is no objective definition of national interest. The
Claimant notes that Australia purposefully left the meaning of the phrase nebulous such that it
might consider investments on a case-by-case basis.“"! Furthermore, the Claimant submits that
the Respondent’s test for national interest is an imprecise and unpredictable one. To that effect,
the Claimant refers to a paper produced by the Financial Services Institute of Australasia which
states that “approaches taken to the national interest test by successive Australian governments
reveal that the concept has been stretched into a laundry list of unlegislated policy
considerations [which] are often poorly defined [and] far removed from genuinely vital national

interests”?

The Claimant invites the Tribunal to take into account Article 4 of the Treaty (“Transparency of

Laws”) in order to assess the extent to which the Respondent may seek to evade its obligations

by referring to the Claimant’s alleged incorrect statements by applying the said vague national
interest test. The Claimant notes that Article 4 stipulates that the Respondent shall make laws

443

and policies relating to investments that are publicly and readily available.’ Accordingly, the

Claimant states that the legal validity of the admission of its investment cannot hinge on an

accurate guess of what the Respondent’s Treasurer might deem to be in the national interest.“

The Claimant argues that the “extraordinary” character of the Respondent’s Non-Admission of
Investment Objection is revealed when the Respondent argues that its national interest will be

affected in the event that the Claimant succeeds with its treaty claim.“

Finally, the Claimant points to correspondence between different departments of Australia that
followed the Claimant’s Notice of Claim. In response to enquiries by the Attorney-General’s
Department, the FITPD confirmed in September 2011 that no objections had been raised against
the Claimant’s Foreign Investment Application. Similarly, shortly before the first procedural
meeting in the present arbitration in July 2012, the FITPD expressed no different view in this
regard. The Claimant argues that this correspondence rebuts the Respondent’s contention that it

was misled by the Foreign Investment Application.“

The Respondent argues that the Foreign Investment Application was also without legal effect
for the purposes of sections 26 and 27 of the FATA because the Claimant ultimately

implemented a different transaction than that described in the Foreign Investment Application.

The Respondent points out that the Claimant stated in the FIRB letter that PM Brands Sarl
would contribute all of the issued and outstanding shares of PM Australia held by it to PM Asia
“for no consideration”.“” The Respondent contends that this was not the proposal that the
Claimant actually put into effect by PM Asia’s Resolutions of 23 February 2011. Philip Morris

Group internal e-mails disclosed to Australia on 1 November 2014 show that, on 17 February

2011 (six days after FITPD had issued the No-objection Letter), the PMI Group considered that
adverse tax consequences could be avoided if the shares were transferred for value.“* However,
the Claimant did not submit a fresh application or otherwise inform FIRB or FITPD of the
alteration even though it knew that a statement made by it, on which Australia acted, was
false.49

The Respondent submits that the consideration to be paid to acquire an interest in an Australian
corporation forms part of the assessment of an investment proposal under the FATA.*” The
Claimant’s failure to update the Foreign Investment Application with this change in
consideration was a “material change in terms of the transaction [that] had an obvious statutory

consequence”, which was that, for purposes of FATA, “no notice had been given at all”.4!

In relation to the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant failed to disclose that a consideration

The Claimant explains that, on 23 February 2011, the Claimant’s Australian counsel discussed
the change in consideration paid for the Claimant’s proposed acquisition with |

and the author of the No-objection Letter. The Claimant relies on an e-mail by counsel to show
that the Respondent exaggerates and distorts information provided in the Foreign Investment
Application.4°

“Treasury and the FIRB did not take consideration into account when assessing notifications of

corporate restructuring”.**4

(d) Completeness of the Foreign Investment Application

The Respondent's Position

302.

303.

The Respondent submits that the statutory notices under section 26 of the FATA were
ineffective because the Claimant failed to annex to the notices “all” documents “relating to or
evidencing” the agreement to restructuring, as was required under the FATA Regulations.
This would have included PMI’s internal memorandum dated 2 September 2010, which the

Claimant alleges, “documented the agreement to engage in the restructur[ing]”.*°°

In particular, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s restrictive interpretation of “relating to or
evidencing the agreement... to which the notice relates” to mean “directly evidencing or
relating to the acquisition itself” so that only legally binding contractual documents need to be
annexed. The Respondent argues that neither were such documents submitted by the Claimant

nor does Mr. Callinan’s evidence support such an interpretation.**”

The Claimant’s Position

304.

The Claimant also submits that the Respondent’s argument that the Foreign Investment
Application was invalid because it failed to attach the PMI memorandum of 2 September 2010
is wrong. In response, the Claimant submits that Regulation 6 of the FATA Regulations requires
prospective investors to annex documents relating or evidencing the investment “agreement”
and that this requirement can only be read as a reference to documents directly evidencing or
relating to the share acquisition in respect of which a notice was given. It cannot, the Claimant
submits, be read as the Respondent does, as a reference to all prior documents evidencing the

decision to proceed with a restructuring.***

3. Domestic Law Consequences of the Alleged Violations of the FATA

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s non-compliance with Australia’s law and investment

policies has the following legal consequences under its domestic law:**”

— The statutory notices provided by the Claimant are invalid pursuant to sections 26
and 27 of the FATA because it contained false or misleading information and failed

to annex documents required by the FATA Regulations.‘

— The Treasurer’s No-objection Letter dated 11 February 2011, in which the Treasury
signaled that it did not object to PMI Group’s application, was affected by
“jurisdictional error”,**! or procured in “bad faith” if PM Asia knew that the Foreign
Investment Application contained false or misleading information; it is thus regarded

in law as “no decision at all” and as having no legal effect.“

— The Treasurer’s delegate was not in a position to consider the investment and its
impact on Australia’s national interest since the PMI Group’s Foreign Investment
Application (comprising of the statutory notices and the supplementary information
required under Australia’s law and investment policies) did not reflect the transaction
that was actually implemented and was incomplete.“

The Respondent submits that any one of these consequences is sufficient for its Non-Admission

of Investment Objection to succeed. Each of these alleged consequences will be discussed in the

following paragraphs.

The Claimant on the other hand submits that, even if the Tribunal found that it breached
Australian law, as alleged by the Respondent, this would have no legal consequence on the

admission of the investments as a matter of Australian law.

The Respondent's Position

466

461

4n

The Respondent submits that the Foreign Investment Application is legally invalid and the No-
objection Letter in response to such an application is void.** In addition, the Respondent rejects
the Claimant’s submission that, even if Australian law was breached, the investment remains
“admitted” pursuant to section 38 of the FATA.*® Section 38 of the FATA provides that “[a]n
act is not invalidated by the fact that it constitutes an offence against this Act”. The Respondent
relies on various Australian court decisions to argue that the term “act” in section 38 concerns
the “entry into the agreement” by which the investment is effected”.**’ The effect of section 38
of the FATA is to preserve contractual obligations between the parties to the transaction
implementing the investment.*** As such, when a foreign person commits a criminal offence
under sections 26 and 26A of the FATA by entering into a contractual agreement without
furnishing the required notice, that contractual agreement is not, for that reason, void or

unenforceable.“

In the present context, the Respondent explains that section 38 of the FATA
“preserves the validity of the acts of the parties that give effect to the transaction, not the legal
validity of any administrative decision” .“”° The Respondent adds that the Claimant cannot point
to a single Australian case that supports its interpretation of section 38 to the effect that it
preserves the legal validity of statutory notices under the FATA, or the administrative decisions

made in response to them.*”!

The Respondent further rejects the Claimant’s related submission that criminal law penalties
and divestiture are the exclusive remedies provided by the FATA with respect to false or
misleading applications. It submits that the Claimant’s submissions on this issue are contrary to

constitutional law, principles of statutory interpretation, and case law under the FATA.”

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

The Respondent challenges the Claimant’s argument that the statutory notices are effective
under sections 25 and 26 of the FATA and that the FIRB letter should be viewed as merely
“supplementary” and not as forming part of the notices. The Respondent asserts that statutory
notices and the FIRB letter constitute a single, compendious supply of all the information
required under Australia’s law and investment policies. Thus, the Foreign Investment

Application in its entirety constituted the “notice” required to be provided under the FATA.“

Relying on an Australian court decision, the Respondent submits that “if the notice... does
attempt an explanation of what is proposed it must be accurate and complete, either particularly
or generally”, and if “infected by inaccurate or incomplete information” so as to defeat the
“beneficial effect”, such a notice was not saved because it complied “with the express
requirements of the Act”.4”4

Applying these principles to the present case, the Respondent submits that the information in a
statutory notice given in purported compliance with sections 25 and 26 of the FATA is intended
to allow the Treasurer (informed by FIRB) to assess whether or not a proposal is “contrary to
national interest” and to allow the Respondent to scrutinise the investment.‘ The statutory
notices were provided under cover of an application letter that was materially false or
misleading. Having provided the FIRB letter, the Claimant did not ensure that it was “accurate
and complete” or, at least, it negated “the beneficial effect” of the statutory notices and “distort,
obscure or minimise” the information contained in them. By concealing the BIT intention, the
BIT reason and the BIT impact on the national interest, the letter gave the impression that the
Claimant’s proposal was “straightforward and raised no national interest issues”, leading to the

miscarriage of the assessment process.*”°

The Claimant’s Position

313.

416

In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent overlooks section 38 of the FATA, which expressly

states that the alleged violations do not invalidate the admission and lawfulness of the

 

investment. The Claimant relies on two Australian court decisions to argue that non-compliance

with the FATA does not render an investment illegal, void, or invalid under Australian law, and

even criminal offences committed in the course of admission of an investment do not invalidate

the investment.”

The Claimant argues that the FATA maintains the validity and lawfulness of the investment
unless and until a divestment is ordered. Prior to such an order, the Claimant submits that the
investor maintains all the rights, obligations, duties and liabilities of the investment.*” In the
present case, the Claimant points out that the Treasurer had the power to order divestment but
has chosen not to exercise that power. Accordingly, in the absence of an order to divest and in
accordance with section 38 of the FATA, the Claimant argues that its investments were at all
times lawful and properly admitted in Australia for the purposes of Article 1(e) of the Treaty.‘”
Furthermore, the Claimant argues that, even assuming that the information provided was false
or misleading, section 18(4) of the FATA distinguishes consequences for the investor from
those for the investment. Section 38 of the FATA makes it clear that there are no consequences
for the lawfulness or validity of the investment and of the admission thereof under Australian

law. A criminal charge, according to the Claimant, does not affect the investment.**°

The Claimant further submits that the offence under section 136.1 of the Criminal Code does
not apply to statements made in, or in connection with, a notice under section 26 of FATA.
Section 26 of the FATA provides inter alia “made in, or in connection with an application for”

and therefore, the Claimant points out, does not apply to a notice of a proposal to invest.**!

Applying this reasoning, the Claimant challenges the Respondent’s argument that, by reason of
the alleged provision of false or misleading information, no valid notice was given under section
26 of the FATA. The Claimant submits that the notice was made in accordance with the
prescribed form and further clarifies that the alleged false or misleading information was not
contained in the notice, but in the accompanying supplementary information. Even if that
supplementary information were misleading, the Claimant asserts, that would not infect the
validity of the notice itself.*? Hence, under any assumption, section 38 of FATA would still

preserve the validity of the investments.***

486

Further, the Respondent submits that the No-objection Letter is legally invalid because it was

tainted with “jurisdictional error”.“** The Respondent sees two such errors:

First, the Respondent submits that the Treasury officials who made the decision exceeded the
terms of their authority.4*° The No-objection Letter was issued by two Treasury officials
pursuant to a limited authorisation. The officials were induced by PM Asia’s false or misleading
Foreign Investment Application to take a decision that went beyond their competence.
According to the Respondent, the Foreign Investment Application involved “special
circumstances” and raised “uncertainty” as to the foreign investment policy. Had the Treasury
officials not been misled, the Claimant’s case would have been elevated to FIRB and the

Treasurer would have been competent to determine it.**°

Second, the Respondent, following the reasoning in Leung v. Minister for Immigration, submits
that the No-objection Letter is invalid because it was vitiated by the Claimant’s
misrepresentations. As a matter of Australian law, “even an innocent misrepresentation,
provided that it is sufficiently material, will vitiate an administrative decision”.“*” Moreover, the
Respondent rejects the Claimant’s contention that “an Australian court would not grant relief for
the jurisdictional error because Australia has challenged the validity of the No-objection Letter

collaterally in this proceeding rather than directly in domestic judicial review proceedings, and

   

because of Australia’s alleged delay, acquiescence and waiver”.*** In response, the Respondent
submits that, under Australian law, the validity of an administrative decision can be challenged

incidentally in the course of seeking other relief.”

The Claimant rebuts the Respondent’s argument that the No-objection Letter was “affected by
jurisdictional error, and [was] as a result... an invalid decision”.*” In response, it argues that the

decision-maker had the power to assess the national interest, and that is what was done.

Although the Respondent might now take the view that its organs made a mistake in assessing
the national interest, the Claimant submits that any such mistake would be an error within
jurisdiction, not a denial of jurisdiction. The Claimant states that there can be no jurisdictional
error only because the Respondent now wishes its Treasurer had made a different decision.*”!
According to the Claimant, an error must be more fundamental, in the sense that “the decision
maker makes a decision outside the limits of the functions and powers conferred on him or
her... By contrast, incorrectly deciding something which the decision maker is authorised to
decide is an error within jurisdiction”.

In relation to the Respondent’s assertion that the Treasury officials who reviewed the Foreign
Investment Application did not have authority to issue the No-objection Letter, the Claimant
submits that the officials acted as the Treasurer’s agent, his alter ego, and as such had the power
to bind the principal. Therefore, the Claimant submits that the transaction was within the agent’s

jurisdiction.

M4,

In any event, the Claimant relies on Leung,** which found that under Australian law, a

“decision infected by jurisdictional error may have continuing effect”.“°>

The Claimant also submits that even assuming that grounds existed to question the Treasurer’s
No-objection Letter on the basis of “jurisdictional error”, the party alleging that the decision is
invalid can apply to Court for an order of certiorari quashing the decision. The Claimant,
relying on the two Australian court decisions, therefore argues that, unless such an order is

sought by the Treasurer, the Tribunal can act on the faith of the decision.”

The Claimant submits that, were the Tribunal to establish a jurisdictional error, a court might
nonetheless refuse the Respondent a remedy, including a certiorari, due to “delay or
acquiescence or waiver”. The Claimant argues that the Respondent never sought to have the
Treasurer’s decision quashed before an Australian court and even if the Respondent wished to
do so, it would have been refused on grounds of waiver and delay. Therefore, the Claimant
points out that unless relief is granted by a court there is no obligation to treat the No-objection

Letter as legally ineffective.*”

Finally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s assertion that it can impugn the No-objection
Letter before the Tribunal as a collateral challenge. The Claimant explains that, because the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction to issue prerogative writs under Australian law, it cannot, in a
confidential arbitration proceeding, decide on the validity of the No-objection Letter, as a matter

of Australian law.”*

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that its investment must be considered

investment.” The Treaty does not require the Parties to bring parallel domestic court
proceedings before making a claim or defence, nor would a decision of a domestic court bind

The Respondent further submits that it was unable to resort to court proceedings since it only
became aware of the basis for the Non-Admission of Investment Objection during these
proceedings—the FITPD and FIRB protected the confidentiality of the Claimant’s information
and did not disclose documents relating to the Foreign Investment Application until 19 August

In addition, the Respondent only discovered the Claimant's rationale for restructuring when that
rationale was exposed by the evidence filed on 28 March 2013. Therefore, the Respondent was
not “plainly on notice” of Claimant’s false or misleading application from June 2011 when it
was served the Notification of Claim. The Respondent also notes that it was under an
obligation to avoid aggravating the dispute, such that it could not bring parallel proceedings

against the Claimant.

Further, the Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot benefit from its false or misleading
conduct. Following the reasoning in the Thunderbird Award, the Respondent argues that an
investor who, by misleading information, prevents a State from an informed consideration of the
exercise of its powers at the correct time should not be heard later to say “because you admitted

me in fact, the legality of the admission can never be questioned”.*°

In line with the findings in Fraport v. Philippines, the Respondent submits that it was precluded
from initiating legal action against the Claimant once this arbitration had begun because of the
confidentiality regime adopted in the present proceedings.™ Further, the Respondent submits
that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction depends on PM Asia’s investment being “admitted” within the
meaning of Article 1(e) of the Treaty, and neither a divestiture order (which can only operate

505

prospectively as a matter of Australian law) nor a parallel criminal prosecution, nor a refusal

of PM Asia’s filings would per se lead to the dismissal of PM Asia’s claims.°°

authorisation of the transaction. However, the Treasurer took no such measures:*** the Foreign

Investment Application was considered by the Respondent without any additional request for
information and, in a legally binding letter dated 11 February 2011 from the FIRB,” the
Respondent officially notified the Claimant that it had no objection to the acquisition of
shares.*!°

Moreover, the Claimant contends that it has been and remains the “registered, overt, and legal
owner” of the assets the admission of which the Respondent asserts has been “nullified”*!! In

support of its contention, Claimant points out that PM Brands’ transfer of shares to Claimant in

February 2011 was and remains valid under Australian Ww i i
ee: and that the Claimant’s ownership of PM Australia is reflected in

all of PM Australia’s filings with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.>!”

The Claimant also observes that the Respondent, despite having admitted the investment and
having been on notice of the Claimant’s present treaty claim, at no time took any steps to annul

or reverse admission of the Claimant’s investments,*!?

such as by ordering divestment under its
FATA legislation. The Claimant argues that, notwithstanding the validity of the statutory notice
under section 26 of the FATA, the Treasurer at all times retained the power of divestment.**
According to the Claimant, the Treasurer has not exercised this power because he was not

sis

satisfied that the investment is contrary to national interest."!” The Claimant thus submits that

the Respondent’s conduct is inconsistent with its present stance on the admission of the
Claimant's investments, three years after the Claimant's notice of its treaty claim.*!
Similarly, the Claimant submits, the Respondent chose not to prosecute the Claimant for alleged

criminal offences relating to the Claimant’s investments before the Australian courts, which are

the proper forum for the adjudication of “criminal guilt”.*!”

In particular, the Claimant notes that
the Respondent’s privilege log shows that it considered taking legal action against the Foreign
Investment Application as early as September 2011 but chose not to do so—in the Claimant’s

view because the Respondent had no basis for taking action under domestic law.>'*

In relation to the Respondent’s attempt to rely on the confidentiality regime applicable in the
present proceedings, the Claimant submits that this argument is misconceived because the
information relevant to the admission of the Claimant’s investments was at all material times in
the possession of the Respondent.*"” In addition, the Claimant notes that the Respondent has
neither made an application to the Tribunal to vary the confidentiality regime nor suggested that
the present confidentiality regime inhibited it from taking domestic legal action.*”°

Therefore, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s failure to prohibit the Claimant’s
investments or to exercise its power of divestment reflects the Respondent’s continuous
admission of the Claimant’s investments and, correspondingly, affords the Claimant the benefits

521

and protection conferred by the Treaty.

4, International Law Consequences of the Alleged Violations of the FATA

In addition to addressing the Respondent’s arguments under Australian law, the Claimant relies
on international law to demonstrate that any violation of Australian law that may have occurred
in the context of the admission of the Claimant’s investment has no legal consequences under
the Treaty. The Respondent responds to these arguments in the alternative, in the event that the
Tribunal finds that the concept of “non-admission” under Article 1(e) of the Treaty requires the

Tribunal to consider international law, in addition to the laws of Australia.

(a) Whether the Respondent “Tolerated” the Claimant’s Violations of Australian
Law

The Respondent's Position

341.

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that it is somehow precluded from invoking
the invalidity of the Foreign Investment Application or the No-objection Letter because it did
not take action against the Claimant in domestic proceedings. In Fraport v. Philippines, the
Tribunal ruled that the Philippines was not estopped from raising the claimant’s violations of
Philippine law in the arbitral proceedings on the basis that the Philippines had “knowingly
overlooked” these violations because the violations were “covert”. By contrast, in the present
arbitration, the Respondent argues that it did not “tolerate” the Claimant’s violations of
Australian law because the Respondent became aware of deficiencies in the Foreign Investment

Application and the true reasons of the restructuring only during the present proceedings.*

The Claimant’s Position

342. Referring to academic commentary, the Claimant argues that, “a host State which has for some

time tolerated a legal situation is thereafter precluded from insisting later, against the investor,

53 Therefore, the Claimant asserts that,

that the situation was unlawful from the beginning’
where the host State has failed to take any action against a known alleged illegality, tribunals
have dismissed objections based on the said alleged illegality.°* Similarly, following the
reasoning in Joannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia, a host State cannot seek to undermine the
prima facie valid and binding acts of its own authorities which are “cloaked with the mantle of
governmental authority” on the basis that they were or might be unauthorised or otherwise

525

invalid.

(b) The Impact of “Technical” Violations of A ian Law on the Admission of the
Investment

 

The Respondent's Position

343. The Respondent takes issue with the Claimant’s submission that any inconsistencies in the

522

523

524

525

context of the admission of the investment were “technical violations” of domestic law, and that

“minor infraction of host State law, such as missing information on an application” cannot lead
to a denial of investment protection. In the Respondent’s view, the Treaty simply provides
“subject to the law and investment policies” of the host State, without suggesting that only
violations of norms of a higher order are relevant. In any event, the Respondent suggests that
the Tribunal need not decide if there is an exception for “technical breaches” in the admission
requirements of the host State because there was nothing technical about the Claimant’s
violation.°”°

With regard to the pre-establishment provision under Article 2(1) of the Treaty, the Respondent
counters the Claimant’s argument that “shall admit” in Article 2(1) confers upon the host State a
mandatory obligation to admit the Claimant’s investment, and asserts that there is an express
qualification in the form of the phrase: “subject to its rights to exercise powers conferred by its
laws and investment policies”. Further, the Respondent argues that, if there were indeed an
obligation to admit investments, this would imply that the onus is all the more on the Claimant
not to give false or misleading information so that the exercise of these “all-important filtering

527

powers is not frustrated”!

The Claimant’s Position

345.

526

527

528

529

The Claimant argues that any breaches of Australian law that may have occurred merely amount
to “technical violations”, which are immaterial to an analysis conducted under public
international law.**§ To be relevant, a breach must be serious or concern a fundamental norm or
involve a contravention of the ordre public of the host State. *° Minor infractions of host State
law, such as missing information on an application, cannot in the Claimant’s view lead to a
denial of investment protection. Following the reasoning in several investor-State cases,
including Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine, Quiborax v. Bolivia and Plama v. Bulgaria, the Claimant
submits that minor errors by the investor or a failure to observe bureaucratic formalities are
irrelevant. According to the Claimant, tribunals refused to admit investments in accordance with
local law only when there was deliberate concealment amounting to a flagrant violation, fraud, a

chain of illegal acts, egregious and conscious, intentional and covert conduct.>*°

The Claimant further contends that there must be a direct causal link between the alleged
illegality and the admission of the investment. The Claimant submits that in the instant case
there can be no such link, as Australia’s own investment legislation expressly provides that
allegations of the kind argued by the Respondent have no effect on the validity of the
investments.**!

The Claimant submits that an assumption of the Respondent’s argument is that its “foreign
investment regime conferred upon the government an absolute and unfettered discretion to
admit or refuse investments by a Hong Kong company”. This, the Claimant notes, is apparent
from former Treasurer Swan’s statement that he “would have been more comfortable” blocking
Claimant’s investments than admitting them due to the “realities of Australian politics”*? In
other words, the Respondent’s position is that it may act in an entirely arbitrary manner in

deciding whether or not to admit investments from Hong Kong.**3

According to the Claimant, the Respondent cannot alter the scope of its international obligations
under the Treaty and state that Article 1(e) of the Treaty and the FATA regime gives it
unfettered discretion to admit or refuse investments at its convenience. This, in the Claimant’s
view, contradicts Article 2(1) of the Treaty, which provides pre-establishment obligations to the
Respondent.*™ The only limitation to this pre-establishment obligation is that the investments
shall be “admitted subject to [Respondent’s] laws and investment policies”. The Claimant,
relying on the travaux préparatoires of the Treaty as well as on arbitral jurisprudence, explains
that this requirement operates as a control mechanism to screen out illicit investments.**°
Therefore, the Claimant submits that it had a pre-establishment right to have its investment
admitted pursuant to Article 2(1) of the Treaty, subject to the Respondent’s laws and investment

policies (which did not give the Respondent’s Treasurer unfettered power to refuse admission

 

on the basis that he wished to insulate the Respondent from consequences of its unlawful
conduct).>*°

The Claimant submits that its investments have been expressly admitted under Australian law
and investment policies by way of the No-objection Letter, and no steps have been taken to

unravel that admission. The Claimant therefore requests the Tribunal to recognise and accept the

status quo under Australian law and investment policies and find that the investments have been
accordingly admitted within the meaning of Article 1(e) of the Treaty on the basis of the
Treasurer’s explicit and unchallenged No-objection Letter, without the need for further
enquiry.*” This, the Claimant asserts, is further reinforced by the principle that official acts of
the State “cloaked with the mantle of governmental authority” are prima facie valid and binding
on the State on the international plane and by the fact that Australia’s investment regime
provides that violations of the admission process have no impact on the validity of the

admission.**8

In light of all the foregoing, and applying the above principles to the facts of the present case,
the Claimant submits that Australia cannot rely on its own domestic law to defeat its
international obligations and therefore (1) Australia is bound by its express, official, and
continuing admission of the investments; (2) the Tribunal should not make determinations ex
post facto as to the Australian national interest, but rather accept the status quo and recognize
the binding nature of Australia’s express, official and continuing admission of the investments;
(3) any violations of Australian law are immaterial in circumstances where Australian law itself
expressly provides that such violations have no impact on the substantive validity of the
admission of the investments; and (4) Australia is precluded from relying on the alleged
violations in circumstances where it has been in possession of all the relevant information for at
least three years and has continuously and bindingly manifested its admission of the

investments.*”

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT’S CLAIM RELATES TO A PRE-EXISTING DISPUTE THAT FALLS
OUTSIDE THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION OR OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES AN ABUSE OF
RIGHT

The parties disagree as to whether the Claimant’s claim falls outside the scope of Article 10 of
the Treaty because it relates to a dispute which pre-dates the making of the investment (the
“Ratione Temporis Argument”) and/or whether the Claimant’s claim amounts to an abuse of
right because the Claimant restructured its investment to gain Treaty protection over a

pre-existing or reasonably foreseeable dispute (the “Abuse of Right Argument”).

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

1. The Ratione Temporis Argument

(a) The Application of Article 10 of the Treaty to Existing Disputes

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s claim falls outside the scope of Article 10 of the
Treaty because Australia has not consented to the submission of pre-existing disputes to an
arbitral tribunal established under this Treaty.*4° The Claimant, in turn, contends that the timing
of the dispute is irrelevant for the Tribunal’s temporal jurisdiction. According to the Claimant,
there are only two elements required for temporal jurisdiction: (1) a dispute concerning an
investment must have existed at the time that the Claimant initiated the arbitration, and (2) the
Treaty’s substantive protections apply to any conduct that occurred after these protections have

become applicable to that investment.**!

The Parties’ differing views on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction reflect their respective interpretations

of Article 10 of the Treaty, which provides in relevant part as follows:

A dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party
concerning an investment of the former in the territory of the latter which has not been
settled amicably, shall, after a period of three months from written notification of the claim,
be submitted to such procedures for settlement as may have been agreed between the
parties to the dispute. If no such procedures have been agreed within that three month
period, the parties to the dispute shall be bound to submit it to arbitration under the
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as then in
force.

The Respondent's Position

354.

355.

The Respondent interprets Article 10 as requiring a series of qualifications in order to establish
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction: “the existence of a ‘dispute’ concerning an ‘investment’ or ‘an
investor of one Contracting Party’ which is made ‘in the territory of another Contracting
Party’”.*? The Respondent considers that under Article 10, the “other Contracting Party” does
not consent to the “submission of claims to arbitration where the dispute that is invoked pre-
dates the making of the investment”. *

In the Respondent’s view, this interpretation of Article 10 of the Treaty derives from the

application of Article 31(1) of the VCLT.““ Accordingly, the ordinary meaning of the phrase

Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

“dispute... concerning an investment” in Article 10 suggests that “there must first be an
‘investment’ before there can be a ‘dispute’”.*° Put another way, the plain meaning of Article
10 is, according to the Respondent that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction does not extend to disputes
that pre-date the making of an investment. Similarly, the object and purpose of the Treaty as
stated in the preamble, including the creation of favourable conditions for greater investment
and the promotion of economic relations, do not support an interpretation of Article 10 as
allowing an international company first to engage in a pre-existing dispute involving a
subsidiary in one of the Contracting Parties, and then to arbitrate this dispute once ownership of

such subsidiary is transferred to a company incorporated in the other Contracting Party.*“

The Respondent considers Articles 6(1) and 2(1) of the Treaty as illustrative of the context of
the Treaty, which in turn informs the interpretation of Article 10.°” Article 6(1) concerning the
prohibition of expropriation provides that compensation for deprivation “shall amount to the
real value of the investment immediately before the deprivation or before the impending
deprivation became public knowledge whichever is the earlier”.*“* Phrased in this fashion, the
Respondent suggests, Article 6(1) clearly indicates that Article 10 does not permit the
arbitration of a dispute where the investment post-dates the alleged deprivation by many
months.™? Turning to Article 2(1), the Respondent argues that the Treaty does not envisage that
the host State is to be placed under a positive BIT obligation “to ‘encourage and create
favourable conditions’ for putative Hong Kong investors to make investments in Australia in

relation to pre-existing disputes”.

The Respondent also refers to case law to support its interpretation of Article 10 of the Treaty.
Relying on the tribunal’s finding in Amco v. Indonesia, the Respondent argues that pre-existing
disputes can only be submitted to arbitration if the parties to the Treaty are “considered as
having reasonably and legitimately envisaged” this result, which is not the case in the present

dispute.**! The Respondent also points to Lao Holdings v. Laos in which a company

restructuring was alleged to have taken place after the given dispute had occurred.**? The Lao

Holdings tribunal referred to Article 28 of the VCLT which provides that “[uJnless a different
intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in
relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date
of entry into force of the treaty with respect to that part”. The Lao Holdings tribunal
concluded that the silence of the treaty with respect to its temporal limit ought not to be
interpreted as contemplating that “investors could change their nationalities at will by artful
corporate restructurings to ‘forum shop’ after a legal dispute has arisen with the same investor
on the same issue and had therefore become... a discrete event in the course of relations
[between the Parties] that predated the Treaty”.*** In the Respondent’s view, the Lao Holdings
tribunal’s conclusion that the relevant treaty is not to be viewed “as intending to provide legal
weapons to investors for the purpose of re-engaging in a pre-existing legal dispute with the Lao

Government” should apply to the present case.*°°

The Respondent does not consider there to be “a presumption, let alone an absolute rule, that in
cases of doubt[,] jurisdiction in an international agreement embraces all disputes, including
those disputes that arose before a given treaty entered into force”.*°° What matters in any given
case is the interpretation of the specific wording of the treaty in light of “well established
principles reflected in Articles 28 and 31 of the VCLT”.**’ Turning to the specific cases relied
upon by the Claimant, the Respondent considers that Georgia v. Russia is not relevant to the
present dispute since the International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) was not addressing the question
of jurisdiction over disputes that pre-date a treaty’s coming into force, or a treaty’s application
more generally to pre-existing disputes.** The Respondent also distinguishes the decision of the
Permanent Court of International Justice (“PCIJ”) in Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions. In
that case, the PCIJ considered whether explicit limitations were required to limit the
jurisdictional scope of a treaty as otherwise applying to all disputes, including those that arise
out of events occurring before the conclusion of the treaty. In the Respondent’s view, the PCIJ

was concerned with a particular treaty whose essential characteristic was to establish rights in

relation to the period prior to its entry into force.*® Consequently, no general rule was

established. *°°

The Respondent further distinguishes the decisions in Vivendi v. Argentina (II) and Chevron v.
Ecuador (1), both relied on by the Claimant, on the basis that neither case considered the issue
of pre-existing disputes in an analogous factual context. The Vivendi I/ tribunal did not consider
the issue of pre-existing disputes at all, and the case is therefore irrelevant to the issue at
hand.**! Chevron v. Ecuador (I) concerned a long-standing investor that was already in dispute
with the State prior to the entry into force of a new BIT; by way of contrast, the present
dispute concerns “a pre-existing dispute, then a corporate restructuring, and then an attempt to

establish a pre-conceived BIT jurisdiction over the pre-existing dispute”.°*

The Respondent discounts the relevance of the International Law Commission’s (“ILC”) 1966
Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with Commentaries, cited by the Claimant to suggest that
the term “disputes”, without qualification, covers all disputes existing after entry into force of
the agreement. According to the Respondent, the Commentary clearly distinguishes between
treaties establishing dispute resolution fora whose jurisdiction extends to all disputes existing
after the entry into force of the agreement, and treaties containing a jurisdictional clause that is
attached to substantive treaty provisions and to which “the non-retroactivity principle may
operate to limit ratione temporis the application of the jurisdictional clause”.** In the
Respondent’s view, the Claimant mischaracterises the Australia-Hong Kong BIT as falling into

the former category, whereas in fact the second category is more apposite.*°

The Claimant’s Position

361.

According to the Claimant, it is not necessary to examine whether Article 10 extends the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to considering pre-existing disputes. First, in the Claimant’s view, both

Parties agree that the dispute existed when the Claimant initiated the arbitration on

21 November 2011, after the entry into force of the Treaty.*°° There is therefore no need to
consider any disagreement between the Parties before this date. Second, the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal ratione temporis is limited by the date on which the dispute ended, rather than the date
on which it commenced. Continuing disputes, insofar as they continue to exist at the time of a
Notice of Arbitration, are contemplated under Article 10.5 To this end, the Claimant refers to
the travaux préparatoires of the VCLT, which states that “an act or fact or situation which took
place or arose prior to the entry into force of a treaty continues to occur or exist after the treaty
has come into force, it will be caught by the provision of the treaty”.*°* Moreover, the travaux
préparatoires state that “[b]y using the word ‘disputes’ without any qualification, the parties are
to be understood as accepting jurisdiction with respect to all disputes existing after the entry into
force of the agreement”.

In the event that the Tribunal considers it necessary to determine whether Article 10 applies to
disputes that pre-date the entry into force of the Treaty, the Claimant contends that nothing in
Article 10 or other provisions of the Treaty excludes pre-existing disputes from the scope of
dispute settlement.°” According to the Claimant, “[a]bsent treaty language, there is no basis to
assert that the Treaty excludes any dispute that began (but did not end) before the entry into
force of the Treaty or before the making of the relevant investment”.*”! Consequently, the
current Treaty does not exclude pre-existing disputes, whether arising before the entry into force
of the Treaty or before a change in the investor’s nationality.*”? Furthermore, neither Article 2
nor Article 6 of the Treaty implies any limit on the temporal scope of Article 10. According to
the Claimant, Article 2 on the encouragement and creation of favorable conditions is a
substantive obligation unrelated to the temporal scope of Article 10. Article 6 concerning

expropriation might hypothetically be relevant to damages but not to jurisdiction.*”

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s reliance on the analysis of legal principles in Lao
Holdings v. Laos is misleading because, unlike in the present dispute, the relevant BIT in Lao

Holdings v. Laos imposed an explicit temporal limitation on the jurisdictional scope of the

treaty such that “any claim... which arose before [the BIT’s] entry into force” was excluded.*™
Similarly, the Claimant maintains that the relevant BIT in Lucchetti v. Peru expressly defined
the scope of disputes so as to exclude “differences or disputes that arose prior to its entry into
force”.*”>

According to the Claimant, the PCIJ in Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions established a
presumption that absent a specific provision to the contrary, a dispute settlement clause extends
to all qualifying disputes existing at the time the claimant invokes the clause, regardless of when
the dispute arose.°”° The Claimant dismisses the Respondent’s concern that the finding in
Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions “was limited to arbitration treaties”; according to the
Claimant, the Court gave no such indication and in any case the treaty was also concerned with
establishing recourse to arbitration.*” The Claimant cites academic commentators in support of
the proposition that the decision in Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions establishes that a
tribunal has jurisdiction over disputes that exist when the arbitration commences.*”* This
principle is, according to the Claimant, further supported by the findings of the ICJ in Georgia
v. Russia” In that case Georgia conceded that a dispute between the parties had existed prior
to the entry into force of the relevant treaty. The ICJ did not consider whether by virtue of this
‘pre-existing’ dispute, it lacked jurisdiction ratione temporis. Rather, the ICJ concluded that a

“dispute must in principle exist at the time the Application is submitted to the Court”.>*°

The findings in Chevron v. Ecuador (I), in the Claimant’s view, also confirm the broad
interpretation of the term “disputes”.**' In Chevron v. Ecuador (1), the tribunal found that in the
absence of a temporal limitation in the treaty’s dispute settlement provision, “the word
‘disputes’ must simply be given its ordinary meaning’- i.e. it must cover all existing
disputes”.**? Given that the existence of a dispute is an element of jurisdiction, the dispute must

exist on the date the arbitration commences; therefore, according to the Claimant, it does not

matter when the dispute began.*** The Claimant cites as further authority the observations of the
tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina (II) that “the determination of whether a party has standing in
an international judicial forum... is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings

are deemed to have been instituted”. >

Absent specific language to the contrary, the Claimant argues, an agreement that refers
“disputes” to arbitration covers any disputes that exist when the arbitration clause is invoked,
including those disputes that exist after the Treaty becomes applicable through a change in the
nationality of the investor. To support this position, the Claimant refers to the ILC’s 1966
Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with Commentaries, which the Claimant cites as stating
that “by using the word ‘disputes’ without any qualification, the parties [to a treaty] are to be
understood to be accepting jurisdiction with respect to all disputes existing after entry into force
of the agreement”.**°

Finally, the Claimant clarifies that it “is not seeking retroactive application of the Treaty” as
none of the alleged claims arose from “any actions that preceded the [Treaty’s] entry into

force” 587

The legal test for establishing whether a dispute has arisen is, according to the Respondent, “a
disagreement on a point of law or fact; a conflict of legal views or of interests between two
persons”.**8 This test has, in the Respondent’s view, been established by the PCI in
Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* and was subsequently affirmed by the ICJ in Georgia v.
Russia.” In Georgia v. Russia, the ICJ stated further that the existence of a dispute in a given

case is a matter for objective determination and that “[i]t must be shown that the claim of one

Murphy v. Ecuador, the tribunal noted that “[i]t is generally admitted that the mere presence of a
legal conflict of interests is sufficient to originate a difference of a dispute”.*”?

In light of the Mavrommatis test, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s contention that,
in order for there to be a dispute, the challenged measure must have passed into law.** In the
Respondent’s view, “[t]he threat to engage in conduct which, it is asserted, would breach an
international obligation, can ground a dispute”.*°° With respect to the case law cited by the
Claimant, the Respondent argues that the decisions in Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela and Lao
Holdings v. Laos do not “seek to establish a general rule” that a measure must become part of
the domestic law before a dispute can be deemed to arise.*° According to Mobil Corporation v.
Venezuela, the Respondent notes, “a decision by a government can indeed give rise to a dispute
before it passes into law”.*”’ The Respondent asserts the proposition established by the tribunal
in Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela that “an announced decision by a government to introduce a
measure by legislation, to be considered and enacted by a legislature, can found a dispute” if
that decision has been “sufficiently clearly opposed and protested by an investor”.*”* In the view
of the Respondent, the possibility that a government may withdraw the measure before the
legislature enacts it, or that the legislature might reject it, are alternative means by which the
dispute might be resolved, and not grounds to deny the existence of the dispute in the first
place.*” That the Lao Holdings tribunal did not find a dispute in that case can be explained by
the fact that the parties in Lao Holdings v. Laos, in contrast to the facts relevant to the present
dispute, “were still in discussions” after the restructuring and “the final position of the...
Government was not certain”, which led to the conclusion that “it could not be said that they

were in dispute”.°°°

the tribunal found that “[t]o instigate a dispute, therefore, refers to the time at which the
disagreement was formed, which can only occur once there has been at least some exchange of
views by the parties. [The instigation of a dispute] does not refer to the commission of the act
that caused the parties to disagree, for the very simple reason [that] a breach or violation does
not become a ‘dispute’ until the injured party identifies the breach or violation and objects to
it’."' This finding is, in the Respondent’s view, “entirely consistent with Australia’s
position”. As regards the Claimant’s reliance on the RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation case,
the Respondent asserts that the case is irrelevant because none of Russia’s jurisdictional
arguments raised “the same issue as in the current case” and RosInvestCo “was not even
arguably in dispute with Russia prior to the making of its investment”.* The Respondent
distinguishes RDC v. Guatemala on the ground that, unlike in the present dispute, “jurisdiction
under [the Treaty] is established by reference to the existence of ‘measures adopted or
maintained by a Party’”.* Moreover, given that “the government process leading to the
[measure in question] was largely an internal one”, “there was no opposition of views prior to
[its] publication”.“°’ The Respondent further criticises the Claimant’s interpretation of the
Gremcitel Award. According to the Respondent, “the facts of Gremcitel are materially
different” from the facts here because “the Peruvian Government had not previously made any
public announcement concerning its intentions” to adopt the measure in question.®® Moreover,
in determining the date when the dispute arose, the Respondent notes, “the Gremcitel tribunal

applied the Mavrommatis test”.

The Respondent dismisses the relevance of Rights of Passage Over Indian Territory on the
ground that the cited proposition in that case—that a dispute cannot “arise until all its
constituent elements ha[ve] come into existence”’—only concerned that particular dispute and
cannot serve as a general rule.®* According to the Respondent’s interpretation, this decision

“suggests that disagreement over the existence of Portugal’s claimed right of passage could

amount to a dispute in the absence of any allegation of a violation of an international

obligation”.

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant that the actions taken by both parties in the period
prior to the enactment of the plain packaging legislation were solely preparatory acts and
conduct that cannot give rise to a legal dispute. Firstly, the Respondent reiterates that the test in
Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions for the establishment of a dispute does not make a
distinction between disagreements over decisions to enact a law and the actual enactment of that
law.°"? Secondly, the Respondent disputes the relevance of the Claimant’s reliance on
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project on the basis that in that case the Parties were deemed to be in
dispute over the proposal by Czechoslovakia to commence damming works in its territory that
would have impacts downstream on Hungary’s territory. According to the Respondent, these
damming works could have been abandoned at a time when the ICJ deemed the parties to be in
dispute.°'! Finally, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s assertion that the present
dispute is necessarily contingent on the actual enactment of plain packaging legislation such that
anything prior to enactment must properly be considered “preparatory”. According to the
Respondent “the 2011 enactment of the plain packaging legislation cannot meaningfully be
divorced from the Australian Government’s decision of April 2010 to introduce that very

legislation”.°!?

While the Claimant refers to the ILC’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for
International Wrongful Acts—that a State does not breach its international obligations merely
because certain government actors threaten or make preparations for an act that might cause
such a violation if enacted—the Respondent asserts that this conflates the existence of a dispute
with findings of international responsibility. In this regard, the Respondent points to the
decision in Achmea v. the Slovak Republic (II) in which the tribunal found that “[i]t does not
follow from the fact that international responsibility can arise only after an internationally

wrongful act has occurred, that an internationally wrongful act is required for a legal dispute to

exist”.°' Rather, “the allegation of a breach is... a requirement for liability to arise” and not a

“constitutive element of the notion of legal dispute”.°'*

The Respondent also refers to Achmea v. the Slovak Republik (II), which concerned a measure
that had been threatened by the respondent government, but not yet enacted.*!5 The Respondent
quotes the tribunal as having found that a dispute existed when “the two Parties h[e]ld radically
opposing views” on the proper interpretation of a particular treaty provision.°'© The Respondent
also disagrees with the Claimant that Pac Rim v. El Salvador establishes a “general principle”
that a dispute must concern a matter that has developed into a concrete legal claim.*!” In Pac
Rim v. El Salvador, the critical factor, according to the Respondent, was that “the respondent
continued to give indications that the mining permits at issue might yet be granted, and the

parties remained in negotiation, after the date of the claimant’s acquisition of US nationality”.°'*

The Respondent disputes purported limitations introduced by the Claimant into the concept of
“dispute” as enunciated in Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions.°"° In particular, the manner in
which the Claimant formulates its claims (i.e. that the claims arise only from the enactment and
enforcement of the Plain Packaging Measures) is not, in the view of the Respondent, decisive.
This position conflates the formulation of a claim with the question of whether a dispute
exists.”! The identification of the existence of a dispute remains a “matter for objective
determination by the given court or tribunal... not a matter to be irrevocably determined by a

claimant in its litigation strategy”.°?

According to the Respondent, the conclusions of the tribunal in Urbaser v. Argentina—that it
was for the claimant to state what it considered to be the dispute between the parties—does not
suggest otherwise, since the issue of the formulation of a claim “arose in the discrete context of

the difference between a shareholder’s claim and a claim on behalf of a company in its own

right”.©? The correct test was, in the Respondent’s view, set out by the ICJ in the Fisheries
Jurisdiction Case: namely that it is for this Tribunal to “determine the real dispute that has been
submitted to it’.** The Respondent therefore reiterates that “[a]n exercise of objective
determination” is required, and for that purpose “the way that PM Asia has chosen to formulate
its current BIT claim is relevant but not decisive”.°>

According to the Respondent, it is critical that the Tribunal focuses on “the substance of the
dispute as it developed... [and] to determine whether the facts or considerations that gave rise to
the earlier dispute continue to be central to the current claim”.°”° In reaching an objective
determination of the dispute, the Tribunal ought not, in the Respondent’s view, be concerned
with whether precisely the same BIT claim could have been made prior to the restructuring of

February 2011.

In further support of its assertion that the dispute prior to the enactment of the plain packaging
legislation is the same as the dispute presently before this Tribunal, the Respondent invites the
Tribunal to adopt the finding in Lucchetti v. Peru that “the critical element in determining the
existence of one or two separate disputes is whether or not they concern the same subject
matter” and this Tribunal will “have to determine whether or not the facts or considerations that
gave rise to the earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute”.°?’ The Respondent
reiterates that “the fact that the original dispute did not involve, and necessarily could not have
involved, any allegation of breach of the BIT did not, in itself, mean that the claim presented

under the BIT constituted a distinct dispute”.°°*

adopted, might never be adopted, and the specific contours of which remain uncertain”. The

PCIJ did not decide, and was not asked to decide, this principle: the PCIJ, in the view of the
Claimant, held only that a dispute existed in that case because Greece had asserted that Britain
had taken an action in breach of international law.* According to the Claimant, the question
before the present tribunal—which is one not touched upon by the PCI) in Mavrommatis
Palestine Concessions—is “whether preparatory activity gives rise to a dispute”.®! In the
Claimant’s view, the correct interpretation of Georgia v. Russia is that the ICJ’s analysis
focused on the question of whether a dispute about a claim had achieved the “specific
crystallisation” necessary to invoke the ICJ’s jurisdiction over contentious cases and that such

crystallisation occurred only subsequent to the allegedly wrongful State conduct.°*?

The Claimant further distinguishes Murphy v. Ecuador on the basis that the position relied upon
by the Respondent—that “the mere presence of a legal conflict of interest is sufficient to
originate a difference or dispute”—is the position of the dissenting arbitrator in that case. In
any event, according to the Claimant, the conclusion of the relevant dissenting opinion in
Murphy v. Ecuador was that the dispute arose after the measure that the claimant alleged
breached the treaty. °* Similarly, in Teinver v. Argentina, the tribunal found that a dispute can
arise only after “the injured party identifies the breach or violations and objects to it”.

In the Claimant’s view, the question that is before this Tribunal—namely, whether a preparatory
act gives rise to a dispute—has been conclusively decided in international law.** In the view of
the tribunals in Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela and Lao Holdings v. Laos, the Claimant notes,
“the dispute over [specific] measures can only be deemed to have arisen after the measures were
taken”.°” The Claimant distinguishes Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela from the present case on
the ground that it does not challenge “an announced but unimplemented government policy”
under the Treaty.°** With regard to Lao Holdings v. Laos, the Claimant asserts that the facts of
that case are analogous to the matters presently in dispute. In Lao Holdings v. Laos, the tribunal

was concerned with the compatibility with the applicable treaty of imposing a new tax code on

the investor. The tax code was enacted a month before the restructuring of the original Macau
company that resulted in the claimant becoming an investor under the applicable treaty.“ The
respondent State challenged the tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis on the grounds that the
dispute actually arose more than a month before the business restructuring.” The Lao Holdings
tribunal reasoned that Laos carried the burden of proving that the dispute arose earlier than the
claimant had alleged.“! This in turn required the proof that (1) it was objectively unreasonable
for the investor to have believed that the issue was still live; (2) the government’s consideration
of the matter had come to an end; and (3) that the government’s decision was “completely
finalized”. The tribunal held that Laos failed to meet this burden of proof, and the dispute
arose only “when the final decision [on the tax code]... was adopted at the highest level” of the
government.“ The Claimant emphasises that the tribunal still “found no pre-existing dispute”
even though the tax law had already been amended and the investor’s application had been
rejected by the Minister of Finance “at the time the investment was made”.*4

The Claimant also refers to Teinver v. Argentina and RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation to
further support its position that a measure must pass into law before it can form the subject of a
legal dispute. Accordingly, the tribunal’s finding in Teinver v. Argentina were that “a breach or
violation does not become a ‘dispute’ until the injured party identifies the breach or violation
and objects to it”. In RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation, the tribunal put emphasis on the
timing of the specific acts that allegedly breached the BIT, rather than the origin of any broader
disagreements. In the view of the tribunal, although Russia’s earlier conduct was “inextricably
linked” to the subsequent acts, the “major alleged acts of Respondent breaching the [BIT]... all
occurred after Claimant was an investor under the [BIT]”.“° In addressing the Respondent’s
attempts to distinguish RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation, the Claimant emphasizes that “[t]he
tribunal was focused on when the acts giving rise to the dispute occurred, not whether

RosInvestCo as opposed to Yukos was involved in an earlier dispute”. According to the

Claimant, a similar fact pattern arises in RDC v. Guatemala, wherein the tribunal determined
that the relevant dispute “crystalli[s]ed” only subsequent to the entry into force of the relevant
lesivo resolution said to have violated the applicable BIT.’ Furthermore, the Claimant puts
emphasis on the Gremcitel Award in which the tribunal considered the critical date of the
relevant dispute as the date “on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even where the
measure represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have started
years earlier”. Lastly, the Claimant points to the decision of the arbitral tribunal in Cervin v.
Costa Rica in which it was found that even where “there has existed pre-existing litigation”,
such pre-existing litigation “cannot in itself deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction”.°°

According to the Claimant, in Rights of Passage Over Indian Territory, the ICJ explained that,
“while ‘[c]ertain incidents occurred [before 1954]... they did not lead the Parties to adopt
clearly-defined positions as against each other. The ‘conflict of legal views’ between the Parties
which the [PCIJ] in [Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions] includes in its definition of a dispute
had not yet arisen”.**! This case, the Claimant maintains, establishes that a dispute cannot “arise
until all its constituent elements ha[ve] come into existence”, including an act or omission

allegedly in breach of the respondent State’s international obligations.*?

Similarly, in Electricity
Company of Sofia and Bulgaria, the Claimant adds, the PCIJ rejected Bulgaria’s assertions that

the Court lacked jurisdiction ratione temporis on the basis that the dispute had arisen “from

 

tuations or facts’ that took place prior to the date of Belgium’s acceptance of the Court’s
compulsory jurisdiction”. According to the Claimant, the Court considered that “the ‘situations
or facts’ that Bulgaria alleged had given rise to the dispute were not the dispute’s ‘real cause’”.
Rather, the real cause of the dispute was reflected in the “concrete actions that allegedly
breached Bulgaria’s international obligations and that were taken by the Bulgarian government
after the critical date”.°? In further support of this proposition, the Claimant cites the PCIJ in
Phosphates in Morocco wherein the PCIJ held that ‘a dispute could only arise after the

enactment of the challenged measures that were the ‘real cause’ of the dispute.°*

characterised as preparatory acts that, absent a positive obligation to the contrary, do not amount
to a breach of international law.°** This is because such statements, in the words of the ICJ in

Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, do not “‘predetermine the final decision to be taken’ on the
issue”.°°° To support its argument, the Claimant quotes ILC’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of
States for International Wrongful Acts, which makes, in the view of the Claimant, a distinction
between “when a breach of international law occurs” as opposed to “being merely apprehended
or imminent”.°’ The Claimant also points out that, to determine whether a dispute has arisen,
the tribunal in CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina reasoned that, “what counts is
whether the rights of the investor have been affected”. Similarly, the Pac Rim tribunal in Pac
Rim v. El Salvador put emphasis on “at least one specific and identifiable governmental
measure that allegedly terminated the rights of the claimants”.°*

The Claimant further maintains that Achmea v. the Slovak Republik (II) supports its position. In
Achmea v. the Slovak Republik (II), the respondent State had announced its intent to pursue a
unified health insurance system, but it had not yet implemented that measure when the claimant
initiated arbitration. The tribunal “declined jurisdiction because... there could be no legal
dispute under the BIT until such time as the [respondent] adopted the measure in question’”.®°
The Claimant quotes the Achmea II tribunal’s findings that the host State’s “consent only
extends to disputes dealing with alleged breaches of the BIT that have already occurred at the
time of the institution of arbitral proceedings” and that there could be no “disputes concerning
an investment” under the BIT unless “on the basis of [the claimant’s] claims of fact there could
occur a [treaty] violation”. According to the Claimant, the Achmea I/ tribunal noted further that,
“preparatory work... is in any circumstances not unlawful”.°°

Even if the Tribunal were to find that a dispute can arise on the basis of a threat to enact law that
will violate an applicable BIT, the Claimant submits that in order to identify the subject of the
dispute, the Tribunal “must examine Claimant’s pleadings to determine which acts or omissions

Claimant asserts breached the BIT and form the basis for its claims”.°! The Claimant refers to

Urbaser vy. Argentina in which the tribunal explained that “it is for Claimants to state the claims
they are submitting to this arbitral jurisdiction. It is for them to say what they consider to be the
‘dispute arising between them and the [respondent State]”.°® In the present case, the Claimant
made it clear that its “claims arise from the enactment and enforcement of the TPP Act and its
effect on investments in Australia owned or controlled by PM Asia”.

Finally, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s argument that its claim can be interpreted
as referring to a pre-existing dispute concerning the threat of passing plain packaging
legislation. Insofar as there was a dispute between PMI and the Respondent prior to the
enactment of the plain packaging legislation, the Claimant asserts that this dispute cannot be
considered the same as that which is currently before the Tribunal. In this regard, the Claimant
disagrees with the Respondent’s test for ascertaining whether two disputes are the same. In
order to determine whether two disputes are the same, the Claimant contends, investor-State
tribunals “have applied a ‘triple-identity’ test that requires an examination of the cause of
action, object, and parties to the two disputes”.*™ In the Claimant’s view, an application of this
test reveals that, “the dispute that Respondent posits and the dispute that is actually at issue in
this arbitration are entirely distinct”.°°

Applying the Lucchetti v. Peru standard as suggested by the Respondent, the Claimant argues,
“leads to the same outcome as the triple-identity test”. °° In Luccherti v. Peru, the tribunal was
required to determine whether a dispute that predated the entry into force of the applicable BIT
was the same as the dispute that was at that time before the tribunal. Each dispute referred to
different decrees, issued by the same Peruvian municipality denying the investor certain
construction and operating licenses. The Lucchetti tribunal decided that the two disputes were
the same, identifying as determinative of the issue the consideration of "whether and to what
extent the subject matter or facts that were the real cause of the disputes differ from or are
identical to the other”. The fact pattern in Lucchetti v. Peru, the Claimant asserts, is distinct
from that of the present dispute, since the present dispute concerns only one piece of legislation
“without any predecessor action of equivalent (or any) legal effect on the Claimants

investments”.°7

In the Respondent’s view, “public statements and exchanges” indicate that Australia’s
announcement of April 2010 gave rise to “a disagreement and/or conflict” between the Parties
as required by the Mavrommatis test.°* The Respondent points out that in January 2009 the
PMI Group (via PML) opposed plain packaging in the NPHT consultation, taking substantially
the same position as in this case:®® (a) that the public health benefit of plain packaging is not
supported by the evidence; (b) that plain packaging is likely to increase illicit tobacco trade; (c)
that that mandating plain packaging would require the Australian Government to compensate
trademark owners for expropriating some of the world’s most valuable brands; and (d) that
eliminating trademarks would violate international treaty obligations.®”’ The Respondent quotes
the 2009 PML submission in the NPHT consultation as stating that “[mJandating plain
packaging or dedicating the entire package to government warnings is extreme and
disproportionate, unsupported by the evidence, and would constitute an expropriation for which
compensation is due”.°’! The Respondent points out that PML reiterated these concerns in 2009
following the announcement by NPHT of a series of “key action areas” in relation to tobacco
packaging.*” In September 2009, PMI Group (via the solicitors of PML and the Managing
Director of PM Australia) contacted the Health Minister and the Trade Minister to make its

claim.

In April 2010, the Government announced its decision to introduce plain packaging, which,
according to the Respondent, signaled the Government’s commitment at the highest level to
introduce the measures.° One day after this announcement, PML’s Director of Corporate
Affairs reiterated PML’s opposition to plain packaging in the Australian Financial Review,
stating that the Plain Packaging Measures were “an unconstitutional expropriation of our
valuable intellectual property and violate[d] a variety of Australian international trade

obligations”. On the same day, PML provided a submission to the Senate Community Affairs

Committee in which it opposed the Plain Tobacco packaging (Removing Branding from
Cigarette Packs) Bill 2009. Following the Government’s publication of its response to the
NPHT Report in May 2010, Mr. Pellegrini—the President of PM Asia at the time—stated that
“[w]e oppose plain packaging, which is not supported by evidence of a public health benefit and
which will increase illicit trade, harm competition and violate Australian and international trade

law" £77

These events, in the Respondent’s view, “manifested, and provide objective evidence of, the

conflict of views between the disputants”®”*

regarding the legality of the implementation of the
plain packaging legislation.*” Accordingly, by this point, a dispute had crystallized between
Philip Morris and the Australian Government. By this time, PMI and the Australian
Government were able to take opposing views on a point of law or fact because the Plain
Packaging Measures were sufficiently definite and precise in their formulation, and sufficiently
clear in their likely effect on the Philip Morris group, to enable the group to dispute the likely
“legality and efficacy of a measure that requires tobacco products to be sold in plain
packaging”.°*°

According to the Respondent, the substance of the dispute that crystallised in April 2010
contained three legal strands: “Australia’s obligations under the Australian Constitution,
intellectual property or like treaties (such as the WTO TRIPS Agreement) and international
investment treaties (i.e. BITs or FTAs)”.**! Moreover, “the same basic claim underpinned all
three strands”, which was that the implementation of the plain packaging legislation would
expropriate or take away the ability to use trademarks and could not be justified as a legitimate

682

public health measure.” The dispute remained in substance the same up to the Claimant’s

 

initiation of these pr di and, ding to the Respond “conti to underpin PM

Asia’s claim under the BIT”.°*

It is, in the Respondent’s view, therefore “plainly incorrect to characterise the announcement of
a government decision to introduce legislation as merely a plan” or a “statement of intent”.
Nor, in the Respondent’s view, can the factual record prior to April 2010, be properly described
as “policy debate about a potential act”.“*° The Respondent asserts, it was “patently clear” that
the introduction of plain packaging was a “significant likelihood” by September 2010 and
“highly probable” by January or February 2011, during which time the PMI Group took no
different view.** In particular, the Respondent points to the fact that from April 2008 the NPHT
had considered, and from September 2009 had recommended the adoption of plain packaging,
and from April 2010 the Australian Government had decided to introduce plain packaging.” In
July of the same year, the Australian Government published a timetable for the implementation
of its decision, and “both the Government and the Philip Morris group subsequently worked on
the basis of that timetable”.°** According to the Respondent, therefore, PMI’s public statements
and internal documents evidence, in the view of the Respondent, its understanding that the
government was “determined to introduce these measures”.*°

The Respondent contends that the assertion by the Claimant that there was no pre-existing
dispute is contradicted by the Claimant’s Written Notice of Claim in which the Claimant defines
its complaint as pertaining to “the Bill (un-enacted)” and envisages “commencement of
proceedings prior to enactment”.® The Claimant’s contention that its Written Notification of
Claim “was intended merely to prevent a dispute from arising”, the Respondent argues, “is
entirely artificial” because the Written Notification did not predicate the existence of a dispute
“on the enactment of the plain packaging legislation” as the Claimant suggests.°! The
Respondent refers to the introductory passage in the Written Notification, which states that “[i]f
the Claim is not admitted, PM Asia advises, pursuant to Article 10, that it is willing to meet and
confer with representatives of [Australia]”.°? The Written Notification, the Respondent notes,

employs the term “the Bill” rather than “the particular Bill once enacted” and seeks a remedy

even “prior to enactment” by requesting Australia to “cease and discontinue all steps towards
enacting plain packaging legislation”.©* The Respondent challenges the Claimant’s position that
the Written Notification “was clearly conditioned on an uncertain event” on the basis that “the

terms ‘once’ and ‘will’, not ‘if’ and ‘would’” were used therein."

In the present case, the Claimant contends that the measure that gave rise to the present dispute
is the enactment of the TPP Act by the Parliament and the Respondent’s attempt to “subvert the
BIT by redefining the ‘dispute’” to include preparatory acts and conduct should be rejected by
the Tribunal. According to the Claimant, there is no basis for the Respondent’s argument that
the dispute concerns the legality of its decision to introduce plain packaging and the ensuing
policy and political debate, because the Claimant has never claimed that these events breached
the Treaty. In the Claimant’s view, prior to the adoption of the TPP Act, the Claimant’s legal
rights regarding its brands and trademarks were not affected and certainly not terminated.”
There was therefore no basis to develop a concrete legal claim.®* The events preceding the
enactment of the TPP Act, including Prime Minister Rudd’s announcement in April 2010, the
Claimant maintains, are merely facts leading to the dispute, and not acts giving rise to the
dispute. This is because “[a] legal dispute cannot arise simply because someone expressed a

view about the ‘legality and efficacy’ of plain packaging” .©”

In the Claimant’s view, “‘plain packaging’ is not a legal measure giving rise to a legal dispute.
It is a regulatory concept that has been debated in Australia at least since the 1990s and on
which the PMI Group (or its corporate predecessors) have expressed views for decades”.”° In
fact, Prime Minister Rudd had no power to adopt the TPP Act or to ensure the passage of the

TPP Act by Parliament”! and, accordingly, “if the TPP A[ct] never materialized, none of those

statements could have given rise to a cognizable investment dispute under the [Treaty]”.”” Any

3 and better characterised

disagreement arising before that time was a political or policy debate
as preparatory acts that, absent a positive obligation to the contrary, do not amount to a breach
of international law. In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent conflates two events that are
legally distinct: “the inchoate policy debate that the Prime Minister’s announcement spurred in
April 2010 and the legal dispute that crystallized when Parliament enacted plain packaging
legislation in 2011 and Claimant initiated the arbitration’”.”°

The Claimant strongly disputes the contention that the enactment of the TPP Act was highly
probable. According to the Claimant, “[i]rrefutable evidence confirms that, even in the view of
the Australian government, the prospects for plain packaging legislation were highly uncertain
during and beyond the fall of 2010”. The Claimant points to a Parliamentary briefing book
that stated in September 2010 that, “[iJt is difficult to determine the likely fate of the plain
packaging proposal given that the position of the [Opposition] Coalition and the independent
members is unknown”.”” The Claimant also points out that in the same month, the Australian
Government’s Health Minister stated that, “she had not yet even discussed the plain packaging
proposal with independent members of Parliament”.”* Similar uncertainty is, according to the
Claimant, reflected in PMI’s 2010 Annual Report.” The Claimant asserts that it was only in
late May 2011 that it came to believe that there was “a serious threat that the legislation would
pass” and that accordingly, in June 2011, “the decision was taken... to send a notice [of
claim]”.7!°

According to the Claimant, “even if the dispute ‘pre-existed’ the investments (it did not), the
Tribunal would still have jurisdiction ratione temporis over the dispute as long as the dispute
continued to exist on the date of the Notice of Arbitration”.”!! The Claimant reiterates that both

Parties agree that the dispute existed when the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration on

21 November 2011 since the Respondent has not argued that the dispute ceased to exist before

this point.”!?

Finally, the Claimant counters the Respondent’s argument that the dispute arose before the
enactment of the TPP Act in November 2011 because the Claimant filed a Written Notification
of Claim in June 2011. According to the Claimant, the purpose of the Written Notification was
to warn the Respondent that a dispute would arise if the plain packaging legislation were to be
enacted, not to acknowledge that a dispute already existed.”* The Written Notification is
conditioned on a future and uncertain event (the passage of the plain packaging legislation), as
demonstrated by the use of the word “will” throughout the text.”'* All potential claims identified
in the Written Notification depend on this future and uncertain event.”'° The Claimant further
maintains that the Written Notification is not an indication of the existence of a dispute, because
the Notification itself explains the substantial change of the political context and prospects for
the legislation between the time when it was introduced to Parliament and the time when the

Coalition withdrew its opposition.’!°

2. The Abuse of Right Argument

(a) Content of the Abuse of Right Doctrine

The Respondent's Position

400.

The Respondent argues that even if the claimed investment falls under Article 10 of the Treaty,
the doctrine of abuse of rights forbids the Claimant from exercising the right in Article 10.7!”

Citing academic authority, the Respondent gives the following explanation for the doctrine:

A reasonable and bona fide exercise of a right... is one which is appropriate and necessary
for the purpose of the right i.e. in furtherance of the interests which the right is intended to
protect). It should at the same time be fair and equitable as between the parties and not one
which is calculated to procure for one of them an unfair advantage in the light of the
obligation assumed. A reasonable exercise of the right is regarded as compatible with the
obligation. But the exercise of the right in such a manner as to prejudice the interests of the
other contracting party arising out of the treaty is unreasonable and is considered as
inconsistent with the bona fide execution of the treaty obligation, and a breach of the
treaty.7!8

 

The Respondent argues that the doctrine has been widely applied in national legal systems, in
the legal order of the European Union, as well as by international courts and tribunals,”!
including investment tribunals.””° By way of example, the Respondent refers to the decision of
the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization in United States—Standards for
Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline wherein the tribunal described the chapeau of Article
XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 as “animated by the principle that
while the exceptions of Article XX may be invoked as a matter of legal right, they should not be
so applied as to frustrate or defeat the legal obligations of the holder of the right under the
substantive rules of the [GATT]”.”!

According to the Respondent, the abuse of rights doctrine is neither exceptionally applied, nor
applied with a particularly high standard.” The doctrine “merely restricts the application of a
given treaty to what the treaty parties intended” thereby bringing the jurisdiction of the arbitral
tribunal within the boundaries of the Parties’ consent.’””> The Respondent points to a “body of
investment treaty cases where tribunals have considered and applied the doctrine of abuse of
rights... precisely in the context of a corporate restructur[ing] intended in whole or in
substantial part to achieve treaty protection”. From this body of case law, it is, according to the
Respondent, possible to establish a number of factors that are to be taken into consideration in

determining whether there is an abuse of right.’”* The two key factors are:

a. “[K]nowledge of the existing or foreseeable dispute”

and in particular where “the
relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific dispute as a high

probability and not merely as a general future controversy”;’”° and

b. “[C]orporate restructur[ing] of an investment such that BIT protection is then obtained
with a view to bringing a preconceived BIT claim in respect of that actual or specific
future dispute” (i.e. “[t]he timing of the corporate restructur[ing]” and “[t]he purpose
of or motivation for the corporate restructur[ing]”).’””

Other relevant factors are the timing of the claim, the transparency of the corporate restructuring

(for example, where an investment is made without revealing to the host State the true motives

behind such an investment”*), and whether the corporate restructuring was followed by

subsequent economic activity in the host State.”

The Respondent submits that the doctrine of abuse of rights is based on the principle of good

faith, citing the tribunal in Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic to the effect that “[t]he principle of

good faith governs the relations between States, but also the legal rights and duties of those
seeking to assert an international claim under a treaty. Nobody shall abuse the rights granted by
treaties, and more generally, every rule of law includes an implied clause that it should not be
abused”. This does not, however, mean that there is a presumption that PM Asia has acted in
good faith.”! Referring by way of example to the decisions in Pac Rim v. El Salvador and

Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela, the Respondent asserts that whether a claim brought

subsequent to a corporate restructuring amounts to an abuse of right “depends on the facts and

circumstances of the case” and not any presumption in the claimant’s favour.” The Respondent
further asserts that the decisions in Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, Pac Rim v. El Salvador,

Tidewater v. Venezuela and ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, all of which deal with corporate

restructuring, make “no mention at all... of any [such] presumption”.73 In the Respondent’s

view, the decision in Chevron v. Ecuador (1), relied upon by the Claimant as establishing a

presumption in favour of a claimant’s right to bring a claim, was issued in “a quite different

context”.

According to the Respondent, the foreseeability of the dispute and the motivation of the
restructuring establish bad faith and an abuse of right where they result in “a manipulation of
the international system of investment arbitration” such that rights are exercised in a way that is
calculated to procure for the investor an “unfair advantage in light of the obligation assumed”.795
By way of example, the Respondent refers to Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic wherein the
tribunal determined that “if the sole purpose of an economic transaction is to pursue an ICSID
claim, without any intent to perform any economic activity in the host country, such transaction
cannot be considered as a protected investment”.”° The Phoenix Action tribunal was concerned
to ensure that “the ICSID mechanism does not protect investments that it was not designed for
[sic] to protect, because they are in essence domestic investments disguised as international
investments for the sole purpose of access to this mechanism”.”*”

The Respondent maintains that the “dozens” of cases to which the Claimant refers concern
allegations of abuse in different circumstances and are therefore irrelevant to the present
dispute.”** The Respondent further asserts that there is no case law that supports the Claimant’s
argument that there is a need to establish “an additional requirement [of] conduct of some
unspecified but egregious level, such as fraud”.”° For example, the Respondent argues that the
tribunal in Cementownia v. Turkey “did consider an allegation of abusive treaty shopping” and
that it “found that a corporate restructur[ing] at a time when the companies were on notice of the
potential termination of a concession contract, but prior to the actual termination, would have
fallen ‘within the category of an artifice’’.“° The Respondent argues that Cementownia
supports its position that “a corporate restructur[ing] for the purpose of making a preconceived

BIT claim will ordinarily be abusive”. ™!

Similarly, the Phoenix Action tribunal did not place emphasis on what the Claimant calls
“egregious conduct”, but rather focused on the “international principle of good faith”.””
According to the Respondent, the tribunal looked at “the timing of the investment, the timing of
the initial request to the tribunal, the timing of the claim, the substance of the transaction, and
the true nature of the investment, including whether the claimant participated in economic
activities”. It was, in the Respondent’s words, these factors that lead the tribunal to conclude
that the investment was not bona fide.“ In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant cannot
differentiate itself from the claimant in Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic on the basis of long-
standing control over the investment, because whether the Claimant controlled PML before
2011 is being disputed in the present case.” Nor, in the Respondent’s view, can the Claimant
distinguish Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic on the basis that the company in Phoenix Action
was nothing more than a “shell” company, with no pre-existing relationship or role with respect
to the investment, since, according to the Respondent, while the claimant in Phoenix Action v.
Czech Republic had to create a shell company to buy the shares of its Czech affiliates, the
Claimant in the present case has “an almost unlimited array of ready-made entities that could
buy the shares of the Australian affiliates”.”°

The ST-AD vy. Bulgaria case, the Respondent notes, did not turn on findings of egregious
conduct or fraud, but on “the timing of the investment and the claim”.”° For the same reasons as
in Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s attempts to
distinguish ST-AD v. Bulgaria by reference to the fact that a shell company had been employed
in ST-AD v. Bulgaria and because of the absence of a relationship of long-standing control.”
The Respondent further rejects the Claimant’s assertions that ST-AD v. Bulgaria establishes that
a dispute over abuse of rights must be “internationalised” such that a domestic dispute is
transformed into an international one. The Respondent asserts that there is no relevant
distinction between cases where the investment is “internationalised” and cases, such as the

present one, where the investment is “renationalised”.”*

The Respondent further disputes the relevance of the decision in Mobil Corporation v.
Venezuela in this context since, according to the Respondent, the Mobil Corporation tribunal
“does not use the term bad faith in its reasoning, and does not suggest that some heightened
standard akin to fraud must be met”. ”?

In sum, investment disputes that deal with allegations of abuse of right in the context of
corporate restructuring turn, according to the Respondent, on their facts, and not on any general
rule that the host State must establish “compelling evidence of [the investor’s] bad faith...

involving egregious conduct”.”°

The Claimant’s Position

411.

412.

The Claimant considers that the scope and content of the abuse of rights doctrine is uncertain”!
and exceptionally applied. The Claimant observes that Australia itself acknowledged such
uncertainty in its arguments in the Case Concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru before
the ICJ, wherein Australia stated that, “[t]he status and content of the doctrine of abuse of right
is uncertain at international law and there has been little agreement amongst writers or arbitral
and judicial tribunals concerning it”.”*?

The Claimant asserts that the doctrine is based on the concept that a party has abused an
otherwise lawful right such that “the objection only comes into play in the present case if the
Tribunal has already determined that it has jurisdiction over the dispute and Claimant has a right

to arbitrate”.”*? Depriving a party of that right on the grounds that the exercise of that right was

4 and was

abusive is, in the view of the Claimant, a serious and exceptional step to take
described by the tribunal in Chevron v. Ecuador (I) as an “extraordinary remedy”.”*° The
Claimant refers to the decision of the tribunal in Rompetrol v. Romania which stated that abuse
of rights “is evidently a proposition of a very-far reaching character; it would entail an ICSID
tribunal, after having determined conclusively (or at least prima facie) that the parties to an

investment dispute had conferred on it by agreement jurisdiction to hear their dispute, deciding

nevertheless not to entertain the application to hear the dispute”.’*° Similarly in ConocoPhillips
v. Venezuela, the tribunal approached allegations of an abuse of rights “bearing in mind how

rarely courts and tribunals have held that a good faith or other related standard is breached”.7*7

In the Claimant’s view, a presumption exists in favour of the right to bring a BIT claim: the
Respondent must prove that the Claimant lacks a legitimate interest in instituting proceedings
and acts in a “legally reprehensible” way.”** In support of its position, the Claimant refers to the
Chevron v. Ecuador (1) decision wherein the tribunal explained that “[a]ny right leads normally
and automatically to a claim for its holder. It is only in very exceptional circumstances that a
holder of a right can nevertheless not raise and enforce the resulting claim’. Thus, there is a
“presumption in favour of [Claimant’s] right to bring [its] claim under the BIT”. When
analysing Ecuador’s abuse of rights argument, the Chevron (I) tribunal found that “[t]he nature
of these defenses as exceptions to a general rule that leads to the reversal of the burden of proof
stem from, among other factors, the presumption of good faith. A claimant is not required to
prove that its claim is asserted in a non-abusive manner; it is for the respondent to raise and
prove an abuse as a defense”.”

The Claimant concludes that, “to uphold an abuse of rights objection, this Tribunal must find
that the Respondent has proven bad faith. Prior tribunals have found that standard met only in
exceedingly rare circumstances involving egregious conduct akin to fraud”.”°'! The Claimant
submits further that in order to rebut the presumption of good faith, the Respondent must come
forward with compelling evidence and meet “a very high evidentiary burden”.’” Thus, the
Claimant asserts, in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, the tribunal stated that it must “bear[] in mind
how rarely courts and tribunals have held that a good faith or other related standard is breached.

39-763

The standard is a high one’ The Claimant refers in particular to the decision in Chevron v.

Ecuador (1), which it cites as “the leading investor-[S]tate case on the presumption of good faith

in the abuse of rights context and [which] is fully in accord with the Claimant’s position”.

The Claimant cites the Chevron (I) tribunal as stating that “in all legal systems, the doctrines of
abuse of rights, estoppel and waiver are subject to a high threshold”.”* This high threshold
“results from the seriousness of a charge of bad faith amounting to abuse of process”.”°°
Furthermore, “[t]he threshold must be particularly high in the context of a prima facie
examination where the Claimant’s submissions are to be presumed true”.”*” The Claimant also
cites the conclusions of the ICJ in its advisory opinion in Tacna-Arica Question that “[a] finding
of the existence of bad faith should be supported not by disputable inferences but by clear and
convincing evidence which compels such a conclusion”.”*

In the Claimant’s view, the “critical point” in establishing an abuse of rights is the evidence of
bad faith.” According to the Claimant, the case law of tribunals that have examined allegations
of abusive treaty shopping provides “an indication of the types of conduct that might constitute

bad faith”. ””° These include cases where:

a. The claimant lacked any pre-existing connection with the investment or lacked the

capability to manage or develop the business post-investment;

b. The claimant company was a mere “shell” company that lacked any substantial ties to

the jurisdiction in which it was incorporated;

c. The claimant did not provide notice to or obtain consent from the host State for the

transfer of ownership to a new company with a different nationality;

d. Where the restructuring resulted in the “internationalisation” of a dispute involving

purely domestic business interests of concerns.””!

The Claimant asserts that the purpose of, or motivation for, a corporate restructuring does not
amount to bad faith even if a claimant could reasonably foresee a potential future dispute with
the host State at the time.”” According to the Claimant, “any effort to secure BIT protection will

be driven, at least to a certain degree, by the fact that an investor can foresee that a host State

might engage in future conduct that would unreasonably impair or harm the foreign investment

and wishes to guard against the risk that it will”.”

While the abuse of rights objections have been considered in a number of cases, the Claimant
argues, these objections have been rejected in all but four cases that involved egregious facts
giving rise to bad faith. Thus, the tribunals in Cementownia v. Turkey and Europe Cement v.
Turkey issued a finding of bad faith and fraud because the respective investors used forged and
fraudulent documents as evidence of their purported ownership of the relevant investments.” In
Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic and ST-AD y. Bulgaria, the tribunals were concerned with
host country nationals that tried to initiate international arbitration against their own
governments long after their domestic disputes had arisen. According to the Claimant, the cases
involved shell companies without any longstanding, legitimate business relationships with the
investments. Consequently, neither case involved facts similar to those that are now before the

Tribunal.’

The Claimant asserts a further distinction between Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, ST-AD v.
Bulgaria and the present dispute: in Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic and ST-AD v. Bulgaria,
both tribunals found an abuse of rights because “domestic investors had sought to
‘internationalise’ claims for damages that had already accrued and were subject to litigation
before the host States’ courts” and “the claimants had established wholly artificial structures
that served no purpose other than to create jurisdiction over existing domestic disputes”.”””
Contrary to the Respondent’s view, the Claimant considers that, “whether the dispute was
‘internationalised’ or ‘renationalised’” makes a difference for the Tribunal’s analysis and
emphasises that the tribunal in ST-AD v. Bulgaria found attempts to internationalise a domestic
dispute “particularly troubling”.”* According to the Claimant, “the [ST-AD] tribunal stated that
the “system of international investment protection” was not designed for “domestic investments
disguised as international investments or domestic investments repackaged as international
disputes”. ”” Referring in particular to Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela, Pac Rim v. El Salvador,

and Tidewater v. Venezuela, the Claimant asserts that “[i]n every other case that Respondent

cites... the tribunal refused to apply the abuse of rights doctrine to create... ‘an impediment or

disentitlement’ to otherwise well-founded jurisdiction under an investment treaty”.’°°

Finally, the Claimant challenges the Respondent’s reliance on ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela to
invoke a presumption in favour of the host State on the ground that the passage cited by the
Respondent does not come from the tribunal’s discussion on abuse of rights but from the
tribunal’s discussion of whether Venezuela consented to arbitration in its domestic investment
law.”*! This, according to the Claimant “was unrelated to whether the claimant acted in bad faith

and thus engaged in an abuse of rights”.”*?

(b) The “Foreseeability” Criterion

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent asserts that “[t]he abuse (i.e. the failure to act in good faith/acting in bad faith)
resides in the manipulation of corporate nationality at a time when the dispute is in existence or
is foreseeable to a sufficient degree”.”*

In respect of establishing an existing dispute, the Respondent maintains its position that a
dispute is established when there is “a disagreement on a point of law or fact” and that this may
arise after a measure is announced, threatened or decided upon and before its final and definitive
implementation.”* What is important, in the view of the Respondent, is that the Tribunal
identifies whether prior to the restructuring, the Parties were already in a dispute concerning the
same subject matter (per Tidewater v. Venezuela and Lucchetti v. Peru).”*° The Respondent
emphasises the need to “focus... on the prospective claimant’s appreciation of the actual dispute
[since] [w]hat matters is whether the prospective claimant restructures at a time when it can see

a dispute that, in substance, then becomes the BIT dispute”.

In respect of establishing a foreseeable dispute, the Respondent emphasises the distinction
between the risk of a specific future dispute as opposed to a general risk of a future dispute.”*”
The Respondent submits that in determining whether there is abuse in the current context by
reference to a foreseeability test, “it is appropriate to look at (i) the viewpoint of the putative
claimant, albeit (ii) with an element of objectivity, such that the question comes down to what

was within the reasonable contemplation of the putative claimant”.”**

The Respondent asserts that the abuse of right objection has been discussed in cases in which
the tribunals expressly applied a foreseeability approach.’ In Pac Rim v. El Salvador, the
tribunal ruled that, “if a corporate restructur[ing] affecting a claimant’s nationality was made in
good faith before the occurrence of any event or measure giving rise to a later dispute, that
restructuring should not be considered as an abuse of process”.””° However, the tribunal found
that “the dividing-line occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a
Specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy”.”'
Hence, the tribunal agreed with El Salvador that an abuse of process exists when an investor
manipulates the nationality of a shell company “at a time when the investor is aware that events
have occurred that negatively affect its investment and may lead to arbitration” .””

In Tidewater v. Venezuela, the tribunal found it legitimate for “an investor to seek to protect
itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host State” by restructuring its investment
but emphasised that “the same is not the case in relation to pre-existing disputes between the
specific investor and the State”.”* The Respondent stresses that what was important in
Tidewater v. Venezuela was the extent to which the dispute was “existing” or “foreseeable” at

the time of the corporate restructuring.”

Similarly, the Respondent refers to the tribunal’s finding in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela that no

claim “was in prospect at the times of the restructurings”.”> The Respondent disputes the

Claimant’s assertions that the ConocoPhillips tribunal focused on the date when the claim or
cause of action accrued and not when it became foreseeable. The Respondent explains that the
facts in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela explain the tribunal’s approach: “(i) at the time of the
corporate restructur[ing], no claims had been made and, save for limited exceptions, none were
in prospect; and (ii) subsequent to the investment, the claimant had invested massively, which
was regarded as a major factor indicating that BIT proceedings were not in prospect at the time
of the corporate restructur[ing]”.”° According to the Respondent, it was for these reasons that
the ConocoPhillips tribunal rejected the abuse of rights claim.”’ The Respondent also cites
Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia, in which the tribunal considered whether the events giving arise to

the dispute were “foreseeable” at the time of restructuring.”*

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s assertion that there must be foreseeability to a very high
standard of probability: according to the Respondent, the test applied in Pac Rim v. El Salvador
is not to be portrayed as if it were much more stringent than that in Tidewater v. Venezuela or
ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela.” Citing the Gremcitel Award as authority, the Respondent

asserts that all of these tests for foreseeability are analogous*”

and that they establish a
foreseeability standard that requires that a dispute must be “in reasonable contemplation of the
investor, or whether a claim is in prospect”.**! The rationale for this position is that all of these
tribunals “are seeking to preserve the integrity of the given treaty whilst at the same time
identifying and distinguishing the cases where corporate restructuring is aimed—quite

permissibly—at possible future disputes” .5°?

The Respondent further rejects the assertion by the Claimant that the investor “must have

known that a dispute was near-immediate”.8°

According to the Respondent, none of the
applicable case law has established such a test with regard to foreseeability.** Insofar as the
Claimant is referring to a need for proximity between the restructuring and the adoption of the

measure, the Respondent asserts that this is inconsistent with the foreseeability test established

by the relevant case law. The Respondent cites the decision in Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela
in which the tribunal found there to be an abuse of right notwithstanding the significant time lag

between the restructuring and the making of a claim.

 

The Respondent dismi the rel of Autopista Ce ionada de V lav. V le

and RosInvestCo vy. Russian Federation. In Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v.
Venezuela, the contract at issue had, according to the Respondent, expressly envisioned a
change to foreign ownership and access to ICSID arbitration. As a result, foreseeability was
neither argued, nor rejected.*” The Respondent also argues that there was no argument on, or
rejection of, a foreseeability analysis in RosInvestCo. v. Russian Federation. That case,
according to the Respondent, did not concern a corporate restructuring motivated in some way
by the wish to obtain treaty protection for an existing investment: it was argued that there was
no bona fide investment, and not that there was an abuse of rights under the offer to arbitrate. °°
The Respondent asserts that the critical date with respect to foreseeability is the date on which
the restructuring occurred. In support of this argument, the Respondent refers to the tribunal
decisions in Pac Rim v. El Salvador and ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela both of which “based
their assessment of what was foreseen/in prospect on the date of the corporate
restructur[ing]”.*” The decision in Tidewater v. Venezuela does not, in the Respondent’s view,
suggest otherwise. In that case “it was unarguably the date of the restructuring that was taken as
the critical date”! The Respondent therefore rejects the Claimant’s contention that
“foreseeability should be assessed as at the time of a non-binding decision to restructure, with

the Tribunal to shut its eyes to any evidence between such decision and the implementation of

it?s!

Finally, the Respondent asserts that Australian law is not inconsistent with the application of a
foreseeability-based standard in abuse of rights cases. While the Claimant places emphasis on
the decision in Esso v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation as stating that the passage of a tax

amendment Bill then under discussion was not “inevitable”, the Respondent contends that this

observation “is irrelevant in the current context”.'!? According to the Respondent, the decision
in Esso v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation turned on the authority of a different case, Meggitt
Overseas Ltd. v. Grdovic*'? which stated that Australian courts are bound to apply the
substantive law as it stands and that an Australian court “cannot deny [a claimant] that right [to
invoke the court’s jurisdiction] because of a reasonable expectation that at some future date the
law will be changed and that [the claimant’s rights] according to law will be changed”.§4
Moreover, the Respondent emphasises that the discussion in these cases “says nothing about
whether an international tribunal has jurisdiction over a pre-existing dispute or a specific future
dispute that was specifically foreseen by the claimant at the time of a corporate restructur[ing]

intended to manufacture jurisdiction over such disputes”.*!5

The Claimant’s Position

431.

432.

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s contention that abuse of rights can be established on
the basis of “knowledge of the existing or foreseeable dispute” at the time the restructuring took

place.*!®

The Claimant asserts that by focusing on the timing of the dispute, the Respondent
misses the “critical point” in establishing an abuse of rights: namely the key factor of
evidencing bad faith.*'’ To do otherwise would, in the terms used by the Claimant, “[omit] the
suggestion of excess inherent in the term ‘abuse’”.*'’ The Claimant points out that the tribunal
in Pac Rim v. El Salvador also “cautioned that this temporal test was not a ‘thin red line’ that
was decisive of the question of abuse”.’'? The Pac Rim tribunal noted the necessity to consider
other circumstances, such as “whether particular facts and circumstances of the corporate

restructuring provide evidence of ‘unacceptable manipulations’ or acts ‘in bad faith’” 6°

The Claimant disputes that the “foreseeability” test is appropriate as a protection against the use
of BIT protections in order to obtain an “unfair advantage” against the host State “even in cases

such as this where the respondent is given advance notice that the claimant intends to initiate

arbitration in the event the respondent adopts a particular measure”.*?! According to the
Claimant, “Respondent does not explain ‘this inequality of position’ or identify the ‘unfair
advantage’ to which it refers” .8??

The Claimant asserts that the Respondent has failed to take a firm and clear position on what it
means by “foreseeable” and instead “offers a parade of inconsistent and disconnected
concepts”.*3 The standards adopted by the Respondent range from “very high probability” to
“imminent”.** The Claimant takes issue with the Respondent’s assertion that the Claimant
would have abused its right to gain BIT protection “where the dispute had crystallized, or was
reasonably foreseeable, as at the date of the investment”, arguing that “crystallized” and
“reasonably foreseeable” are two very different standards and only the former would imply that

there is a ripe legal claim.*?>

The Claimant suggests that the reason for the inconsistency in the Respondent’s approach is that
“there is no coherent—much less settled—principle of international law underlying
Respondent’s objection”.*”° The Claimant restates its contention that “no tribunal has dismissed
a claim based on foreseeability, and no consistent doctrine of foreseeability has emerged from
the case law, as each case has articulated a different standard”.*?? The Claimant asserts that there
cannot be a doctrine of abuse of rights based on the restructuring of an investment at a time
when a dispute is “foreseeable” since such a test would be “highly subjective and difficult to
administer”, leading to the result that host States would “scour the historical and administrative
record for any State conduct... for evidence that could conceivably be viewed as telegraphing
an intention to adopt the subsequent measure”.** In any event, according to the Claimant, it is

difficult to ascertain “how foreseeable a dispute must be”.*? The Claimant concludes that “the

entire concept of foreseeability as a standard of abuse is ultimately unworkable’”*”? and in any

event does not justify the finding of bad faith.**!

In order to come close to establishing bad faith, the standard of the foreseeability criterion, if
applied at all, must be set at “a very high probability and not merely contemplated at the time
the restructuring in question took place”.8*? The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s assertion
that the standard of foreseeability is “nothing more than that a dispute must be ‘in reasonable
contemplation of the investor, or whether a claim is in prospect’”.6 According to the Claimant,
the Respondent derives this standard from a misinterpretation of the Gremcitel Award.** The
Claimant submits that the correct interpretation of Gremcitel v. Peru is that the tribunal “found
that the Pac Rim v. El Savador standard was analogous to a standard that assessed whether there
was a ‘reasonable prospect’ that the challenged measure was ‘imminent’ or to a standard that
assessed whether a dispute was ‘highly probable’”.**° The Claimant insists that the Gremcitel
tribunal did not state that the Pac Rim v. El Salvador standard is met when a dispute is “merely
in prospect”.8°°

The Claimant submits that in light of the difficulties with the foreseeability standard, some
tribunals have “simply refused to engage in a discussion of whether a dispute was foreseeable at

$9837

the time a restructuring occurred”’*”’ citing, in support of this assertion, the findings in Autopista

Concesionada de Venezuela v. Venezuela and ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela.5**

In the Claimant’s view, in none of the cases heavily relied upon by the Respondent did the
tribunal employ a “reasonable foreseeability” test, as the Respondent advocates in the present
arbitration.’ In Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic and ST-AD v. Bulgaria, the tribunals found
that “the claimants had established artificial structures that served no purpose other than to

create jurisdiction over existing domestic disputes for damages that had already been

incurred”.*“° Rather than applying a foreseeability test, the Phoenix Action tribunal instead
applied the principle that assigning pre-existing claims to a foreign entity cannot lead to BIT
protection for a domestic entity that is not entitled to such protection.*!! The tribunal found an
abuse of the investment treaty system on the ground that “what was really at stake were indeed
the pre-investment violations and damages”.*?

The tribunals in both Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela and ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, the
Claimant emphasises, focused on determining “whether the claimant was improperly seeking to
assert legal claims based on conduct that occurred or situations that ceased to exist before the
restructuring was complete”.*? In Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela, the Claimant notes, the
tribunal focused on “the date on which that process culminated in Venezuela’s adoption of the
nationalisation measures that forced such migration and stripped Mobil of the value of its
investments”.*4 The Claimant therefore stresses that the Mobil Corporation tribunal did not
adopt a foreseeability test at all. As regards ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, the Claimant
submits that the tribunal followed the Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela approach and stressed
“the date on which the claim or cause of action accrued, not when it became ‘foreseeable’”.*“°
To the extent that the tribunal in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela did consider foreseeability, it
applied a very high standard. According to the Claimant “[t]he ConocoPhillips tribunal found
that a dispute under the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT was not foreseeable, even though one of the
Dutch claimants (the shell company) was inserted into the chain of ownership after the
enactment of two challenged tax measures (but before one of those measures took effect)”.
The Claimant stresses that “[c]learly, those measures were entirely foreseeable when the
claimants inserted [ConocoPhillips] into the ownership structure, [b]ut the ConocoPhillips
tribunal did not consider that fact to be relevant”.**

According to the Claimant, the tribunals in both Pac Rim v. El Salvador and Tidewater v.

Venezuela found no abuse of rights even with “substantial evidence that the particular dispute at

issue was (or should have been) within the reasonable contemplation of the investor prior to the
restructuring”.“? To the extent that the Pac Rim and Tidewater tribunals did consider
foreseeability, the Claimant asserts that both tribunals asserted a very high standard of
foreseeability. The Claimant cites the Pac Rim tribunal as stating that “because even at th[e]
time [of restructuring] there still seemed to be a reasonable possibility, as understood by the
Claimant” to stop the challenged measure, the dispute was not foreseeable to “a very high
probability” and the claimant did not “act[] in bad faith”.°° According to the Claimant, the
Tidewater tribunal “found that a dispute under the Barbados-Venezuela BIT was not foreseeable
even though Venezuela issued a threat to the claimants’ industry just two days before they
inserted a Barbados shell company into their chain of ownership, and Venezuela expropriated
the claimant’s investment two months later”.*°!

The Claimant maintains the relevance of the tribunal’s decision in RosInvestCo v. Russian
Federation. According to the Claimant, in RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation, the host State
objected that “a [t]ransaction[] undertaken for litigation purposes without economic activity
[was] an abuse of the investment treaty system”.*? The claimant in Ros/nvestCo v. Russian
Federation asserted that Russia had “not demonstrated that making an investment in order to
bring a treaty claim... would be illegitimate or in violation of the principle of good faith”.*°?
According to the Claimant, the Ros/nvestCo tribunal “quickly dismissed this objection without
finding any need to delve into questions of foreseeability”.“* The Claimant disputes the
Respondents contention that RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation is not relevant on the basis that
the tribunal was concerned only with identifying whether there was a bona fide investment and
not with whether there was abuse of rights.*°*° According to the Claimant, since the abuse of
rights doctrine is based on the principle of good faith, “the core question for an abuse of rights
objections is always whether there was a ‘bona fide’ investment”.**° Consequently, Ros/nvestCo

v. Russian Federation cannot be distinguished on this basis.

(c) The “Motivation” Criterion

The Respondent's Position

441.

442.

443.

363

The Respondent “accepts that it is a perfectly legitimate goal, and no abuse of an investment
protection treaty regime, for an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future
disputes with a host [S]tate”.**7 The Respondent insists, however, that where the motivation for
a corporate restructuring is to bring a specific preconceived BIT claim, this will be an abuse of
right.8°*

In support of this assertion, the Respondent refers to the decision in Pac Rim v. El Salvador
where the tribunal referred to the foreseeability of a “specific future dispute”.*° Likewise, the
tribunal in Tidewater v. Venezuela referred to the foreseeability of “the present dispute”.* In
Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela wherein the tribunal found that “[w]ith respect to pre-existing
disputes,... the tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain
jurisdiction under a BIT for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix
Action tribunal, ‘an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection
under the ICSID Convention and the BITs’”.*°'! The Respondent distinguishes the case of
ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela in this regard since, in that case, the tribunal found that the
restructuring took place before any claims were in prospect. This finding was supported by the
significant value of the investment that was made—a factor that the tribunal considered to be
inconsistent with the proposition that the claimant foresaw or was motivated by an imminent

nationalisation of its investment.*

The Respondent explains that “where there is a corporate restructur[ing] in the knowledge of an
actual or specific future dispute, and a preconceived BIT claim is then brought, there is no
longer an equality of position between the investor and the host State, and the investor benefits
from an unfair advantage [since] the investor invests knowing that it is about to/ready to bring a

claim [whilst] [t]he host State admits the investment, in ignorance of the investor’s intent”.8

The Respondent cites the tribunal in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela which stated that “[t]here is
jurisdiction only if the parties to the dispute have each consented and throughout the process
each is treated on an equal footing, as indeed the principles of due process and natural justice
require”.*“t The Respondent therefore stresses that “it is not the corporate restructur[ing] per se
that is abusive” but rather that where there is a specific pre-determined dispute in mind, the

abuse will arise “where the claimant has benefited from this inequality of position”. °°

The Claimant asserts that restructuring to secure BIT protection does not amount to bad faith,
even if the claimant could reasonably foresee a potential future dispute with the host State at the
time.*® The Claimant cites the tribunal in Tidewater v. Venezuela as stating that, “it is a
perfectly legitimate goal, and no abuse of an investment protection regime, for an investor to
seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host [S]tate”.*” Similarly,
the tribunal in Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia observed that, “it is not uncommon in practice, and—
absent a particular limitation—not illegal to locate one’s operations in a jurisdiction perceived
to provide a beneficial regulatory and legal environment”.** The Claimant refers to the
Respondent’s submissions during the Hearing on Bifurcation that, “it is legitimate for a
corporate group in good faith to make its investment into a country or restructuring an existing
investment in a country in order to provide for BIT protection for that investment as regards
future disputes”. *°

The Claimant submits further that the findings of the tribunals in Mobil Corporation v.
Venezuela and ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, support its position: in both cases the tribunals
found that even if the sole or predominant motivation for the restructuring is to gain access to
investor-State arbitration that does not constitute an abuse of right.” In Mobil Corporation v.
Venezuela the tribunal found that it had jurisdiction notwithstanding the observation that the
“main, if not the sole purpose of the restructuring [at issue in that case] was to protect” Mobil’s

pre-existing investment in Venezuela in light of potential adverse actions by the Venezuelan

government before the restructuring occurred.'"! In ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, the tribunal
“flatly rejected Venezuela’s argument of treaty abuse despite the fact that... ‘the only business
purpose of the restructuring... was to be able to have access to ICSID proceedings’”.§” The
Claimant thus concludes that “restructuring an investment to preserve or augment BIT

protection is legitimate, prudent, and fulfils a primary objective of the BIT”.8”

a Claim

The Respondent's Position

877

According to the Respondent, by the end of April 2010, a dispute had crystallised between the
PMI Group and Australia, and that dispute is in substance the same dispute underpinning this
arbitration.’ The “three legal strands” of the dispute—according to the Respondent, Australia’s
obligations under the Australian Constitution, intellectual property or like treaties, and
international investment treaties—were “foreshadowed by the PM[I] [G]roup in its responses to
the various NPHT reports and consistently articulated after the Government’s announcement of

the measure” 8”

According to the Respondent, there were three events that were critical to the formation of the
dispute: the first was the 29 April 2010 announcement of the Government’s decision to
introduce plain packaging “which signalled the Government’s commitment at the highest level
to introduce the measure”; the second and third were PML’s statements to the press and Senate
Committee submission of 30 April 2010 “in which the PM[I] [G]roup publicly reiterated its
opposition to plain packaging on the basis of the tree legal strands”. 8”

The Respondent reiterates that “[t]he dispute was never about the legality of the Government’s
announcement or proposal as such. It was about the legality of the implementation of plain

packaging pursuant to the Government’s announced decision”.*” The Respondent also stresses

that “[t]he Parties’ conflicting positions were unwavering” such that they cannot be described as

merely a “policy debate about a potential act”.8”*

By 3 September 2010, and no later than January-February 2011, “the PM[I] [G]roup had a
crystallised intention to bring a claim against Australia under the BIT in respect of plain
packaging if and when the Government’s decision to introduce the measure was
implemented”.§”? The Respondent strongly disputes the Claimant’s assertion that it did not
decide to bring a claim until June 2011 when it “came to believe that the enactment of the plain
packaging legislation became likely”. **° The Respondent emphasises various pieces of evidence

to support its position:

a. According to the Respondent, the Revised Privilege Log (“RPL”) entries leading up
to early September 2010 “record extensive preparations for BIT litigation that cannot
credibly be explained away as simply a ‘prudent’ review of ‘various legal

scenarios’”.*!

b. The Respondent also points to “38 communications” circulated by the end of April

2010 by the PMI Group and its lawyers that “involved consideration of investment

treaty protections for the Australian subsidiaries... PF

HH The Respondent then points to “68 communications” that were circulated

between 1 May 2010 to 2 September 2010 of which “8 were communications between

arbitration concerning plain packaging in Australia.“ In one particular e-mail dated
29 July 2010 from PMI to an investor relations firm, the Respondent points out that a
PMI representative stated that “[w]e... believe that a plain packaging measure would
violate... international trade agreements” and “we are ready to take all steps we deem
necessary to obtain the protection and relief to which the company is entitled”. The
Respondent also points out that the same PMI representative stated that the Plain
Packaging Act would cause Australia to violate its obligations under “certain
international trade treaties and other various investment treaties... [giving] rise to

actions both by States and private investors in Australia”. **5

d. The Respondent refers to PML’s August 2010 OB/LRP, which sets out, as part of a
“Plain Packaging Strategy”, the following components: “Litigate if the Bill is enacted”
and “Litigation readiness”. The Respondent asserts that litigation must have referred
to investment arbitration when viewed in the context of PML public statements and

internal documents before August 2010.5*°

when plain packaging was introduced, and a belief as to the precise prospects that plain
packaging would be introduced, are entirely separate mindsets”.*” In any event, the Respondent

insists that the introduction of plain packaging was of “significant likelihood” by September

2010 and “highly probable” by January or February 2011, “and the PM[I] [G]roup took no

different view”.

The Respondent refers to the PMI Group’s public statements and internal
documents as evidence of its understanding that the Government was determined to introduce

the measure.**

The Respondent acknowledges that PMI’s Annual Report for 2010, dated March 2011, states
that “it is impossible to predict the outcome of... the legislation slated for introduction in 2011”.
However, this passage, according to the Respondent, “does not say anything about PMI’s
already crystallised intention to sue in the event that the legislation passed” .** The Respondent
insists that Mr. Pellegrini has conceded that the PMI Group had a crystallised intention to sue
Australia under the Treaty as at 23 February 2011, citing Mr. Pellegrini’s oral testimony
wherein he agreed that he approved the acquisition on 23 February 2011 for the purpose,
amongst others, of placing PM Asia “in a position where it could sue Australia and would sue

Australia if the legislation passed”.8°*

The Respondent asserts that, even if the Tribunal were to consider that the relevant intention to
bring a claim had not crystallised by early September 2010, the evidence provided by the
Respondent “in any event establish[es] the requisite degree of foreseeability which is all that

Australia needs to ground its abuse of right claim’.**°

The Claimant insists that the Respondent has been unable to demonstrate that the Claimant had
the intention to sue the Respondent under the BIT “either in September 2010 or January
2011”. According to the Claimant, “(t]he earliest time when it can be said that a dispute was
foreseeable as a very high probability is late May/June 2011 [when] Claimant came seriously to
believe that the legislation might pass, prompting consideration of whether to bring a claim in
that eventuality”.*°’ The Claimant insists that the Respondent’s logic is flawed: “according to
Respondent's logic, a dispute would have existed even if Prime Minister Rudd had never made

an announcement, because a dispute existed as soon as PML expressed opposition to the

Fielding Bill, which according to the Government did not even represent Government
Policy”.*°8 The Claimant emphasises that a legal dispute cannot arise simply because someone
expressed a view about the “legality and efficacy” of plain packaging, and that “plain
packaging” itself is not a legal measure that can give rise to a legal dispute.”

The Claimant asserts that the Respondent has failed to describe in “any consistent way the
dispute that allegedly crystallized in April 2010”.°%° According to the Claimant, the
Respondent's briefs “conflate two events that are legally distinct: the inchoate policy debate that
the Prime Minister’s announcement spurred in April 2010 and the legal dispute that crystallized
when Parliament enacted plain packaging legislation in 2011 and Claimant initiated the

arbitration”.°"!

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s interpretation of the communications it had with
lawyers. According to the Claimant, “what the RPL shows is simply that PMI lawyers reviewed
legal options, as they had been doing for years before the announcement”. According to the
Claimant, “since BIT considerations played a role in the transfer decision... it is only natural
that PMI’s lawyers looked at the BIT in that context”. The Claimant notes that, “more than
80% of the documents on the RPL are e-mails that do not represent a large number of separate
conversations”.°™* Moreover, the Respondent distorts the figures that it asserts: many of the
communications that the Respondent lists are in fact communications that belong to a longer e-
mail chain. The Claimant submits that no conclusions can be drawn simply from numbers of

e-mails sent at the time.°

The Claimant points to the testimony of Mr. Pellegrini who disagreed that, by August 2010, the
necessary “BIT intention” had been formed.” According to the Claimant, Mr. Pellegrini “was

not even aware of the BIT in August 2010, so Claimant could not have had a BIT intention at

that time”.°°* The Claimant strongly disputes the Respondent’s assertion that the August 2010
OB/LRP was that “the plain packaging legislation would be defeated” and that this evidences an
intention to defeat the legislation through investment treaty arbitration. The correct
understanding of the OB/LRP was made clear in Mr. Pellegrini’s oral testimony, wherein he
stated that “PML assumed in August 2010 that the plain packaging legislation would not pass
Parliament, in part because merely highlighting the threat of litigation domestically and in [the]
WTO would convince part of the Parliament that it was not worthwhile to proceed with the
measure”.”!° The Claimant highlights Mr. Pellegrini’s statement that “at the time, I was honestly
convinced that plain packaging wouldn’t happen”.”!!

The Claimant also disputes the assertion made by the Respondent that the reference in the
August 2010/LRP to “litigation readiness” must have meant that the Claimant had already
decided to initiate arbitration. Referring to Mr. Pellegrini’s testimony, the Claimant notes that,
“what we were discussing here was the domestic litigation”.°'* The Claimant submits that the
Respondent is asking the Tribunal to find that the August 2010 OB/LRP establishes the
Claimant’s intention that “the plain packaging legislation would be defeated in arbitration
under the BIT rather than through the Parliamentary process”.’'? In any event, the Claimant
points out, the OB/LRP establishes PML’s three-year business plan, and “nothing in the 2010
OB/LRP’s financial projections or brand plans reflected the need to change the packaging or
marketing of PML’s products because of plain packaging”.?!*

The Claimant asserts that the dispute was not foreseeable at the time of restructuring in June
2011. According to the Claimant, “numerous documents on the record show that neither
Claimant nor Respondent had determined that the enactment of plain packaging was even
likely, much less a very high probability, until months after the restructuring”.”!* The Claimant

refers in this regard PY and the Transcript of Meet the Press interview with

Minister for Health Nicola Roxon.°!* The Claimant also points to a Parliamentary briefing book

that stated that “[i]t is difficult to determine the likely fate of the plain packaging proposal given
that the position of the [Opposition] Coalition and the independent members is unknown”.?!”
Moreover, PMI’s 2010 Annual Report, released in March 2011 noted that “[i]t is not possible to
predict the outcome of the [plain packaging] Bill or the legislation slated for introduction in
2011”.°'8 According to the Claimant, “[t]o accept Respondent’s assertion that the plain
packaging legislation was foreseeable as a very high probability, the Tribunal would have to
disregard both Mr. Pellegrini’s testimony and the Government’s admission that there was still a
“big fight” over the plain packaging well into 2011, after restructuring took place”. In sum, the
Claimant asserts that until June 2011, “neither enactment of the legislation nor the dispute was
foreseeable as a very high probability” and “the dispute did not crystallize until the legislation

was passed and Claimant commenced this arbitration”.”!°

claim], where none otherwise existed, was a, or the, true reason for the restructur[ing]”.°”” The
Respondent refers to Mr. Pellegrini’s oral testimony in which he agreed that he approved the
restructur[ing] for reasons including that the transaction would grant “BIT protection to enable
[PM Asia] to sue Australia if the measure passed into law”.°?! The Respondent asserts that this
was the “driving motivation” behind the restructuring” as evidenced by the nature and volume
of RPL entries from May 2010 onwards.°”’ Further evidence can, according to the Respondent,
be found in the “pattern of e-mails linking consideration of the restructur[ing]... with plain
packaging and/or investment treaty protection”.°** The Respondent also considers the “absence
of communications about any other reason for the restructur[ing]” to be indicative of the

motivation behind the restructuring.°?°

The Respondent highlights that “PM Asia no longer seriously contests that obtaining BIT
protection for the Australian subsidiaries in respect of future plain packaging legislation was a
reason for the restructur[ing]”,””° but points out that the Claimant “significantly understated the
importance [of] the PM[I] [G]roup’s decision to restructure [in order to gain] BIT protection in
respect of plain packaging”.°””

The Respondent insists that the foreseeability of a claim, the intention to bring that claim and
the need for a “vehicle” to achieve that claim are the “only” explanations for “the interposition
of PM Asia between the Australian subsidiaries and PM Brands Sarl, or later PM Holland”.°*
According to the Respondent, “[e]ach of the purported business rationales for the
restructur[ing], other than the BIT strategy, is inconsistent with (i) the contemporaneous
documents (such as they are), (ii) the detailed and uncontradicted economic analysis of
Professor Lys, and (iii) the oral testimony of Mr. Pellegrini”.°?? The Respondent purports to

rebut each of the explanations given by the Claimant for the restructuring:

a. The Respondent disputes that the restructur[ing] was undertaken solely in order to
“streamline” entities into two chains.” The Respondent refers to Mr. Pellegrini’s
testimony that the restructuring had “no relationship with that ‘streamlining’
rationale”.°*' The Respondent also refers to Professor Lys’s analysis which found that
“the explanation of the restructur[ing] lacked coherent purpose in light of the various

logical and factual deficiencies that he identified”.??

b. With respect to the Claimant’s “tax rationale”, the Respondent asserts that this is “not
corroborated anywhere in the evidence, and establishes no reason for interposing PM
Asia between PM Holland Holdings and PM Australia”.°*? The Respondent asserts
that complex tax matters need to be proven by calling “persons from PMI who

supposedly designed the restructur[ing] with this aim”.°**

The Respondent disputes that the restructur[ing] was undertaken for “revenue” or
“cash flow” purposes.” This, according to Professor Lys, is “a nonsensical and
unpersuasive justification” and would more easily have been achieved through an
alternative restructuring that placed “PM Australia directly under PM Holland”.*°
The Respondent asserts that Mr. Pellegrini “knew nothing about this alleged revenue
purpose”.**” As further evidence against the “revenue” purpose, the Respondent points
to the “substantial delays between the purported decision to restructure and the
various steps to implement [the restructuring]”.*** Finally, the Respondent contends
that, if the motivation for restructuring was truly one of revenue, “there were other
more obvious targets amongst the top earning Asian affiliates” but that none of these
affiliates were considered for the restructur[ing] and that “none [had] the nationality to
bring the present claim”. °°

The Claimant’s contention that the restructur[ing] was part of a broader regional
strategy to “align management control of affiliates with legal ownership” is
inconsistent with Mr. Pellegrini’s oral testimony and is unsupported by any
documentary evidence other than documents prepared when this arbitration was in
contemplation or ongoing.” The Respondent points to Professor Lys’s second report
as stating that this “alignment had no business justification whatsoever”.”4! The
Respondent concludes that the Claimant has failed to explain “why ownership of the
Asia affiliates remains to this day ‘spread all over the place’... and why ‘alignment’
was necessary or beneficial when there was a regional structure and business
relationship with the Australian affiliates that Mr. Pellegrini agreed was ‘functioning
perfectly well’”.°”? The Respondent further disputes the Claimant’s assertion that the
Claimant was the “most logical” candidate for the restructuring since this is, according

to the Respondent, not borne out by the evidence.

e. Finally, the Respondent disputes any other asserted rationales for the restructur[ing].
Thus, the assertion that the restructur[ing] enabled PM Australia’s dividends to fund
the everyday operations of PM Asia is, according to the Respondent, “a fiction”. This
is because PM Asia passed on the entirety of the Australian dividends to PM Holland
Holdings.“ Similarly, the assertion that the restructuring was part of a decade-long
group-wide restructuring of legal entities is “nonsense”. The Respondent points to a

lack of evidence to support this assertion.“

The Respondent argues that “[nJeither of the factual witnesses called by PM Asia in this
proceeding can speak directly to the PM[I] [G]roup’s (i) decision to conduct the restructur[ing];
(ii) development of the BIT intention; or (iii) issuing of instructions to lodge the Foreign
Investment Application”. This, according to the Respondent, includes Mr. Pellegrini, who
could “recall almost nothing surrounding the lodgement of PM Asia’s NoC”.” The Respondent
asserts that “[t]he failure to call the actual decision-makers leads to adverse inferences against

PM Asia concerning the purpose of the restructur[ing]”.°*

The Respondent notes that there are evidentiary gaps in the Claimant’s case: “where were the

five individuals who purportedly approved the restructur[ing] decision; [w]here were the ‘senior

 

management’ in PMI above Mr. Pellegrini who were clearly the real decision-makers regarding
litigation against Australia under the BIT; [w]here were the people who instructed the lawyers
charged with undertaking the extensive legal work documented in the RPL; [w]here were the
people who gave instructions to lodge the Foreign Investment Application?” The Respondent
further asserts that the Claimant has failed to produce adequate documents that could rebut the
core elements of the Respondent’s factual case, pointing to one non-privileged document
concerning the decision to restructure; no documents concerning the decision to seek FIRB
approval and proceed with the restructur[ing]; and one document contemporaneous with the
restructuring.°* The Respondent contends that, if all of the documents relating to the Claimant’s

case are subject to legal professional privilege, “the inference arising from the RPL... is

overwhelming: there was no commercial reason for the restructur[ing] separate from litigation

strategy” >!

The Respondent emphasises that the Tribunal “cannot safely rely on Mr. Pellegrini’s evidence
to draw the conclusions that PM Asia seeks” on the basis that Mr. Pellegrini “was not a witness
who could speak to any of the relevant issues in anything but vague terms based on second or
third-hand conversations”.°> Moreover, “there are inconsistencies in Mr. Pellegrini’s
testimony... which has driven PM Asia to use it very selectively in its [Post-Hearing Brief]”.°
The Respondent asserts that, at best, Mr. Pellegrini’s testimony establishes that “a decision to
initiate proceedings was not made until June 2011”.°* According to the Respondent, this says
nothing about “whether the PM/I] [G]roup had formed an intention at the time of the decision
to restructure or the Foreign Investment Application to bring a claim if and when the plain

packaging measure was enacted” °*

The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that “the primary motivation underlying the restructuring of the
Australian subsidiaries was unrelated to the BIT”.°*° According to the Claimant “[t]he transfer
of the Australian subsidiaries to Claimant took place in the context of a restructuring of the PMI
Group that has been in progress since 2005”.°’ The restructuring was driven by many factors,
“the most important of which was the broad, company-wide reorganization”,”™* the purpose of
which was to “‘refine’, ‘rationalise’ and ‘streamline’ PMI’s corporate structure”.°* According
to the Claimant, placing the Australian subsidiaries under PM Asia “provided added benefits,
including aligning ownership with Claimant’s pre-existing management control of the

subsidiaries and optimizing Claimant’s cash flow”. Moreover, the Claimant was “the most

logical candidate to serve as the immediate parent company for the Australian subsidiaries

within the ownership chain under PM Holland”.**!

According to the Claimant, the “overall objectives of PMI’s restructuring were to minimize tax

liability, align ownership with control, and optimize cash flows”.°” There were also “additional

benefits”, such as alignment of the ownership of the Australian subsidiaries with Claimant’s

pre-existing management control of the subsidiaries, optimization of the Claimant’s cash flow,
>> 963

as well as “additional BIT protection[s]”."* These are discussed in further detail in the

following:

a. A key motivation behind the restructuring was, according to the Claimant, that
“restructuring aligned the ownership and management control of many PMI
affiliates”. The Claimant refers to documents from 2004 that evidence that
“centralized ownership will facilitate [its] overall objectives”.° According to Mr.
Pellegrini, “there was an advantage in clarity” and “a better, leaner, clearer structure”
that would be achieved through the restructuring. This, in the view of the Claimant,
was “an entirely legitimate objective that was unrelated to the BIT and this
arbitration”.°°°

b. Another motivation behind the restructuring was, according to the Claimant, that
“PMI sought to minimize its tax liability”.°°’ Thus in 2010, PMI decided to transfer
the Australian subsidiaries to the ownership chain under PM Holland to secure a tax

advantage relating to the payment of intercompany debt.°*

c. The Claimant also asserts that the “group-wide restructuring has optimized the cash
flows of many PMI affiliates” and refers to Mr. Pellegrini’s testimony wherein he

stated that the restructuring would be advantageous for PMI’s regional headquarters to

receive “substantial, consistent cashflow... to fund everyday operations as well as less

flow could be used “for example, to fund potential strategic acquisitions” and would
have provided “greater financial flexibility in the event an acquisition opportunity
arose”.°”” The Claimant reiterates Mr. Pellegrini’s comment in oral testimony that
“you have to look at it prospectively” because “how Claimant used the dividends
‘would depend on the amounts’ of dividends as well as the future needs of the
company”.”7!

d. The Claimant acknowledges that an “additional” reason behind the restructuring was
“to gain an additional layer of protection under the BIT”.”” This, however, does not
mean that the restructuring decision was made in order to sue the Respondent under

According to the Claimant, Mr. Pellegrini “is uniquely positioned to give evidence on why PM
Asia added ownership to its longstanding control of the Australian subsidiaries [since] his
approval was necessary for the transfer to proceed, and, therefore his understanding of the
various objectives he described in his testimony is highly probative of the internal decision-
making process”.°”> The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s “inflammatory” assertions that it
lacks sufficient evidence. The Claimant points out that the Respondent’s document requests did
not cover the period leading up to the Written Notification of Claim, which indicates a
deliberate attempt to avoid evidence that would be contrary to the Respondent’s attempt to
undermine the FATA notification.°” In sum, “[since], as Mr. Pellegrini explained, the intention
to bring a claim and the decision to litigate were formed well after February 2011, the RPL does

not refer to documents relating to that decision”.°”” As Mr. Pellegrini testified, he “did not come

to believe plain packaging would pass until after the Opposition announced its support of the

Bill in May 2011”.°*

WHETHER THE PARTIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR BURDEN OF PROOF WITH RESPECT TO
THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

The Parties disagree as to whether each of them has discharged the burden of proof with respect

to the preliminary objections under consideration.

The Respondent explains that each Party carries the burden of proving the facts relied on to
support its claim or defence. Relying on the decisions of international tribunals, the Respondent
argues that once a party has adduced sufficient or prima facie evidence in support of its
assertion, the evidential burden shifts to the other party to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut
it.” In this regard, the Respondent distinguishes legal burden of proof (which never shifts)
from evidential burden of proof (which can shift from one party to another, depending upon the

state of the evidence).°*°

The Respondent submits that the Claimant not only failed to rebut Respondent’s prima facie
case in respect of its preliminary objections but also failed to acknowledge that the burden shifts
when Australia adduces sufficient prima facie evidence in support of its preliminary
objections.°*! The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s proposition that Respondent’s case is

characterised by “hypothetical scenarios based on counterfactuals”.°*?

Following the reasoning in Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan, the Respondent observes that when a
party is unable to provide direct proof due to the evidence being in the primary control of the
other party, the tribunal may draw inferences from a failure of the other party to adduce the

983

evidence.”*’ The Respondent rejects the relevance of Ambiente v. Argentina, explaining that it is

not in a similar position as Argentina in that case because the preliminary objections raised by

Australia involve factual matters for which Australia has adduced prima facie evidence in spite

of the Claimant having primary control over the evidence.*™

The Claimant, on the other hand, submits that it has met its burden of proving all the facts that
establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction: that the Claimant is a Hong Kong investor under Article
1(f) of the Treaty; that it owns or controls investments in Australia under Article 1(e) of the
Treaty; and that a dispute existed between the Claimant and the Respondent when the Claimant

submitted its claim to arbitration.°**

Relying on the tribunal’s reasoning in Pac Rim v. El Salvador, the Claimant submits that the
Respondent bears the burden to prove its jurisdictional objections.°** However, the Claimant
argues that the Respondent has failed, or has not even attempted, to do so. Comparing the
Respondent in the present dispute to that in Ambiente v. Argentina, the Claimant asserts that the
Respondent must provide evidence to prove its jurisdictional objections and it cannot prevail
merely by questioning the evidence the Claimant has presented. In this regard, the Claimant
states that the Respondent “only raises questions about the Claimant’s evidence and poses
hypothetical scenarios based on counterfactuals, but fails to prove its objections with

evidence”.**”

The Parties present specific arguments in respect of each preliminary objection.

While the Respondent points out that the Claimant has not adduced sufficient evidence to rebut

the Non-admission of Investment Objection. The Respondent emphasizes that, when having

regard to Australian law, the Tribunal should apply a “balance of probabilities” standard of

proof because this arbitration is similar to civil judicial review proceedings, and not to criminal

proceedings.°**

In this context, the Respondent denies the Claimant’s suggestion that, in order to succeed on the
Non-Admission of Investment Objection, Australia must establish that the Claimant has
committed criminal offences under section 26(2) of the FATA and section 136.1 of Australia’s
Criminal Code. The Respondent explains that it has referred to the Criminal Code only to
emphasise the existence of an obligation on investors to deal with the host State in a manner

which is not false or misleading.°*

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has not proven its objection to the Claimant’s

Respondent puts before the Tribunal.°”

The Claimant characterises as hypothetical the following questions raised in the Respondent’s
pleadings: (1) what the Claimant should have disclosed to the Treasury had it already decided to
sue Respondent under the Treaty at the time of the Foreign Investment Application, even though
the Claimant had made no such decision at the time; (2) what the Treasury might have done if
the Foreign Investment Application stated that transferring ownership of the Australian
subsidiaries to the Claimant would provide an additional basis of jurisdiction under the Treaty;
(3) whether the Foreign Investment Application was false or misleading under Section 136.1 of
the Criminal Code, even though the Respondent now asserts that it is not alleging that the
Claimant violated the Criminal Code;*! (4) whether the Treasury would have invalidated its
No-objection Letter if it had been given the opportunity to revisit the matter; and (5) whether

the investment was not properly admitted despite the provision of section 38 of the FATA.”

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the standard of proof is a matter of public international
law and not Australian law. The Respondent bears the burden of proof when it accuses the
Claimant of illegalities in the making of an investment. The Claimant explains that, although the
present proceeding is not a criminal one, the Respondent should prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt, as it is relying on breaches of Australia’s Criminal Code.°”?

2. Burden to Prove the Ratione Temporis Objection and an Abuse of Right

The Respondent's Position

481.

482.

483.

994

The Respondent submits that it has discharged its burden of proving, on a balance of
probabilities, the facts supporting its ratione temporis objection and its abuse of rights
argument, while the Claimant has adduced insufficient evidence to rebut the Respondent’s

evidence.

Supporting its abuse of right argument with reference to Mr. Pellegrini’s evidence, documents
recorded in the RPL and internal documents of the PMI Group, the Respondent submits that it
has established that the restructuring was prima facie abusive. In particular, the Respondent
points out that the evidence of Professor Lys, which shows that there was no reason to believe
that the restructuring was undertaken for a business purpose or economic rationale,’ has not
been challenged by the Claimant. The evidential burden therefore shifts to the Claimant, which
has failed to justify the restructuring of its subsidiaries: the Claimant’s witnesses were not
directly involved in the restructuring; and Mr. Pellegrini, who was “at the margins of key

decisions”, has stated that the decision to restructure was “not particularly meaningful”.°”°

In relation to the standard of proof, the Respondent submits that the Claimant, referring to the
ruling in Chevron v. Ecuador (I), seeks to set an unduly high standard for an abuse of right. The
Respondent argues that it does not need to prove bad faith, or presume good faith. Following the
reasoning in Pac Rim vy. El Salvador, the Respondent points out that to impose any higher
evidentiary threshold in the context of a corporate restructuring would fail to take account of the

fact that the party that controls the corporate structure is also in control of the evidence that is

threshold on the Respondent.

486.

996

997

999

The Claimant contends that the present dispute came into existence when the arbitration began
and therefore the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis. The Claimant states that the
Respondent has failed to adduce persuasive evidence to prove the contrary. Instead, the
Claimant argues that the Respondent asks the Tribunal to make assumptions—that the Claimant
intended in April 2010 to challenge Prime Minister Rudd’s announcement, and that the

Claimant knew, at that time, that the Respondent would adopt Plain Packaging Measures.””

With regard to the abuse of rights argument, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has
failed to meet the required “high threshold”, which encompasses a showing of bad faith, and
cautions the Tribunal not to compare it to claimants in other cases put forth by the Respondent.
Unlike in those cases, the Claimant argues that, in the present arbitration proceeding, there are
no indicia of bad faith because the Claimant invested transparently in the host State; had
exercised management control of the Australian subsidiaries for a decade before the transfer
took place; did not engage in fraud; and did not “internationalise” a domestic dispute as stated

by the Respondent.”

In response to the Respondent’s allegation that its abuse of right argument focuses on the timing
of the restructuring, the Claimant submits that timing only is insufficient to prove an abuse of
right. The Claimant further argues that the Respondent has failed to prove that the dispute was
foreseeable at a “very high probability” and was not “merely a possibility” when the
restructuring decision was made. It is not sufficient for the Respondent to create a reasonable
doubt regarding the reasons for the restructuring, as (in the Claimant’s view) Counsel for the

Respondent attempted to do at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections.°”

The Claimant therefore submits that the Respondent failed to meet the “high threshold” to rebut
the presumption of good faith to which the Claimant is entitled, and the evidentiary burden

consequently does not shift to the Claimant.!°°

1003

1004

The Respondent points out that the Claimant has failed to adduce sufficient evidence that it

exercised control over its Australian subsidiaries since 2001.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s assertion of control is a “distracting fiction” and
should be rejected by the Tribunal because it is inconsistent with the Notice of Arbitration and
the Foreign Investment Application, in which the Claimant stated “nil” where it was required to
specify shares or interests in shares in which it already held an interest.'°"' In distinguishing the
ruling in SD Myers v. Canada from the present arbitration proceeding, the Respondent further
explains that the Claimant has not exercised “control” because it has not “provided a single

dollar for the operation of the Australian subsidiaries”!

The Respondent also rebuts the Claimant’s argument of “delegated control” and explains that
this criterion is not sufficient to establish control for the purposes of Article 1(e) of the Treaty.
A company exercising delegated control is not protected when the delegator is not itself an
“investor” under the Treaty.'°

Furthermore, the Respondent casts doubt on Mr. Pellegrini’s testimony and submits that the
Claimant’s factual record does not support its assertion of control. For example, the Respondent
explains that what really matters in the control of the Australian subsidiaries’ business, as
pointed out by Mr. Gledhill, is the “region” and the role played by PMI’s regional structure,

which Claimant has failed to disclose.'°*

The Claimant maintains that it has established an independent basis for jurisdiction based on its

sufficient, the Claimant argues that it has discharged its burden to prove the factual elements of
its control argument through extensive witness testimony and copious documentary
evidence.! The Claimant further submits that by adducing such evidence, it has proved that it
had controlled the subsidiaries before the ownership transfer and before the time the Respondent

alleges the dispute began.

Since the Respondent has, in the Claimant’s view, failed to rebut the Claimant’s evidence, the
Claimant argues that the Respondent’s preliminary objections must fail.'° More specifically,
the Claimant argues that the Respondent has not refuted the fact that Mr. Pellegrini, regardless
of his title, works on behalf of the Claimant and that he and his staff at PM Asia control the

Australian subsidiaries.!°”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal shall now examine the Parties’ arguments. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed
the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written and oral
submissions. While the Tribunal considers that it is in the interest of clarity briefly to repeat
certain aspects of each Party’s case, the Tribunal’s reasoning shall only address what the
Tribunal regards as determinative for deciding the disputed issues of jurisdiction and
admissibility. In the following, the Tribunal shall set out its findings of fact alongside its legal

determinations, as the latter provide critical context for the former.

BURDEN OF PROOF

The Tribunal finds that there is no general disagreement between the Parties as to the principles
governing burden of proof, although the application of these principles to certain preliminary
objections requires further discussion. Specifically, it is for the Claimant to allege and prove
facts establishing the conditions for jurisdiction under the Treaty; for the Respondent to allege
and prove the facts on which its objections are based; and, to the extent that the Respondent has

established a prima facie case, for the Claimant to rebut this evidence. Where relevant, the
Tribunal will address the application of the burden of proof when discussing the various

objections below.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT HAD CONTROLLED PML’s BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE
RESTRUCTURING

As noted above, the Claimant contends that Australia’s preliminary objections relating to the
manner in which it obtained ownership of the PMI Group’s Australian subsidiaries fail because
it had already exercised management control over these entities since 2001. To succeed with its

argument, the Claimant would need to convince the Tribunal that:

- as a matter of Treaty interpretation, mere management control satisfies the test of
“controlled” under the Treaty; and

- as a matter of fact, it actually exercised such management control.

1. Interpretation of “Controlled”
The Tribunal recalls Subsection (e) of Article 1 of the Treaty regarding Definitions:

“investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one
Contracting Party and admitted by the other Contracting Party subject to its law and
investment policies applicable from time to time [...].

For the purposes of this Agreement, a physical person or company shall be regarded as
controlling a company or an investment if the person or company has a substantial interest
in the company or the investment. Any question arising out of this Agreement concerning
the control of a company or an investment shall be resolved to the satisfaction of the
Contracting Parties.
Thus, the Treaty defines control through the concept of “substantial interest”. Since the first
paragraph mentions “owned or controlled” as alternative possibilities, it is evident that the
drafters intended substantial interest to require something other than full ownership. However, it
is less clear what the concept refers to. The travaux préparatoires of the Treaty—as recorded in
Exhibit R-752!°%—do not provide a conclusive answer. Paragraphs 26, 137 and 167 were
discussed by the Parties and considered more closely by the Tribunal:

PCA 157710 154

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

 

499. A possible reading of paragraph 137 appears to be that Australia considered that “substantial
interest” would serve to extend protection to a minority owner. On the other hand, it might be
argued that, irrespective of control, minority ownership would in any event have been protected
by the Treaty under the notion of “owned” in the first sentence of the provision, as the scope of
“asset” is broad and includes shares, and as the word “owned” is not limited by any

qualification such as “full”.

500. The Tribunal notes the Claimant’s reference to findings of the tribunal in S.D. Myers v. Canada
in support of its assertion that oversight and management can suffice to establish control for the
purposes of enjoying Treaty protection. According to the Claimant, the S.D. Myers tribunal
considered similar language to that set out under Article 1(e) of the Treaty and confirmed that,
“control can exist independently of ownership”.!% The present Tribunal is not persuaded by
that comparison. First, in S.D. Myers v. Canada, the issue was whether the investment was
controlled directly or indirectly, while in the present case the BIT expressly defines control by

reference to “substantial interest”. Second. as the Claimant itself mentions, the S.D. Myers

tribunal “relied on the testimony of the President of SDMI that he controlled Myers Canada in
his role as President of SDMI, even though SDMI did not own equity in Myers Canada and that
there was no legal agreement ‘set[ting] out the respective responsibilities and obligations’ of the
companies”.'°!° In the present case, as will be noted below, when discussing the evidence,

Mr. Pellegrini has not been found to exercise such control at the relevant time.

For similar reasons, the decisions of other tribunals regarding the interpretation of “control”
referred to by the Parties cannot be relied on for present purposes, because none of those other
treaties defines “control” by reference to “substantial interest” or any similar wording.

Therefore, “control” in this BIT must be interpreted independently.

In the view of the Tribunal, the most plausible reading of “substantial interest” may be the
Respondent’s suggestion “that the putative investor must have a right or power over an asset
which is sourced in a legal arrangement, and which is capable of being exercised in some
significant way that affects the economic returns from and disposition of the asset”.'!' As noted
above, the Respondent contends that the essentially economic meaning of that phrase follows

from the “context of the term ‘control’” in the Treaty;!°!

under the Treaty, “‘investments’ are
understood as an economic contribution of a certain duration which involves some element of
risk”.!°' Specifically, the Respondent brings Articles 2(2), 3(1) and 8(1) of the Treaty to the
Tribunal’s attention, noting that these provisions “apply to ‘investments and returns’ of
investors”.'°4 In addition, the Respondent refers to Article 6(1) of the Treaty, which provides
that investors should be compensated for any loss suffered'*'°— a provision that would not
make any sense in the absence of any economic interest in the investment.'°!° This interpretation
would have the consequence that PM Asia would not have had a “substantial interest” in the
Australian Philip Morris subsidiaries before 2011 since, as the Respondent recalls, “in the
period 2001-2011, PM Asia did not have any expectation of ‘an economic return’ from its

asserted ‘[management] control’ of PM Australia and PML”.!°!7

Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

Whatever the precise intention of the negotiators as summarised in paragraph 137 of the travaux
préparatoires may have been, the Tribunal considers that it cannot draw the kind of far-reaching

conclusions from this paragraph that the Claimant suggests.!0!8

To better understand the notion of management control, one could attempt to invoke the fact
that two or more entities could “co-control” an investment in Australia, such that they would all
be considered protected investors under the Treaty, a result that the Treaty would arguably not
allow. However, such reasoning would be inconclusive at best. Indeed, the exact same result
may occur in a situation where several investors own the investment, as all of them would be

considered protected investors under the Treaty.

Be that as it may, considering the lack of clarity in the preparatory works on the Treaty, some
doubt remains as to whether the Tribunal should dismiss the Claimant’s control argument on the
ground that the criterion of “controlled” in the Treaty could not be satisfied by mere
management control. As explained below, the Tribunal does not need to rely on this argument.
Furthermore, the Tribunal observes that, in view of the very last sentence in Article 1(e) of the
Treaty, Australia had originally argued—albeit in a different context—that the interpretation of
the notion of control under the Treaty fell outside the jurisdiction of the Parties and had to be
considered and resolved to the satisfaction of the Treaty Parties through consultations.
However, the argument was not raised again in respect of the meaning of “controlled” in the

context of the Claimant’s control argument.

2. Evidence regarding Control

For the reasons just mentioned, i.e. because the documentation provided does not allow the
Tribunal to reach any conclusive interpretation and because some uncertainty remains as to the
Tribunal’s role in interpreting the notion of control in view of the last sentence of subsection (e)
quoted above, the Tribunal is inclined to leave open the precise meaning of the term
“controlled”. Instead, the Tribunal considers that, even if substantial interest could be defined
through management control, it must be concluded that the Claimant has not proven that PM

Asia exercised management control of any significance in respect of the Australian subsidiaries.

The following documentary evidence referred to by the Respondent in this context is relevant.
With regard to PML’s financial performance and budget, the documents produced by the

Claimant do not show that PM Asia controlled PML.'°'? As mentioned earlier, Mr. Pellegrini

admitted that the CEO of PMI finalises PML’s budget and that PMI is entrusted with the final
decision-making power.'®° In his role within PMI, Mr. Pellegrini approved PML’s capital
expenditures in accordance with PMI policy,'! but his role was limited. For example, for

extent, PML’s managing directors reported to and worked under the supervision of the
Claimant’s President, Mr. Pellegrini, the evidence shows that much of the reporting was made

directly to the PMI personnel in Lausanne, and only indirectly to Mr. Pellegrini.'°?°

3. Conclusion

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, while some (limited) management activity was exercised
by PM Asia from Hong Kong prior to the 2011 restructuring, Mr. Pellegrini acted in most
relevant circumstances as a manager of PMI, rather than PM Asia, and that all significant

strategic and budgetary decisions were either taken by or at least had to be approved by PMI.

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant, who bears the burden of proof on this
issue, has failed to show that, prior to the 2011 restructuring, it had “control” with a “substantial

interest” over the Australian investments in the sense of the definition in Article 1(e) of the BIT.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENT HAS BEEN ADMITTED UNDER AUSTRALIAN LAW
AND INVESTMENT POLICIES

The Parties’ arguments concerning the (non-) admission issue are summarised in considerable
detail in Section V.B. above, to which the Tribunal refers. In essence, the Respondent contends

that the Claimant’s investment was never admitted under the Treaty, because the Foreign

Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

Investment Application was false or misleading, and that consequently, the investment cannot
be afforded Treaty protection. By contrast, the Claimant submits that the admission requirement
under Article 1(e) of the Treaty was satisfied, because (i) the Respondent admitted the
investments following an open and factually accurate FATA notification and expressly stated
that it had no objection to these investments; (ii) the No-Objection Letter is and was at all times
a formal legally binding document; and (iii) the Respondent took no steps to invalidate its own

regulatory action.

1. The Admission Test under the Treaty

Article 1(1)(e) of the Treaty provides that protected investments must have been admitted in the
host country in the following terms:
“investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one

Contracting Party and admitted by the other Contracting Party subject to its law and
investment policies applicable from time to time [...].

2. Prima facie Admission of the Investment

The starting point for the Tribunal’s analysis as to whether the Claimant’s investment was
“admitted” in Australia is the No-objection Letter, i.e., the Respondent’s notification to the
Claimant of 11 February 2011 whereby the Treasury stated that it had no objection to the

proposed restructuring. The No-objection Letter reads as follows:

Dear Mr Scarf,

I refer to correspondence received on 21 January 2011 concerning the proposal for Philipp
Morris Asia Limited to acquire Philip Morris (Australia) Limited as a result of a company
reorganisation.

There are no objections to this proposal in terms of the Government’s foreign investment
policy.

You

  
 

 

ncerely,

 

Foreign Investment Review Board Secretariat

In the view of the Tribunal, the No-objection Letter, which contains no reservations, constitutes

prima facie evidence that the investment was (and remains) validly admitted.

Therefore, the burden of proving that the investment was not admitted shifts to the Respondent.
Based on the evidence before it and for the reasons explained further below, the Tribunal finds
that the Respondent has not provided sufficient evidence in support of its non-admission

objection to rebut the No-objection Letter.

3. Lack of Evidence that the Investment Was Not Admitted

Having established that the investment was (initially) admitted through the No-objection Letter,
the Tribunal must now review whether the No-objection Letter was nonetheless ineffective
because the information provided by the Claimant was incomplete and thus misleading. The

Tribunal finds that this was not the case in particular for the following reasons.

First, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent’s reliance on the alleged requirements
with respect to the content of the FATA notification as set forth in the How-to-Apply Guide!’
and in Australia’s Foreign Investment Policy.'* According to the Respondent, two elements
were missing from the Claimant’s FATA notification: first, a statement of its future intentions
(immediate and ongoing) and, second, a description on how the proposed investment may

impact on the national interest.

However, the Respondent has not demonstrated that these requirements were mandatory. Hence,
the Tribunal cannot conclude that non-compliance with some aspects of the Guide or the Policy,
which is neither contained nor referred to in the FATA, resulted in a misleading application
which could invalidate the admission. In other words, while it may be argued that the Claimant
omitted a key reason for the restructuring, the Tribunal is not convinced that it was mandatory

for the Claimant to mention any such reason in the context of its FATA notification.

Second and more specifically with respect to national interest, one cannot see why the applicant
would have considered that the restructuring raised a concern of national interest, a term for
which no precision had been provided. As to the applicant’s intention, it is true that the latter did
not disclose that it was seeking BIT protection, but this would have been known at least in some
quarters of the Treasury. Indeed, the Government, including at least the Treasurer, was aware of
(i) Australia’s BIT programme; and (ii) the Claimant’s intention to challenge Plain Packaging
Measures. Thus, the Respondent’s claim that, had it known of the BIT intention, the matter
would have been elevated to the Treasurer, seems to be rather an admission of a defect in its
own internal procedures, where a matter of potentially important public policy was missed. Nor
is the Tribunal persuaded by the Respondent’s assertion that the Treasury officials who
reviewed the Foreign Investment Application lacked authority to issue the No-objection Letter.

Instead, the Tribunal is more inclined to accept the Claimant’s argument that the officials acted

Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

as the Treasurer’s agents, his alter egos, and as such had the power to bind the principal.!°°
This is confirmed by the practice of FIRB in other cases.

In particular, the Tribunal has reviewed excerpts of FATA notifications in previous cases.!9°° It
has also reviewed internal minutes of the Treasury, as produced by the Respondent and
submitted in excerpts to the Tribunal by the Claimant, which show how applicants in the past
described the purpose of their proposed restructuring. These descriptions (e.g., “aligning a
group’s legal structure with its operational structure”) are similar in style and detail as that in
the description contained in the PMI Group’s Foreign Investment Application.’%! These
minutes confirm that internal corporate restructuring did not normally raise serious national

interest concerns. 1°32

Third, and more specifically with respect to the attribution of knowledge to the Treasurer, there
is simply no evidence on the record of the state of knowledge of the lower-ranking officials
deciding on the No-objection Letter. Thus, there is no basis for engaging in a discussion about
attribution of knowledge within the Treasury for which the Respondent would have the burden

of proof.

Fourth, the Tribunal observes that none of the other FATA applications on the record concern a
scenario that is comparable with an intention to bring a BIT claim. Indeed, what the other
applications suggest is that the Treasury’s primary focus is on changes that result in foreign
ownership of strategic industries. This finding further supports the Tribunal’s view that the
Claimant was not required to disclose what the Respondent has called its “BIT intention”,
namely, the intention to bring a Treaty claim against Australia if the Plain Packaging Measures

were implemented, in the Foreign Investment Application.

Finally, as to the Respondent’s argument that the No-objection Letter was “affected by

jurisdictional error, and [was] as a result... an invalid decision,” the Tribunal notes that the

letter has never been formally revoked by the Government and that no procedure was initiated
to have it declared invalid by any administrative authority or courts. In other words, the
Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to challenge successfully the undisputed facts that
the No-objection Letter was issued and no administrative or judicial authority has found the No-
objection Letter to be invalid. The Respondent itself has never taken any action to divest the
Claimant of its investment. Moreover, the fact that the No-objection Letter had been sent was
later confirmed by officials of the Treasury—on 31 October 2011! and on 31 July 2012!°\—

to the effect that the investment was admitted, without there being any suggestion of invalidity.

4. Conclusion

In light of these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant’s investment was admitted as
required in subsection (e) of Article 1 of the BIT and that the Respondent’s non-admission

objection must thus fail.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT’S CLAIM FALLS OUTSIDE THE TEMPORAL SCOPE OF ARTICLE
10 OF THE TREATY

Having found that the investment was “admitted”, the Tribunal shall now consider whether the
Claimant’s claim in the present arbitration falls outside the temporal scope of the Parties’
consent to arbitration embodied in Article 10 of the BIT, such that the Tribunal has no

jurisdiction.

The Respondent emphasises that the existence of a dispute is a question of substance, not form,
and that, based on the facts of this case, a dispute pertaining to the legality and efficacy of plain
packaging in Australia had arisen prior to the restructuring of PMI through which it obtained the
protection of the Treaty. The Respondent considers that a relevant “disagreement and/or
conflict” between the Parties existed as early as in April 2010, when the plan to enact plain
packaging legislation was announced. The dispute that arose then is the same as the one
presently before the Arbitral Tribunal, notwithstanding the fact that the parties are different and
that the dispute now pertains to a specific breach of the Treaty. Article 10 does not envisage that
the Treaty will apply to disputes that existed before the Treaty took effect vis-a-vis a particular

investor. Absent specific provisions to the contrary, the jurisdiction ratione temporis under an

investment treaty must be deemed to be limited to prospective disputes. To find otherwise
would be contrary to the ordinary meaning of the dispute resolution clause, as well as the object

and purpose of the Treaty.

The Claimant argues that a dispute regarding a breach of an international obligation cannot exist
on the basis of mere threats or proposals of a measure. Any disagreement between the Parties
prior to the enactment of wrongful legislation has the character of a policy debate in preparation
for the positions to be taken in a dispute in the event of enactment. Until June 2011, neither the
enactment of the legislation nor the dispute was foreseeable as a very high probability, and the
dispute did not crystallise until the legislation was passed. There was therefore no relevant “pre-
existing” dispute, and the present dispute falls within the jurisdiction ratione temporis of the
tribunal in accordance with Article 10 of the Treaty. Alternatively, even if a dispute did exist
prior to the enactment of the legislation, nothing in Article 10 of the Treaty precludes the

extension of the scope of the tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis to pre-existing disputes.

In view of the arguments submitted by the Parties, the starting point for the Tribunal is to

distinguish between the ratione temporis objection and the abuse of rights objection. This is

1035

now clear from the jurisprudence’*” and is also largely consistent with the manner in which the

Parties structured their pleadings. As the tribunal reasoned in Gremcitel:

182. As a further threshold matter, the Tribunal considers that an abuse of process objection
must be distinguished from a ratione temporis objection. If a claimant acquires an
investment after the date on which the challenged act occurred, the tribunal will normally
lack jurisdiction ratione temporis and there will be no room for an abuse of process. Here,
the Tribunal has established that Ms. Levy acquired her investment prior to the challenged
measure, even if it was just slightly before. In such a situation, a tribunal has jurisdiction
ratione temporis but may be precluded from exercising its jurisdiction if the acquisition is
abusive.!°°

The Claimant distinguishes between jurisdiction ratione temporis (which it submits must be
assessed at the time of filing the request for arbitration) and the temporal application of the
substantive standards (in relation to which it accepts that the substantive standards could only

apply after a claimant has made its protected investment under the BIT). While correct in

See Pac Rim Decision on the Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objections, paras 2.101, 2.107 (distinguishing
between a ratione temporis objection and an abuse of process objection); Lao Holdings NV. v. The Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on Ju i
2014, para. 76 (“if a company changes its nationality in order to gain ICSID jurisdiction at a moment
when things have started to deteriorate so that a dispute is highly probable, it can be considered an abuse
of process, but for an objection based on ratione temporis to be upheld, the dispute has to have actually
arisen before the critical date to conform to the general principle of non-retroactivity in the interpretation
and application of international treaties”) (emphasis in bold omitted).

theory, the Tribunal is of the view that the distinction is unnecessary when the cause of action is

founded upon a treaty breach.'*’ As the tribunal in Gremcitel v. Peru explained:

146. [...] it is clear to the Tribunal that, where the claim is founded upon an alleged breach
of the Treaty’s substantive standards, a tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to a dispute
between the host [S]tate and a national or company which has acquired its protected
investment before the alleged breach occurred. In other words, the Treaty must be in force
and the national or company must have already made its investment when the alleged
breach occurs, for the Tribunal to_have jurisdiction over_a breach of that_Treaty’s
substantive standards affecting that investment.

147. This conclusion follows from the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties, which
entails that the substantive protections of the BIT apply to the [S]tate conduct that occurred
after these protections became applicable to the eligible investment. Because the BIT is at
the same time the instrument that creates the substantive obligation forming the basis of the
claim before the Tribunal and the instrument that confers jurisdiction upon the Tribunal, a
claimant bringing a claim based on a Treaty obligation must have owned or controlled the
investment when that obligation was allegedly breached.

  

 

148. [...] [A claimant] must therefore prove that [it] had already acquired [its] investment at
the time of the impugned conduct.'°*8 (Emphasis added)

The Tribunal agrees with this approach and considers that, whenever the cause of action is
based on a treaty breach, the test for a ratione temporis objection is whether a claimant made a
protected investment before the moment when the alleged breach occurred. Investor-State
jurisprudence is in accord with this approach.'°* In this respect, the identification of the critical

date is essential for the assessment of the scope of the Tribunal’s ratione temporis jurisdiction.

Furthermore, in view of the Tribunal’s conclusion below that the critical date is the date of enactment of
the TPP Act, this discussion would become moot, as the Notice of Arbitration was filed on the same date
of such enactment.

Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

To identify the critical date, the Gremcitel tribunal took the following view:

149. [...] the critical date is the one on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even

when the measure represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may

have started years earlier. It is not uncommon that divergences or disagreements develop

over a period of time before they finally “crystallize” in an actual measure affecting the

investor's treaty rights.'™°
The Gremcitel tribunal accepted that this was the situation in that case because it was only when
the measure (a 2007 Resolution by the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Cultura (INC)) was
“adopted and published” that the rights of the claimants were allegedly affected. Prior to that
moment, “there was still a possibility that the INC would decide not to adopt the Resolution.

The [c]laimants would then have had no act to complain about”.!°!

The Tribunal shares this view. It should be mentioned in this context that the date of the dispute
is not necessarily identical to that of the alleged breach. Rather, at least as far as one-time acts
are concerned, the dispute normally follows the alleged breach (it arises when an aggrieved
investor “positively opposes” the measures adopted or any claim of the other party that derives

from them).!°?

In conclusion, for purposes of the ratione temporis objection the critical date is the date when
the State adopts the disputed measure, which in this case is the date of enactment of the TPP

Act, as before that moment the Claimant’s right could not be affected. In other words, the

of treaties in international law, a BIT cannot apply to the protection of an investor before the latter indeed
became an investor under said BIT”). See also Zachary Douglas, The International Law of Investment
Claims (Cambridge, 2009), para. 330 (“The act of making a qualified investment is also controlling for
the scope of the arbitral tribunal’s adjudicative power in several respects. [...] the timing of the investor’s

Claimant was to have acquired its investment by the date of enactment of the TPP Act, i.e. by
21 November 2011. The Tribunal observes that, whether the Tribunal refers to the date when
the restructuring was decided (3 September 2010) or when it was completed (23 February

2011), both events occurred before the date of the enactment of the TPP Act.

Therefore, and without prejudice to its later finding on abuse of rights, the Tribunal concludes

that the requirements for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis are met.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT’S INVOCATION OF THE TREATY CONSTITUTES AN ABUSE OF
RIGHTS

Finally, the Tribunal must address whether the invocation of the Treaty by the Claimant

constitutes an abuse of rights under the present circumstances.

The essence of the Respondent’s position is as follows. The doctrine of abuse of rights delimits
the tribunal’s jurisdiction as defined by the consent of the Parties to the Treaty.'** While the
Respondent accepts that it must meet the burden establishing an abuse, it does not accept that
there is a presumption that the Claimant acted in good faith in bringing its claim, in undergoing
a corporate restructuring and subsequently relying on Treaty protections.'“4 According to the
Respondent, there is no case law to support this contention.'“* Rather, cases hold that the
entitlement of the Claimant to bring a claim under the Treaty is circumscribed by the scope of
the consent of the parties to the Treaty, and such consent and its scope cannot be presumed, but
instead must be positively established.'“° In discharging the burden of proof, the Respondent
does not need to meet an exceptionally high evidentiary standard,’ such as a standard of
“egregious conduct”.!8 The case law indicates that an abuse of right can be found where a
corporate restructuring is motivated wholly or partly by a desire to gain access to treaty

1049

protection in order to bring a claim in respect of a specific dispute’™” that, at the time of the

restructuring, exists or is foreseeable.'° In these circumstances, the restructuring is intended to

create an unfair advantage for the foreign investor because the investor has no intention of

performing any economic activity in the host State.'°5!

The Claimant argues that the application of the doctrine of abuse of rights results in depriving a
claimant of rights that otherwise fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the tribunal.'°? Such a
deprivation is to be made only in exceptional circumstances.'°*? To meet the burden of proof,
the Respondent must overcome a presumption in favour of the Claimant that it has brought its
claim in good faith.'°* The threshold for establishing an abuse of rights is that of compelling
evidence of egregious bad faith akin to fraud.'° “Foreseeability” is not relevant to establishing
abuse of rights—the critical test is bad faith.'°° To the extent that foreseeability is relevant, it
must be to a very high standard of probability. The “motivation” of an investor is indeed a
criterion of abuse of rights. However, bad faith does not exist by virtue of a mere corporate
restructuring with a view to taking advantage of Treaty protections. Such normal business

practice meets neither the standard of “egregious” conduct nor that of bad faith.'°%7

1. Arbitral Case Law Regarding “Abuse of Rights”

The present case is by no means the first investment arbitration in which it is disputed whether a
BIT claim brought shortly after restructuring is admissible. Therefore, the Tribunal considers

that it is appropriate to review the relevant case law on this point.

As a preliminary matter, it is clear, and recognised by all earlier decisions that the threshold for
finding an abusive initiation of an investment claim is high. It is equally accepted that the notion
of abuse does not imply a showing of bad faith. Under the case law, the abuse is subject to an
objective test and is seen in the fact that an investor who is not protected by an investment treaty
restructures its investment in such a fashion as to fall within the scope of protection of a treaty
in view of a specific foreseeable dispute. Although it is sometimes said that an abuse of right
might also exist in the case of restructuring in respect of an existing dispute, if the dispute

already exists, then a tribunal would normally lack jurisdiction ratione temporis.

A detailed examination of the relevant cases reveals the following considerations in connection
with the legal test for an abuse of right. Among these, it is first and foremost uncontroversial

that the mere fact of restructuring an investment to obtain BIT benefits is not per se illegitimate.

In Tidewater v. Venezuela, the tribunal said:

184. [I]t is a perfectly legitimate goal and no abuse of an investment protection treaty
regime, for an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes with
a host [S]tate in this way.!°°8

In Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela, the tribunal said:

holding was to protect those investments against breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan
authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration through the BIT. The tribunal considers
that this was a perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.!°°

 

In a similar vein, the tribunal in Gremcitel v. Peru said:

184. In the Tribunal’s view, it is now well-established, and rightly so, that an organization
or reorganization of a corporate structure designed to obtain investment treaty benefits is
not illegitimate per se, including where thi done with a view to shielding the investment
from possible future disputes with the host [S]tate.!°°

    

In Aguas del Tunari SA v. Bolivia, the tribunal observed:

... [T]o the extent that Bolivia argues that the December 1999 transfer of ownership was a
fraudulent or abusive device to assert jurisdiction under the BIT, that:... (d) it is not

in practice and—absent a particular li i t illegal to locate one’s
operation in a jurisdiction perceived to provide a beneficial regulatory and legal
environment in terms, for example, of taxation or the substantive law of the jurisdiction,
including the availability of a BIT.!°

At the same time, it may amount to an abuse of process to restructure an investment to obtain
BIT benefits in respect of a foreseeable dispute. After commenting that it is legitimate for an
investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes, the tribunal in

Tidewater v. Venezuela went on to say:

At the heart, therefore, of this issue is a question of fact as to the nature of the dispute
between the parties, and a question of timing as to when the dispute that is the subject of
the present proceedings arose or could reasonably have been foreseen... If the Claimants’
contentions are found to be correct as a matter of fact, then, in the view of the Tribunal, no
question of abuse of treaty can arise. On the other hand, if the Respondent's submissions on
the course of events are correct, then there may be a real question of abuse of treaty.

 

 

 

But the same is not the case in relation to pre-existing disputes between the specific
investor and the [S]tate. Thus, the critical issue remains one of fact: was there such a pre-
existing dispute?!

The point was reiterated in Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela:

205. With respect to pre-existing disputes, the situation is different and the Tribunal
considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for
such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix Tribunal, “an abusive
manipulation of the tem of international investment protection under the ICSID
convention and the BITs”.'°°

 
 

The tribunal in Pac Rim v. El Salvador elaborated on this point, setting out a test for

distinguishing between a general risk of future disputes and a specific dispute, stating:

2.99. [...] In the Tribunal’s view, the dividing-line [between legitimate restructure and an
abuse of process] occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a
specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a_ possi
controversy. !0+

 

The Gremcitel tribunal posited a simpler test stating:

185. However, a restructuring carried out with the intention to invoke the treaty’s
protections at a time when the dispute is foreseeable may constitute an abuse of process
depending on the circumstances. !0
The principle that a restructuring undertaken to gain treaty protection in light of a specific
dispute can constitute an abuse was reiterated in Lao Holdings v. Laos in the following terms:

70. The Tribunal considers that it is clearly an abuse for an investor to manipulate the
nationality of a company subsidiary to gain jurisdiction under an international treaty at a
time when the investor is aware that events have occurred that negatively affect its
investment and may lead to arbitration. In particular, abuse of process must preclude
unacceptable manipulations by a claimant acting in bad faith who is fully aware prior to the
change in nationality of the “legal dispute,” as submitted by the Respondent. !°°
While they admit that, under certain circumstances, a restructuring may constitute an abuse,
investor-State tribunals have set a high threshold for finding an abuse of process, requiring
proof of the foreseeability of the claim and depending on the particular circumstances of each
case. The Tidewater tribunal said:

147. [uJnder general international law as well as under ICSID case law, abuse of right is to
be determined in each case, taking into account all the circumstances of the case...”

That statement was reiterated in Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela.'*

The requirement of a high threshold was articulated by the Chevron (J) tribunal in the following
terms:

143. ... [I]n all legal systems, the doctrines of abuse of rights, estoppel and waiver are
subject to a high threshold. Any right leads normally and automatically to a claim for its
holder. It is only in very exceptional circumstances that a holder of a right can neverthele:
not raise and enforce the resulting claim. The high threshold results from the seriousness of
a charge of bad faith amounting to abuse of process. As Judge Higgins stated in her 2003
Separate Opinion in the Oil Platforms case, there is “a general agreement that the graver the
charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on.”!°°

  

    

A similar approach was taken by the tribunal in Gremcitel when it said:

186. As for any abuse of right, the threshold for a finding of abuse of process is high, as a
court or tribunal will obviously not presume an abuse, and will affirm the evidence of an
abuse only “in very exceptional circumstances”. Furthermore, as the Tribunal in Mobil v.
Venezuela stated, “[u]nder general international law as well as under ICSID case law, abuse

of right is to be determined in each case, taking into account all the circumstances of the
91070

  

case.
Despite the variations in the formulations used in the decisions just quoted, this Tribunal
considers that case law has articulated legal tests on abuse of right that are broadly analogous,
revolving around the concept of foreseeability.'"’' In the Tribunal’s view, foreseeability rests
between the two extremes posited by the tribunal in Pac Rim v. El Salvador—“a very high
probability and not merely a possible controversy”. On this basis, the initiation of a treaty-based
investor-State arbitration constitutes an abuse of rights (or an abuse of process, the rights abused
being procedural in nature) when an investor has changed its corporate structure to gain the
protection of an investment treaty at a point in time when a specific dispute was foreseeable.
The Tribunal is of the opinion that a dispute is foreseeable when there is a reasonable prospect,
as stated by the Tidewater tribunal, that a measure which may give rise to a treaty claim will

materialise. The Tribunal will now apply this test to the facts of the case.

2. The Restructuring in the Context of Political Developments

particularly relevant to place the Claimant’s restructuring into temporal perspective.

entirely clear to the Tribunal to what extent these changes in the corporate structure were part of
a single restructuring plan rather than a series of ad hoc improvements. The Respondent began

Minister Rudd, and at her first press conference, she indicated “a willingness to revise the
policies of the Rudd Government”.'*! There was however no specific reference to the fate of
plain packaging legislation. On 7 July 2010, the Australian Government published a timetable
which showed that the plain packaging legislation would be ready for introduction before
30 June 2011 and would be fully implemented by 1 July 2012.'° The House of Representatives

On 21 August 2010, no political party achieved an absolute majority in the federal election and
the Labor Party and the Opposition Coalition, which had criticised plain packaging, now had an
equal number of seats in the House of Representatives.!°87 On 26 August 2010, the Parliament
discontinued its consideration of the Fielding Bill, and the next day, the PMI Group circulated
an internal e-mail titled “urgent ownership transfer” which contained advice regarding corporate
restructuring.'°** On 3 September 2010, as part of its ongoing restructuring, PMI approved, inter
alia, the restructuring proposal of several companies within its Group and the transfer of its

plain packaging legislation because the Labor Party had secured the four extra votes that it
needed to pass the legislation.1!

On 22 June 2011, a memorandum from Mr. Pellegrini indicates that PMI sought approval to
refine its affiliates’ corporate structure in the Asia region.'!°! The Claimant then served the
Respondent with the Notice of Claim under the BIT on 27 June 2011. On 6 July 2011, the TPP
Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives." On 13 July 2011, the Claimant
acquired Philip Morris (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and Philip Morris Taiwan SA from PM Brands
Sarl." Finally, on 21 November 2011, the TPP Bill passed both Houses of Parliament and the
TPP Act was enacted. On the same date, the Claimant served the Respondent with a Notice of
Arbitration under the BIT."

For the Tribunal, the key question is whether a dispute about plain packaging was reasonably
foreseeable before the restructuring. In line with jurisprudence, the Tribunal considers that a
dispute in the legal sense is a disagreement about rights, not merely about policy. It is clear that
the dispute contemplated here was a dispute about rights. The record shows that PMI stated
clearly even before the Rudd announcement that plain packaging would deprive it of its legal
rights. As early as 2009, it had informed the Australian Government that plain packaging would
interfere with its property rights, and its internal memoranda made it clear that it was
considering the matter in legal terms. On 29 April 2010, Australia’s Prime Minister Rudd and
Health Minister Roxon unequivocally d the G si ion to introduce Plain
Packaging Measures. In the Tribunal’s view, there was no uncertainty about the Government’s

 

intention to introduce plain packaging as of that point. Accordingly, there was at least a
reasonable prospect that legislation equivalent to the Plain Packaging Measures would
eventually be enacted, which would trigger a dispute. The Tribunal is not convinced that
political developments after 29 April 2010 were such that the Claimant could reasonably
conclude that the enactment of Plain Packaging Measures and the ensuing dispute were no

longer foreseeable.

The Tribunal wishes to make two further general but at the same time case-specific
considerations. First, in this case a period of 19 months passed between the announcement of
the intention to legislate and the passage of the actual legislation. However, the length of time it
takes to legislate is not a decisive factor in determining whether the legislation is foreseeable.
The Tribunal notes that democratic States often have long legislative processes involving
consultations with a variety of stakeholders. In this case, the process, which led to the approval

of the TPP Act, was

involving p ‘y reports and and

discussions with all stakeholders, including the tobacco companies. However, this does not
make the outcome any less foreseeable than in the case of a State that does not have the same
sort of democratic oversight of the legislative process and might enact legislation almost

overnight.

Second, in April 2010, long before the restructuring, the Australian Government announced that
it would introduce Plain Packaging Measures and never withdrew from that position even
though political leaders changed and the Government became a minority government. What
became uncertain was not whether the Government intended to introduce plain packaging, but
whether the Government could maintain a majority or would be replaced. But that is a difficulty
which any minority government faces, and if it were treated as a basis for saying that there was
no reasonable prospect of a dispute, then there would be one rule for majority governments and
another for minority governments, which would create particular difficulty for States whose

electoral processes can result in minority governments.

The Tribunal thus concludes that, at the time of the restructuring, the dispute that materialised
subsequently was foreseeable to the Claimant. Indeed, at least after the 29 April 2010

it was ly that |

equivalent to the Plain Packaging

Measures would eventually be enacted and, consequently, a dispute would arise.

3. The Cogency of PM Asia’s Alleged Other Reasons for Restructuring

Having held that the dispute was foreseeable prior to the restructuring, the Tribunal now turns to
the Claimant’s reasons for restructuring. In this context, the Parties have discussed whether the
restructuring was solely motivated by the desire to obtain treaty protection or whether such
protection was merely an ancillary consequence of the restructuring. The Tribunal considers that
the mere fact that a company prepared for “the worst case” by seeking legal advice about a BIT
claim at an early stage would not be unusual; such conduct might simply be normal and prudent
business behaviour. In the view of the Tribunal, it would not normally be an abuse of right to
bring a BIT claim in the wake of a corporate restructuring, if the restructuring was justified

independently of the possibility of bringing such a claim. The Tribunal acknowledges the reality

Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

that corporate groups—and particularly multinationals—are routinely restructured for a variety

of reasons.

The Parties have addressed the cogency or persuasiveness of PM Asia’s alleged other reasons
for restructuring extensively both by arguments and by the submission of evidence. A summary

of these submissions follows:

The Claimant alleges that the restructuring was part of a broader, group-wide process that had
been ongoing since 2005." In support, the Claimant relies on internal memoranda that refer to
proposals for restructuring PMI’s European affiliates in 2004, and PMI’s Latin American and
Canadian affiliates in 2008.1 The Claimant also submits one internal memorandum dated
3 September 2010 as evidence of a proposal to restructure affiliates in the African and Asian
regions at that time,'!®” and one internal memorandum dated 22 June 2011 as evidence of a
proposal to restructure certain Asian affiliates under PM Asia Limited “as part of ongoing
efforts to refine PMI affiliates’ corporate structure in the Asia region.”"!8 In addition, the
Claimant presents a Board decision as evidence of ongoing restructuring of other PMI
affiliates. To reinforce this documentary evidence, the Claimant relies on the witness
statements and oral testimony of Mr. Pellegrini in support of its assertion that the transfer of
ownership of PM Australia to the Claimant was consistent with the objectives of these other
restructuring initiatives.!"1°

The Respondent, on the other hand, relies on the witness statement of Professor Lys, who notes
that the only contemporaneous piece of evidence provided by the Claimant that directly relates
to a broader project to restructure PMI Asia is the internal memorandum dated 3 September

2010 and that this memorandum raises a number of questions about whether this restructuring

made real business sense.!!!! The Respondent also questions the veracity of that memorandum,
citing to excerpts from company registers, Annual Reports of the affected affiliates, as well as
previous internal PMI memoranda that appear to contradict the 3 September 2010
memorandum."!!? The Respondent criticises the Claimant’s reliance on documentary evidence
on the basis that it was prepared in contemplation of this arbitration, that it contradicts the
Claimant’s purported restructuring strategy, and that certain documents are too remote to be of
relevance." Finally, the Respondent argues that ; oral testimony directly
contradicts the Claimant’s position, since “[h]e agreed that [the restructuring] had no
‘commercial advantage’”!!4 and “conceded he was not really a part of [the restructuring] and

said it had no meaningful impact on this region”.1"5

The Claimant also argues that one relevant and compelling reason motivating the restructuring
was the need to align ownership with the Claimant’s pre-existing management control of its
subsidiaries, thereby creating a “better, leaner, clearer structure”. The Claimant points to
internal PM Asia memoranda in support of the contention that a more centralised ownership
structure would facilitate PMI’s overall objectives.'!!” The Claimant relies on the oral testimony

of Mr. Pellegrini who stated that one of the objectives of PMI’s group-wide restructuring was to

align the ownership and management control of its various affiliates."'* Mr. Pellegrini also

explained why certain PMI affiliates in the Asia region had not been acquired by PM Asia, and
that this did not contradict the streamlining objectives of the restructuring.""!9

The Respondent disputes that the restructuring was motivated by the need to align PMI affiliates
in the Asia region, pointing to a Table of PMI Affiliates in the Asia region over which PM Asia
asserts oversight and control and which, according to the Respondent, establishes that the
restructuring has not followed a regional pattern.!!”° Pointing to a PMI internal Memorandum
dated 22 June 2011, the Respondent asserts that the decision to transfer certain PMI Asian
affiliates to PM Asia was made on the same day that Mr. Pellegrini signed the Notice of
Claim.""?! The Respondent relies on the report of Professor Lys, who stated that the previous
structure was functioning “perfectly well” before the restructuring and that the net impact of the

restructuring was to complicate, rather than simplify the ownership structure."

Furthermore, the Claimant contends that the restructuring helped to minimise the Claimant’s tax
liabilities. By way of example, the Claimant refers to an intemal PMI memorandum dated
Ee. which indicates that certain tax benefits under the Dutch tax system were
associated with shifting certain functions and responsibilities from PM Holland to PMI."!3 The
Claimant also submits internal memoranda dated i. | and
that purportedly evidence PMI’s efforts to streamline its activities, thereby liquidating
redundant entities and creating consequential tax advantages.'* These tax advantages, in turn,
allowed the Claimant to finance an inter-company debt, as evidenced by a Loan Note between

PM Holland and PM International Management S.A."?° The Claimant finally relies on

Mr. Pellegrini’s oral testimony wherein he recalled that the restructuring presented “an

advantage from a tax point of view” to finance intercompany debt.!!7°

The Respondent replies that the restructuring was hurried through and that valuation and tax
considerations were only an afterthought. It points in particular to a series of e-mails in this
regard.'"?7 It adds that the Tribunal has been kept away from any “tax experts” who could speak
of the supposed revenue rationale for the restructuring. Similarly, the Respondent observes that
there are only few privileged documents listed in the RPL that support the purported tax benefits
of the restructuring at the time when it was being approved by the PMI Group." It refers to the
report of Professor Lys which explains that any tax advantage from the restructuring would
have been “small and inconsequential” in the context of other sources of income, and that these

advantages were “not needed to service its interest obligations under the ‘loan-note””.""°

Furthermore, in reliance on Mr. Pellegrini’s written and oral evidence, the Claimant alleges that
the restructuring also helped to optimise cash flow, which was useful for everyday operations as
well as strategic acquisitions.'!° It notes that these cash flow benefits provided greater financial
flexibility in the event that an acquisition opportunity would arise.!>! The Claimant relies on
internal correspondence and compares PM Asia’s financial statements before and after the
restructuring as evidence of the cash benefits of the restructuring.""?

579. The Respondent objects that this alleged reason is “nonsensical and un-persuasive”. It refers in

particular to the evidence of Professor Lys, who states that the restructuring did not have any of
the anticipated financial benefits.'4? The Respondent also points to PM Asia’s financial
statements for 2001 and 2010 to show that PM Asia made a profit in those years without the
receipt of dividend income from the restructuring.'4 The Respondent also recalls Professor
Lys’s report, and PM Asia’s financial statements for 2011, 2012 and 2013, in order to
demonstrate that any dividend income arising from the restructuring was not used to fund PM
Asia’s operations or to make strategic acquisitions, in contradiction of the Claimant’s purported
rationale for the restructuring.'° The Respondent relies on internal PMI documents, including
various “country reports” and financial statements, as well as public comments made by PMI
representatives, as evidence that PMI’s growth in the Asia region was the result of non-Asian
PMI affiliates making strategic acquisitions in the region, as opposed to the growth of PM

Asia.!36

protection under the BIT, but stresses that this was not the sole motive because the enactment of

to a significant extent on Mr. Pellegrini’s testimony that the primary motivations for

By contrast, the Respondent asserts that giving the PMI Group a “corporate vehicle with

Several e-mails include the subject line “Australia-HK BIT”, “HK BIT”, and “Philip Morris—

refers to the adoption of litigation as part of PMI’s “Plain Packaging Strategy”, and the PMI

582. After a close examination of the evidence, the Tribunal is not persuaded that tax or other
business reasons were determinative factors for the Claimant’s restructuring. In particular, the
Tribunal notes that no witness who was familiar with the rationale of the restructuring was

presented by the Claimant in the proceedings. Indeed, the persons most closely involved in the

restructuring decision were not offered as witnesses by the Claimant. Nor was the Tribunal
presented with contemporaneous corporate memoranda or other internal correspondence

sufficiently explaining the business case for the restructuring in detail.

In this context, the Tribunal is inclined to place limited weight on Mr. Pellegrini’s testimony as
it became apparent during the hearing that Mr. Pellegrini was not familiar with details of legal
or corporate strategy. Against this background, the expert report of Professor Lys does carry
weight, especially as it remains unrebutted by other expert evidence, and Professor Lys was not

called for cross-examination.

Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not been able to prove that tax or other
business reasons were determinative for the restructuring. From all the evidence on file, the
Tribunal can only conclude that the main and determinative, if not sole, reason for the
restructuring was the intention to bring a claim under the Treaty, using an entity from Hong

Kong.

4. Conclusion

In view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the commencement of treaty-
based investor-State arbitration constitutes an abuse of right (or abuse of process) when an
investor has changed its corporate structure to gain the protection of an investment treaty at a
point in time where a dispute was foreseeable. A dispute is foreseeable when there is a

reasonable prospect that a measure that may give rise to a treaty claim will materialise.

In the present case, the Tribunal has found that the adoption of the Plain Packaging Measures
was foreseeable well before the Claimant’s decision to restructure was taken (let alone
implemented). On 29 April 2010, Australia’s Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Health Minister
Roxon unequivocally announced the Government’s intention to introduce Plain Packaging
Measures. In the Tribunal’s view, there was no uncertainty about the Government's intention to
introduce plain packaging as of that point. Accordingly, from that date, there was at least a
reasonable prospect that legislation equivalent to the Plain Packaging Measures would
eventually be enacted and a dispute would arise. Political developments after 29 April 2010 did
not involve any change in the intention of the Government to introduce Plain Packaging

Measures and, thus, were not such as to change the foreseeability assessment.

The Tribunal’s conclusion is reinforced by a review of the evidence regarding the Claimant’s
professed alternative reasons for the restructuring. The record indeed shows that the principal, if
not sole, purpose of the restructuring was to gain protection under the Treaty in respect of the

very measures that form the subject matter of the present arbitration. For the Tribunal, the

PCA 157710 184

589.

590.

PCA Case N° 2012-12
Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

adoption of the Plain Packaging Measures was not only foreseeable but actually foreseen by the

Claimant when it chose to change its corporate structure.

In light of the foregoing discussion, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the initiation of this
arbitration constitutes an abuse of rights, as the corporate restructuring by which the Claimant
acquired the Australian subsidiaries occurred at a time when there was a reasonable prospect
that the dispute would materialise and as it was carried out for the principal, if not sole, purpose
of gaining Treaty protection. Accordingly, the claims raised in this arbitration are inadmissible

and the Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute.

COSTS OF ARBITRATION

As this Interim Award (final save as to costs) comes to the conclusion that this Tribunal cannot

 

exercise its jurisdiction, it brings the present proceedings to an end, but for a deci

The Tribunal will provide the Parties with an opportunity to make submissions regarding the
amounts and the allocation of the costs of the proceedings, and the Tribunal will then fix and

allocate the costs of arbitration in a final award on costs.
