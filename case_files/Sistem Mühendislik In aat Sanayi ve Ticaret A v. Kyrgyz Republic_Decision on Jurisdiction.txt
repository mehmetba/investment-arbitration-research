DECISION 28

THE BACKGROUND TO THE CLAIM

1. This case was initiated by the Request for Arbitration dated September 30, 2005, made by
Sistem Miihendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (“Sistem”), a company incorporated under the
laws of the Republic of Turkey (“Turkey”) and located at 1703 Sokak 67/2 Karsiyaka, Izmir,
Turkey. The Claimant says that Sistem and all of its shareholders have Turkish nationality, and
this has not been contested by the Respondent. The claims are brought against the Kyrgyz
Republic. The claims arise from a dispute between Sistem and the Kyrgyz Republic concerning
the building and operation of a hotel in Bishkek in the Kyrgyz Republic.

2. Turkey ratified the ICSID Convention on March 3, 1989, and the Convention entered into
force for Turkey on April 2, 1989. The Kyrgyz Republic signed the ICSID Convention on June
9, 1995, but has not yet ratified the Convention.

3. There is in force a bilateral investment treaty between Turkey and the Kyrgyz Republic
(the “BIT”). The BIT states, in one of the texts submitted by the Claimant, that it was “Done at
Bishkek on the day of 28/4/1992 in two authentic copies in English.”' That is the date also given
on the UNCTAD website, which records that the BIT entered into force on October 31, 1996.”
The copy submitted by the Respondent gives the date of the treaty as “29.04.92.”

4. In essence, the claim arises from a joint venture formed in 1992 by the Claimant, Sistem,
and a Kyrgyz company, the Ak-Keme Joint-Stock Company (“Ak-Keme”). Sistem says that it
fulfilled its obligations under the various agreements that underpinned the project, that it bought
Ak-Keme’s share in the project in 1999 after Ak-Keme went into bankruptcy in 1998, and that it
is entitled now to operate the hotel, but was dispossessed in March 2005 by Ak-Keme (now
acting with a Malaysian partner). Sistem claims that the Kyrgyz Republic failed in its duty to
protect Sistem’s investment. The Respondent says that Sistem was simply a contractor hired to
build the hotel, that it did not fulfil its obligations, that the 1998 bankruptcy procedure and 1998
purchase by Sistem of Ak-Keme’s interest were legally invalid, and that Sistem unlawfully
occupied the hotel until it was recovered by Ak-Keme and its Malaysian partner in March 2005.
The Kyrgyz Republic does not accept Sistem’s claim.

5. It is necessary to explain the background in more detail.

Sistem’s Account of the Background to the Claim

6. According to Sistem, the background to the claim is as follows. (This account refers only
to those matters necessary for an understanding of this decision on jurisdiction and does not set
out all of the allegations made by Sistem or all the responses made by the Kyrgyz Republic.)

7. In 1992 Sistem decided to make a hotel investment in the Kyrgyz Republic in
collaboration with Ak-Keme. An Agreement between Sistem and Ak-Keme was signed on May
27, 1992.4 In Special Agreement No | of May 27, 1992, they agreed to “jointly construct as a
‘key delivery project’ a 4 star 400 beds world class hotel in Bishkek city.”> The Charter of the
Joint Kyrgyz-Turkish Venture “Ak-Keme-Pinara” was signed on October 16, 1992.° “Pinara”
or “Ak-Keme Pinara” was the name of the hotel.

8. In 1993 Turkey provided, via Turkish Eximbank, a loan to the Kyrgyz Republic of
USD75 million, of which USD6 million was provided for the building of the hotel.

9. The contract for the construction of the hotel (“Contract No. 1”) was signed by
Mr. F. Yenice for Sistem and by Mr. R. Sarymsakoy for Ak-Keme on February 1, 1993.7 A
letter dated February 3, 1993, from the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan to Sistem refers to the
opening of a credit line in respect of the sum of USD6 million provided by Eximbank for the
hotel project, and notes that

This project is included in the list of the projects approved by the government
of the Republic of Kirghizstan and has got a positive expert conclusion of the
Ministry of Economics and Finances, State Committee on Foreign
Economical Affairs and National Bank of Kirgizstan [sic] and is to be
financed [according] to expences culculations [sic] made by your firm and
given in feasibility studies.

10. The hotel was opened on August 28, 1995. On December 19, 1995, according to Sistem,
“Ak-Keme’s armed men invaded the Hotel” and Ak-Keme informed Sistem that it would no
longer take responsibility for the safety of the lives of Sistem’s Turkish employees.”

11. The dispute was addressed by the inter-governmental Turkish-Kyrgyz Joint Technical
Permanent Committee in 1996, which confirmed on September 13, 1996, inter alia that Sistem
and Ak-Keme each owned “50% [of the] shares over the hotel and the Turkish firm [Sistem]
holds the operating rights for 5 years.”"°

12. The Respondent says that in 1996 Sistem’s investment licence was revoked, and that Ak-
Keme began to negotiate with other investors, and in particular with a Malaysian company. The
Respondent further says that a joint venture was created by Ak-Keme and the Malaysian
company, and that from 1998 onwards it was this joint venture that was continuing to construct
the hotel.

13. A Decision of the Legislative Assembly of the Kyrgyz Republic dated October 7, 2002,
records that in 1996 Sistem’s investment licence was taken back because it “failed to prove [its]
contributions,” and that “[a]s a result of this, ‘Ak-Keme’ Joint [sc., Venture] Company has
stopped performance.”'? The notice of revocation, dated April 10, 1996, states that Sistem’s
licence was revoked “based on non-presentation of documents certifying the facts of investment
by Turkish Founder, and informs on liquidation of Ak-Keme Pinara Joint Kyrgyz-Turkish
Enterprise on the basis of documents and statement presented by Kyrgyz Founder — Ak-Keme
Closed Joint-Stock Company.”'? The 2002 Decision continued: “Construction of the Hotel had
been completed from the accounts of Kyrgyz and Malaysian investor ‘Biznes Fokas Sdn.
Bhd.’ Company. 2.000.000 USD had been spent for the completion of the construction.”'*

14. On December 10, 1998, the Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Kyrgyz Republic
declared Ak-Keme bankrupt, on the application of the “Liqui and Re-Establi: of
the Companies Organization” (the “URLP”) of the Kyrgyz Republic.'® This decision
followed earlier bankruptcy proceedings and reversed an earlier decision of the Bishkek City
Court of Arbitration, dated November 16, 1998.

15. The bankruptcy arose from Ak-Keme’s failure to pay its debts, including debts to the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, which had guaranteed payment by Ak-Keme of loans to
Ak-Keme from the Turkish Eximbank. The loans were used for purchasing construction
materials from Turkey.'®

16. The decision of the Supreme Court of Arbitration records that

Through the hearing, representatives of the Government of the Republic of
Kyrgyz and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kyrgyz completely
supported the demands of the FGI of the URLP of the Republic of Kyrgyz;
and, requested the bankruptcy of the ‘Ak-Keme’ company because payment
regarding Tiirk Eximbank credit is a heavy burden on the state budget.'”
It also records that “[t]he rep ive of the defend: pp d at the court di: fully
and left the room alone. He did not come to the following hearings.”"*

17. Sistem, already the owner of a 50% share of the interest in the hotel, subsequently
purchased the remaining 50% that had belonged to Ak-Keme in accordance with the terms of the
July 1, 1999 “Main Agreement,” to which Turkey, the Kyrgyz Republic, the liquidator of Ak-
Keme, and Sistem were parties.’ Sistem did so by purchasing 100% of the shares in a new
company (“Hotel Ak-Keme de Luks”),”° established by the liquidator of Ak-Keme, to which
company Ak-Keme’s interest in the hotel had been transferred in accordance with the Main
Agreement.”!

18. The Share Purchase Agreement was concluded on the same day, July 1, 1999.7 It
provided, in Articles 2 and 3, for payment to be made by the transfer by Sistem of half of its net
profit gained from the management of the hotel. On the following day, July 2, 1999, Sistem and
the Kyrgyz Republic agreed that Sistem would pay off Ak-Keme’s debt to the Kyrgyz
Republic.

19. On April 13, 2001, representatives of the Republic of Turkey and of the Kyrgyz Republic
agreed a Protocol at a meeting of the Turkish-Kyrgyz Intergovernmental Mixed Economic
Commission. The agreed Protocol, signed by Abdulhak Mehmet Cay, Turkish Minister of State,
and Temirbek Akmataliev, Kyrgyz Minister of Finance, included the following statement:

The parties have affirmed their determination to fulfil the main agreement
signed on July 1, 1999, in Ankara, under the guarantee of the Governments of
the Turkish and Kyrgyz Republics, concerning Pinara Bishkek Hotel located

20. Sistem alleges that the Kyrgyz authorities subsequently created difficulties for the hotel’s
operation, for example by alleging that the hotel’s construction was defective and that the hotel
lacked the necessary licence.”

21. The hotel was subsequently approved for operation in an order of the Kyrgyz State
Approval Committee dated January 15, 2002.7° The hotel was being operated by Pmara
Bishkek Ltd, whose chairman was Mr. F. Yenice.”” The sole founder and member of Pinara
Bishkek Co. Ltd. is Sistem.”® According to the Supreme Court of the Kyr; py Republic, all rights
and obligations relating to the hotel were assigned to Pinara Bishkek Ltd.~” The Respondent has
taken no point on the distinction between Pinara Bishkek Ltd and Sistem.

22. According to the decision of Judge B. Karasartov, dated August 2, 2002,”

On July 24, 2002 an agreement was signed between ZAO ‘Ak-Keme’ and
“Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret AS’ (the sole creditor of ZAO
‘Ak-Keme’ considering the agreement mentioned above).*! According to this
agreement, in order to pay its debts, ZAO ‘Ak-Keme’’s liquidator transfers all
the assets that are not brought through the auction, to the Company. The total
amount of the assets is 11,256,286.56 USD and 27,182,686 soms. The transfer
of the foresaid assets was made considering the last auction values of them,
which is 11,002,148.94 USD and 175,850 soms. This agreement was
approved by ZAO ‘Ak-Keme’’s creditors’ meeting on July 25, 2002 and since
then, the debt of 12,220,276.23 USD from the company to its liquidator (debt
remaining from the Hotel), the debt of 27,187,686 soms and 11,256,286.56
USD from the liquidator to the company are accepted as having been paid.

23. In the decision dated August 2, 2002, the liquidation of Ak-Keme was declared complete
by Judge B Karasartov.** The decision records the establishment of Hotel Ak-Keme de Luks
and its sale to Sistem. It notes that the hotel was valued at USD10,570,000, and that 100% of the

unpaid creditors of Ak-Keme had transferred their rights to Sistem and that

mentioned legal entities: AGB Bishkek 19,039.64 USD (remaining: 6000
USD), Oktyabr Region Tax Office 1,703,986 soms** (remaining: 4,800,000
soms), Insurance 840,000 soms (remaining 316,700 soms). The debt to the
Economic Development Fund shall be paid depending on the annual business
results of the ‘Pinara Bishkek’ Hotel.”°

24. Sistem says that following a change in the political climate in the Kyrgyz Republic the
attitude towards foreign investors changed.*® Decision 874-II of the Legislative Assembly of the
Republic of Kyrgyzstan, dated October 7, 2002, determined that Sistem had not fulfilled its
commitments relating to the hotel project and had violated Kyrgyz laws and procedures. It
recommended that the Government cancel the Main Agreement and other agreements made on
July 1, 1999, and transfer the hotel from Sistem to a new company, formed by Ak-Keme and the
Malaysian investor, within ten days.*” It also recommended collection of taxes and other sums
said to be owed by Sistem to the Kyrgyz Republic, among other matters.

25. In a letter dated October 15, 2002, Sistem said that the account given by the Legislative
Assembly was inaccurate.** A criminal investigation into the hotel was nevertheless started on
the basis of the decision 874-II of the Legislative Assembly, and pursuant to that investigation,
two of Sistem’s bank accounts, in the name of “Pinara Bishkek Ltd,” were frozen following a
decision of the “Interrogation Judge of Acute Issues” of Bishkek City Prosecution Office on
December 20, 2002.°° In the meantime, on December 10, 2002, the Constitutional Court of the
Kyrgyz Republic ruled that the bankruptcy of Ak-Keme was unconstitutional and should not be
executed.

26. On December 24, 2002, a further decision of the “Interrogation Judge of Acute Issues” of
Bishkek City Prosecution Office annulled the previous decision, dated December 20, 2002, and
thus unfroze Sistem’s bank accounts.*!

27. The next events that are specifically concerned with the hotel project to which Sistem
points occurred in 2005. During the intervening period it appears that Sistem was occupying and
operating the hotel. Sistem says that it has run the hotel from 1999 until 2005 and that many
official documents of the Kyrgyz Republic recognized it as an investor, so that the Kyrgyz
Republic in fact treated it as an investor regardless of the revocation of its investment licence in
1996.

28. Sistem alleges that on March 25, 2005, Mr. Sarymsakov “invaded the hotel with 50
armed men” and that “[s]ome of the invaders introduced themselves as the Public Prosecutor and
the General and police, by showing their identity cards.” Sistem sought the assistance of the
authorities in ending this incursion into the hotel, and sought to prevent the use without its
permission of the stamps, headings and other documentation belonging to the hotel.’®

29. On April 6, 2005, the Acting President and Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr.
Kurmanbek Bakiyev, requested the Public Prosecutor, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and National
Security Committee to “return the rights of the investor and take urgent measures in order to
fulfil the previous commitments of the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan.”

30. On April 8, 2005, the Bishkek Public Prosecutor ordered Ak-Keme and Mr. Sarymsakov
to return the hotel to Pinara Bishkek Ltd.*° The hotel was not returned.

31. On June 14, 2005, the Bishkek City office of the General Public Prosecutor of the Kyrgyz
Republic wrote to Sistem noting inter alia that the question of the ownership of the hotel was in
issue before the Kyrgyz courts.”

32. On June 30, 2005, Sistem wrote to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic outlining the
dispute and recalling the terms of the Main Agreement and the dispute settlement provisions of
the BIT.*” On July 18, 2005, the Kyrgyz State Estate Fund Administrative Committee wrote to
Sistem saying inter alia that the dispute lay between Sistem and non-governmental people (R.
Sarymsakov and S. A. Jumanaliyeva) and that there was “no dispute between [Sistem] and the
Government of the [Kyrgyz Republic].’"**

33. It is on the basis of alleged facts including those set out above that Sistem claims that the
Kyrgyz Republic failed in its obligations, set out in the BIT, in Kyrgyz law and in the Main
Agreement, to protect Sistem’s investment in the Kyrgyz Republic.”

The Kyrgyz Republic’s Account of the Background to the Claim

34. | The Kyrgyz Republic does not accept the account of the facts given by the Claimant. In
particular, it asserts that Sistem was itself in serious breach of its obligations as an investor in the
Kyrgyz Republic.

35. Specifically, the Respondent says that Sistem failed to make any contribution to the
project,” and notes that Sistem’s investment licence was revoked in 1996 because of its failure
to prove that it had made the necessary investment.*' It regards Sistem as having been hired by
Ak-Keme as contractors, not investors.

36. According to the Respondent, the hotel was not completed and could not be opened in
1996. Sistem was essentially absent from the project during the period 1996-1999, during
which time Ak-Keme continued the construction of the hotel, at first on its own and then
together, with a Malaysian partner which paid Ak-Keme’s debts in the amount of USD2
million.

37. | The Respondent says that the 1998 declaration of bankruptcy in respect of AkK-Keme was
unlawful, pointing to the 2002 decision of the Supreme Court.

38. | The Respondent has also submitted the text of the decision of the Supreme Court of the
Kyrgyz Republic in the case No. 6-904, dated November 2, 2005, in which the Supreme Court
determined that Ak-Keme was not the owner of the hotel at the time of its bankruptcy, having
already transferred it to the joint venture that it had established in January 1997 with the
Malaysian investor (the Joint Kyrgyz Malaysian Venture or “JKMV”).°°

39. | The Respondent says that “in 1999 Sistem again appears and somehow enters into a
contract.”*” It suggests that the 1999 Main Agreement was procured irregularly:

Sistem somehow managed to agree with some governmental officials to sign
the [MJain [A]greement, and it claimed it to be the ground for them to operate
in the hotel.**

40. It also says that the Main Agreement has the status of an international agreement, and is
therefore, as a matter of Kyrgyz law, subject to ratification by the Kyrgyz Government, which
was not done.®? Further, it says that both the Main Agreement and the Share Purchase
Agreement were, in 2002, found to be illegal,” and that it was in this context that in 2002 the
Legislative Assembly passed the luti di Ilation of the 1999 Ag

41. In its decision in the case No. 6-904, dated November 2, 2005, submitted by the
Respondent, the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz Republic determined that the July 1999
agreements under which Sistem acquired Ak-Keme’s interest in the hotel were made on
“crushing terms,”°! in the interests only of Sistem and contrary to public and State interests, and
in a manner that did not comply with the requirements of Kyrgyz civil legislation. The
agreements were declared to be void.

42. The Respondent says that when Sistem was operating the between 1999 and 2005 it was
doing so illegally, on the basis of the 1999 Agreements.

43. Sistem applied to the Bishkek Inter-District Court for an order excluding employees of
the JKMV from the hotel. The application was refused in the Court’s decision dated December
19, 2005,°? which noted the earlier court decisions on the invalidity of the bankruptcy procedure
and the 1999 agreements.

44. By an amicable agreement between (i) the Ministry of Economy and Finances of the
Kyrgyz Republic, (ii) the Bankruptcy Affairs Administration under the State Committee of the
Kyrgyz Republic on State Property, and (iii) JKMV, dated July 12, 2006,° JKMV assumed the
liability to pay certain debts in the amount of USD10,261,883.00 and 1,001,150.35 som, owed

agreement was approved by the Bishkek City Court as of July 12, 2006."

G.D.-1945\06gb1, dated November 23, 2006, Sistem was ordered to pay JKEMV USDS5,092,900,
being the difference between the amount for which Sistem was paid (around USD8.7 million) for
the construction of the hotel under the agreed payment scheme between 10.09.1993 and

THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY

46. The case was initiated by the Request for Arbitration dated September 30, 2005, filed by
Sistem. The case was registered by ICSID on April 12, 2006, as case No. ARB/(AF)/06/1,
following extensive exchange of communications between Sistem and the Centre.

47. On June 13, 2006, more than sixty days having elapsed since the registration of the
request for arbitration and the parties having not agreed on the number of arbitrators and the
method of their appointment, the Claimant invoked Article 9 of the Arbitration (Additional
Facility) Rules, under which, the Tribunal is to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each
side and the third who shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the parties.
Also on June 13, 2006, the Claimant appointed Mr. Paolo Michele Pattocchi, a national of
Switzerland, as arbitrator. The Respondent did not respond to correspondence from ICSID and
on July 13, 2006, the Claimant invoked Article 6(4) of the Additional Facility Rules, by which
the arbitrators not yet appointed would be appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council upon the request of one of the parties. The Chairman appointed Judge
Nabil Elaraby, a national of Egypt, and Professor Vaughan Lowe, a national of the United
Kingdom, as arbitrators in the case, with Professor Lowe being designated as presiding
arbitrator. The Tribunal was constituted on October 26, 2006.

48. The first session of the Tribunal was held in Geneva on November 30, 2006. The
Claimant was represented by Dr. Ziya Akinci, Dr. Cemile Gokyayla, and Mrs. Karen D. Akinci
of the Akinci Law Office, Istanbul. The Respondent, which had been repeatedly notified by
ICSID of the date and location of the session, was not represented.

49. At the first session the Tribunal decided that it would separate questions of jurisdiction
and merits, and first hold a hearing on the question of jurisdiction.

50. The Claimant filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction on January 17, 2007.

51. TheR dent filed a Counter-M. ial on Jurisdiction on May 9, 2007.

 

52. At the request of the Tribunal, in order to clarify the issues in dispute as far as possible
before the hearing, the Claimant filed a brief response, the Reply on Jurisdiction, on May 17,
2007.

53. At the request of the Tribunal, in order to clarify the issues in dispute as far as possible
before the hearing, the Respondent filed a brief response, the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, on
May 23, 2007.

54. The hearing on jurisdiction was held at the World Bank offices in Paris on May 31, 2007,
and June 1, 2007. Dr. Ziya Akinci, Dr. Cemile Gokyayla, and Mrs. Karen D. Akinci of the
Akinci Law Office appeared on behalf of the Claimant. Ms. Indira Satarkulova appeared for the
Respondent. Also attending were Mr. Fehim Yenice, Mr. Giirkan Yenice, and Mr. Giirsel
Yenice, of Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S.; Mr. Ishenbay Dushenbievich
Kadyrbekov, former peoples’ deputy of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic and former deputy

 

of the Legislative Assembly of the Jogorku Kenesh-Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr.
Leonid Nuhimovich Komarover, a former Government official, Mr. Ruslan Sarymsakov,
President of the Joint Kyrgyz-Malaysian Venture LLC “Ak Keme” Hotel, LLC, and Mr. Nurdin
Sarymsakov, former employee of the “Ak-Keme” Joint Stock Company.

55. After the hearing the Parties filed comments on the transcript of the hearing and costs,
within the time limits set by the Tribunal and adjusted to take account of a delay in the
translation of the transcript of the hearing on jurisdiction. The Respondent filed a submission on
June 3, 2007, and the Claimant filed a submission on July 6, 2007.

56. The Tribunal has read the written submissions of the Parties and the transcript of the
hearing on jurisdiction, and, after deliberation among its members, has decided as follows.

JURISDICTION

57. The Claimant asserts that there are three grounds upon which the Tribunal may base its
jurisdiction in this case:

a. The BIT, including both
i. Article VII (“Settlement of Disputes Between One party and Investors of the
Other Party”), and
ii. Article Il (the MFN provision, under “Promotion and Protection of
Investments”).
b. Article 18 of the Kyrgyz Investment Law, dated March 27, 2003
c. Article 12 of the Main Agreement and Article 6 of the Share Purchase
Agreement.

58. Each basis will be addressed in turn. Before doing so the Tribunal will address the
question whether the dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the ICSID Additional Facility and
certain questions of general significance.

59. As was noted above,’ Turkey is a Party to the ICSID Convention, and the Kyrgyz
Republic has signed but not ratified the Convention. The claim accordingly falls to be
considered within the context of the ICSID Additional Facility. That Facility authorizes the
ICSID Secretariat to administer proceedings between a State and a national of another State
falling within the following categories:

(a) conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement of legal disputes
arising directly out of an investment which are not within the jurisdiction of
the Centre because either the State party to the dispute or the State whose
national is a party to the dispute is not a Contracting State;

(b) conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement of legal disputes
which are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre because they do not arise

Claimant’s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 5.
See supra para. 2.

directly out of an investment, provided that either the State party to the dispute
or the State whose national is a party to the dispute is a Contracting State ....

The Requirements of Nationality

60. There is no dispute that the requirements of the ICSID Additional Facility relating to
nationality are met in the present case, the Claimant being a national of an ICSID Contracting
party, Turkey, and the Respondent being another State, the Kyrgyz Republic, which is not an
ICSID Party.

The Requirement That There be a Dispute Arising Out of an Investment

61. | There are two aspects to the question whether there is a dispute arising out of an
investment. The first is the question whether there is an investment, and the second is the
question whether the dispute arises out of the investment.

Is There an Investment?

The Positions of the Parties

 

62. In this case the Claimant asserts that it has made an investment in the Kyrgyz Republic,
inter alia by constructing and operating the hotel, buying the shares in the hotel that formerly
belonged to Ak-Keme, transferring know-how, and paying Ak-Keme’s debts.°*

63. | The Respondent denies that Sistem made an “investment” in the Kyrgyz Republic. It
concedes that Sistem was issued by the Kyrgyz authorities with an investment licence in 1993,
but says that it is not enough for the Claimant to be registered as an investor: it must also be
shown that “there were financial operations or financial activity, and contributions attracted or
owned by the investor made into the economical development of the State." It says that Sistem
itself made no such contributions of money, time or work to the project.”

64. The Respondent characterizes Sistem’s role as that of a contractor, building the hotel for
Ak-Keme as the employer, and funded by Ak-Keme using monies deriving ultimately from the
Turkish Eximbank funds.”' It says further that Sistem failed to fulfil its obligations towards Ak-
Keme, and that it was necessary to bring in other (Malaysian) investors in order to complete the
hotel.”* “Sistem [was] never [in] a position of joint investor,” according to the Respondent.”>

65. During the hearing on jurisdiction the Respondent gave this account of the position:

By means of Ak-Keme Joint Stock Company, the hotel was constructed; by
means of Kyrgyz-Malaysian company, the hotel was completed. Sistem
invaded the hotel. Sistem somehow managed to agree with some
governmental officials to sign the [M]ain [A]greement, and it claimed it to be
the ground for them to operate in the hotel, in the Ak-Keme Hotel. They
operated with profits, they took profits from the operation and management of
the hotel.

66. | When asked by the Tribunal

how does the Kyrgyz Republic answer the objection that Sistem has as a
matter of fact been carrying on economic activity for several years in the
Kyrgyz Republic, to the knowledge of at least some branches of the Kyrgyz
Government, without being closed down by the government?

the Respondent replied:

By referring to the [M]Jain [A]greements, Sistem operated the hotel, and it
claimed to have property rights and ownership of the hotel. Because there
was no thorough investigation made in this case.

67. The Respondent considers that Sistem was operating the hotel illegally, having in effect
ousted Ak-Keme.” The Respondent also pointed out that the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic could not simply order Sistem to leave the hotel: the matter had to proceed through the
State’s courts.’” Moreover, the Respondent distinguished between the making of an investment
and the carrying out of economic activity, suggesting that Sistem merely operated an already-
built hotel in order to obtain profit from it, and that this “has nothing to do with the definition of
‘investment activity.””

The Tribunal’s Analysis

68. A key question in the present proceedings is whether the Claimant is an investor which
has made an investment in the Kyrgyz Republic. The question of what constitutes an investment
arises in this case under the BIT and the Kyrgyz Investment Law. The Tribunal notes that it is
not necessary for the existence of jurisdiction under the ICSID Additional Facility that the
dispute concern an investment.

69. The ICSID Additional Facility does not define the term “investment.”
70. The BIT defines the term “investment” in Article I, as follows:

2. The term ‘investment’, in conformity with the hosting Party’s Laws and
Regulations, shall include every kind of asset in particular, but not
exclusively:

(i) shares, stocks or any other form of participation in
companies,

(ii) returns reinvested, claims to money or any other rights to
legitimate performance having financial value related to an
investment,

(iii) moveable and immoveable property, as well as any other
rights in rem such as mortgages, liens, pledges and any other
similar rights,

(iv) copyrights, industrial and intellectual property rights such as
patents, licenses, industrial designs, technical processes, as
well as trademarks, goodwill, know-how and other similar
rights,

(v) business concessions conferred by law or by contract,
including concessions to search for, cultivate extract or
exploit natural resources on the territory of each Party as
defined hereafter.

3. The term ‘returns’ means the amounts yielded by an investment and
includes in particular, though not exclusively, profit, interest, and dividends.”

71. The Kyrgyz Investment Law*? defines the term “investments” and “investor” in Chapter
1, Article 1, as follows:

1. Investments mean tangible and intangible assets, in particular:

- money;
- moveable and immoveable property;
- property rights (mortgages, liens, pledges and others);

 

- stock and other forms of participation in a legal entity;

- bonds and other debenture liabilities;

- non-property rights (right to intellectual property including
goodwill, copyrights, patents, trade marks, industrial designs,
technological processes, trade names and know-how);

- any right to activity based on a license or in other form given by

 

State agencies;
- concessions based on Law, including concessions for search,

- profit and revenue received from investment and re-invested on the

2. Direct Investments mean the holding, acquisition by an investor of not less
than one third percent of stock and stockholders votes in joint stock
companies registered or newly created on the territory of the Kyrgyz
Republic, or any equivalent of such participation in busi entities of other
types and all further operations between an investor and a company which is
invested to, investment of capital to the fixed assets of branches,
representative offices of a legal entity created on the territory of the Kyrgyz
Republic.

3. Investor means a subject of investment activity making his own, borrowed
or attracted contributions as direct investments.

72. It is in principle possible that certain economic activity might constitute an “investment”
for the purposes of some legal instruments but not others. In the particular context of this case,
however, the Tribunal finds no sig! di in the definitions of an ii under
the legal instruments applicable in this case.

73. The Tribunal considers that the initial intentions of Sistem and Ak-Keme regarding the
nature of Sistem’s activity in relation to the hotel project are evident from the key agreements
concluded in 1992 and 1993.

74. Article 1 of Special Agreement No. | of May 27, 1992, between Sistem and Ak-Keme
refers to their agreement to “jointly construct” the hotel.*’ According to the Respondent, Article
2.1 of the Agreement of May 27, 1992 provides that “Joint Venture is established with the
purpose of joint construction and operation of the hotel in Bishkek city.”*?

75. A third document from 1992, the Charter of the Joint Kyrgyz-Turkish Venture “Ak-
Keme-Pinara,” signed on October 16, 1992,*? names Sistem and Ak-Keme as the members of the
joint venture (‘JV’) Ak-Keme-Pinara. It sets out in Article 2 the aim of the joint venture, which
is “joint Hotel construction and running in Bishkek.” It then defines, in 13 sub-paragraphs, the
“Venture activity subject,” as follows:

76. These provisions point to an involvement by Sistem that goes beyond the mere
construction of the hotel and extends into its operation.

77. Article 4.4 of the Charter contains a provision which reads as follows:

... ‘Sistem Muhendislik’ having signed this agreement, not in the capacity of
a materials supplier or a Trade Company but in the capacity of a contractor
Partner during the construction stage giving services for preparing the project
and its related technical supplements and documents and also for constructing
the hotel will not be asked in any way to disclose itemized or otherwise the
prices of an [sic] material it has to supply (due to local unavailability) for the
construction, finishing and equipping the hotel.

78. This provision (in translation) distinguishes between a mere supplier of materials and a
construction Partner. In the view of the Tribunal, the provision is concerned with the process of
calculating the resources invested by Ak-Keme and Sistem respectively, and is intended to
release Sistem in certain circumstances from any duty to itemise the value of materials that it
supplies for the project. Moreover, it relates only to the construction phase and says nothing of
the operation phase of the project. Whatever the precise meaning of that provision (and the
Tribunal takes no position here on that question), it is plain that the reference to Sistem as a
“contractor Partner” was not intended to characterize the nature of the entirety of Sistem’s
involvement in the hotel project. This provision does not, in the view of the Tribunal, lead to the
conclusion that Sistem was merely a hired contractor engaged in the construction of the hotel.

Case 1:12-cv-04502-ALC-RWL Document 21-1 Filed 07/31/13 Page 21 of 33

79. A further indication of the original intentions of Sistem and Ak-Keme regarding the
nature of their venture appears in Article | of the contract between Sistem and Ak-Keme, dated
February 1, 1993 (Contract No. 1) (in which Sistem is referred to as “the Contractors” and Ak-
Keme as “the Customers”). It reads as follows:

1, Subject of the Contract

The Contractors will construct as a ‘key delivery project’ a 4 star 400 beds
Hotel in Bishkek on the plot supplied by the Customers and will supply
technical and project documentation also a feasibility report, consultancy and
assistance, supervision, training of Customers’ personnel, Technical Know-
How and at completion of the Hotel will be 50% shareholder and will
participate in management. **

80. The final words, “and at completion of the Hotel will be 50% shareholder and will
participate in management,” again indicate an intention that the involvement of Sistem should
extend beyond the construction of the hotel.

81. That reinforces the indications to the same effect in the 1992 documents, quoted above.
The Tribunal considers that these documents evidence an intention that Sistem should not only
construct the hotel in Bishkek but, having constructed it, should thereafter be a participant in the
management and operation of the hotel.

82. Accordingly, the construction of the hotel by Sistem from November 1992 onwards®*
was itself an activity undertaken in contemplation of Sistem becoming a continuing participant in
the management of the hotel.

83. | The Main Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement of July 1, 1999, confirm this view.
It is very clear that those two agreements contemplated that Sistem would manage the hotel for
some time after the date of those agreements. This is evident from the provisions in Articles 2.2
and 3.3.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement®® under which the Buyer (Sistem)*” would remit half
of the net profit from the management of the Hotel as payment for the shares purchased
according to the terms of that Agreement. That arrangement also makes plain that Sistem was
operating the hotel for a variable profit, and not as a contractor receiving a fixed payment.
Sistem did indeed manage the hotel, up until the events of 2005.

84. The Tribunal notes that the Main Agreement of July 1, 1999,** made by representatives
of Turkey, the Kyrgyz Republic , and Sistem, and the liquidator of Ak-Keme, expressly refers to
the hotel project, of which Sistem was about to become the 100% owner, as an “investment.”

between the Republic of Turkey and the Republic of Kyrgyz.”®° Article 6 of the Main
Agreement also states that

The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic shall take all the necessary measures
in order to enable all necessary activities to manage the Hotel. The
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic guarantees not to demand any additional
request other than applied so far, moreover, in the frame of Kyrgyz laws, the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic guarantees full and sustainable
protection of the investment.

85. | The Respondent says that Sistem did not actually transfer its own money or resources
into the Kyrgyz Republic to build the hotel, and that there was similarly no transfer of Sistem’s
own money or resources into the Kyrgyz Republic in order to pay for the purchase of Ak-Keme’s
50% shareholding in the hotel venture in accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement. The
Respondent considers that Sistem might have become an investor if it had transferred money or
resources into the State, but that it did not do so and is therefore not an investor.

86. The Tribunal does not share this view. It considers that Sistem made a contribution at the
outset of the project, at least in the form of know-how and work on the construction of the hotel,
and that it made a further contribution when it bought Ak-Keme’s 50% interest in 1999.

87. The fact that those actively planning and realising the project may not be relying upon
their own financial resources does not prevent them having the status of investors. It is common
for projects to be funded by persons other than those who undertake the actual work of planning
and realising a project. Funding may take the form of bank loans, or loans from passive
investors not themselves actively engaged in the running of the project, or from international
agencies, or — as here — from domestic or foreign government sources.

88. In this connection the Tribunal notes that Article 1(3) of the 2003 Kyrgyz Investment
Law defines an investor as “a subject of investment activity making his own, borrowed or
attracted contributions as direct investments.””' “Investment activity” is defined by Article 1(4)
as “practical operation of investor in respect of his investments.”*”

89. Similarly, the fact that the 1999 purchase was to be funded by repayments out of the
profits of the hotel operation does not alter the fact that Sistem was paying for the shareholding
out of revenues generated by Sistem by the operation of the hotel as a commercial concern.

90. Sistem was a 50% participant in the Joint Venture established in 1992. In 1999 it bought
Ak-Keme’s interest in the project, making it the 100% owner of the hotel. The Respondent
argues that the 1999 Main Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement were found retrospectively
to be illegal,” and suggests that this is a further reason (in addition to the absence of any real

contribution from Sistem) why the 1999 Agreements cannot support Sistem’s claim to be an
investor. The Respondent also considers that the illegality precludes reliance upon the
undisputed fact that Sistem was, prior to what it regards as its dispossession in 2005, actually in
occupation of the hotel and running it.”*

91. | The Tribunal does not accept this analysis. As Judge (now President) Higgins pointed
out in her Separate Opinion in the Oil Platforms case, at the jurisdiction stage it is necessary to
accept pro tem the facts as alleged by the applicant and to decide if those facts could involve a
breach of the relevant treaty. The equivalent step in the present case is to take the evidence put
forward by the Claimant and to consider, in the light of the observations of the Respondent,
whether those facts could disclose the existence of an “investment.” Judge Higgins observed
that it is not necessary to determine that the facts actually do constitute a breach of the treaty
when dealing with jurisdiction, and that no such determination could be made without venturing
into the merits:

What is for the merits — and which remains pristine and untouched by this
approach to the jurisdictional issue — is to determine what exactly the facts
are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of [the treaty];
and if so, whether there is a defence to that violation .... In short, it is at the
merits that one sees ‘whether there really has been a breach.’”°

92. In the present case, there is no suggestion that the 1999 Main Agreement and Share
Purchase Agreement are forgeries. Their effect under Kyrgyz law is disputed, but that dispute is
a matter appropriate to be addressed during a consideration of the merits. So, too, is the
character of Sistem’s occupation and management of the hotel. These are matters that go to the
heart of the substantive dispute between the Parties. However, Sistem’s characterization of itself
as an investor in the Bishkek hotel project prior to the events of 2005 is not based solely upon
Sistem’s own allegations; Sistem has substantiated this point and relied upon documentary
evidence which is sufficient for the Tribunal to determine that it may proceed to consider the
merits of the case if there is an instrument that gives jurisdiction over investment disputes arising
between Sistem and the Kyrgyz Republic.

93. The Tribunal appreciates that there may be questions as to the extent to which Sistem
fulfilled its obligations to Ak-Keme and to the Kyrgyz Republic in respect of the hotel project.
The Tribunal considers, however, that any such failures on the part of Sistem cannot cancel out
the fact that Sistem has invested in the Kyrgyz Republic, as has been explained above. Sistem
having made legally binding commitments in respect of its obligations, such failures could have
been addressed in the courts of the Kyrgyz Republic. But in any event, while any such failures
on the part of Sistem may be relevant to questions of the value of Sistem’s investment and the
extent of any loss that it may have suffered, and to questions concerning the merits of Sistem’s
claim, they do not prevent Sistem qualifying as an “investor.”

94. The Tribunal has considered the position of Sistem in the light of the discussion in the
Bayindir case” of the so-called Salini test,°” which requires (i) that the investor make a
contribution to the project, (ii) that the project have a certain duration in time, (iii) that the
operational risks be shared, and (iv) that the project contribute to the host State’s development.
It considers that Sistem’s investment satisfies all of those requirements.

95. The Tribunal also observes in passing that complaints by a State that an investor has
failed to fulfil its obligations under the host State law or under contractual arrangements fall
clearly within the category of disputes that ICSID tribunals and BITs were intended to address.
It would be inconsistent with the basic purposes of international law on the promotion and
protection of investments if a tribunal otherwise properly constituted under a BIT were prevented
from hearing a claim in respect of cancelled rights whenever a Respondent argued that the
cancellation of the rights deprived the Claimant of its status as an investor.

96. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that Sistem had made an investment, in the form of its
investment of know-how and services in the construction of the hotel, its operation of the hotel,

its purchase of Ak-Keme’s share of the participation in the project, its payment of Ak-Keme’s
debts, and its reinvestment of (a share of) its profits from the running of the hotel.

Does the Claim Arise Directly Out of the Investment?

97. Inthe view of the Tribunal, there is no room for doubt that the dispute arises directly out
of Sistem’s investment.

Jurisdiction Under the ICSID Additional Facility
98. The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the claim falls within the scope of the ICSID

Additional Facility. The next question is whether there is an instrument that confers jurisdiction
on the Tribunal to determine the claim.

(a) Jurisdiction Under the BIT
Article VII (‘Settlement of Disputes Between One Party and Investors of the Other Party”)
99. Article VII of the BIT reads as follows:
Settlement of Disputes Between One Party and Investors of the Other Party.
See Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan (ICSID Case No.
ARB/03/29), Decision on Jurisdiction of Nov. 14,2005.

1. Disputes between one of the Parties and one investor of the other
Party, in connection with his investment, shall be notified in writing,
including a detailed information, by the investor to the recipient Party
of the investment. As far as possible, the investor and the concerned
Party shall endeavour to settle these disputes by consultations and
negotiations in good faith.

2. If these disputes cannot be settled in this way within six months
following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph
1, the dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to:

(a) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID) set up by the ‘Convention on Settlement of Investment
Disputes Between States and Nationals of other States’, [in case
both Parties become signatories of this Convention.]

(b) an ad hoc court of arbitration laid down under the Arbitration
Rules of Procedure of the United Nations Commission for
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), [in case both parties are
members of U.N.]

(c) the Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of
Commerce,

provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before
the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a
final award has not been rendered within one year.

3. The arbitration awards shall be final and binding for all parties in
dispute. Each Party commits itself to execute the award according to
its national law. °°

“Disputes between one of the Parties and one investor of the other Party”

100. The Claimant’s status as a national of “the other Party” to the BIT (i.e., Turkey) is not
disputed by the Kyrgyz Republic.

101. The Respondent has argued that the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is not a party to
the dispute, which it characterises as a private dispute between Sistem and Ak-Keme, to be
settled according to the procedures set out in the contracts between Sistem and Ak-Keme.”

102. The Tribunal does not accept this submission. It is well established in ICSID case law
that the fact that a particular action or omission may constitute a breach of contract cannot
preclude the possibility that it may also constitute a breach of a BIT provision.'® In this case

Sistem is claiming that the Kyrgyz Republic failed in its duty under the BIT to protect Sistem’s
investment, That clearly makes the Kyrgyz Republic, represented by its Government, a party to
this dispute.

“in connection with his investment”

103. The Tribunal has determined that Sistem made an investment in the Kyrgyz Republic,
and that the claim arises directly from it and is therefore certainly a dispute “in connection with”
the investment.

“shall be notified in writing, including a detailed information, by the investor to
the recipient Party of the investment”

104. The Tribunal notes the view of the Tribunal in the Bayindir'®' and of the Tribunal in SGS
v Pakistan,’ that a requirement of notice such as appears in Article VII(1) is “directory but not
mandatory and jurisdictional.” Sistem had in any event made its complaint very plain to the
authorities in the Kyrgyz Republic in the letters dated March 27 and 28, 2005, from Pinara
Bishkek Ltd to agencies of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic.'?

“If these disputes cannot be settled in this way within six months following the
date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1”

105. Six months elapsed between the letters dated March 27 and 28, 2005 from Pinara
Bishkek Ltd to agencies of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic'™ and the Request for
Arbitration dated September 30, 2005.

“provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts
of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been
rendered within one year”

106. The Respondent takes the view that the words “provided that, if the investor concerned
has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a
final award has not been rendered within one year” in Article VII(2) apply only to Article

for Id., para. 99.

VII(2)(c).'°° The Tribunal need take no position on the question because Sistem has not
instituted any proceedings in the national courts against the Kyrgyz Republic.

Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis

107. The Respondent argues'” that the Claimant is attempting to give retroactive effect to the
BIT, changing the legal status and consequences of acts that occurred before the BIT entered into
force on October 31, 1996. The Tribunal does not accept this analysis. Nothing in the BIT
limits the scope of its application to investments made after the date of signature or of the entry
into force of the BIT; and in so far as the jurisdictional provisions of the BIT are concerned, they
do not alter the character of acts that occurred before the BIT enters into force, but only the
procedures available in respect of complaints of violations of the BIT. Furthermore, many of the
acts in question in this case occurred after the entry into force of the BIT. The Tribunal’s
jurisdiction ratione temporis is established. The question whether particular substantive
obligations under the BIT did or did not apply to specific acts is a question appropriate to the
merits, and not to this jurisdictional phase.

The effect of the contractual dispute settlement clause

108. The Respondent further argues that the reference in Article 12 of the 1993 Construction
Contract'” to the settlement of disputes by the Arbitration Commission of the Chamber of
Commerce of the Kyrgyz Republic precludes a reference of the dispute to ICSID. It is clear and
axiomatic that the dispute settlement provision in the contract between Ak-Keme and Sistem
cannot affect the right of Sistem to refer disputes between Sistem and the Kyrgyz Republic,
concerning the obligations of the Kyrgyz Republic under the BIT, to the procedures made
available under the BIT.

Claims are based on the BIT

109. The claim refers in general terms to a violation of the obligation to protect Sistem’s
investment.'°8 Article II of the BIT (entitled “Promotion and Protection of Investments”) clearly
offers a basis for Sistem’s claim. There is, accordingly, a claim based upon an alleged breach of
the BIT and thus within the scope of the BIT.

“in case both Parties become signatories of this Convention.]”

110. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction therefore depends upon Article VII(2)(a), which permits the
investor to submit a dispute to ICSID “[in case both Parties become signatories of this
Convention. ]"!?

23

111. The drafting of this provision may be thought not to be entirely clear, and the appearance
of brackets around the quoted words might be thought to give the text more of the appearance of
a draft than of a final text. Nonetheless, this is the text of a BIT that is now 15 years old, and
which has been signed and ratified by both Parties. The Tribunal must work with the text as it
exists.

112. The text of Article VII(2)(a) indubitably demonstrates the common intention of the
Parties to the BIT that it should be possible to refer disputes to ICSID in some circumstances.
The question is, what is the effect of the words “[in case both Parties become signatories of this
Convention]? The Parties do not dispute that the BIT is to be interpreted in accordance with the
rules of international law on treaty interpretation, as reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Tribunal recalls that Article 31(4) stipulates that “A
special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.”!!°

113. The Tribunal notes that elsewhere in the BIT there are references to the “ratification” of
treaties (Article IX(1)), and to States being “members” of international organizations. It cannot,
therefore, ignore the fact that in Article VII(2)(a) the condition refers not to the ratification of the
ICSID Convention by both States but to the signature of the Convention by both States. It would
be wholly wrong for the Tribunal to re-write the text of the treaty that the Parties have adopted
by substituting a reference to the ratification of the ICSID Convention for the reference to its
signature.

114. Reading the text as it is written makes sense. Turkey was already a Party to the ICSID
Convention when the BIT was signed. The provision accordingly enabled disputes to be referred
to ICSID’s Additional Facility if the Kyrgyz Republic subsequently signed the ICSID
Convention, which it did in 1995. That is the position here.

115. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction under Article VII(2)(a) of the
BIT over claims based upon alleged violations of obligations arising under the BIT.

Article I (“Promotion and Protection of Investments” / MEN

116. The Tribunal has found that it has jurisdiction under the BIT by relying solely upon
Article VII. The Claimant says that the Tribunal may also found its jurisdiction on the MFN
clause in Article II of the Kyrgyz Republic’s Turkish BIT, which entitles it to rely upon the
dispute settlement provisions in the Kyrgyz Republic — U.S. BIT.'' The Respondent says that
the MEN clause does not allow the submission of contractual disputes to ICSID, and that the
MEN clause cannot apply to the present dispute.''? It also rejects the argument that the MFN
provision can confer procedural rights upon the Claimant, and argues in detail that the case-law
cited by the Claimant does not support that argument.''? In view of its finding in relation to

Article VII, the Tribunal does not need to decide upon the question whether jurisdiction may be
established on the basis of the combined effect of the MFN clause in the Kyrgyz Republic-
Turkey BIT and the jurisdictional provisions of the Kyrgyz Republic — U.S. BIT.

(b) Jurisdiction Under the Kyrgyz Investment Law
117. Article 18 of the 2003 Kyrgyz Investment Law reads as follows:

1. Investment dispute shall be resolved in accordance with any applicable
procedure agreed in advance between an investor and authorized state bodies
of the Kyrgyz Republic that does not exclude the use of other means of legal
defense by an investor in accordance with the legislation of the Kyrgyz
Republic.

2. If such agreement is not reached the investment dispute between
authorized state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic and investor shall be resolved
by conducting consultation between parties. If parties will not agree in 3
month period from the day of first written address for such consultation, the
dispute shall be resolved by addressing to a court of the Kyrgyz Republic,
unless one of the parties to a dispute between the foreign investor and the state
body requests to consider the dispute in accordance with one of the following
procedures:

(a) _ by applying to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) pursuant to the Convention on settlement of investment
disputes between states and citizens of other states or the rules regulating
the use of additional means for conduct of hearings by the Secretariat of
the Centre; or

(b) by applying to arbitrage or an international temporary arbitral
tribunal (commercial court) formed in accordance with the arbitration
tules of UN Commission on international trade law.

3. In the event that an investment dispute is to be resolved through
arbitrage as referred to in subpoints ‘a’ and ‘b’ of point 2 of this Article, the
Kyrgyz Republic shall waive any claim for preliminary application of the
internal administrative or judicial procedures prior to referral of the dispute to
international arbitration.

4. Any investment dispute between the foreign and domestic investors shall
be considered by the judicial bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic unless the parties
reach an agreement on any other dispute settlement procedure, including
national and international arbitration.''

me Law No. 66, supra note 81, at 10-11.

25

118. An “investment dispute” is defined by Article 1(6) as “any dispute between an investor
and governmental bodies, officials of the Kyrgyz Republic and other participants of investment
activity, arising in process of investment realization.”

119. Article 18 contemplates the reference of investment disputes to an ICSID arbitral
tribunal, without preliminary application to legal procedures in the Kyrgyz Republic. It must,
therefore, contemplate that the Kyrgyz Investment Law will be interpreted by an ICSID tribunal.
This the Tribunal will do.

120. The Respondent argues that Article 18 is inapplicable because Sistem made no
investment in the Kyrgyz Republic.''® The Tribunal has explained above that it considers the
Claimant to be an investor which has made an investment in the Kyrgyz Republic. It considers
the Claimant to be an investor for the purposes of the Kyrgyz Investment Law.

121. As far as the three-month consultation procedure is concerned, the Tribunal observes that
Sistem had made its complaint clear to the authorities in the Kyrgyz Republic in the letters dated
March 27 and 28, 2005 from Pinara Bishkek Ltd to agencies of the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic.''® Six months elapsed between the letters dated March 27 and 28, 2005 from Pinara
Bishkek Ltd to agencies of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic''” and the Request for
Arbitration dated September 30, 2005. The three-month consultation procedure (which the
Tribunal in any event regards as directory but not mandatory and jurisdictional)''® has been
satisfied.

122. The Respondent argues that Article 18(2)(a) is inapplicable because the Kyrgyz Republic
is not a party to the dispute, which it characterises as a dispute between Sistem and Ak-Keme to
which Article 18(4) applies.'!?

123. The Tribunal does not accept this analysis. The claims made by the Claimant are directed
against the Kyrgyz Republic, not against Ak-Keme.'° The Kyrgyz Investment Law provides
substantive legal rights and guarantees for investors. Those rights arise from obligations
imposed upon or accepted by the Kyrgyz Republic and its agencies, such as the obligation in
Article 4(4):

The Kyrgyz Republic in the person of its authorized governmental bodies,
officials and self-government bodies shal] abstain from any interference with
economic activity, rights and legal interests of investors, except as provided
by the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic. '”!

124. The claims based on the Kyrgyz Investment Law are distinct from those based upon the
BIT. The former necessarily refer to the rights, guarantees and obligations arising under the
Kyrgyz Investment Law; the latter refer to the rights and obligations arising under the BIT.

125. Article 18(2)(a) provides for the possibility of the reference of investment disputes to the
ICSID Additional Facility, at the option of the investor.

126. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction under Article 18(2)(a) of the
Kyrgyz Investment Law over claims based upon alleged violations of rights and obligations
arising under the Kyrgyz Investment Law.

(c) Jurisdiction Under the Main Agreement
127. Article 12 of the Main Agreement dated July 1, 1996 reads as follows:

All the disputes arising from this Agreement shall be settled through
negotiations. If the dispute can not be settled through negotiations, a
committee consisting of the representatives of the Kyrgyz and the Turkish
Governments shall resolve the dispute. If this committee cannot resolve the
dispute either, each party shall appoint an arbitrator from their country or from
another country. These arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator from a third
country or from a third country that the parties agreed. The parties undertake
to execute the Arbitral Tribunal’s award.'”

128. Article 6.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement is drafted in identical terms.'”

129. It is evident that this Tribunal has not been constituted in accordance with the procedure
set out in those provisions. Its members were appointed in accordance with the ICSID
Additional Facility rules. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not a tribunal constituted under the Main
Agreement or the Share Purchase Agreement, and it does not have jurisdiction under Article 12
of the Main Agreement or under Article 6 of the Share Purchase Agreement.

130. As a result of this determination it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the
question of the validity of the Main Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement at this stage.

131. The question of whether the Main Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement may be
relied upon for substantive rights in proceedings that are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as
established by the BIT and the Kyrgyz Investment Law is a matter to be addressed at the merits
stage.

EFFECT OF THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION

132. The Tribunal notes the observations of Judge (now President) Higgins in the Oil
Platforms case in the International Court of Justice where she concluded, after a careful analysis
of the matter, that “[w]here the Court has to decide, on the basis of a treaty whose application
and interpretation is contested, whether it has jurisdiction, that decision must be definitive.”'*
The Tribunal considers that analysis to be applicable here. Its decision on jurisdiction is
definitive, and as res judicata is not subject to being reopened at any hearing on the merits.

133. This decision is limited to the question of jurisdiction. The result is that the Tribunal
finds that it is competent to hear and decide claims based upon alleged violations of the BIT and

the Kyrgyz Investment Law. It remains open to the parties to present at the merits stage
arguments concerning the applicability of substantive provisions of the law.

COSTS
134, The Tribunal has noted the submissions of the parties concerning costs. It has decided
that it will take no decision as to costs at this stage, but will decide on the matter at the end of the
proceedings in this case.

DECISION

For the reasons set out above herein, the Tribunal decides, unanimously, after having reviewed
the Claimant’s and Respondent’s arguments, both as presented in writing and orally:

1, that it has jurisdiction under Article VII(2)(a) of the BIT over claims based upon
alleged violations of obligations arising under the BIT;

2. that it has jurisdiction under Article 18(2)(a) of the Kyrgyz Investment Law over
claims based upon alleged violations of rights and obligations arising under the
Kyrgyz Investment Law;

3. that it does not have jurisdiction under Article 12 of the Main Agreement or under
Article 6 of the Share Purchase Agreement;

4. that it will take no decision as to costs at this stage, but will decide on the matter at
the close of the proceedings in this case.
