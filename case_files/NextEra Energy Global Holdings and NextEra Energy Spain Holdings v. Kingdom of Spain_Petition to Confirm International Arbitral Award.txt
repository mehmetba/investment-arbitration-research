PETITION TO CONFIRM INTERNATIONAL ARBITRAL
AWARD PURSUANT TO THE 1965 ICSID CONVENTION

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 2 of 12

1. Pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a and Article 54 of the 1965 Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 575 U.N.T.S.
159 (the "ICSID Convention"), Petitioners NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V., and NextEra
Energy Spain Holdings B.V. (collectively "NextEra" or "Petitioners") bring this action against
the Kingdom of Spain ("Respondent" or "Spain") to recognize and confirm an international
arbitral award (the "Award"), issued on May 31, 2019 in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11, entitled
NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. & NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. v. Kingdom of
Spain.!

2. The Award resulted from a full hearing, and reflected the Tribunal's prior
Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles dated March 12, 2019 rendered in the
same proceedings (the "Liability Decision"), which is attached as an annex to the Award (Nelson
Decl. Ex. 1, Annex).

3. Pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, arbitral
awards issued under the ICSID Convention "shall be enforced and shall be given the same full
faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of . . . one of the several States"
of the United States. 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a). Accordingly, NextEra requests this Court: (i) enter
an order recognizing and confirming the Award, and (ii) enter judgment for NextEra in the
amounts of (a) EUR 290,600,000, plus interest at the rate of 0.234%, compounded monthly, from
June 30, 2016 to the date of judgment; (b) USD 4,279,400.67, plus interest at the rate of 0.234%,
compounded monthly, from May 31, 2019 to the date of judgment; (c) EUR 1,042,135.30, plus

interest at the rate of 0.234%, compounded monthly, from May 31, 2019 to the date of judgment;

A copy of the Award appears as Exhibit 1 to the accompanying Declaration of Timothy
G. Nelson ("Nelson Decl."). A copy of the ICSID Convention appears as Exhibit 2 to the
Nelson Declaration.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 3 of 12

and (d) post-judgment interest on all of the preceding sums at the rate applicable under 28 U.S.C.
§ 1961.
PARTIES

4. Petitioners NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. and NextEra Energy Spain
Holdings B.V. are private limited liability companies incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands. (See Liability Decision {| 2.)

5. Respondent the Kingdom of Spain is a foreign state within the meaning of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 ("FSIA"), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330 and 1602-1611. (See
Liability Decision { 3.) Spain signed the ICSID Convention on March 21, 1994, and deposited
its instrument of ratification on August 18, 1994. The ICSID Convention entered into force for
Spain on September 17, 1994.7

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b), which
gives "district courts of the United States . . . exclusive jurisdiction" to enforce ICSID
Convention awards.

7. Furthermore, this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under the
FSIA because ICSID arbitration proceedings are a "nonjury civil action against a foreign state"
on a claim against which the foreign state enjoys no immunity under the FSIA. 28 U.S.C.
§ 1330(a). Under 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6), "[a] foreign state shall not be immune from the
jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any case . . . to confirm an award"
based on an agreement to arbitrate where "the agreement or award is or may be governed by a

treaty or other international agreement in force for the United States calling for the recognition

See Int'l Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, Database of ICSID Member States
(Nelson Decl. Ex. 4).

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 4 of 12

and enforcement of arbitral awards." Jd. The ICSID Convention is such a treaty in force in the
United States for the recognition and enforcement arbitral awards. See Blue Ridge Invs., L.L.C. v.
Republic of Arg., 735 F.3d 72, 85 (2d Cir. 2013) ("To our knowledge, every court to consider
whether awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention fall within the arbitral award exception
to [foreign sovereign immunity under] the FSIA has concluded that they do.").

8. Moreover, Spain's accession to the ICSID Convention operates to waive
immunity from an action to recognize an award governed by the ICSID Convention. See 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) (subject matter jurisdiction exists if a "foreign state has waived its immunity
either explicitly or by implication"); see also Blue Ridge Invs., 735 F.3d at 84 (foreign countries
waive sovereign immunity under the FSIA "by becoming a party to the ICSID Convention").

9. Because subject-matter jurisdiction exists over Spain, personal jurisdiction also is
established. See 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b).

10. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4), which allows civil
actions against foreign states or their political subdivisions to be brought "in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia."

11. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., does "not apply to enforcement
of awards rendered pursuant to the [ICSID] Convention," 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a), so its
jurisdictional requirements play no role here. See OJ European Grp. B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic
of Venez., No. 16-1533, 2019 WL 2185040 at *7-8 (D.D.C. May 21, 2019).

THE UNDERLYING DISPUTE
12. The Award arises from NextEra's investments in concentrated solar power ("CSP")

projects in Spain.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 5 of 12

13. In 2007, Spain enacted legislation to encourage investment in solar power projects
within its territory. The legislation was intended to "minimise regulatory uncertainty" by
providing "transparency and predictability" regarding economic incentives in order to
"encourage[] investment in new capacity." (Liability Decision { 116.) In reliance on that
legislation and explicit assurances by Spanish authorities—including "[s]tatements made in
writing to NextEra by Spanish officials"—NextEra invested in the construction, development
and operation of two Spanish CSP projects at a total cost of approximately 750 million euros.
(Cd. J 93, 97, 588(1).)

14. After a government transition, Spain enacted a series of laws between 2012 and
2014 that "fundamentally and radically changed" the investment regime NextEra relied on when
making its investment. Jd. {599. The changes created an entirely new regulatory system by
2014, contradicting written government assurances to NextEra and going "beyond anything that
might have been reasonably expected" by NextEra when it "undertook [the] investment." Jd.
NextEra suffered significant harm as a result. See id. {| 678-80 (concluding that "Claimants are
entitled to damages" and inviting further quantum claim submissions).

15. NextEra's solar power investments were protected by the Energy Charter Treaty
(Nelson Decl. Ex. 3 ("ECT")). The ECT "establishes a legal framework in order to promote
long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits."
ECT, art. 2.

16. Spain is a party to the ECT and the ICSID Convention, as is NextEra's state of
incorporation, the Netherlands.* Furthermore, NextEra is an "investor" under the ECT. (See
See Int'l Energy Charter, Energy Charter Treaty: Signatories/Contracting Parties (listing
both the Netherlands and Spain as parties) (Nelson Decl. Ex. 5); Int'l Centre for

Settlement of Investment Disputes, Database of ICSID Member States (Nelson Decl. Ex.
4 ("ICSID Member Database")).

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 6 of 12

Liability Decision {211 ("Claimants are companies that are organized under the law of the
Netherlands and thus are Investors’ within the meaning of Article 1(7) of the ECT.").)

17. As an ECT contracting party, Spain has consented to submitting any ECT
disputes to arbitration. See ECT, art. 26(3)(a) (Contracting Parties give their "unconditional
consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration . . . in accordance with the
provisions of this Article"). Furthermore, ECT arbitrations can proceed under the ICSID
Convention where "the Contracting Party of the investor and the Contracting Party . . . to the
dispute" are also parties to the ICSID Convention and the investor elects arbitration under that
Convention. ECT, art. 26(4)(a)(i). Accordingly, upon becoming a party to the ECT, Spain
irrevocably consented to arbitrate disputes with investors (such as NextEra) arising thereunder
pursuant to the ICSID Convention.

18. On May 12, 2014, NextEra filed a Request for Arbitration against Spain, arguing
that Spain's regulatory revisions devalued NextEra's solar power investments and constituted a
violation of Articles 10(1) and 10(7) of the ECT. ICSID received the Request for Arbitration,
including its hard copy exhibits, on May 15, 2014. (Liability Decision J] 6, 180.) In the
Request for Arbitration, NextEra consented to submit its disputes to ICSID arbitration pursuant
to Article 26 of the ECT.

19. A three-member ICSID arbitral tribunal (the "Tribunal") was duly constituted on
January 23, 2015. (Liability Decision { 10.) The Tribunal received briefing and evidence from
the parties, and conducted a hearing on all issues (including contested issues of jurisdiction,
merits and quantum) in London from December 12 to 19, 2016. (/d. { 67.) NextEra and Spain

were represented by counsel, and fully participated in the hearing.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 7 of 12

20. On March 12, 2019, the Tribunal issued its 235-page Liability Decision (its full
title being the "Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles"), finding that Spain
breached its obligation to "provide [NextEra] fair and equitable treatment" under Article 10(1) of
the ECT by failing to protect NextEra's "legitimate expectations." (/d. { 682(ii).) The Tribunal
directed that NextEra was entitled to damages quantified by reference to the capitalized costs of
the two Spanish CSP projects and a return equal to the weighted average cost of capital of the
projects plus a margin of 200 bps. (/d. J 682(iii).) In light of this finding, the Tribunal instructed
NextEra to "recalculate their damages claim of EUR 398.4 million" in light of the quantum
formulation directed in the Tribunal's Liability Decision and to submit the recalculated amount
"within 10 days of receipt of this Decision." (/d. {682(iv).) The Tribunal then received
confirmation of the relevant amount from NextEra.

21. On May 31, 2019, the Tribunal issued a Final Award requiring Spain to pay
NextEra EUR 290.6 million as damages, plus pre-judgment interest at a rate of 0.234%,
compounded monthly, from June 30, 2016. ICSID Award { 37(2)-(3). The Tribunal further
directed Spain to pay NextEra USD 132,368.86, representing its share of the costs of the
proceeding, USD 4,147,031.81 plus EUR 1,042,135.30 representing part of NextEra's costs of
the ICSID proceedings (including legal fees), and directed that Spain "shall pay [NextEra] post-
judgment interest on the amounts owing under this Award from the date of the Award until date
of payment at the rate of 0.234%, compounded monthly." (Id. J 37(4)-(6).)

LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF
22. The United States is a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention.’ Article 54 of

the ICSID Convention requires the U.S. to "recognize an award rendered pursuant to th[e]

4 See ICSID Member Database (Nelson Decl. Ex. 4).

6

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 8 of 12

Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its
territories as if it were a final judgment of a [U.S.] court." ICSID Convention, art. 54(1). Article
54 further provides that, for Member States (such as the United States) with federal systems,
ICSID awards may be enforced "through its federal courts," in which case an ICSID award shall
be treated "as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state." Jd. Consequently,
the implementing legislation for the ICSID Convention states that "[t]he pecuniary obligations
imposed by [an ICSID award] shall be enforced and shall be given the same full faith and credit
as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of one of the several
States." 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a); see also TECO Guat. Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guat., Civil
Action No. 17-102 (RDM), 2018 WL 4705794, at *2 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2018).

23. ICSID Convention awards thus "create a right arising under a treaty of the United
States." 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a). ICSID Convention awards against a foreign state may be
enforced by plenary actions in U.S. federal district courts if they comply with (i) the FSIA's
personal service, jurisdiction and venue requirements, and (ii) the requirements for commencing
a civil action under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Micula v. Gov't of Rom., 104 F.
Supp. 3d 42, 49-50 (D.D.C. 2015); see also Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of
Venez., 863 F.3d 96, 99-100, 117-20 (2d Cir. 2017).

24. The legal standards governing judicial review of arbitration awards are "not
complicated"—they are "limited by design." Duke Energy Int'l Peru Invs. No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic
of Peru, 904 F. Supp. 2d 131, 133 (D.D.C. 2012) (citation omitted). Those standards are even
narrower for awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention, which are not open to any
collateral attack during enforcement proceedings. Courts may only "examine the judgment's

authenticity and enforce [its] obligations." TECO, 2018 WL 4705794, at *2 (citation omitted).

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 9 of 12

They cannot examine its "merits, its compliance with international law, or the ICSID tribunal's
jurisdiction to render the award." Mobil Cerro Negro, 863 F.3d at 102; accord OI European
Grp., 2019 WL 2185040, at *7. Courts are expected to "treat the award[s] as final," Mobil Cerro
Negro, 863 F.3d at 102, and award-debtors cannot "make substantive challenges to the award" in
enforcement proceedings. /d. at 118. Furthermore, the FAA and its various defenses do not
apply to ICSID award enforcement. See Tidewater Inv. SRL v. Bolivarian Republic of Venez.,
Civil Action No. 17-1457 (TJK), 2018 WL 6605633, at *1 (D.D.C. Dec. 17, 2018). Thus, Spain
cannot collaterally attack the Award or Liability Decision during these proceedings.

25. Additionally, Spain may not claim sovereign immunity under the FSIA. The
FSIA creates "a comprehensive set of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every
civil action against a foreign state." Verlinden B.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 488
(1983). The standards include "a set of enumerated exceptions" to state immunity, "including,
such as here, when a case is brought to 'confirm an award made pursuant to . . . an agreement to
arbitrate’ and the award is 'governed by a treaty or other international agreement in force for the
United States calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.'" Tidewater, 2018
WL 6605633, at *4 (alteration in original) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6)). The Award fits this
FSIA exception, and Spain cannot escape enforcement here.

26. Spain has also waived its foreign sovereign immunity in this action by acceding to
the ICSID Convention. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) (a foreign state is not immune from suit in
US. courts where it has "waived its immunity either explicitly or by implication"). As a party to
the ICSID Convention, Spain has agreed to abide by and comply with all awards against it, and
enforce award obligations as if they were final judgments of Spanish courts. ICSID Convention,

arts. 53(1); 54(1). That very agreement necessarily contemplates "enforcement actions in other

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 10 of 12

[Contracting] States," Blue Ridge Invs., 735 F.3d at 84 (alteration in original) (citation omitted),
and dispenses with any claim of sovereign immunity.
CAUSE OF ACTION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF

27. Under federal statute, the Award is to be given "the same full faith and credit
as ...a final judgment" issued by a state court. 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a); TECO, 2018 WL
4705794, at *2. NextEra may therefore enforce the Award's pecuniary obligations against Spain.
Accordingly, NextEra requests that this Court issue an order: (i) recognizing and confirming the
Award, and (ii) entering judgment in NextEra's favor thereupon.

28. NextEra requests that the Court enter judgment in the currencies specified in the
award, including Euros. See ICSID Award { 37. This Court has authority to enter judgment in a
foreign currency when requested by the judgment creditor. See Leidos, Inc. v. Hellenic Republic,
881 F.3d 213, 218 (D.C. Cir. 2018) ("Recent cases have endorsed judgment in a foreign currency
if the petitioner requests payment in that currency."); accord Restatement (Third) of the Foreign
Relations Law of the United States § 823 cmt. b (Am. Law Inst. 1987) ("[T]here is no
impediment to issuance by a court in the United States of a judgment denominated in a foreign
currency.").

29. Once judgment is entered by the court confirming the Award, the proper rate of
interest is that prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 1961. See OI European Grp., 2019 WL 2185040, at *8
(construing ICSID implementing legislation, and the requirement of full faith and credit, as
meaning that 28 U.S.C. § 1961 "should apply" as the basis for post-judgment interest, once an

ICSID award is confirmed).

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document1 Filed 06/03/19 Page 11 of 12

WHEREFORE, Petitioners request that the Court enter an order:

(i) enforcing the Award against Spain in the same manner as a final judgment
issued by a court of one of the several states;

(ii) entering judgment thereupon against Spain and in NextEra's favor in the
amounts of (a) EUR 290,600,000, plus interest at the rate of 0.234%, compounded monthly, from
June 30, 2016 to the date of judgment; (b) USD 4,279,400.67, plus interest at the rate of 0.234%,
compounded monthly, from May 31, 2019 to the date of judgment; and (c) EUR 1,042,135.30,
plus interest at the rate of 0.234%, compounded monthly, from May 31, 2019 to the date of
judgment; and

(iii) | awarding post-judgment interest at the rate applicable under 28 U.S.C. §
1961.
