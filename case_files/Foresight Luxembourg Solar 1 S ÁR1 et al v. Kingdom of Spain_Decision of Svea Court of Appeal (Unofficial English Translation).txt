initiative. The Commission has also requested permission from the Court of Appeal to submit oral

observations in forthcoming oral hearings in the case.

The Commission has requested that the Court of Appeal set a time limit for the submission of its

written observations.

The Kingdom of Spain has welcomed written observations and stated that it has no objection to the

Commission’s request to submit oral observations at a forthcoming main hearing.

The respondents have objected to the Commission’s request, stating that there is no legal basis for

either written or oral observations.

The Kingdom of Spain has requested that the Court of Appeal request a preliminary ruling from the
CJEU [the Court of Justice of the European Union] to, inter alia, clarify the various issues of EU law

in the case. The Kingdom of Spain has proposed a number of questions to be referred to the CJEU.
The respondents have objected to the request.

After a presentation of a report on the issue, the Court of Appeal makes the following

DECISION (to be issued on 2020-10-26)

1. The European Commission is presented with the opportunity to submit written observations by 18

December 2020 at the latest.
2. The Court of Appeal denies the request that a preliminary ruling be requested from the CJEU.
[orig. p. 3] Reasons for the decision

The Commission’s right to submit written observations to a national court follows directly from
Article 29(2) in the Council Regulation laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 108 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and is not conditioned upon permission by the

court.

As regards the Commission’s request to submit oral observations at forthcoming hearings, the Court of
Appeal concludes that the nearest equivalent to such observations is an expert opinion (cf.
Government Bill 2003/04:80 p. 60 et seg.). Consequently, oral observations could only be submitted at

a main hearing. The Court of Appeal is yet to determine whether to hold a main hearing in the case

and therefore intends to decide on the Commission’s request to submit oral observations after the

Court of Appeal has rendered a decision on the continued proceedings of the case.

What has been presented in the case so far does not currently motivate a request for a preliminary

ruling from the CJEU.

The decision may not be appealed separately.
