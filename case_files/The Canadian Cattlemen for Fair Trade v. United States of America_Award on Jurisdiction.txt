C.I. The Claimants' Perspective

The following quotation from the Claimants’ Reply Memorial on the Preliminary

Question summarizes the main aspects of the dispute as follows (C I, {7 — 16):

"7.

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Juri

As acknowledged by the Respondent at p. 2 of its submission
and elaborated in each of the Claimant’s Notices of
Arbitration, the Claimants are all Canadian nationals engaged
in beef and cattle business. These businesses include: feedlot
operations and other cattle-related operations including cow-
calf production, back-grounding, finishing, custom feeding,
agency/brokerage as well as secondary transportation and
crop production activities. The establishment of the North
American Free Trade Area within which the continental
market for live cattle, and the North American cattle herd,
have grown was the intended result of the economic
integration underlying the NAFTA. Each of the Claimants has
made investments in this live cattle market and each has
suffered serious economic losses as a_ result of the
Respondent’s measures, which continue to unfairly
discriminate against Canadian participants in favour of their
U.S. counterparts competing in the very same integrated
market.

A. Discriminatory Measures

Effective May 20, 2003, the United States has maintained

prohibitions and restrictions on Canadian-origin livestock and

beef products. These U.S. measures have included:

(a) an absolute ban on the transport, shipment and sale of
certain Canadian-origin livestock from May 20, 2003
to July 14, 2005;

 

-17-

(b) an absolute ban on the transport, shipment and sale of
certain Canadian-origin cattle 30 months of age and
older;

(c) an absolute ban on the transport and sale of all
Canadian-origin pregnant heifers;

(d) the implementation of a_ costly, onerous, and
discriminatory certification process; and

(e) a ban on the transportation and sale of bovine meat
products derived from bovines 30 months of age and
older in the United States.

9. From May 20, 2003 to July 14, 2005, the United States
im d and intained an absolt prohibition on the
shipment of live cattle from Canada under the authority of the
Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA). This ban was imposed
in spite of abundant evidence that Canadian-origin livestock
and beef products were safe and posed minimal risk of BSE to
the United States.

10. U.S. authorities commenced an unnecessary and lengthy rule-
making process in May 2003 that supported a ban on
shipments of livestock and certain beef products from the
Canadian portion of the North American Free Trade Area to
the American portion for 26 months. During that 26-month
period, the Claimants suffered significant economic losses.
Even when the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) determined that Canadian-origin livestock and beef
products represented a minimal risk to the U.S. portion of the
industry, significant restrictions remained in place. These
restrictions have been maintained in spite of the fact that U.S.
authorities have recognized that Canadian authorities have the
necessary safeguards already in place.

Ii. The rule-making process engendered additional frustration
and delay by means of judicial action by protectionist industry
members in the United States.

12. Until January 2005 Final Rule, politics had intervened to
trump sound science, the World Organization on Animal
Health (“OIE”) guidelines for international trade, and the
NAFTA. Even now, significant restrictions have remained in
place for political reasons that have put the Claimants at a
competitive disadvantage with their U.S. competitors and have
added increased costs and delays to their operations. These
include:

(a) a prohibition on the transport and sale of certain
Canadian-origin livestock 30 months of age and over;

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-18-

(b) a prohibition on the sale and transport of Canadian-
origin pregnant heifers;

(c) costly certification procedures for live cattle under 30
months of age; and

(d) a ban on the transportation and sale of bovine meat
products derived from bovines 30 months of age and
older in the United States.

13. These continuing prohibitions and restrictions were and are
not justified. In the context of a fully integrated market, they
make no sense. The Respondent’s actions have consistently
failed to account for the fact that Canadian- and U.S. origin
cattle have long since become intermingled and therefore form
a single, North American herd.

14, During the period 1999-2003, 3.9 million live slaughter cattle
and 1.1 million feeder cattle were sent from Canada to the
United States. Over 150,000 slaughter cattle were sent from
the United States to Canada. In addition, large numbers of
breeding cattle moved in both directions across the border and
Canada had maintained a steady trade in the exportation of
dairy heifers. In 2002 alone, well over 550,000 Canadian
feeder cattle and calves had been exported to the United States
and, given that the majority of these were exported late in
2002, it can be concluded that on May 20, 2003, there were
over 200,000 live feeder and breeding cattle in U.S. herds and
feedlots that had been born in Canada. Simply put, only
protectionists or the misinformed could speak of “Canadian”
or “American” herds prior to imposition of the Respondent’s
ban and its subsequent modifications. There was one, North
American, herd.

1S. It was not until January 4, 2007 that U.S. officials finally
announced a proposed set of amendments to the January 2005
Final Rule. If adopted, those amendments would purportedly
re-open the Respondent’s border to live cattle from Canada 30
months of age or older. These proposed changes, however,
have not yet come into effect. The basis for relaxing the
restrictions on imports of Canadian cattle that continue to
apply under the Final Rule — that Canadian regulations
protecting against the introduction of BSE in the North
American cattle herd are as sound as U.S. safeguards — was
just as valid in May 2003 as it is in January 2007.

16. The continued ban on Canadian-origin cattle and beef
products was never justified or reasonable in the
circumstances. Those circumstances include:

(a) the science of risk regulation;

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-19-

(b) integration of the North American market for live cattle
and beef products;

(c) regulatory homogeneity extant between Canadian and
American regulatory regimes; and

(d) the compliance of Canada’s regulations with the OIE
international guidelines.”

C.II. The Respondent’s Perspective

Apart from the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction which are described in a
separate section below, the following quotation from the Respondent’s First
Memorial on the Preliminary Issue summarizes the main aspects of the dispute as

follows (R I, p. 2):

“Claimants are Canadian nationals engaged in the operation of cattle
feedlots and other cattle-related business in Canada. They seek to
challenge the United States’ ban on the importation of Canadian
cattle that was instituted on May 20, 2003 after the discovery of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE”) in a cow in Alberta,
Canada. They maintain that the United States is obligated under
NAFTA Article 1102(1) to accord national treatment to Canadian
investors with respect to their investments in Canada, that the ban
breached this obligation, and that by reason of this alleged breach
they incurred losses when the profitability and value of their cattle-
related investments in Canada decreased. Claimants assert that they
are eligible to have their claims for damages resolved under the
dispute resolution provision of Chapter Eleven because their
investments, even though not located in the United States, are located
within the NAFTA free trade area.

The United States has no obligation under the NAFTA with respect to
claimants’ investments in Canada. It neither has the obligation to
provide national treatment to those investments, nor the obligation to
arbitrate claims relating to them.”

D.__Procedural History

On March 16, 2005 the Claimants sent the first notices of arbitration to the
Respondent, notifying it of Claimants’ claims and initiating recourse to
arbitration in accordance with Article 3 UNCITRAL Rules of Arbitration and
NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1120.

Between March 16, 2005 and June 2, 2005, 109 different notices of arbitration
reached the Respondent, seeking damages of varying amounts, ranging from
CAN$ 38,000 to CAN$ 95 million. In total, the damages sought by the Claimants

amount to approximately US $ 235 million.

During a conference call on August 15, 2006, the Parties agreed to the informal

consolidation of the claims before a single tribunal.

By a joint letter of August 23, 2006, the Parties put on record that they had
respectively appointed Mr. James Bacchus and Ms. Lucinda Low as party-
appointed members of the Tribunal and that they now appointed Prof. Karl-Heinz
Bockstiegel as Presiding Arbitrator in the above-mentioned consolidated claims.

Thereby, the Tribunal was constituted.

By letter of August 31, 2006, the Parties were sent an annotated preliminary
agenda for the First Procedural Meeting to be held on September 21, 2006. The
Tribunal invited the Parties to try to agree on a place for such a meeting

convenient to most of the Parties in accordance with UNCITRAL Rule 16.

On September 5, 2006, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was
unavailable on the proposed date, and asked for alternative dates. By e-mail of
September 6, 2006, the Claimants suggested possible dates for a meeting either in

New York or Washington, D.C. The Chairman replied to the Parties by letter of

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-21-

September 15, 2006 that a meeting on October 3, 2006 would be most convenient

for the Tribunal, again inviting the Parties to agree on a place for the meeting.

On September 24, 2006, the Chairman confirmed that the Procedural Meeting
would be held in Washington, D.C. on October 3, 2006, and attached an

annotated agenda for the meeting.

By joint letter of September 28, 2006, the Parties settled on the location of the
First Procedural Meeting in Washington, D.C., agreed on a preliminary phase of

the proceedings, and jointly proposed a timetable for this preliminary phase.

The First Procedural Meeting with the Parties took place on October 3, 2006 at
the Army & Navy Club in Washington, D.C. This place was chosen without
prejudice to the Place of Arbitration for reasons of convenience for most of the
Parties in accordance with UNCITRAL Rule 16. Present at the meeting were the
members of the Tribunal as well as Michael Woods and Todd Grierson-Weiler,
representing the Claimants, and Mark Clodfelter, Andrea Menaker, and Jennifer

Thornton, representing the Respondent.

By e-mail of October 10, 2006, a draft of the First Procedural Order was sent to
the Parties, giving them the opportunity to submit comments. On October 13,
2006, the Respondent proposed certain amendments to the draft by e-mail with

which the Claimants concurred by e-mail of October 17, 2006.

On October 20, 2006, Procedural Order (PO) No.1 regarding the further
procedure was issued, confirming the established timetable and taking into
account the results of the discussion and the agreements reached between the
Parties at the First Procedural Meeting. Since it gives an outline of the agreed

procedure, its full text is provided hereafter:

“This PO puts on record results of the discussion and agreement
between the Parties and the Tribunal at the Ist Procedural Meeting in
Washington DC on October 3, 2006 taking into account as well the

3.6.

3.7.

-25-

The language of the arbitral procedure shall be English.

The Parties have agreed that the place of the arbitration is
Washington, D.C.

The city where the Hearing on the Preliminary Issue will be
held will be decided by the Tribunal after the Parties have filed
submissions in this regard by October 31, 2006.

The Parties have agreed on a bifurcated procedure to the
effect that, in a first stage of the procedure, the Tribunal shall
only deal with a “Preliminary Issue” which the Parties have
defined as follows:

“Does this Tribunal have jurisdiction to consider
claims under NAFTA Article 1116 for an alleged
breach of NAFTA Article 1102(1) where all of the
Claimants’ investments at issue are located in the
Canadian portion of the North American Free Trade
Area and the Claimants do not seek to make, are not
making and have not made any investments in the
territory of the United States of America?

The Parties agree that a negative determination of this
question will dispose of all of Claimants’ claims in
their entirety.

The Parties also agree that any other objections of a
potentially jurisdictional nature shall be reserved for a
single merits phase should the claims not be dismissed
at the preliminary phase.”

The Parties have further agreed as follows regarding
Confidentiality:

“Either Party may make public the written submissions,
hearing transcripts, and orders and awards generated during
the course of this arbitration, except to the extent that they
refer to confidential information — in which case any such
text shall be redacted prior to being made public.

If either Party submits any document containing confidential
information, it shall designate it as such and, where
practicable, provide a redacted version of the document that
may be released to the public. Where a Party refers to a
document that has been designated confidential in its written
submission, it shall provide a redacted version of the
submission that may be released to the public.

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

- 26 -

The Parties agree to endeavor to make arrangements for a
one-way video-conference transmission of all substantive
hearings including the hearing on the Preliminary Issue so
that those hearings may be viewed by the public in a room
separate from the hearing room.”

 

Consolidation

4.1. The Parties have agreed that all claims of Canadian citizens
and corporations referred to in the “Notices of Arbitration
and Statement of Claim” submitted between March 16 and
June 2, 2005 and listed by name and address in Claimants’
“Litigants List”, and listed as well by Respondent on its
website as “Cases Regarding the Border Closure due to BSE
Concerns”, shall be consolidated before and decided by this
Tribunal.

4.2. All Claimants are represented by the same Counsel as
mentioned above.

5. Timetable

 

For the first stage of this bifurcated procedure, the following timetable
has been set:

5.1. For the purposes of the procedure on the Preliminary Issue,
the Parties agree that the Statements of Claim submitted by the
Claimants between March 16 and June 2, 2005, are a
sufficient basis for Respondent to present its objections in
detail.

By October 31, 2006 the Claimants shall submit
a CD containing all Statements of Claim

and a_ binder, with a table of contents,
containing one full Statement of Claim together
with copies of those parts of the other
Statements of Claim which differ from the first
one.

5.2. By December 1, 2006, the Respondent shall file its Memorial
with all its objections regarding the Preliminary Issue together
with all evidence (documents, witness statements, expert
statements) it wishes to rely on.

By January 30, 2007, the Claimants file their Reply Memorial
on the Preliminary Issue with any evidence (documents,
witness statements, expert statements) they wish to rely on.

By March 1, 2007, Art. 1128 submissions and/or Amicus
submissions, if any, may be filed.

By May 1, 2007, the Respondent files its Rebuttal Memorial on
the Preliminary Issue with any further evidence (documents,
witness statements, expert statements), but only in rebuttal to
Claimant’s Reply memorial or regarding new evidence.

By July 5, 2007, the Claimants file their Rebuttal Memorial on
Jurisdiction with any further evidence (documents, witness
statements, expert statements), but only in rebuttal to
Respondent’s Reply memorial or regarding new evidence.

Thereafter, no new evidence may be submitted, unless agreed
between the Parties or expressly authorized by the Tribunal.

By July 12, 2007
* the Parties submit notification of witnesses and

experts presented by themselves or by the other
Party they wish to examine at the Hearing

* the Parties inform the Tribunal of the
arrangements made for the transcript of the
Hearing

On July 17, 2007, a Pre-Hearing Conference between the
Parties and the Tribunal shall be held, if considered necessary
by the Tribunal, either in person or by telephone.

As soon as possible thereafter, Tribunal issues a Procedural
Order regarding details of the Hearing.

From October 9 to 11, 2007, Hearing on the Preliminary Issue
of up to 3 days.

By dates set at the end of the Hearing, if considered
appropriate by the Tribunal after consultation with the
Parties, Parties shall submit Post-Hearing Briefs of up to 30
pages (no new documents allowed unless agreed by the Parties
or admitted by the Tribunal).

Evidence Rules

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

- 28 -

The Parties and the Tribunal may use, as an additional guideline, the
“IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial
Arbitration”, always subject to changes considered appropriate in
this case by the Tribunal.

Z. Documentary Evidence

7.1. All documents (including texts and translations into English of
all substantive law provisions, cases and authorities)
considered relevant by the Parties shall be submitted with their
Memorials, as established in the Timetable.

7.2. All documents shall be submitted in the form established above
in the section on communications.

7.3. New factual allegations or evidence shall not be any more
permitted after the respective dates for the Rebuttal Memorials
indicated in the above Timetable unless agreed between the
Parties or expressly authorized by the Tribunal.

7.4. Documents in a language other than English shall be
accompanied by a translation into English.

8. Witness Evidence

8.1. Written Witness Statements of all witnesses shall be submitted
together with the Memorials mentioned above by the time
limits established in the timetable.

8.2. In order to make most efficient use of time at the Hearing,
written Witness Statements shall generally be used in lieu of
direct oral examination though exceptions may be admitted by
the Tribunal. Therefore, insofar as, at the Hearing, such
witnesses are invited by the presenting Party or asked to
attend at the request of the other Party, the available hearing
time should mostly be reserved for cross-examination and re-
direct examination, as well as for questions by the Arbitrators.

9. Expert Evidence

Should the Parties wish to present expert testimony, the same
procedure would apply as to witnesses.

10.___ Hearing on the Preliminary Issue
Subject to changes in view of the further procedure up to the Hearing:
10.1. The dates of the hearing shall be those given in the above

timetable.

il.

-29 -

The city where the Hearing is to be held shall be decided by
the Tribunal according to section 3.5.above.

As soon as possible after the Tribunal’s decision on the city,
the Parties shall submit a joint proposal regarding the location
of the Hearing which, failing such agreement shall be decided
by the Tribunal.

The Parties may present opening statements of not more than
three hours.

No new documents may be presented at the Hearing. But
demonstrative exhibits may be shown using documents
submitted earlier in accordance with the timetable.

Taking into account the time available during the period
provided for the Hearing in the timetable, the Tribunal intends
to establish equal maximum time periods both for the
Claimants and for the Respondent which the Parties shall have
available. Changes to that principle may be applied for at the
latest at the time of the Pre-Hearing Conference.

All substantive hearings including the Hearing on the
Preliminary Issue shall be simultaneously transcribed using a
live transcription software system, with the delivery to the
parties and members of the Tribunal of daily transcripts each
evening after the close of the hearing.

Procedural hearings shall be recorded, but not transcribed,
unless otherwise agreed.

The Parties, who shall share the respective costs, shall try to
agree on and make the necessary arrangements in this regard.
With regard to the Hearing on the Preliminary Issue, the
Parties shall inform the Tribunal accordingly before the time
of the Pre-Hearing Conference as provided in the timetable.

Should the Parties be presenting a witness or expert not
testifying in English and thus requiring interpretation, they are
expected to provide the interpreter unless agreed otherwise.
Should more than one witness or expert need interpretation, to
avoid the need of double time for successive interpretation,
simultaneous interpretation shall be provided.

 

Extensions of Deadlines and Other Procedural Dec

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-30-

11.1. Short extensions may be agreed between the Parties as long as
they do not affect later dates in the Timetable and the Tribunal
is informed before the original date due.

11.2. Extensions of deadlines shall only be granted by the Tribunal
on exceptional grounds and provided that a request is
submitted immediately after an event has occurred which
prevents a Party from complying with the deadline.

11.3. The Tribunal indicated to the Parties, and the Parties took
note thereof, that in view of travels and other commitments of
the Arbitrators, it might sometimes take a certain period for
the Tribunal to respond to submissions of the Parties and
decide on them.

11.4. Procedural decisions will be issued by the chairman of the
Tribunal after consultation with his co-arbitrators or, in cases
of urgency or if a co-arbitrator cannot be reached, by him
alone.

12. Arbitration Costs (UNCITRAL Rules 38 — 41)

12.1. In accordance with UNCITRAL Rule 38, the Tribunal shall fix
the costs of arbitration (fees and expenses).

12.2. In accordance with UNCITRAL Rule 39, after the consultation
with the Parties during the Washington meeting, the Tribunal
fixes the fees of the members of the Tribunal to be US-Dollars
500.00 per hour.

12.3. The Tribunal may appoint an Administrative Secretary. The
respective fees and expenses of the Administrative Secretary
shall be costs of arbitration.

12.4. In accordance with UNCITRAL Rule 41, the Tribunal has
requested and received from each Party an equal amount as an
advance for the costs of arbitration to the trust account of the
Chairman of the Tribunal.

14. Results of the Procedural Meeting
The Parties, within one week after receiving the draft for this
Procedural Order, were given an opportunity to submit comments.

Taking into account the comments received, the Tribunal has issued
this Order.

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-31-

By e-mail of October 26, 2006, the Claimants submitted a Claims Binder in
accordance with paragraph 5.1 of Procedural Order No.1, containing one full
Statement of Claim and copies of Claimant-specific information from all the
Statements of Claim which differ from the full one together with a CD containing

all the Statements of Claim.

Pursuant to paragraph 3.5 of Procedural Order No.1, the Parties filed submissions
with respect to the place where the October 31, 2006 Preliminary Hearing should
be held, and proposed Calgary, Alberta, and Washington, D.C., respectively.

On November 7, 2006, Procedural Order No.2 regarding the place of the hearing
on the Preliminary Issue was issued. Since the issue of the place of the hearing
was a matter of particular concern to the Parties, the full text of the Order is

provided hereafter :

“I. The Tribunal has carefully examined the arguments and
considerations submitted by the Parties regarding the selection
of the place of the Hearing on the Preliminary Issue presented
at the Procedural Meeting in Washington D.C. held on
October 3, 2006 (recorded in the transcript) and supplemented
by their letters of October 31, 2006.

2. The Tribunal finds that the Parties have introduced and dealt
with all arguments and considerations relevant in this context
and that there is no need to repeat all these.

3. From these, the major considerations on which the Tribunal
bases its decision in this matter are the following:

3.1. As recorded in section 3.4. of PO No.1 of October 20,
2006, the Parties have agreed that Washington D.C. is
the place of arbitration according to Art. 16
UNCITRAL Rule in this case. To hold hearings in
places other than the official place of arbitration is on
one hand possible under the UNCITRAL Rules, but, in
the view of the Tribunal, would require compelling
arguments for such a choice.

3.2... The Tribunal notes that the Parties have agreed that
there is no reason from the standpoint of location of
evidence to hold the Hearing in Calgary. The only
specific argument in favor of choosing Calgary as the

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

20.

-32-

place of the Hearing is the proximity to the residences
and work places of most Claimants in this consolidated
case. However, since the Parties agreed at the
Washington meeting that attendance of the more than
100 Claimants in the Hearing Room itself is not
warranted or intended, and section 3.7. of PO No.1
records only the agreement on a one-way video
conference transmission to a separate room, the
Tribunal considers that a transmission from a Hearing
in Washington D.C. to a separate room in Calgary
could serve the same purpose. Respondent has
informed the Tribunal that such a video transmission
from Washington D.C. to Calgary can be arranged,
and Claimants have not contested this.

4. Therefore, the Tribunal decides as follows:

4.1. The Hearing on the Preliminary Issue shall be held in
Washington D.C.

4.2. The Parties shall try to agree on a joint proposal at
which location the Hearing can be held in Washington
D.C. at the agreed dates, and shall inform the Tribunal
of this proposal by January 30, 2007.

4.3. The Parties shall try to agree on arrangements for a
one-way video transmission of the Hearing to a room in
Calgary where Claimants can view the proceedings,
and shall inform the Tribunal in this regard by January
30, 2007”

On December 1, 2006, the Respondent submitted its First Memorial on the

Preliminary Issue (R I) together with copies of the documents relied upon in the

Memorial.

On January 30, 2007, the Claimants submitted their Reply Memorial on the
Preliminary Question (C I) together with copies of the documents relied upon in

the Memorial.
Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128, on March 1, 2007, the United Mexican States
filed a submission commenting on certain issues of interpretation that have arisen

in the present case.

On May 1, 2007, the Respondent submitted its Reply Memorial on the
Preliminary Issue (R II).

On July 5, 2007, the Claimants submitted their Rejoinder Memorial on the
Preliminary Issue (C II).

By e-mail of July 29, 2007, a draft of Procedural Order No. 3 was sent to the
Parties, again inviting them to submit comments. Both Claimants and
Respondent by letters of August 2, 2007, expressed their agreement with this
draft.

On August 3, 2007, Procedural Order No. 3 was issued regarding the details of
the forthcoming hearing. In view of its relevance to understand the conduct of the

hearing and its transcript, its full text of the Order is provided hereafter :

“After both Claimants and Respondent, by letters of August 2, 2007
have expressed their agreement with the draft of this PO, it is now
issued in its final form:

1. Earlier Rulings
The Tribunal recalls the following agreements and earlier rulings in
this procedure which remain valid unless changed by this Order:

1.1. From PO No.1:

5.11. From October 9 to Il, 2007, Hearing on the
Preliminary Issue of up to 3 days.

10.4. The Parties may present opening statements of not more
than three hours.

10.5. No new documents may be presented at the Hearing. But
demonstrative exhibits may be shown using documents
submitted earlier in accordance with the timetable.

10.6. Taking into account the time available during the period
provided for the Hearing in the timetable, the Tribunal intends
to establish equal maximum time periods both for the
Claimants and for the Respondent which the Parties shall have
available. Changes to that principle may be applied for at the
latest at the time of the Pre-Hearing Conference.

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-34-

10.7. All substantive hearings including the Hearing on the
Preliminary Issue shall be simultaneously transcribed using a
live transcription software system, with the delivery to the
parties and members of the Tribunal of daily transcripts each
evening after the close of the hearing.

Procedural hearings shall be recorded, but not transcribed,
unless otherwise agreed.

The Parties, who shall share the respective costs, shall try to
agree on and make the necessary arrangements in this regard.
With regard to the Hearing on the Preliminary Issue, the
Parties shall inform the Tribunal accordingly before the time
of the Pre- Hearing Conference as provided in the timetable.

1.1. From PO No.2:

4.1. The Hearing on the Preliminary Issue shall be held in
Washington D.C.

4.2. The Parties shall try to agree on a joint proposal at which
location the Hearing can be held in Washington D.C. at the
agreed dates, and shall inform the Tribunal of this proposal by
January 30, 2007.

4.3. The Parties shall try to agree on arrangements for a one-
way video transmission of the Hearing to a room in Calgary
where Claimants can view the proceedings, and shall inform
the Tribunal in this regard by January 30, 2007.

1.2. Agreement on location and video transmission

By Claimants’ letter of January 30, 2007, the Tribunal was
notified that the Parties had agreed to hold the Hearing at the
Army and Navy Club of Washington D.C. located at 901, 17th
Street N.W. and that board room facilities at the Calgary,
Alberta, offices of Hennan Blaikie will serve as the place
where Claimants can view the proceedings via one way video
transmission.

1.3. Agreement on Transcript

The Meeting followed the Agenda as provided in Section 3 of Procedural
Order No. 3 cited above.

The details of the hearing were provided in the Transcript which was
delivered on a daily basis during the hearing, and again following the hearing
in both electronic and paper format. At the end of the hearing, the Chairman
of the Tribunal asked the Parties whether they had any objections regarding
the method and way the Tribunal conducted this case so far, and the Parties

replied that there was none (Tr. 333).

28. After the hearing, an e-mail by the Chairman of the Tribunal of October 16, 2007

recalled what further actions had been agreed:

“Dear colleagues,

hoping that you all returned well from the Hearing in Washington, let
me just recall some points regarding further action agreed at the end

of the Hearing which are also recorded in the transcript:

1. The Parties agreed to send to the Tribunal, within about a week

after the Hearing, CDs of their Hearing Binders.

2. By November 8, 2007, both the Claimants and the Respondent

shall submit Claims for their costs of arbitration.

3. By November 15, 2007, the Parties may submit comments

regarding the cost claim submitted by the other side.

4. By mail of October 11, 2007, you received copies of the invoice
sent by the court reporting service. As agreed, I have today ordered

E. The “Preliminary Issue”

31. The following quotation from PO No. 1 summarizes the Preliminary Issue agreed

upon by the Parties (PO No. 1, {| 3.6):

“3.6. The Parties have agreed on a bifurcated procedure to the effect that,
in a first stage of the procedure, the Tribunal shall only deal with a
“Preliminary Issue” which the Parties have defined as follows:

“Does this Tribunal have jurisdiction to consider claims under
NAFTA Article 1116 for an alleged breach of NAFTA Article
1102(1) where all of the Claimants’ investments at issue are
located in the Canadian portion of the North American Free
Trade Area and the Claimants do not seek to make, are not
making and have not made any investments in the territory of
the United States of America?

The Parties agree that a negative determination of this
question will dispose of all of claimants’ claims in their
entirety.

The parties also agree that any other objections of a
potentially jurisdictional nature shall be reserved for a single
merits phase should the claims not be dismissed at the
preliminary phase.”

investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion,
management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of

Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf

I. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a
claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:

G_ Relief Sought by the Parties Regarding the
Preliminary Issue

G.I. Relief Sought by Respondent Regarding the Preliminary Issue

34, As identified in the First Memorial (R I, p. 20) and restated in the Second
Memorial on the Preliminary Issue (R II, p. 34) the Respondent asks the Tribunal

to render an award as follows:

“For the foregoing reasons, The United States respectfully requests
that this Tribunal render an award in favour of the United States and
against claimants, dismissing claimants’ claims in their entirety for

lack of jurisdiction.”

the Tribunal to render an award as follows:

“So, in conclusion, Mr. President and Members of the Tribunal, there
is no basis on which Claimants can go forward in this proceeding.
The question that the Tribunal set out in paragraph 3.6. of Procedural
Order Number I must be answered in the negative. The United States
thus respectfully requests that the Tribunal dismiss Claimants’ claims
for lack of jurisdiction and award the United States full costs and

fees.”

H. Short Summary of Contentions Regarding the

Preliminary Issu

H.I. Short Summary of Contentions by Respondent

The Respondent challenges the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, raising objections which
are best summarized, subject to additional details in later sections regarding
particular issues, by quoting the Introductions of Respondent’s First and Second

Memorial on the Preliminary Issue (R I, pp. 2 — 3; R II, pp. 2 - 4):

“The United States has no obligation under the NAFTA with respect
to claimants’ investments in Canada. It neither has the obligation to
provide national treatment to those investments, nor the obligation to
arbitrate claims relating to them. As demonstrated below, the
NAFTA’s terms read in context and in light of the Treaty’s object and
purpose, leave no doubt that the scope and coverage of NAFTA
Chapter Eleven extends only to investors that seek to make, are
making or have made investments in the territory of the Respondent
State, and to the investments those investors own or control. None of
the NAFTA Parties undertook any obligation with respect to
investments located outside of its territory or with respect to
“investors” who are not seeking to make, are not making and have
not made investments in its territory.

Under Claimants’ interpretation of Chapter Eleven’s scope, every
national of a NAFTA Party that believes its business has been
adversely affected by a border measure of another NAFTA Party
would be an “investor” entitled to invoke Chapter Eleven’s dispute
resolution procedures. Such an interpretation would constitute a
radical departure from the obligations that the NAFTA Parties, or any
State Party to an international investment agreement, have ever
undertaken with respect to foreign investors. It would create an
avenue for direct claims against states by foreign nationals for
matters that are, like the claims here, quintessentially trade disputes,
in clear circumvention of the mechanisms provided in NAFTA
Chapter Twenty and elsewhere for the resolution of such disputes
through State-to-State dispute settlement procedures. Nothing in the
NAFTA supports such a result (R I, pp. 2 - 3)

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-53-

Instead of supporting Claimants’ interpretation, as they contend, the
uniqueness of Claimants’ particular claims, if anything, actually
undermines it. Not only have Claimants failed to establish how a
treaty’s jurisdictional reach can be determined by the unprecedented
nature of the claims asserted or the novelty of the jurisdictional
theories advanced, the fact that Claimants’ claims are unprecedented
and novel only highlights in this instance just how farfetched
Claimants’ claims and theories are.

At bottom, Claimants’ interpretation is based on untenable premises.
First, that the NAFTA Parties, without so much as a single comment
by the Agreement’s negotiators, the Parties’ respective legislatures,
the trade press, or academic commentators, created a revolutionary
arbitral mechanism for private parties to resolve cross-border trade
disputes. Second, that the NAFTA Parties intended to extend the
protections of Chapter Eleven, including its arbitration provisions, to
investors with respect to their home-country investments, even though
the Parties expressly, and concededly, did not extend those
protections to those home-country investments themselves, a
differentiation that makes no sense. Third, that the NAFTA Parties
contemplated that each Party actually could regulate the formalities
of establishing enterprises in the territories of the other Parties.

None of these premises is correct and, in their Reply Memorial,
Claimants have failed to address the manifestly absurd and
unreasonable results that obtain under an interpretation that would
have Chapter Eleven apply to measures relating to “investors” with
respect to their non-foreign investments. Indeed, Claimants’ entire
argument is that such measures are within Chapter Eleven’s scope of
application, which is contained in Article 1101(1), because Article
1102(1) — a substantive provision that grants national treatment to
investors with respect to “the establishment, acquisition, expansion,
management, conduct, operation, and sale of other disposition of
investments” — applies wherever those investments are located. But
not only do Claimants fail to explain how the meaning of Article 1101
is determined by their interpretation of Article 1102(1), they also fail
to show that that interpretation is correct in the first place.

All of the Parties to the Agreement have expressly disavowed
Claimants’ erroneous interpretation. In seeking to overcome the
NAFTA Parties’ own statement contradicting — Claimants’
revolutionary interpretation of the NAFTA, Claimants contend that
“[s]tatements by the parties, of their alleged intent behind a treaty
provision, are neither relevant nor credible. Claimants’ contention is
not only unsupported, it is refuted by all pertinent authority, which,
consistent with common sense, holds that the Parties’ common and
concordant statements of their intent with respect to a treaty provision
provide the best evidence of the meaning of that provision. Each of the
three NAFTA Parties has specifically disclaimed any intent to provide

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

39.

-54-

national treatment to “investors” of the other Parties with respect to
investments made in their home territories.

Furthermore, although Claimants purport to rely upon the object and
purpose of the NAFTA, they have failed to produce any evidence that
the protection of domestic investors of other Parties with respect to
their home-country investments was among the Parties’ objectives.
Given the enormous financial burden that Claimants’ interpretation
could impose on the NAFTA Parties, it is inconceivable that they
would have embraced such an objective without significant
consideration, negotiation, and deliberation.

Lacking any direct evidence, Claimants urge this Tribunal to infer
that the Parties had such an objective by relying on the language in
the NAFTA’s Preamble and the general objectives stated in Article
102. But Claimants have failed to establish the link between the
degree of economic integration the Parties hoped to achieve with the
Agreement and the scope of investor protection in the NAFTA’s
investment chapter, or any rationale for why the NAFTA Parties
would so dramatically depart from their habitual treaty practice.

As discussed below, Chapter Eleven — interpreted in accordance with
the relevant rules of international law, the NAFTA Parties’
subsequent practice, in context and in light of the Treaty’s object and
purpose — does not grant national treatment to investors who never
invested, and never sought to invest, in the territory of the Respondent
NAFTA Party. For all these reasons, the Tribunal should accept the
NAFTA Parties’ authentic interpretation of the NAFTA and should
reject Claimants’ invitation to substitute a new and_ radical
interpretation of the Parties’ Agreement (R II, pp. 2 — 4).

H.II. Short Summary of Contentions by Claimants

The main arguments of Claimants can best be summarized, subject to further
details in later sections regarding particular issues, by quoting paragraphs 3 to 6
of the Introduction in Claimants’ First Memorial on the Preliminary Question (C

1, (13-6):

”3. The answer to the question is yes. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to
proceed to a hearing of the merits of the consolidated claims, based
on the applicable rules of international law. The Tribunal has
jurisdiction because:

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-55-

(a) the Claimants’ interpretation of Article 1102(1) is fully
supported by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law
of Treaties (“VCLT”) which provides that treaties are to be
interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in
context, and that such interpretation is to be guided by the
object and purpose of the treaty.

(b) the terms of Article 1102(1), interpreted within their proper
context and in light of the objectives and principles of the
NAFTA set out in Article 102(1), are clear and unambiguous:
the Claimants are entitled to the most favourable treatment
accorded to their U.S.-based competitors by the Respondent
without imposing any of the territorial limitations ascribed by
the Respondent to them; and

(c) a review of the drafting history of the applicable NAFTA texts
confirms the interpretation established by application of the
approach set out in VCLT Article 31.

4, The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s approach to treaty
interpretation is flawed and its position is untenable because the
Respondent:

(a) fails to adhere to the general approach to interpretation of
NAFTA Articles 101(1), 1101(1) and 1102(1) required under
VCLT Article 31 and customary international law;

(b) attempts to obscure the sui generis nature of this case;

(c) relies heavily on irrelevant jurisprudence and academic
commentary;

(d) submits an inapplicable sovereignty principle to the
interpretation of the NAFTA;

(e) makes erroneous claims about the alleged agreement of the
Parties on interpretation of the NAFTA; and

i) attempts to construct an unsustainable “legal scrub” theory
that avoids the obvious import of the available preparatory
texts of NAFTA Chapter 11.

5. In addition, the Respondent has ignored the facts setting out how and
why the Claimants were entitled to rely, and did rely, on the promise
of non-discrimination for their participation in the North American
Free Trade Area. The investors participated in an integrated
continental market fostered through the establishment of the rule of
law within the Free Trade Area established by the NAFTA. Their
market was subsequently disrupted by the imposition of a measure
that was fundamentally at odds with the United States’ obligation to
promote competition and non-discrimination in the free trade area,
contrary to Article 1102(1) of the North American Free trade Area.

6. In sum, the ordinary meaning of the NAFTA terms at issue
demonstrates why the Respondent is incorrect. The objectives and
context within which these terms are situated also demonstrate why

-56-

the Respondent is incorrect. NAFTA Article 1102(1) is not merely a
bilateral investment treaty obligation. It is a NAFTA obligation that
binds the United States to provide the Claimants non-discriminatory
treatment vis-a-vis investors competing in like circumstances in the
North American Free Trade Agreement. It imposes no territorial
limitation as to where an investor must invest in order to qualify for
protection vis-a-vis other investors. Nothing in the Chapter imposes
such a territorial limitation on the Article 1102(1) obligation. Where
the drafters intended for territorial limitations to exist in NAFTA
Chapter 11, they explicitly included them, such as in Articles 1106 and
1110. Territorial limitations should not be read into the text where
none exist, and particularly not when the objectives and the context of
the treaty support the opposite conclusion.”

I.__ Considerations of the Tribunal Regarding the

Preliminary Issue

40. The Tribunal has carefully examined all of the many and extensive arguments of
the Parties. What follows deals with those aspects that the Tribunal considers to

be the most relevant in their respective context.

LI. Preliminary Considerations

1. The Preliminary Issue in the Context of Subject-Matter

Jurisdiction — Ratione Materiae and Consent to International Arbitration
41. For convenience, the Preliminary Issue is cited again below (PO No.1, {3.6.):

“3.6. The Parties have agreed on a bifurcated procedure to the effect that,
in a first stage of the procedure, the Tribunal shall only deal with a
“Preliminary Issue” which the Parties have defined as follows:

 

“Does this Tribunal have jurisdiction to consider claims under
NAFTA Article 1116 for an alleged breach of NAFTA Article
1102(1) where all of the Claimants’ investments at issue are
located in the Canadian portion of the North American Free
Trade Area and the Claimants do not seek to make, are not
making and have not made any investments in the territory of
the United States of America?

The Parties agree that a negative determination of this
question will dispose of all of claimants’ claims in their
entirety.

The parties also agree that any other objections of a
potentially jurisdictional nature shall be reserved for a single
merits phase should the claims not be dismissed at the
preliminary phase.”

NAFTA Chapter Eleven provides private parties with direct access to
international jurisdiction in the course of investor-State arbitration for an alleged
breach of a specified, and exhaustive, list of obligations contained in Section A of
Chapter Eleven, but does so only with regard to a circumscribed subject-matter
therein. The scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven is defined in Article 1101, which
provides that “[t]his Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a
Party relating to (a) investors of another Party; (b) investments of investors of

another Party in the territory of the Party [...]”.

There is considerable debate between the Parties on the question whether the
term “investors of another Party” in Article 1101(1) (a) applies to the Claimants
given the location of their investments. The Respondent contends that this
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction since the United States did not consent to arbitrate
these claims under NAFTA Chapter Eleven as the jurisdictional prerequisite of
NAFTA Article 1101 is allegedly not established due to the location of the
Claimants’ investments (R I, pp. 4 et seq; Tr. p. 21). The Claimants for their part
submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain their claims as they
purportedly fall within the scope of Chapter Eleven in accordance with Article
1101(1)(a) and that the United States, hence, has agreed to be sued in this context

(CI, f 1 et seq.).

As regards the fact that the Parties’ dispute, thus, centers on the construction of
the term “investor of another Party”, this Tribunal classifies the Preliminary Issue
as to be a question of subject-matter jurisdiction — ratione materiae. Further

details will be discussed in the later section of this Award.

. The Relevance of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties

There is no dispute that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is

applicable to the NAFTA.

46.

47.

48.

49.

-59-

Under NAFTA Article 1131(1), the Tribunal is required to decide the
Preliminary Issue in accordance with NAFTA and the applicable rules of
international law. Similarly, NAFTA Article 102(2) sets out that the provisions
are to be interpreted and applied in accordance with the applicable rules of
international law and in light of the objective of the NAFTA contained in Article
102(1). It is widely acknowledged that the term “applicable rules of international
law” comprises the customary international rules of treaty interpretation which

are reflected and codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.

Whereas VCLT Article 31(1) contains the general rule of interpretation
according to which a treaty must be interpreted “in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of
its object and purpose”, VCLT Article 31(2) stipulates that the relevant context
includes the treaty’s text, the preamble and annexes and any related agreements
or instruments. VCLT Article 32 further provides for recourse to “supplementary
means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the

circumstances of its conclusion”.

In its further considerations of the specific issues of the case, the Tribunal will
follow as closely as possible the order and priority of the various criteria of

interpretation provided in VCLT Articles 31 and 32.

The Relevance of Decisions in Other Cases

Both Parties have cited in argument various decisions and awards by arbitral
tribunals for their relevance to the issues currently before this Tribunal. The
Tribunal deems it useful to make clear from the outset that it regards its task in
these proceedings as the very specific one of arriving at the proper meaning to be
given to those particular provisions in the context of the NAFTA in which they

appear.

50.

51.

52.

- 60-

On the other hand, Article 32 VCLT permits, as supplementary means of
interpretation, not only preparatory work and circumstances of conclusion of the
treaty, but indicates by the word “including” that, beyond these two means
expressly mentioned, other supplementary means may be applied. Article 38
[paragraph 1.d.] of the Statute of the International Court of Justice provides that
judicial decisions are applicable for the interpretation of public international law
as “subsidiary means”. Therefore, they must be understood to be also

supplementary means of interpretation in the sense of Article 32 VCLT.

That being so, it is not obviously clear how far arbitral decisions are of relevance
to the Tribunal’s task. It is at all events plain that the decisions of other tribunals
are not binding on this Tribunal, and the Tribunal refers in this connection to
paragraphs 73-76 of the Decision on Jurisdiction in Bayindir Insaat Turizm
Ticaret v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan of November 14, 2005 (ICSID Case No.
ARB/03/29). This does not, however, preclude the Tribunal from considering
other arbitral decisions and the arguments of the Parties based upon them, to the
extent that it may find that they throw useful light on the issues that arise for
decision in this case. Such an examination will be conducted by the Tribunal later
in this Award, after the Tribunal has considered the Parties’ contentions and
arguments regarding the various issues argued and relevant to the interpretation

of the NAFTA provisions at stake.

LI. Ordinary Meaning in Light of the Context and Object and
Purpose of the NAFTA and of its Negotiating History (Article 31 (1)
and 32 VCLT)

Arguments by Respondent

First, the Respondent challenges the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, asserting that it
did not give its consent to arbitration in this matter as NAFTA Article 1101(1)(a)

limits the Chapter’s scope to disputes relating to investors only with respect to

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

53.

54.

-61-

investments in the territory of the State that has adopted or maintained the

measures at issue (RI, p. 5; Tr. pp. 21; 288).

As regards the ordinary meaning and object and purpose of NAFTA Chapter
Eleven, the Respondent contends that Chapter Eleven functions like a bilateral
investment treaty (BIT), governing investments of the Parties’ respective
nationals in the other Parties’ territory (R I, p. 6; Tr. pp. 138 ef seq.). Noting that
such BITs create obligations only with regard to investors of contracting states
who make investments in the territory of other contracting states, the Respondent
asserts that the purpose of a BIT and generally of investment chapters in Free
Trade Agreements (FTAs) is to promote and protect foreign investment (R I, pp.
6 et seq.; Tr. pp. 42, 139). The object and purpose of NAFTA Chapter Eleven is
deemed to be no different from these BITs (R II, p. 24; Tr. pp. 29, 139), a view
which is allegedly supported by one of NAFTA’s objectives in Article 102,
which is “to increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of
the Parties” (R I, p. 7; Tr. p.29). In further support of its contention, the
Respondent relies on the award in the Metalclad arbitration, where the NAFTA
Chapter Eleven Tribunal held that the NAFTA Parties’ specific intent was “to
promote and increase cross-border investment opportunities” (R I, p. 7; Tr. p.
44). Additionally, this object and purpose of the NAFTA’s investment chapter is
said to be confirmed by numerous commentators and practitioners (R I, p. 9; Tr.

p. 43).

Allegedly, this object and purpose of promoting and protecting foreign
investment is advanced only if the NAFTA treaty is construed to provide
protection only for foreign investments and to foreign investors who have made
or are seeking to make investments in the territory of the other treaty partners (R.
I, pp. 9 et seq.; Tr. p. 39). For this reason, the Respondent strongly objects to the
Claimants’ contention that NAFTA Chapter Eleven also applies to measures
relating to investors that have not made, and do not intend to make, investments
in the territory of another NAFTA Party. This is said to be inconsistent with the
object and purpose of international investment agreements, such as NAFTA

Chapter Eleven (R I, p. 10; Tr. p. 44). It is asserted that the Claimants have failed

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

55.

-62-

to produce any evidence that the protection of domestic investors of other Parties
with respect to their home-country investments was among the Parties’ objectives

(RIL, p. 3).

To support its view, the Respondent draws upon the award of the ICSID Tribunal
in the Gruslin v. Malaysia case, which it argues deals with a similar issue and
confirms Respondent’s interpretation (R I, p. 10, R II, p. 27). In this case, the
arbitrator had to deal with a BIT that did not contain a territorial specification in
each of its provisions (Tr. pp. 31 et seg., 301). The claimant in the Gruslin case
purportedly argued that the BIT applied to all investments regardless of their
location. The arbitrator in that case, however, rejected the claimant’s argument,
noting that the “absence of qualifying words of limitation to the word
“investment” in Article 10 [the consent article] itself does not broaden the class
of investments included by the [investment agreement].” (R I, p. 10; Tr. p. 32). In
the present case, the Respondent argues that the Claimants make the same
argument by stating that, in the absence of an express territorial limitation,
NAFTA Article 1101(1)(a) should be interpreted to apply to all investors,
regardless of whether they have established investments in the territory of the
United States or in Canada. However, the Gruslin tribunal allegedly addressed
and flatly rejected the argument that “[t]here is no territorial requirement” under
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (R II, p. 28), observing that the meaning
of the term “investment” had to be “informed by the stated objects” of the BIT (R.
II, p. 29; Tr. pp. 32, 301). As purportedly in the BIT in that case, one of
NAFTA’s objectives is to increase opportunities for investors of one Party to
make investments in the territories of the other Parties (R II, p. 28). Claimants’
attempt to distinguish the Gruslin case from the present one is, thus, regarded by
the Respondent to be unavailing (R II, p. 29). The Respondent, hence, concludes
that, just as in Gruslin, any protection of investors in the NAFTA’s investment
Chapter is necessarily “confined to the same defined subject matter of
investments by nationals of one contracting state in the territory of the other.” (R
II, p. 29). Accordingly, the Respondent submits that Claimants’ contention makes
no sense in the light of the clear object and purpose of NAFTA Chapter Eleven,

and advises the Tribunal to dismiss the claim for this reason (R I, p. 11).

-63-

Further, the Respondent draws the attention of the Tribunal to the award in the
Bayview case, which is alleged to have squarely addressed and rejected the same
arguments advanced by the Claimants in this arbitration (Tr. p. 32). The Bayview
Tribunal found that it was “quite plain that NAFTA Chapter Eleven was not
intended to provide substantive protections or rights of action to investors whose
investments are wholly confined to their own national States in circumstances
where those investments may be affected by measures taken by another NAFTA
State Party.” (Tr. pp. 33 et seq.). The Bayview Tribunal further held that in order
to be an investor within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1101(1)(a), an enterprise
must make an investment in another NAFTA State, not in its own (Tr. p. 170;
294). Adopting the terminology of the Methanex award, the Tribunal in Bayview
found that there needed to be a legally significant connection between the
investment and the State applying the contested measure (Tr. p. 170) for NAFTA
Chapter Eleven to be applicable.

Moreover, Claimants’ recourse to the NAFTA’s preamble and the general
objectives stated in Article 102(1) is deemed by the Respondent to be fruitless as
the Claimants allegedly have failed to establish the link between the degree of
economic integration the Parties hoped to achieve with the Agreement and the
scope of investor protection in the NAFTA’s investment chapter (R II, pp. 4, 22 et
seq.). Although the preamble and the objectives contained in Article 102 may
inform the construction of provisions in NAFTA Chapter Eleven, they are not
capable of transforming the nature of those obligations, or of imposing
independent ones on the treaty signatories (R II, pp. 21 et seg.; Tr. pp. 299 et

seq.).

From the fact that every other FTA to which the Respondent is a party contains
objectives and/or preamble language identical or similar to those contained in
the NAFTA, the Respondent concludes that the mere creation of a free trade area
does not necessitate Claimants’ interpretation of Article 1102(1) (R II, p. 29; Tr.
pp. 181 et seq.). It is argued that a comparative approach to treaty interpretation

was also applied by the ICJ in the Oil Platforms case (Tr. pp. 188 et seq.) and by

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

59.

60.

- 64-

the Tribunal in the ADF decision (Tr. p. 191). However, allegedly, none of the
other agreements could be interpreted in the manner the Claimants suggest (Tr. p.
138). The Respondent cites both the Chile-U.S. FTA and the DR-CAFTA as
examples of U.S. FTAs which do not extend national treatment to investors that
do not have investments or do not seek investments in the territory of another
Party despite the fact that both of them contain goals similar to those of the
NAFTA, particularly the establishment of a Free Trade Area (R II, p. 30; Tr., pp.
182 et seq.).

In agreement with the Article 1128 submission of the United Mexican States
(Mexico), the Respondent notes that though most NAFTA chapters seek to
eliminate barriers at the border in form of tariffs and non-tariffs barriers to trade
in goods and services, Chapter Eleven purportedly targets internal barriers to
economic integration in the form of investment restrictions, helping foreign
investors to establish themselves in the other NAFTA Parties’ territories
governed by legal regimes with which they are unfamiliar (R II, pp. 25 et seq.;
Tr. pp. 29, 39). This purpose of the NAFTA is said to be promoted by
Respondent’s interpretation of Chapter Eleven’s scope in compliance with the
objectives set out in Article 102 and the resolutions included in the preamble (R.

II, p. 26).

Claimants’ suggestion that the Respondent’s interpretation undermines the
NAFTA’s objectives is said to reveal a fundamental misconception about how
the Agreement is structured (R II, p. 23). First, the Respondent asserts that the
Claimants’ distinction between the text of Article 102(1) (c) and that of Article
102(1) (d) is erroneous, and assures that there is no difference in meaning
between the phrases “in the territories of the Parties” and “in each Party’s
territory” (R II, p. 24). The only significant distinction in the language of the
Article 102 objectives is deemed to be between Article 102(b), which focuses on
promoting conditions of fair competition “in the free trade area”, and Articles
102(a), (c) and (d), which all refer to the territories of the Parties respectively (R
II, p. 24).

Furthermore, the Respondent contends that granting Claimants’ claims for
damages because of the adoption of a ban on imports by the Respondent would
ignore that the NAFTA Parties specifically negotiated a detailed State-to-State
consultation and dispute resolution mechanism to address such external barriers
to trade (Tr. p. 30), and would frustrate the express provisions of Chapter Seven,
as well as the Parties’ intention that such disputes be subject to State-to-State
arbitration (R II, p. 23; Tr. pp. 156 et seqg., 198). In this context, domestic
investors have the option of presenting such complaints to their own government,
which may decide to initiate a consultation, State-to-State arbitration, or the

GATT dispute settlement mechanism (Tr. pp. 31 and 163 et seq.).

All in all, the Respondent submits that its interpretation is entirely consistent
with the over-arching object and purpose of the Agreement and the Agreement’s

stated objectives (R II, p. 31; Tr. p. 36).

Regarding the context (Articles 31(1) and (2) VCLT), the Respondent contends
that the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims is also obvious
from the context in which the terms of Article 1101(1)(a) must be read.
Claimants’ suggestion that Chapter Eleven’s scope extends to any investor that
has made an investment is rejected by the Respondent, arguing that the term
“investor of a Party” in Article 1101(1)(a) cannot be read in isolation (RI, p. 11;
Tr. pp. 37, 289). Read in context, it is purported that the term clearly means an
investor that has made, or is seeking to make, an investment in the territory of

another NAFTA Party (RI, p. 15).

The interpretive context of Article 1101 is said to be provided by the other
substantive obligations contained in Section A of NAFTA Chapter Eleven (R I,
p. 11). In this context, the Respondent first notes that most of the obligations
contained in Section A of NAFTA Chapter Eleven address the protection for
investments, while some others, such as Article 1102(1), provide protection for
investors (R I, p. 11). The Respondent further elaborates that any such provision
obligating a Party to provide a certain level of treatment to investors does so only

with respect to the investor’s investments in the territory of the State that has

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

65.

66.

- 66 -

adopted or maintained the measure at issue (R I, p. 12; Tr. p. 39). As it is alleged
that the NAFTA nowhere obligates a Party to provide a certain level of treatment
to investors that have not made or are not seeking to make investments in another
State, it would consequently def[y] logic to interpret Article 1101(1)(a) — the
scope and coverage provision — more expansively than the scope of any of the

substantive obligations (RI, p. 12).

Particularly, the Respondent addresses Article 1102(1), which provides for
national treatment of investors. Allegedly, this national treatment provision must
be read to apply only to investors that have made or are seeking to make
investments in another NAFTA Party, for any other reading would lead to
absurd results (RI, p. 12; Tr. pp. 28 et seg., 51). The Claimants’ attempts to read
the term “with respect to investments” out of the text ofArticle 1102(1) and to
import the words “in like circumstances” instead is deemed by the Respondent to
be an inquiry relating to the merits for a national-treatment claim — which

cannot inform the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (Tr. pp. 290 et seq.).

Respondent notes that in the case of a Canadian investor establishing an
investment in the United States, the United States would be obliged pursuant to
Article 1102 (1), to accord national treatment to the investor with respect to the
investment and also, in accordance with Article 1102(2), to provide such
treatment to the investor’s investment (R I, p. 12) as well. However, the
Respondent further maintains that no obligation to accord national treatment
would apply with regard to the investment of a Canadian investor in Canada, as
Article 1101(1)(b) explicitly provides that only investments of investors in the
territory of the Party that adopted or maintained the measure are covered by
NAFTA Chapter Eleven. Consequently, the Respondent rejects Claimants’
notion that the United States is obliged under Article 1102(1) to accord national
treatment to a Canadian investor, whose only investments are in Canada.
According to the Respondent, this theory would lead to the absurd result that the
United States would have no obligation to accord national treatment to
Canadian-owned investments in Canada, yet would have an obligation to accord

national treatment to Canadian “investors” with respect to those very same

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

67.

68.

-67-

investments (RI, p. 13; RIL, pp. 2 et seq., 18 et seq.; Tr. p. 297). As this cannot
be sustained, the Respondent contends that the term “investors of a Party” in
Article 1101(1) (a) must be read to apply only to those investors that are seeking
to make, are making or have made an investment in the territory of another
NAFTA Party (R I, p. 13). This conclusion is said to be confirmed by the
Bayview award (Tr. pp. 51 et seq.). Claimants’ contrary interpretation is said to
provide an unbalanced protection while failing to offer a reasonable explanation

therefor (R II, pp. 18 et seq.).

In support of its interpretation, the Respondent further relies on the decision of
the ADF NAFTA Chapter Eleven Tribunal. ADF, it argues, presumed that the
obligation contained in Article 1102(1) applies only with respect to an investor
that has an investment in the territory of another Party, by explicitly explaining
that “Article 1102 entitles an investor of another Party and its investment to equal
[...] treatment [...] from the time of entry and “establishment” or “acquisition” of

the investment in the territory of that Party [...]” (R I, p. 14).

Claimants’ allegation that Article 1102(1) would be superfluous if it is not read to
protect investors with respect to investments located in their home country, is
deemed to be incorrect by the Respondent (R II, p. 16; Tr. p.41). The
Respondent strongly opposes this notion, noting that Article 1102(1) retains
independent meaning when its geographic reach is properly limited by Article
1101 in several circumstances (R II, p. 16). As an example, a hypothetical
violation of Article 1102(4) is put forward, which would affect the investor and
not the investor’s investment. Thus, the investor’s claim would need to be
submitted under Article 1102(1), and could not be submitted under Article
1102(2) (R Il, p. 17). The same purportedly goes for “pre-establishment”
situations, in which a state measure relating to a putative investor cannot be
challenged under Article 1102(2) as there is not yet any investment that is owed
national treatment. Accordingly, the Respondent’s interpretation in no way

renders Article 1102(1) superfluous (R Il, pp. 17 et seq., Tr. pp. 41 et seq.).

69.

70.

71.

- 68 -

Additionally, the Respondent draws upon the text of Articles 1102(3) and (4),
both of which are only applicable in situations involving an investors of another
Party and occurring in the territory of the Party and in its territory respectively
(RI, p. 15; Tr. p. 147). It is asserted that this choice of language shows that the
NAFTA Parties only sought to prohibit domestic legislation designed to restrict
or burden foreign investment with the national treatment obligation, not domestic
legislation that adversely affects investors or investments operating exclusively

within the territory of another contracting State (RI, p. 15; Tr. pp. 40 et seq.).

Moreover, the Respondent relies on Article 1110 providing protection from for
uncompensated expropriations only with respect to measures that relate to
investments in the territory of the expropriating State (RI, p. 5; Tr. 146 and 223
et seq.). Similarly, Article 1105(1) only provides substantive protection in
relation to the failure to accord minimum standards of treatment for investments
in the territory of the State that has adopted the challenged measure (R I, p. 5;
Tr. pp. 146 et seq.). Lastly, rights under Article 1102(2) are also recognized only
with regard to the failure to accord national treatment to investments in the
territory of the State according the treatment. The Respondent concludes that as
Article 1101(1)(b) expressly limits Chapter Eleven’s applicability to measures
relating to investments of investors of another party in the territory of the Party,
so Article 1101(1)(a) limits its applicability to measures relating to investors with
respect to investments in the territory of the State. Article 1101(1)(a) allegedly
cannot be interpreted reasonably any other way (RI, p. 5; Tr. pp. 135 et seq.; Tr.

pp. 226 et seq.).

Furthermore, the Respondent draws the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that if
the Claimants’ interpretation were correct, this would mean that any provision in
Chapter Eleven that does not contain a territorial restriction could be interpreted
as imposing extraterritorial obligations on the Parties (R Il, p. 19). In the light of
Article 1111(1) which, like Article 1102(1), does not include the “in the
territory” language, this would enable any NAFTA Party to require that any

investor in the Free Trade Area comply with special formalities even if the

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

723.

- 69 -

investment were located outside its territory, thereby frustrating the objectives of

the investment chapter (R II, p. 20; Tr. pp. 52 et seq.).

In addition, it is the firm position of the Respondent that Claimants’ suggestions
that the NAFTA Parties have, sub silentio, derogated from their habitual treaty
practice is absurd and contrary to international and U.S. domestic law (R II, p.
6). Allegedly, states express their intention to depart from common and habitual
past practice clearly. In the Respondent’s view, important principles cannot be
assumed to be tacitly dispensed which is said to be confirmed by the award in the
Loewen arbitration. (R II, p. 7). This is contended to be even more important with
regard to radical and far-reaching departures from habitual practice that would
result from an interpretation (R II, pp. 7 et seg.). As there is no direct expression
in the NAFTA of the NAFTA Parties’ intent to discard former consistent and
habitual treaty practice, the Respondent considers that the treaty is to be
interpreted in accordance with the “common habitual pattern adopted by
previous treaties”, which is that private parties lack standing to bring claims
against States for money damages (R II, pp. 6 ef seq.). This is alleged to be even
more the case as Claimants’ interpretation purportedly would extend the national
treatment obligation in a way that every cross-border trade dispute could trigger
the investor-State dispute resolution mechanism (R Il, p. 9; Tr. pp. 23 et seq.).
The Respondent, hence, draws the conclusion that /i/t cannot be reasonably
argued that the NAFTA Parties created such a mechanism for trader-State

arbitration without any record of their consciously doing so (R II, p. 9; Tr. p. 24).

This is said to be further confirmed by U.S. domestic law, according to which a
“treaty cannot impose uncontemplated extraterritorial obligations on those who
ratify it” (R II, p. 9). Citing the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Sale v. Haitian
Centers Council, the Respondent concludes that a presumption against
extraterritorial application of treaty obligations applies (R II, p. 9) which cannot
be rebutted by the mere absence of a few words from a few provisions of the

NAFTA (RIL, p. 10).

-70-

Finally, the alleged uniqueness of Claimants’ particular claims is regarded by the
Respondent to undermine Claimants’ interpretation by highlighting just how
farfetched it is (R II, p. 2). A multitude of secondary sources by academics and
practitioners confirms that the NAFTA did not create or grant any new

revolutionary and expansive rights to purported investors (Tr. pp. 142 et seq.)

Regarding the negotiating history, the Respondent emphasizes that a review of
the negotiating history of the NAFTA would confirm the purported meaning of
Article 1101(1)(a) (R I, p. 15; Tr. p. 53). In this respect, the Claimants’ assertion
that the Tribunal may only resort to preparatory texts if the interpretation under
VCLT Article 31 leads to a bizarre result is contested by the Respondent, which
reads VCLT Article 32 as explicitly allowing reference to supplementary sources
of interpretation in order “to confirm the meaning resulting from the application

of article 31” (RIL, p. 32; Tr. p. 289).

Observing that NAFTA Chapter Eleven is said to be based on the investment
chapter of the predecessor Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the model
USS. BIT, the Respondent asserts that the coverage of Article 1101(1) (a) is
restricted to investors of one Party that have made or are seeking to make
investments in the territory of another Party (R I, pp. 15-16). Particularly, the
Respondent argues that the Canada-U.S. FTA confines its coverage to “any
measure of a Party affecting investment within or into its territory by an investor
of the other Party”. Likewise, it is alleged that the model US BIT defines
“investment” as “every kind of investment, in the territory of one Party owned or
controlled directly or indirectly by national or companies of the other Party” and
that every BIT or FTA to which the United States is a Party is restricted in a
similar manner (R I, p. 16; Tr. p. 54). In this context, the Respondent assures that
any derogation from these prior investment agreements would have been
accompanied by significant debate and negotiation as well as by subsequent
commentary. As this was not the case, it is contended that this fact confirms
Respondent’s interpretation (R I, pp. 16 — 17; R Il, p. 2; Tr. p. 22), a view which

is said to be confirmed by the Bayview award (Tr. p. 54).

Furthermore, the Respondent relies on preliminary drafts of NAFTA Chapter
Eleven dated prior to August 26, 1992, all of which are said to expressly limit the
scope of the Chapter to investors of one NAFTA Party that were seeking to make
or had made an investment in the territory of another NAFTA Party.
Additionally, all drafts of the national treatment provision purportedly contained
a similar restriction. It is contended that the first time this language was removed
from the respective articles was in the August 26, 1992 “Lawyers’ Revision” of
Chapter Eleven during which a “legal scrub” of the Chapter was performed by
the respective counsel to the NAFTA Parties (R I, p. 18; Tr. pp. 22 ef seg.; 315).
Its alleged purpose was neither to make substantive changes nor to radically
expand an agreement’s scope but only to conform language and terminology and
to eliminate redundancies and obvious conflicts (R I, p. 18; Tr. pp. 23; 312 et
seq.). As the language in question was removed without comment in the course
of this revision, the Respondent concludes its purpose was not to fundamentally
alter the scope of the investment chapter but that it was insignificant (R I, pp. 18
et seq.; RII, pp. 32 et seq.; Tr. pp. 216 et seg.). The preparatory work of the
NAFTA thus confirms its ordinary meaning and requires dismissal of Claimants’
claims (RI, pp. 18 et seq.; R Il, pp. 32 et seq.). Additionally, on August 30, 1992
the “in the territory” language was explicitly added back in Article 1102(4)(b)
which is said to confirm that Article 1102(1) only applies to investors that have
made or seek to make an investment in the territory of the respondent Party (R II,

p. 33; Tr. p. 147).

Arguments by Claimants

As regards the interpretation of these Chapter Eleven provisions in the light of
the ordinary meaning and the object and purpose of a treaty, the Claimants first
assert that the text of the treaty at issue itself is presumed to be the authentic
expression of the Parties’ intentions and the starting point of every interpretation,
while statements of the Parties with regard to their alleged intent behind a treaty
provision are deemed to be irrelevant (C I, {| 37). Additionally, the Claimants

contend that an interpretation of the ordinary meaning is also to be informed by

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

79.

80.

-72-

the Treaty’s context and its general object and purpose. This is said be confirmed
by the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on Competences of
the General Assembly For The Admission Of A State To The United Nations (C I,
QW 38 et seq.). The Claimants assume that the Respondent fails to address this
applicable customary international law approach by manufacturing a generic
object and purpose for NAFTA Chapter Eleven, providing little more than a
cursory reference to VCLT Article 31 (CI, TJ 83 et seq.).

In this context, the Claimants reject Respondent’s purported attempt to invoke its
sovereignty as a defence to the Claim indirectly, stating that the Claimants are
not entitled to receive “the benefit of the doubt” with regard to the Respondent’s
status as a sovereign (Tr. p. 124). Drawing upon the Ethyl Tribunal’s award and
academic sources, the Claimants contend that this strict rule of interpretation is
displaced by VCLT Article 31 (C I, ff 111 et seg.; Tr. p. 125). Further, it is
alleged that the terms of NAFTA Articles 1101(1)(a) and 1102(1) are clear on
their face so that the Claimants need not seek the benefit of the doubt from the

Tribunal (C I, J 113; Tr. p. 125).

Noting that the object and purpose of the NAFTA Treaty are explicitly set out in
Article 102(1), the Claimants assert that this article has been repeatedly applied
by other NAFTA tribunals when interpreting substantive NAFTA provisions (C
I, (41; Tr. p. 92). According to the Claimants, the relevant NAFTA’s objectives
in the present case are: Article 102(1)(c), the promotion of “conditions of fair
competition in the free trade area”; Article 102(1)(a), the elimination of barriers
to trade in goods and services between the territories of the Parties, thereby
facilitating their cross-border movement; and Article 102(1)(c), the substantial
increase of “investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties” (C I, J 42).
With regard to these objectives and to Article 101, the Claimants conclude that
the NAFTA was indeed intended to create a North American Free Trade Area by
increasing the flow of goods, services and investment throughout the free trade
area (C I, {J 43 et seq.). References to a Free Trade Area mean that the Parties
are establishing a geographic are within which they agree to regulate themselves

based on established norms with the goal of free commerce (Tr. p. 185). The

Respondent, however, is said to belie the nature of its case by briefly mentioning
only one of the objectives contained within Article 102(1) (C I, { 84). After
failing to persuade the tribunal in the Softwood Lumber case that Article 102(1)
was only intended to apply to interpretations of the NAFTA Parties themselves,
the Respondent is said now to try to ignore the ordinary meaning of the
objectives found in Article 102(1) and to suggest an alternative, not based upon

the NAFTA text (C I, ff 85 et seq.).

Claimants’ findings mentioned above are said to be further confirmed by the
language of the NAFTA preamble (C I, { 45; Tr. p. 91). Relying upon VCLT
Article 31(2) and upon the awards in the S.D. Meyers and the Cross-Border
Trucking arbitrations, the Claimants assure that the text of the preamble has to be
included in the interpretation of the NAFTA’s objectives found in Article 102(1)
(C I, Jf 45 et seg.). The Respondent, however, is criticized for making no
reference to representations [...] in the NAFTA preamble at all (C I, Jf 88, 91 et

seq.).

According to the Claimants, the promises in the preamble to “REDUCE
distortions to trade” and to “ESTABLISH clear and mutually advantageous rules
governing their trade” establish the rule of law in the new FTA. The preambular
resolution to “CREATE an expanded and secure market for the goods and
services produced in their territories” is said to inform the significance of the
Parties’ establishment of an FTA in Article 101 (C I, { 47). This purpose of an
expanded and secure North American market is allegedly repeated in two further
preambular resolutions, which are claimed to focus on individual economic
actors, providing them with the promise of stability and security for their
commercial activities undertaken anywhere in the North American Free Trade
Area; namely: to “ENSURE a predictable commercial framework for business
planning and investment” and to “ENHANCE the competitiveness of [North
American] firms in global markets” (C I, {/ 48). Allegedly, these resolutions are
intended to reinforce the legitimate expectations created by NAFTA Articles
1102(1) and 1116(1), which promise national treatment for “investors of another

party” and the right to seek compensation in case of non-adherence (C I, {{ 49).

The Claimants conclude that the risen expectation shared by all investors is that
another NAFTA Party will not impose measures that accord more favourable
treatment to their own investors in the North American Free Trade Area (C I, {.
49). This leads to Claimants’ conclusion that the NAFTA is unique due to its
rule-of-law based instrument that would encourage private actors to join in a
process of achieving deep economic integration (C II, {J 104 et seq; Tr. pp. 137,
140). This intention to promote a deep level of economic integration is said to be

confirmed by statements of academic writers (C II, { 105; Tr. pp. 141 ef seq.).

For this reason, the Claimants strongly reject Respondent’s generic object and
purpose approach, which is said to be derived not from NAFTA itself but from
other BITs, thereby portraying NAFTA as being only a pedestrian trade treaty
with a separate BIT attached (C I, { 89). By doing so, Claimants accuse the
Respondent of pick[ing] and choos[ing] amongst the NAFTA’s objectives (C II,
87). The Claimants oppose this “all or nothing” approach to interpretation,
affirming that the NAFTA’s investment obligations both offer usual BIT
protection to investments and greater protection to investors (C I, {| 90 et seqg.;
Tr. pp. 94, 136). By not acknowledging this, the Respondent is said to be
ignoring the differences that exist between the NAFTA and [...] other treaties (C
I, { 96; Tr. p. 137). In any case, the Claimants contend that Respondent’s
submission on [w]hether the Claimants would qualify as an “investor” or
“foreign investor” under a BIT is not relevant in determining whether they
qualify under the NAFTA definition of an “investor of another Party” (C I, ¥
76). Citing the Methanex case, the Claimants assure that while principles can
sometimes be drawn from different treaty texts, such an exercise should not

divert the interpreter from the general rule of interpretation (C I, {ff 97 et seq.).

Additionally, the Claimants argue that the Respondent wrongly fails to
acknowledge that the terms to which it has agreed in other treaties are not
relevant to interpretation of the treaty terms at hand (C I, { 99). The jurisdictional
basis for the Claimants’ claims in the case at issue is, Claimants reiterate, not
founded upon other United States BITs but in the NAFTA itself. Differently

framed BITs purportedly simply show how the United States could have

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

85.

86.

87.

-75-

restricted the scope of the NAFTA’s national treatment obligation, but failed to
do so (C II, {J 100 et seq.). Furthermore, none of the other U.S. BITs includes the
explicit NAFTA objective “to promote conditions of fair competition in the free
trade area” nor the objective to “substantially increas[e] investment opportunities

in the territories of the parties” (C II, { 103).

Moreover, Respondent’s reliance on the ICSID case Gruslin v. Malaysia is
regarded by the Claimants as irrelevant, since the jurisdictional criteria pursuant
to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are said to differ considerably from the
those established under NAFTA Chapter Eleven. According to Claimants, the
Respondent mischaracterizes both claimant’s position in the case, and the facts
and arguments (C I, { 108; C II, {ff 97 et seqg.; Tr. pp. 144, 325). Whereas Gruslin
dealt with an indirect investment in the territory of another Party, the Claimants
in the present case argue that they have been denied national treatment for
investors operating in like circumstances in the Free Trade Area established
particularly under the NAFTA (C I, {ff 109 et seg.; Tr. pp. 112 et seg.).
Accordingly, the Gruslin award is deemed to not assist the Tribunal with respect

to the present case (C I, J 110).

With respect to the Respondent’s claim that an SPS measure would fall under
NAFTA Chapter Seven and, thus, cannot be challenged under NAFTA Chapter
Eleven, the Claimants note that there is nothing in NAFTA Chapter Seven that
prevents the Claimants from seeking damages in relation to the damages suffered
as a result of the Respondent’s imposition of the measures at issue (C II, {J 89 et
seq.; Tr. pp. 159 et seq.). Accordingly, SPS measures are said not to be implicitly
excluded from the ambit of Article 1102(1)(C II, {JJ 90 et seq.).

All in all, the Claimants conclude that cardinal element in the object and purpose
of the NAFTA is the establishment of a geographically contiguous free trade
area within which the rule of law governed by a principle of nondiscrimination is

intended to reign (Tr. p. 92).

Regarding the context (Articles 31(1) and (2) VCLT), considering that the
surrounding text of NAFTA Chapter Eleven provides context for the construction
of Article 1102(1), the Claimants urge the Tribunal to adopt an interpretation that
gives harmonious meaning to all of the terms in accordance with the principle of

effectiveness in treaty interpretation (C I, {50 et seq.).

First, the Claimants embark upon Article 1139, containing the definitions of
“investor of a Party” as well as of “investment”. According to them, both
definitions are fulfilled, considering that [t]he claimants are all nationals of
Canada who have established enterprises and employed real estate and other
property for the purpose of establishing, and participating in, an integrated

North American market for live cattle (C I, { 52).

Second, the Claimants contemplate that Article 1116 provides a remedy for “an
investor of a Party” if “another Party” has breached a provision such as Article
1102(1) and the investor incurred a loss or damage by reason or resulting from
the breach (Tr. pp. 94 et seg.). Inasmuch as all claims in the current arbitration
have been made in respect of losses arising out of the alleged discriminatory
intervention by the United States in breach of Article 1102(1), and considering
that the Claimants comply with the definition of “investor of a Party” in Article
1139, Claimants conclude that the conditions of this fundamental provision are
fulfilled (C I, {§[ 53 et seq.). A territoriality requirement is nowhere in that text
(Tr. p. 95).

As regards Article 1101(1)(a) and (b), the Claimants submit that it
unambiguously applies both to measures relating to “investors of another Party”
and “investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party” (C I, {
55; Tr. pp. 95 et seq.). Accordingly, the Claimants deny Respondent’s allegation
that the scope of Article 1101 only extends to “investors of another Party” that
have made investments in the territory of another Party (C I, { 55). The
Claimants further state that Article 1101 distinguishes between obligations to
protect investments, much like a simple bilateral investment treaty, and the

obligation to protect investors, consistent with the establishment of a Free Trade

93.

-77-

Area pursuant to Article 101 (C I, { 56). Whereas subparagraph (b) allegedly
works in conjunction with Article 1116 and other substantive provisions to
provide the protection normally found in a BIT, subparagraph (a) is said to work
in conjunction with Articles 1102(1), 1103(1) and 1116 to provide greater
protection to investors against non-discrimination than normally found in a BIT.
This is reinforced by the fact that none of the Respondent’s BITs ever purported
to establish the world’s largest free trade area as the NAFTA does (C I, 57; Tr.
p. 135).

More precisely, the Claimants ascertain that the traditional protections of a BIT
are all contained in NAFTA Chapter Eleven (C I, { 58). Particularly, it is
conceded that Articles 1106, 1107 and 1110 explicitly impose a territoriality
requirement on covered investments (Tr. p. 97). Similarly, Article 1105, read in
conjunction with Article 1101(1)(b), requires that an investment be made in the
territory of another NAFTA Party in order to extend its protection (C I, { 59 et
seq.; Tr. p. 98). The same allegedly goes for Article 1102(2) and Article 1103(2)
(Tr. pp. 99 et seq.).

In contrast to these articles, however, the Claimants submit that Articles 1102
and 1103 constitute hybrid provisions when read in context with Article 1101(1)
and in light of the NAFTA’s objectives. They allegedly go further than merely
providing the traditional BIT protection for cross-border investments, protecting
the rights and interests of NAFTA investors directly wherever the investment has
been made in the Free Trade Area and providing them with a right to national
treatment (Tr. pp. 100 ef seq.). It is asserted that this protection is based upon a
comparison of investors whose circumstances of competition are “like” in that
they participate in an integrated continental market (C I, { 62; Tr. p. 101).
Accordingly, not everybody who trades in goods across the Parties’ borders
should be entitled to make a claim for money damages but only those who
invested in building an integrated regional market within the Free Trade Area
and who can prove that they are in like circumstances with other participants in

that same integrated market (Tr. pp. 104 and 261 et seq.).

95.

-78 -

The Claimants argue that these circumstances are -dependent on context, relying
on the award of the Pope & Talbot Tribunal, and further assert that the
circumstances of the present case are sui generis. (C I, {| 63, 104). They allege
that before May 23, 2003, the Claimants competed with U.S. and other Canadian-
based competitors in like circumstances in a continental market, established by
the economic integration within the North American Free Trade Area (Tr. pp. 70
et seq., 102 et seq.). This is said to be confirmed by statistical information (Tr. p.
72 et seq.). It is contended that this situation was changed by the Respondent’s
measures radically altering the circumstances in which North American
cattlemen operated (C I, { 64). The Respondent, however, is said to ignore this
sui generis character of the case by recasting the issue as being common and
well-settled (C I, J 104). Quite to the contrary, the present case is said to be the
first of its kind, where deep regional integration was achieved in a particular

industry (Tr. p. 104).

Summarizing, the Claimants confirm that, according to Article 102(1), the
NAFTA was designed to promote conditions of fair competition in the Free
Trade Area based upon the principle of non-discrimination and national treatment
(CI, J 65; Tr. pp. 166 et seqg.). They reiterate that Articles 1102(1) and 1103(1)
distinguish between the protection of investors and the protection of investments.
With regard to the protection of investments, the Claimants contend that although
neither paragraph indicates a territoriality requirement, Article 1101(1)(b)
imposes it on the provisions (C I, { 66). In contrast, Articles 1101(1)(a), 1102(1)
and 1103(1) do not contain any such territoriality link, indicating that they are
intended for the protection of investors, as investors (C I, J 67). For this reason,
the Claimants also reject Respondent’s interpretation of the treaty terms as
[p]aragraph (1) of Article 1102 must have a meaning independent of paragraph
(2). Otherwise, there would be no need for paragraph (1) and both paragraph (1)
and Article 1101(1) (a) [would be rendered] inutile (C I, {J 68 et seq.). Even in
cases of “pre-establishment,” there would allegedly be no need for Article
1102(1) to be invoked by an investor under this interpretation because the

breadth of protection already provided under Article 1102(2) (C II, [79 et seq).

97.

98.

99.

-79 -

The Claimants further contend that the Respondent fails to acknowledge that if
they had intended to restrict an obligation to measures affecting investments in
the territory of another NAFTA Party, the drafters would have done so clearly.
Whereas Article 102(1)(c) explicitly refers to investments in the “territories of
the Parties” globally, this is contrasted with subparagraph (d) which protects
intellectual property rights “in each Parties’ territory” and, thus, in the territories

of the Parties respectively (C I, { 93; C II, {ff 93 et seq).

Moreover, the Respondent is criticized by Claimants for putting forward
unrelated NAFTA cases such as ADF and unrelated academic articles, ignoring
the claims’ sui generis character (C I, ff] 106 et seg.; Tr. p. 143). Further,
Claimants highlight that in any case pursuant to NAFTA Article 1136(1) “an
award made by a Tribunal shall have no binding force except between the

disputing parties and in respect of the particular case” (C I, ff 106 et seq.).

Additionally, Respondent’s claim of a “habitual practice” rule is heavily
contested by the Claimants, affirming that there is no general rule of treaty
interpretation whereby the plain meaning of treaty terms can or should be
ignored in favour of the so-called “habitual practice” of the Parties (C II, { 30;
Tr. pp. 126 et seq.). The jurisprudence and academic literature which are cited by
the Respondent in support of its position are alleged to be inapplicable to the
present case (C II, {{[ 36 et seg.; Tr. p. 127). Moreover, in Claimants’ view the
Respondent fails to explain why a “habitual pattern” found in the negotiations of
BITs should apply to the NAFTA which is deemed to be unique (C II, { 39).
Furthermore, since the governing law of this arbitration is international law, the
Respondent’s remarks on its national law are deemed to be not useful by the

Respondent (C II, {{ 45).

Lastly, with respect to the Respondent’s claim that a SPS measure would fall
under NAFTA Chapter Seven and, thus, cannot be challenged under NAFTA
Chapter Eleven, the Claimants note that there is nothing in NAFTA Chapter
Seven that prevents the Claimants from seeking damages in relation to the

damages suffered as a result of the Respondent’s imposition of the measures at

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

100.

101.

102.

-80-

issue (C II, {ff 89 et seq.; Tr. pp. 159 et seg.). Accordingly, SPS measures are said
not to be implicitly excluded from the ambit of Article 1102(1) (C IL, {J 90 et

seq.).

Regarding the negotiating history, the Claimants submit that the recourse to
preparatory texts of a treaty as well as to contemporaneous statements and
actions of the Parties form an ancillary approach to treaty interpretation outlined
in VCLT Article 32, which should only be applied if the ordinary meaning of the
treaty terms in context and in light of its objectives lead to an absurd result (Tr.
p. 106). The latter is defined as bizarre or incongruous in context (C I, { 70).
Since neither result of the Parties’ interpretation is absurd, it is suggested that the
ancillary approach need not be applied by the Tribunal (C I, J 71; Tr. pp. 106 er

seq.).

Furthermore, the Claimants object to Respondent’s approach since the NAFTA
Parties did not issue any official travaux préparatoires (Tr. p. 106). Only in July
2004 did the NAFTA Parties jointly release what the Claimants call informal
travaux. Although the Claimants contend that tribunals have been cautious to
read too much into these preparatory texts, an approach they assert was
confirmed by the award in the Methanex arbitration (C I { 72), Claimants
recognize that the draft negotiating texts could serve the limited function of
confirming the meaning of treaty terms derived from application of the general
approach to interpretation, which is said to be confirmed by the decision in the

Noble Ventures arbitration (C I, (73; C II, 7 117).

Subsequently, the Claimants embark upon the drafting history of what would
later become NAFTA Article 1101. They contend that the earliest versions of
Article 1101 qualified the application of NAFTA Chapter Eleven to individual
economic actors who had made an investment in the territory of another Party
without distinguishing between the investor/investment architecture that
demarcates the final version (C I, { 74; Tr. p. 108). The Claimants go on to point
out that by May 22, 1992, the draft provision was broken into a paragraph on

investor protection and a paragraph on investment protection (C I, { 75; Tr. p.

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

103.

104.

105.

-81-

108). On August 26, 1992, the territoriality requirement was removed, leaving
nothing more than “investors of another NAFTA Party” in paragraph (b).
According to the Claimants, this demonstrates how investors were intended by
the drafters to receive protection in their own right as investors, intending a

territorial qualification only for investments (C I, | 76; Tr. p. 109).

As regards the negotiating history of Article 1102, the Claimants consider the
change to the draft on August 26, 1992 by which the territorial requirement for
investors was removed to be of major importance (C I, 79; Tr. p. 109). Since
this part of the provision remained untouched during the following 20 versions of
the negotiating draft, the Claimants conclude that the change was neither
insignificant nor accidental but that it was deliberate (C I, J 80 et seg.; Tr. p.
111). All in all, the Claimants submit that the significance of these changes
confirm the ordinary meaning of the terms in their context and in light of the

objectives of the NAFTA as contended by the Claimants (C I, { 82; Tr. p. 111).

In addition, the Claimants strongly oppose the Respondent’s attempts to
downplay the obvious significance of the changes made to the treaty text by
manufacturing a “legal scrub” exception. They ascertain that there is no basis in
international law for Respondent’s proposition that changes are not significant
just because they were made by lawyers shortly before the finalization of the text
(Tr. p. 107). This is particularly so given the case given that these changes were,
they assert, made by persons who were likely some of the best lawyers in the
Parties’ employ (C I, 115) and that there were no less than 20 more
opportunities to make changes to the text over a period from 31 August, 1992 to

23 April 1993 (C II, J 118; Tr. pp. 107 et seq.).

Lastly, the Respondent’s recourse to the predecessor 1989 Canada-U.S. Free
Trade Agreement and to other BITs is deemed by the Claimants to be irrelevant.
In their view, the NAFTA is an advanced successor agreement, a position which
is said to be confirmed by the Softwood Lumber tribunal. It has its own “scope
and coverage” provision and provides more protection than a mere BIT (C I, {

100 et seq.).

Submission by the United Mexican States

In its Article 1128 submission, the United Mexican States (Mexico) adds that the
interpretation of the NAFTA and particularly of NAFTA Chapter Eleven in
accordance with customary rules of international law must be governed by the
fact that Chapter Eleven is part of a broader Free Trade Agreement, providing for
the liberalization of trade in goods and services by producers situated in the

territories of the contracting States (M, {| 5).

Regarding the context (Articles 31(1) and (2)), first, Mexico agrees with the
United States that the NAFTA Parties did not undertake any obligation with
respect to investments located outside of its territory or regarding investors that
are not seeking to make, are not making and have not made investments in its

territory (M, {[ 2).

As regards trade in goods, Mexico stipulates that NAFTA Chapter Three
provides for national treatment and market access. Mexico argues that violations
of these provisions may only be contested by State-to-State dispute settlement
(M, { 6). Whereas the latter is said to form the general rule for NAFTA dispute
settlement, the investor-State arbitration for an alleged breach of a substantial
provision contained in Section A of Chapter Eleven allegedly is one of two
exceptions that provide a private party with direct access to international
jurisdiction in respect of a circumscribed subject-matter. (M, J 7). Accordingly,
Mexico emphasizes that Chapter Eleven tribunals do not have the competence to
address violations of other NAFTA chapters, and that a private party has no
access to international arbitration to complain of a breach that is not specifically
made actionable by Articles 1116 and 1117 (M, {| 8). While the purpose of the
respective NAFTA chapters is to reduce barriers to trade so that producers
situated in one NAFTA Party enjoy better access to other markets, the NAFTA
did not go so far as to establish a full customs union or common market with no

remaining restrictions on trade between the Parties (M, {J 9 et seq.).

Mexico regards Chapter Eleven as providing for the liberalization of investment
flows, enabling commercial actors to produce goods or services in the territory of
another Party by means of an investment (M, {[ 11). Article 1101 establishes the
Chapter’s scope, indicating that it applies to measures with regard to “investors
of another Party” and “investments of another Party in the territory of the Party”
(M, {| 12). “Investor of a Party” is defined in Article 1139 as a person that seeks
to make, is making, or has made an “investment”. Chapter Eleven applies to
measure relating only to an “investment” of an investor of a Party in the territory
of another contracting Party. From the fact that the term “investment” is used to
define “investor”, Mexico concludes that the obligations of States Parties under
NAFTA Chapter Eleven are owed only to an “investor” that seeks to make, is
making, or has made an investment within the territory of another NAFTA Party
(M, Qf 13 et seq.). This result would also follow from the drafting conventions of
the NAFTA, the Treaty’s territorial basis, the fact that it establishes a free trade
area and not a more extensive form of economic integration, and the plain
meaning of Chapter Eleven’s terms with regard to the applicable rules of treaty
interpretation. To read Article 1101(1)(a) otherwise would lead to an outcome

which was plainly not intended by the NAFTA Parties (M, {| 16).

The disputing Parties have submitted detailed and searching analyses of the
relevant provisions of the NAFTA and related instruments. Their submissions
have been helpful to the Tribunal, which has found the provisions of NAFTA
Chapter Eleven to be less clear and consistent than one might hope for in a treaty

so long negotiated and so closely scrutinized and debated.

Although Claimants’ position is far from frivolous, the Tribunal has concluded

that their interpretation of Chapter Eleven, which would require the isolation of

the investor from his investment, would do more violence to the fabric of Chapter
Eleven, and to the overall fabric of the NAFTA, than the interpretation espoused
by Respondent. In this Tribunal’s view, a careful review of the key provisions of
Chapter Eleven in their full context, as the VCLT requires, demonstrates that the
only investors who may avail themselves of the protections of Chapter Eleven,
including its national treatment protections, are actual or prospective foreign
investors in another NAFTA Party. Because Claimants concede they are only

domestic investors, their claim must fail.

As the Tribunal will discuss in further detail in the following paragraphs,
“investors” do not exist in Chapter Eleven in isolation, but are explicitly linked to
their investments. And because it is clear from the text that the only
“investments” covered by Chapter Eleven are those that are made (or planned to
be made) in the territory of another NAFTA Party by qualifying persons of one
NAFTA Party — i.e., foreign investments — and because it is therefore clear as
well that purely domestic investments do not fall within the scope of Chapter
Eleven of the NAFTA, we find it illogical and inconsistent with the structure of
Chapter Eleven as a whole that the scope of its protection for investors should be

different.

The issue does not turn simply on the presence or absence of specific territorial
language in particular sections. Other provisions of Chapter Eleven, including
those distinguishing between trade and investment rights, provide important
contextual insight. The larger NAFTA, including but not limited to its preamble

and object and purpose clause, also forms part of the relevant context.

Had Chapter Eleven been intended to provide national treatment protection to
domestic investors selling across borders in integrated markets in the NAFTA
free trade area, as Claimants argue, this Tribunal would have expected numerous
provisions of Chapter Eleven to be drafted quite differently, as well as to find
some express indication of such a significant and unprecedented expansion of the
scope of investment protection somewhere in the course of the NAFTA

negotiations, or its approval by the NAFTA Parties. But there is none. There is

none at all. Although NAFTA is arguably unique, and although Chapter Eleven
is a much more complex instrument than a simple bilateral investment treaty,
fundamentally Chapter Eleven functions to encourage and protect foreign
investment, leaving other parts of the NAFTA to provide redress for measures

that do not implicate foreign investors or their investments.

Governing Law

It is common cause between the Parties that the governing law of this dispute is
established by Article 1131 of the NAFTA, which requires a decision in

accordance with the NAFTA and applicable rules of international law.

It is also common cause that the VCLT provides the applicable rules of
international law governing the interpretation of the NAFTA. As _ noted
previously, Article 31(1) of the VCLT requires that a the terms of treaty be
interpreted in good faith, in accordance with their ordinary meaning, taken in
context and in light of the treaty’s object and purpose. Article 31(2) goes on to
define a treaty’s context as including not only its text (including preamble and
annexes) but also any contemporaneous agreement between the parties or any

contemporaneous instrument of one of the parties accepted by the others.!

Analysis: Ordinary Meaning as Discerned from the Text

This Tribunal seeks to determine ordinary meaning by turning first to the text of

key provisions of Chapter Eleven.

"It is also common cause between the disputing parties that Article 31 establishes no hierarchy or
priorities as to the relevance of the particular sources of meaning referred to therein. Subsequent
agreement and/or practice, which are also relevant sources as provided in Article 31(3), are discussed
in the next section.

Article 1101

This Tribunal’s textual analysis begins with Article 1101 — not only the first
article of Chapter Eleven, but a key article in terms of the entire Chapter’s scope
and coverage. Recognizing its critical role, the Methanex Tribunal characterized
Article 1101 as the “gateway” to Chapter Eleven in these terms: “This [Article
1101] is the gateway leading to the dispute resolution provisions of Chapter
Eleven. Hence the powers of the Tribunal can only come into legal existence if
the requirements of Article 1101(1) are met.” [Methanex Corporation v. the

United States of America (First Partial Award), 7 August 2002, J 106.)°

Article 1101 provides for the application of Chapter Eleven to measures adopted
or maintained by a NAFTA Party that relate to three classes: (1) investors of
another Party; (2) investments of investors of another party in the territory of the
Party whose measure is at issue; and (3) with respect to claims involving
measures challenged under Article 1106: Performance Requirements, or Article
1114: Environmental Measures, all investments (i.e., not just from other NAFTA

Parties) in the territory of the Party whose measure is at issue.

There is no dispute between the Parties that the U.S. government actions at issue
here involved “measures” that have been adopted and maintained by a NAFTA
Party. Nor is there any dispute at present about whether the measures at issue
satisfy the “relates to” requirement.> Rather, the dispute in answering the
preliminary question before the Tribunal centers around the proper interpretation
of the term “investors of another Party,” as used in Articles 1101(a) and 1102(1),

and whether the term encompasses persons who have not made, are not seeking

> The Tribunal in Bayview similarly stated: “The role of Article 1101 in determining the scope of the

jurisdiction of tribunals established to hear Chapter Eleven claims is clear from the title of the Article.

It defines the ‘scope and coverage’ of the entirety of Chapter 11 ....”. Bayview Irrigation District v.

of Article 1101 is

> The disputing Parties in this case have agreed that the issue of whether the “relating to” requirement

 

isfied is left for another day, and only to be reached if the answer to the

preliminary issue is affirmative. [see, e.g., Tr. at 284-85].

to make, and are not making, investments in the territory of another NAFTA

Party.

Of these three classes of measures covered by Article 1101, the two focusing on
“investments” contain express territorial limitations, requiring that the
investments be “in the territory of the Party” adopting or maintaining the
measure. Although the third, focusing on “investors,” was drafted without the
inclusion of any explicit territorial language, this Tribunal is of the view that the
meaning of the “investor” class cannot be determined in a vacuum; indeed to do
so would run counter to the dictates of Article 31 of the VCLT. Article 1101

uses defined terms, and our inquiry takes us to those terms next.

Article 1139, the definitions section of Chapter Eleven, does not define
“investor” or “investor of another Party.” However, it does define “investor of a
Party,” of which “investor of another Party” would seem to be a simple variant.
“Investor of a Party” is defined as a “Party [NAFTA country], or state enterprise
thereof, or a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making
or has made an investment” (emphasis added). “Investors of another Party,” as
used in subparagraph (a) of Article 1101, must be investors of a different Party
from the Party enacting the measure at issue, referred to in the lead-in to that

Article.

The foregoing definition leaves no doubt that “investors” only exist based on
“investments.” This is further reinforced by the parallel definition of “investor of
a non-Party” in Article 1139. As with the definition of “investor of a Party,” this
definition focuses on a person “that seeks to make, is making or has made an
investment” (emphasis added). In other words, both Article 1139 definitions of

“investors” make it plain that “investors,” whether of a Party or a non-Party,

cannot exist without “investments.”

Although these definitions of “investors” thus establish a necessary linkage
between investors and investments, they do not answer definitively the question

of where those investments must be located.

125.

126.

127.

128.

-88-

Nor is the definition of “investment” in Article 1139 dispositive on that question,
in this Tribunal’s view (although, as discussed below, certain of its provisions
contain highly probative language). It would be premature, however, to conclude
based on the provisions examined thus far that there is no territorial limitation for

investors in Chapter Eleven.

Returning to Article 1101(1) in light of these definitions provides the first
crystallization of the answer. From the fact that Article 1101(b) and (c), which
are conjunctively linked with 1101(a), explicitly limit Chapter Eleven’s coverage
to investments in the territory of the Party whose measure is at issue, it is
apparent that the foreign investment, and the investors who engage in such
investment activities, are the concern of Chapter Eleven. In other words,
“investors” are inextricably linked to “investments,” which Article 1101 limits to
“foreign investments,’— that is to say, investments of a party in the territory of

another Party whose measure is at issue. 4

Thus, the “gateway” to Chapter Eleven — Article 1101 — is properly read, in this
Tribunal’s view, to render Chapter Eleven applicable only to investors of one
NAFTA Party who seek to make, are making, or have made, an investment in
another NAFTA Party. Absent those conditions, both the substantive protections
of Section A, and the remedies provided by Section B, of Chapter Eleven, are

unavailable to an investor.

Although this analysis should be sufficient to dispose of the issue at hand,
subsequent sections will review other relevant provisions of Chapter Eleven and
the NAFTA so as to provide the fullest possible context for this Tribunal’s

conclusions.

* The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that Chapter Eleven’s failure to use the term “foreign

investment” or “foreign investor” should not be given any weight asthe NAFTA is a multilateral

rather than a bilateral treaty. [R II, p. 15.]

Article 1102

An examination of the provisions of Article 1102, the national treatment norm
claimed to have been violated in these cases, provides no basis for change in the
above analysis. The article begins with parallel protections for “investors of
another Party” and their “investments” in Articles 1102(1) and 1102(2),
respectively. [For text, see section F.I. supra.] The investor protections of Article
1102(1) establish obligations of the state enacting the measures not with respect

to investors in isolation, but in connection with the treatment of their similarly
5

 

situated “investments.” Article 1102, rather than eliminating it, thus maintains
and reinforces the necessary linkage of investors to investments found in our

analysis of Article 1101.

Claimants have made much of the fact that there is no territorial language in
Article 1102(1). This proves too much, as neither Article 1101(1) (focusing on
investors) nor 1101(2) (focusing on investments) contains such language. Its
absence does not signify, in this Tribunal’s view, that no territorial limitation for
either is required, but, instead, simply reinforces the conclusion that it is the
“gateway,” Article 1101, that supplies that reference point for both
subparagraphs. To read Article 1102(1) as Claimants would have this Tribunal
do, as conferring national treatment rights on investors without foreign
investments because of the absence of territorial language in that subparagraph,
would ignore this structure and context. The fact that the only mention of
territoriality in Article 1102 is in Article 1102(4), a provision applicable to
“investors,” whose stated purpose is to “provide greater certainty,” is further

reinforcement of this view.

Other Chapter Eleven Tribunals have read territorial language into Article
1102(1). The ADF Tribunal interpreted Article 1102 as “entitl[ing] an investor

of another Party and its investment to equal (in the sense of ‘no less favorable’)

 

are the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct,

operation, and sale and other disposition of “investments.”

treatment, in like circumstances, with a Party’s domestic investors and their
investments, from the time of entry and ‘establishment’ or acquisition’ of the
investment in the territory of that Party, through the ‘management,’ ‘conduct,’
and ‘operation’ and ‘expansion’ of that investment, and up to the final ‘sale or
other disposition’ of the same investment.” [ADF Group, Inc. v. United States,

ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, [ 153 (Jan. 9, 2003).]

Moreover, as Respondent has pointed out, the investor provisions have
independent meaning. For example, providing certain substantive protections for
“investors” as distinct from “investments” is important in the pre-establishment
phase of an investment, as well as in the circumstances highlighted by Article

1102(4). [See R II, pp. 16-18.]

Conversely, were the NAFTA to providing national treatment protection to
“investors” having only domestic investments, without providing such treatment
to the investments themselves (a result required by the explicit territorial
requirements of Article 1101(2)), an asymmetry in the scope of the NAFTA
would result. Such a dichotomy would not only be illogical, as Respondent has
argued [see R I, pp. 12-13], but would also be difficult to reconcile with other

provisions of Chapter Eleven, as discussed earlier and below.

Articles 1103 and 1116

Claimants have highlighted two other provisions of Chapter Eleven — Articles

1103 and 1116 — to support their interpretation of Articles 1101 and 1102.

Article 1103, Chapter Eleven’s most-favored-nation clause, is, in structure and
substance, identical (except for the comparator class) to Article 1102. An analysis
of its provisions yields results no different from the analysis of Articles 1101 and

1102 above regarding the territorial scope of Chapter Eleven.

Nor do the so-called claiming provisions of Article 1116, (under which the

instant claims are brought,) support a different finding as to the meaning of

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

137.

138.

-91-

Article 1101. Article 1116, the basis for Claimants’ claims, permits claims to be
made by an investor of a Party on its on behalf. Its counterpart, Article 1117,
permits claims by an investor of a Party on behalf of an enterprise of another
Party that it owns or controls. Claimants’ attempt to present Article 1116 as the
procedural complement to the investor-focused rights in Article 1102(1) makes
little sense both as a textual matter and also when the claiming provisions are

considered comparatively and in context.

First, both Article 1116 and Article 1117 focus on investors; they do not reflect a
parallel investor/investment structure. (In fact, Article 1117 not only focuses on
investors rather than investments, but specifically prohibits claims by
investments.) Both rely on the Article 1139 definition of “investor.” As discussed
supra, this definition makes it clear that investors do not exist in isolation from
their investments. Moreover, Article 1101, by its terms, applies to the entirety of
Chapter Eleven, including the procedural provisions of Section B of which the
claiming provisions of Article 1116 are part. Article 1101 unambiguously refers
to “this Chapter,” which comprises both Section A, the substantive investment
protections, and Section B, the investment dispute resolution mechanism.
Neither Article 1116 nor Article 1117 contains territorial language. And the
express language of Article 1117 regarding the enterprises on whose behalf an
Article 1117 claim may be submitted also evidences a focus on foreign investors

by its reference to enterprises of another Party. Considering Article 1116 in this

 

context, the Tribunal sees no basis for concluding it is intended to establish a

claim mechanism for domestic investors.

Other Provisions of Chapter Eleven - Further Context

Other provisions of Chapter Eleven support the conclusion reached above that the
only investors protected by Chapter Eleven are those that have made, are making,
or seek to make investments in another NAFTA Party, not those who have only
made domestic investments and therefore merely suffer losses in the context of

trade in goods or services.

This subsection examines three areas: first, provisions in Chapter Eleven which
focus primarily not on territoriality per se, but on the types of activities covered
by Chapter Eleven, particularly those that elucidate the extent to which Chapter
Eleven’s applies to cross-border trade in goods and services; second; other
provisions of Chapter Eleven that overlay or interact, explicitly or implicitly,
with Article 1102 or investment activities protected by Article 1102, thereby
shedding light on the scope of investor protections under Article 1102; and third,
the extent to which territorial references in other substantive protections of
Section A of Chapter Eleven, and the negotiating history of Chapter Eleven, offer

probative evidence on the proper interpretation of Articles 1101 and 1102(1).

@ Exclusion of Cross-Border Trade Activities From Chapter Eleven

Several provisions of Chapter Eleven confirm that only investors with foreign
investment, and not domestic investors such as Claimants engaging in cross-

border trade, fall within the scope of Chapter Eleven.

Article 1139’s definition of “investment” is perhaps the most important
illustration of this point, as its definitions apply across all provisions of Chapter
Eleven. Subparagraphs (a) through (g) of this definition enumerate a range of
interests that can qualify as investments, from different territorial types of
securities to other economic interests and assets, and do not explicitly address

issues of territorial location. °

However, the last two subparagraphs of the “investment” definition, in the
context of addressing contractual interests, demonstrate that NAFTA Chapter

Eleven was not intended to cover simple cross-border trading interests.

6 Claimants’ submissions have focused primarily on subparagraph (g) of Article 1139, which covers

“real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the

purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes.”

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

143.

144.

-93-

Subparagraph (h), in discussing turnkey, construction, and other types of
contractual interests, requires a commitment of capital or other resources “in the
territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory” for such interests to be

considered an “investment” (emphasis added).

Subparagraphs (i), and (j) of the definition of “investment,” exclusionary clauses
also focus on contractual claims, and are even more telling. Subparagraph (i)
provides that mere money claims arising out of cross-border goods in trade or
services or trade financing, unaccompanied by any of the other interests
previously enumerated in the definition, do not constitute an investment.’

Subparagraph (j) excludes “any other claims to money.”

In other words, these exclusions establish that mere cross-border trade interests
are not sufficient to trigger Chapter Eleven — something more permanent — such
as a commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to
economic activity in such territory — is necessary for a contractual claim for
money based on cross-border trade to rise to the level of an investment.
Moreover, the exclusion’s requirement that these simple trade interests be
coupled with one of the other types of investment interests enumerated in

998

subparagraphs (a) through (h) to fall within the definition of “investment” make

’ The specific text of this exclusion is as follows:

“but investment does not mean,

(i) claims to money that arise solely from

(i) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or
services by a national or enterprise in the
territory of a Party to an enterprise in the
territory of another Party, or

(ii) the extension of credit in connection with a
commercial transaction, such as trade
financing, other than a loan covered by
subparagraph (d) [longer-term inter-company
loans]; or

[text of (j) omitted]
...that do not involve the kinds of interests set out in subparagraphs (a) through

(h).”

-94-

it evident that wherever in Chapter Eleven it is not express, there is, nevertheless,
an implied requirement that those investment interests be located in the host

country as well.

Stated somewhat differently, had Chapter Eleven been intended to extend any
protections to purely domestic investors, as Claimants suggest, it is evident to
this Tribunal that the Article 1139(i) and (j) exclusions from “investment” would
have had to be written much differently. Goods and services produced by a trade
claimant are themselves invariably the products of investments, large or small,
whether those investments are in the production or distribution of goods and
services, and whether they are in the home country, the host country, a third
country, or some combination of these. Accordingly, had there been an intention
to protect domestic as well as foreign investment under any provisions of Chapter
Eleven, including Article 1102, the Article 1139(i) and (j) exclusions could not
have been written in such a sweeping way. Rather, the drafters would have had
either to eliminate the exclusions entirely, revise the denial of benefits provision
in Article 1113, or otherwise distinguish (perhaps by degree of industry
integration) between categories of domestic investors. The fact that this was not
done is further evidence to the Tribunal that Chapter Eleven is properly
interpreted as protecting only foreign investment and investors, not foreign
traders, no matter how integrated the particular industry operating on both sides

of a border.

Article 1112(2) takes a similar approach in the context of services, a topic which
is the subject of another chapter (Chapter 12) of the NAFTA. Article 1112(2)
provides that a Party’s requirement that a cross-border service provider post a
bond or other form of financial security as a condition of providing a service into
the territory of that Party does not result in Chapter Eleven being applicable to
the cross-border service itself. Article 1112(2) explicitly distinguishes between
such cross-border activity, which is not subject to Chapter Eleven, and the bond
or financial security that the cross-border service provider posts, which is made

subject to Chapter Eleven.

147.

148.

149.

150.

-95-

The drafters of Chapter Eleven thus carefully differentiated between the
underlying cross-border service and the commitment of financial resources
pursuant to a requirement of the country to which the services are exported. The
exclusion makes no exception for those cross-border service providers that have
investments in their home country that enable them to provide the services, as
this Tribunal would expect if Claimants’ position were the intended one. The
precise textual distinction of this Article, and the absence of provisions
addressing home country investment, thus reinforce the conclusion that Chapter
Eleven is not intended to apply to interests arising merely from cross-border trade

activities.

(ii) Other Probative Provisions of Chapter Eleven

Other provisions of Chapter Eleven that explicitly overlay with Article 1102, or
necessarily implicate the activities Claimants assert are protected by Article
1102(1), also are bereft of any indication of applicability to purely domestic

investors. Articles 1111, 1109, and 1114 are of particular interest in this regard.

Article 1111 relating to Special Formalities and Information Requirements,”
preserves the ability of host states to impose certain requirements on foreign
investors and their investments without thereby violating Article 1102,
reinforcing the view that Chapter Eleven, including Article 1102, is concerned

only with foreign investors and foreign investments.

Article 1111(1) states that

“nothing in Article 1102 shall be construed to prevent a Party from
adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities
in connection with the establishment of investments by investors of
another Party, such as a requirement that investors be residents of the
Party or that investments be legally constituted under the laws or
regulations of the Party, provided that such formalities do not
materially impair the protections afforded by a Party to investors of
another Party and investments of investors of another Party pursuant
to this Chapter.”

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

- 96 -

The focus on foreign investors and foreign investment in this provision is

manifest, and its reference to Article 1102 implies a similar focus for that Article.

151. Article 1111(2), which applies notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 1102
and 1103, permits NAFTA Parties to impose reporting requirements on foreign
investors or their investments for analytical and statistical purposes.” There is no
hint in these provisions of any concern for domestic investors or investment in

this Article, or by implication, Articles 1102 or 1103.

152. Article 1109 relating to “Transfers,” while not referring specifically to Article
1102, is another example of a provision that this Tribunal considers would be
significantly different if Article 1102(1) had been intended to cover domestic
investors. Article 1109(1) requires that host countries permit the free transfer of
profits from investment within its territory. Article 1109(3) goes on to prohibit a
Party from requiring its investors’ to transfer back profits from investments in
the territory of another Party, or from penalizing them for failing to make such
transfers — i.e., from leaving such profits outside the home country. Had the
NAFTA Parties intended for domestic investors to be protected by Chapter
Eleven, even if just in Articles 1102 and 1103 as Claimants argue, Article 1109

would have needed a complementary provision to Article 1109(3)’s repatriation-

° E.g., the International Investment Trade in Services Survey Act (IITSSA), 20 U.S.C. § 3101 et seq.
Claimants confused these types of reporting requirements, which apply only to foreign investors or
their investments, with U.S. securities law requirements that apply to both U.S. and foreign companies

seeking acces

 

to U.S. capital markets. And both disputing parties appear to have conflated questions
of extraterritorial jurisdiction to prescribe and enforce norms of conduct over persons engaged in
international business activity with the question of the territorial scope of States’ obligations under
Chapter Eleven. However, all Article 1111 says is that it would not be a violation of national
treatment or most-favored treatment requirements for a Party to require a foreign investor or its
investment to provide certain information or observe certain formalities in the making of that
investment.

'° This appears to be the only provision of Chapter Eleven that impos

 

requirements on a NAFTA

 

Party with respect to its own investors. The word “its” modifying “investors” makes this clear.
Moreover, this obligation only makes sense if Chapter Eleven is intended to promote foreign
investment, and in connection with that promotional goal, to protect foreign investors.

focused prohibition, prohibiting home countries from imposing limitations on the

expatriation of profits.

Article 1114(2) is an acknowledgment that relaxations of domestic health, safety
or environmental measures by a country are inappropriate ways of encouraging
investment, and that NAFTA Parties may request consultations if they consider
that another Party has improperly encouraged such investment. While lacking
explicit territorial language, it is obvious that this provision assumes that the
purpose of Chapter Eleven is the encouragement of foreign investment by
investors of other NAFTA Parties. It is consequently both a further example of
provisions in Chapter Eleven that we believe would have to be drafted quite
differently if domestic investors could qualify for national treatment protection,

as well as evidence of the intended purpose of Chapter Eleven.

These are just some of the examples of additional relevant context from other
provisions of Chapter Eleven. In the Tribunal’s view, these examples provide
further textual evidence that Article 1102 Chapter Eleven is properly construed as
requiring an investor to have made, or be seeking to make, foreign investment to

receive the benefits of Chapter Eleven.

(iii) Territoriality in Other Substantive Provisions in Section A of

Chapter Eleven and Negotiating History

The remaining substantive protections in Subchapter A of Article 11 do not
reveal an intention by the NAFTA Parties to extend any of Chapter Eleven’s
protections to domestic investors, either. Stated somewhat differently, for the
reasons detailed below, they do not suggest to this Tribunal any intention to
provide extraterritorial benefits for NAFTA investors or impose extraterritorial

obligations on NAFTA Parties.

A number of the investment protection provisions in Section A of Chapter Eleven

(Articles 1104, 1005(2), and 1111(2)) focus on investors as well as investments.

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

157.

158.

- 98 -

Others (e.g., Articles 1105(1), 1107, 1109(1) (as discussed above), and 1110)
focus only on investments. Notably, these provisions are inconsistent — sometime
even within the same article — in the extent to which they contain territorial
language." This inconsistency is particularly striking with respect to the

: . sos 12
investment-protection provisions.

Claimants made much in their oral and written submissions of the fact that during
the final drafting stages of the NAFTA, territorial references were removed from
Articles 1101 and 1102 and remained untouched for some twenty drafts, while
territorial references in other sections of Chapter Eleven were included or
removed. Respondent has argued that any changes made during this ”legal scrub”

process should not be given much weight.

Recognizing that the “legal scrub” occurred at a late stage in the treaty
negotiations, when the substance of the NAFTA was ostensibly settled, and that
we have no official travaux on which to rely, the Tribunal nevertheless confesses
to being troubled by the scrubbers’ apparently deliberate attention to territorial
language in some parts of Chapter Eleven and not in others. Having no
explanation for those changes, and having extensively studied the language of the
final product, however, this Tribunal is persuaded that it is not fruitful to try to
infer too much from this unexplained history, or from the presence or absence of
territorial language in these other substantive protections of Section A of Chapter
Eleven, as the drafting appears to be inconsistent and in many places not clearly

or fully developed.’

Performance Requirements (investments), 1109: Transfers (investments, except for 1109(3) discussed
below, which applies to investors), and 1110: Expropriation (territorial language) (investments), all of
which contain territorial language.

'S For example, Article 1105(2) contains territorial language, but its language appears to have a
descriptive function (“measures it adopts in its territory owing to armed conflict or civil strife”), or

This is especially true in that these substantive provisions of Chapter A represent
the classic types of protections found in treaties designed to encourage and
protect foreign investment. Moreover, to focus solely on the presence or absence
of territorial language in a particular subsection misses, as this Tribunal sees it,
the bigger picture that emerges from a detailed consideration of the text. This
Tribunal finds no indication in any of these other provisions of an intention to
provide extraterritorial protection to investors or their investments. Yet that is
precisely what would result from giving effect to those substantive provisions
that lack territorial language. This would be inconsistent with Article 1101, a
provision of overriding effect. Ultimately the choice comes down either to
concluding that certain territorial language in the substantive protections of
Chapter Eleven is rendered superfluous (not contradicted) by virtue of Article
1101, or to finding extraterritorial obligations and benefits of significant scope by
an isolated and non-contextual reading. This Tribunal believes the former to be

the course more consistent with the body of the relevant evidence.

Object and Purpose of the NAFTA, and in Particular, of Chapter Eleven

This brings the Tribunal to the disputing Parties’ debate about the purpose of the
NAFTA. The disputing Parties have spilled much ink over the proper
interpretation and role of Article 102 of the NAFTA.

That Article contains only one clause referencing investments, Article 102(1)(c),
which speaks of “‘increas[ing] investment opportunities in the territories of the

Parties.” (italics ours).

 

one that is perhaps meant to delineate the scope of available damages. As to the absence of territorial

language in Article 1105(1), this Tribunal was not persuaded by Claimants’ argument at the hearing

that its absence was not significant given the NAFTA Free Trade Commission’s subsequent

interpretation of Article 1105. This argument ignored the disparity in the language of the two

paragraphs of Article 1105, and the fact that the interpretation focused not on addressing the

provisi

  

n’s territorial scope (which was assumed to relate only to foreign investment), but on the

clarifying the substantive breadth of the protection provided by Article 1105.

Claimants seek to characterize this plural reference as ambiguous, and emphasize
the importance of other goals, in particular free competition and market
integration among the States Parties, in Article 102 and in the NAFTA’s
preamble [C I, {{[ 42-48]. Those goals, they argue, provide justification for
reading Articles 1101 and 1102 as protecting investors who have only domestic
investments, especially those who function in highly integrated markets, in the

limited context of national treatment.

Respondent argues that NAFTA Chapter Eleven is no more than a BIT dropped
into a free trade agreement, and would give limited effect to the provisions of
Article 102 and the NAFTA’s preamble, except for the investment protection

goal.

Without disagreeing with the fundamental conclusion of the Metalclad
Tribunal," in this Tribunal’s view, neither of the disputing Parties has gotten it
quite right. Despite the fact, as we have seen, that many of its provisions are
typical of bilateral investment protection treaties, NAFTA Chapter Eleven cannot
be reduced simply to an ordinary bilateral investment treaty. For one thing, it is
not bilateral but multilateral (thus leading to some of the linguistic challenges
mentioned earlier). Second, and more fundamentally, it functions as part of a
larger agreement that requires analysis of how the different parts of the treaty

interrelate in a range of circumstances.

Chapter Eleven itself reflects this interdependence thoroughly. Beginning with its
gateway, Article 1101, which carves out measures covered by Chapter 14
(Financial Services), Chapter Eleven is replete with provisions showing its
interconnectedness to other parts of the NAFTA. Article 1112(1) makes Chapter

Eleven in its entirely subordinate to the provisions of other NAFTA chapters

intent “to promote and increase cross-bord PL ities,” Iclad Corporation v.

where there are inconsistencies — thereby establishing the supremacy of other
dispute resolution mechanisms in the event of conflict.'> Article 1115 contains a
savings clause that insures that the rights and obligations of the NAFTA States
Parties under the dispute settlement provisions of Chapter 20 of the treaty are
preserved, subject to the provisions of Article 1138. The latter article also
clarifies the relationship between Chapter Eleven and national-security based
actions under Article 2102. A number of other provisions of Chapter Eleven,
including Articles 1116 and 1117, discussed earlier, import provisions from
outside the Chapter. And provisions outside of Chapter Eleven — for example, the
provisions of Article 2103 — affect an investor’s exercise of the rights granted by

Chapter Eleven.

Thus, it is clear to this Tribunal that NAFTA Chapter Eleven cannot be viewed in
isolation but must be considered in light of its larger context — the NAFTA as a
whole. However, is that does not mean that Chapter Eleven itself must bear the
whole weight of the diverse purposes set out in Article 102. Those purposes, it is
clear, apply to the treaty in its complex entirety, and some are wholly irrelevant
to Chapter Eleven. As one Chapter Eleven Tribunal, the ADF Tribunal, has
stated, the NAFTA’s overall purpose clause is akin to a lex generalis, while the
particular chapter is a lex specialis. [ADF Group v. United States, ICSID Case
No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, { 147 (Jan. 9, 2003).] The corollary is that particular
segments of the treaty may reflect a much more limited set of purposes than the
overall purposes clause sets forth. As Chapter Eleven lacks its own object and
purpose clause, as a stand-alone investment treaty would likely have, its meaning
must be discerned principally from textual analysis of the /ex specialis and other

relevant context.

At the hearing, Claimants were pressed to identify any free trade agreement that

contained investment protections of the scope it argued for under the NAFTA —

'S Chapter 7 of the NAFTA, dealing with sanitary and phytosanitary measures, such as those on which

the instant claims are based are asserted to be, contains a parallel override for provisions subject to

that Chapter.

i.e., that protected domestic as well as foreign investors. [Tr. pp. 125-127.]
Claimants were unable to do so. Leaving aside customs unions and other
arrangements going beyond free trade areas, there can be no question that
Claimants’ interpretation of Chapter Eleven would result in its providing an
unprecedented scope of protection to investors. Although Claimants may be
correct that the NAFTA may be in some respect sui generis, considerably more
specific evidence of the NAFTA Parties’ intent to achieve such a result is, in this
Tribunal’s view, necessary to support such a material expansion in the scope of

Chapter Eleven.

Recalling especially the controversy that surrounded the passage of the NAFTA,
it is more than passing strange to this Tribunal that such a sweeping expansion of
the scope of investor protection would have gone unnoticed in the course of the
NAFTA’s adoption. Instead, all of the evidence adduced by the Parties
contemporaneous with the adoption of the NAFTA, including the Statements of
Administrative Action in Canada and the United States,'° other official
documents,'” and commentary,'* characterize purely Chapter Eleven in
conventional terms as analogous to a bilateral investment treaty, with the purpose
of encouraging the protection of foreign investment. Had there been an intention
to protect domestic investments — something that surely would have been
significant to all considering the treaty, as it would expand the scope of treaty

obligations — this Tribunal would have expected to see this highlighted, and

indicating that Chapter Eleven is intended to protect cross-border investors and investments.

are likewise explicit and unambiguous. [R I, p. 14-15; R Il, p. 26-27 at notes 64-65.]

thoroughly analyzed. A failure to do so, especially in face of statements affirming
a conventional scope and purpose for Chapter Eleven, would not just be a
material omission, but an omission that would make the official statements that

were made incomplete and misleading.

169. Respondent’s equation of Chapter Eleven with a BIT does not do full justice to
the structure and scheme of the NAFTA. Nevertheless, its fundamental point as
concerns the purpose of Chapter Eleven must be sustained. The object and
purpose of Chapter Eleven is only to protect foreign investors. Chapter Eleven
does not give investors of one NAFTA Party who have not made, are not making,
nor seeking to make, an investment in another NAFTA Party the ability to claim
directly for damages for violations of rights granted by Chapter Eleven. The fact
that the NAFTA indisputably seeks to promote economic integration among
industries in the three States Parties does not mean that the border has been
eliminated for purposes of investor protection, no matter how similar or

integrated the industries on each side of the border may be.

170. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal gives limited weight to the authorities
put forward by the Respondent involving the terms of subsequent free trade
agreements. Our focus on textual analysis of the NAFTA and the mandates of the
VCLT gives these authorities limited probative value to the issues at hand, except
to demonstrate that certain terminology used in the NAFTA (e.g., the term “free

trade area”) has no unique significance.

LIII. Subsequent Agreement and Practice (Article 31 (3) VCLT )

1. Arguments by Respondent

171. As regards the subsequent practice, the Respondent asserts that the authentic

interpretation of a treaty remains the exclusive province of the State Parties

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

172.

173.

174.

- 104 -

themselves that may construct the treaty either expressly or tacitly through
subsequent conduct (R Il, p. 11; Tr. p. 47). VCLT Article 31 (3) is said to
expressly provide that any subsequent agreement or practice among the Parties
to the Treaty regarding the interpretation of the Treaty shall [...] “be taken into
account together with the context” (Tr. pp. 25 et seq.). As there is no hierarchy
among the elements of interpretation enumerated in VCLT Article 31, the
subsequent practice of the Parties to the Treaty is a critical element to be
considered, along with the Treaty’s text, context, and object and purpose (Tr. p.

26).

In this respect, the Respondent strongly opposes the Claimants’ point of view that
subsequent statements of the Parties with regard to treaty provisions are “neither
relevant nor credible”, pointing out that the parties to the treaty are best situated
to understand the sense of the treaty that they concluded. This view is said to be
confirmed by the award in the Methanex arbitration and by academic writers (R.

Il, p. 13).

The Respondent submits that all three NAFTA Parties have confirmed its
interpretation of Chapter Eleven’s purpose, which is to protect those investors
and investments with respect to another NAFTA Party’s territory (R I, p. 7; R II,
pp. 3, 12; Tr. p. 24). The Claimants’ argument that the Parties never formally
agreed upon the interpretation of the NAFTA through the Free Trade
Commission pursuant to Article 2001(2), is rejected by the Respondent, noting
that the suggestion [...] that a particular formality is required for there to be an
agreement among the NAFTA Parties is incorrect (R Il, pp. 13-14, 303). A

similar argument was allegedly rejected by the Methanex Tribunal (Tr. p. 50).

The Respondent, then, embarks upon alleged subsequent practice by the United
States. First, the United States Statement of Administrative Action (“SAA”)
which was submitted to Congress with the conclusion of the NAFTA is cited,
stating that Chapter Eleven “applies where such firms or nationals make or seek
to make investments in another NAFTA country” (R I, p. 7; R II, p. 15; Tr. pp.

25, 48). It further specifies that “Part A [of Chapter Eleven] sets out each

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

- 105 -

government’s obligations with respect to investors from other NAFTA countries
and their investments in its territory”. Likewise, the United States General
Accounting Office is said to characterize NAFTA Chapter Eleven in a report to
Congress as relating to “any measure of a NAFTA Party that affects investments
in its territory by an investor of another NAFTA Party.” (R I, p. 8; Tr. p. 253).
Additionally, it is contended that the United States’ Congressional Budget Office
noted in its analysis of the NAFTA that Chapter Eleven’s national treatment
article only “provide[s] that investors from one NAFTA country with an
investment in another should be treated no less favorably [...]” (R II, p. 26; Tr. p.
43). In a similar manner, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative purportedly
concluded that the NAFTA enables investors “to go directly to international
arbitration for disputes with the host government” (R IL. p. 27; Tr. pp. 43, 253).
And lastly, the United States additionally made a submission pursuant to Article
1128 in the Bayview arbitration, reiterating that the aim of NAFTA Chapter
Eleven, which is also set forth in Article 102 (1) (c) only is to protect foreign

investments and the investors who make them (Tr. pp. 44 ef seq.).

Furthermore, in order to point out Canada’s purported support of its
interpretation, the Respondent relies on the Canadian Statement on
Implementation of the NAFTA, in which the Canadian Government sets out that
Chapter Eleven provides “a rules-based approach to the resolution of disputes
involving foreign investors in Canada or Canadian investors abroad.” (R I, p. 8;
RIL, p. 16; Tr. pp. 49, 306). Furthermore, the Respondent contends that in the
S.D. Myers arbitration, Canada reiterated that Chapter Eleven applies only to
investors that have, or are seeking to make, investments in the territory of the
disputing Party (RI, p. 8; RIL, p. 12; Tr. pp. 24 et seq., 48 et seq., 306 et seq.).
Claimants’ attempts to deny these findings are deemed to be unavailing (Tr. p.
48). The fact that Canada did not make a submission pursuant to Article 1128 to
this arbitration allegedly cannot serve as any basis for concluding that it
disagrees with the interpretation proposed by the Respondent (Tr. pp. 304 et

seq.).

176.

177.

178.

- 106 -

Third, the Respondent argues that Mexico similarly stated in the Bayview
arbitration that “Chapter Eleven [...] aim[s] to promote and protect foreign
investment” and that it does not intend “to protect [...] the property of one state[‘s
nationals] in that same state”. Further, that Chapter Eleven “only applies to
investments of investors of a Party in the territory of another Party, and to the
investors of another Party insofar as they have made such investments.” (R I, pp.
8 et seq.; Tr. p. 171). This view is alleged to be confirmed by Mexico’s Article
1128 submission in this arbitration in which Mexico expressly “agrees with the
United States that none of the NAFTA Parties undertook any obligation with
respect to investments located outside of its territory or with respect to
“investors” who are not seeking to make, are not making and have not made

investments in its territory.” (R II, p. 12; Tr. pp. 24, 171).

Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the NAFTA Parties’ concordant,
common and consistent State practice affirms Respondent’s interpretation of
Chapter Eleven’s limited scope with regard to investors of a Party that have not
invested, and do not intend to invest, in another NAFTA Party, but have invested
only in the territory of their home State (R I, p. 9; R II, p. 14). Relying on the
ADF award, the Respondent concludes that there can be no more authentic and

authoritative source of instruction” (Tr. p. 47).

Arguments by Claimants

First, the Claimants criticize that the Respondent embellishes and exaggerates the
meaning of the alleged “subsequent practice” of the NAFTA Parties by
reserving an “exclusive” right to provide an “authentic” interpretation to itself
and the other NAFTA Parties. Quite contrary to this allegation, it is contended
that the subsequent practice of parties to a treaty may be used only to inform
one’s interpretation of such treaty (C II, { 46), particularly where the meaning of
treaty terms are unclear or obscure (C II, { 50). The Claimants reaffirm that the
text of a treaty itself remains the best indicator of the Parties’ “original intent” as

it remains untainted by any revelation or revision by NAFTA Party officials

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

179.

180.

- 107-

subsequent to their learning that a NAFTA claim has been commenced (C II, {
50).

Moreover, although the Respondent is said to be well aware that a specific
mechanism exists under Article 2001 (2) in conjunction with Article 1131 (2)
whereby the NAFTA Parties could agree on the interpretation of Articles 1101
(1) and 1102 (1) through the auspices of the Free Trade Commission, a statement
under this mechanism was not issued in the present case (C I, J 114; C II, 9] 47,
51; Tr. p. 121). The Respondent’s alleged attempt to dictate a binding
interpretation of the NAFTA text to this Tribunal without reference to this
mechanism is deemed by the Claimants to violate the principle of effectiveness in
treaty interpretation (C II, { 47). The Claimants further purport that if
Respondent’s interpretation was followed, this would lead to the possibility of
labeling any comment of a NAFTA Party about a provision as “subsequent
conduct”, thereby demonstrating the “authenticity” of [a Party’s] position in any
given case (C II, J 48). This allegedly disposes of the need to establish a tribunal
under Chapter Eleven as the Parties are primarily responsible for the

“authorative interpretation” (C II, 1 49; Tr. pp. 123 et seq.).

The more so as the Claimants strongly believe that the Respondent misleads the
Tribunal in arguing that all three NAFTA Parties have agreed upon the issue (C
I, { 114; C II, { 51). Quite to the contrary, the Claimants strongly believe that
there is no authentic interpretation, meaning direct agreement of the Parties here
(Tr. p. 245). Particularly, the Claimants allege that the Government of Canada
did neither issue any statements with relevance for this case in the S.D. Myers
case nor in its “Statement on Implementation” (C II, {J 51 et seg.). Whereas the
S.D. Myers arbitration is distinguished by its factual background and legal
argument by the Claimants (Tr. pp. 115 et seg.; Tr. p. 247), the Canadian
“Statement on Implementation” is explicitly said not to refer to the NAFTA as
being a mere “investment treaty” (C II, {| 53 et seq.). Additionally, Canada did
not issue any submission under NAFTA Article 1128 concerning this arbitration
(Tr. pp. 121 et seg., 243). Furthermore, the facts, claims and legal arguments

submitted in the Bayview arbitration by Mexico are deemed by the Claimants as

3.

181.

182.

183.

- 108 -

to be categorically different from this case and, thus, Mexico’s submission in that
case is said to be not relevant either (C II, {{] 60 et seq.; Tr. pp. 115 et seq.). In
addition, submissions under Article 1128 are generally not binding (C II, { 50).

The Tribunal

Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that,
in treaty interpretation:
“There shall be taken into account, together with the context:
(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;
(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding _ its

interpretation....”. (emphasis added)

In applying this customary rule of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal agrees with a
leading commentator that “/t/he value and significance of subsequent practice
will naturally depend on the extent to which it is concordant, common, and
consistent. A practice is a sequence of facts or acts and cannot in general be
established by one isolated fact or act or even by several individual
applications.” Tan Sinclair, The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and

Ed. (Manchester University Press, 1984), 137.

Consistent with this rule, the Tribunal is of the view that, in interpreting a treaty,
“reference may be made to ‘subsequent practice that clearly establishes the
understanding of all the parties regarding its interpretation.’ ” Ian Brownlie,
Principles of Public International Law, 5" Ea. (Oxford University Press, 1998,
635). The Tribunal is, furthermore, of the view that, as the rule states, any
“subsequent agreement” or “subsequent practice” of the kind contemplated by
the rule “shall be taken into account, together with the context’ of the treaty

terms subject to interpretation.

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

184.

185.

186.

187.

- 109 -

As to the issue of “subsequent agreement,” the Tribunal observes that Article
1131(2) of the NAFTA provides: “An interpretation by the Commission of a
provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this
section.” The “Commission to which this provision refers is the Free Trade
Commission established by the NAFTA Parties under Article 2001(1) of the
NAFTA “comprising cabinet-level representatives of the Parties or their

designees.” Article 2001(2)(c) provides that, among its other responsibilities
relating to the NAFTA, “/t/he Commission shall...resolve disputes that may

arise regarding its interpretation or application.”

It is not disputed by either Claimants or Respondent that the NAFTA Parties have
not sought an interpretation by the Commission on the preliminary issue before
this Tribunal. Claimants see this as persuasive evidence that there is no
“subsequent agreement” on this issue among the NAFTA Parties. Respondent
argues that the formal process of interpretation under Article 1131(2) is not the
only means available to the NAFTA Parties of reaching a “subsequent

agreement.”

On this point, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent. But has a “subsequent
agreement” been reached on this issue by the NAFTA Parties by other means?
The Respondent maintains that there is such a “subsequent agreement,” and
points to its own statements on the issue, before this Tribunal and elsewhere; to
Mexico’s Article 1128 submission in this arbitration; and to Canada’s statements
on the issue, first in implementing the NAFTA, and, later, in its counter-

memorial in the Myers case.

All of this is certainly suggestive of something approaching an agreement, but, to
the Tribunal, all of this does not rise to the level of a “subsequent agreement” by
the NAFTA Parties. Although there is no evidence on the record that any of the
NAFTA Parties has voiced a discordant view on this issue, the Tribunal is
mindful that there is limited experience thus far with many of the subtleties and
implications of Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA. Too, the Tribunal notes the

absence of any Article 1128 submission by Canada before this Tribunal. This

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

188.

189.

190.

- 110-

cannot be seen as evidence of Canadian support for the Claimants’ position on
this issue, but it also cannot be seen as evidence of Canadian opposition. The
Tribunal concludes that there is no “subsequent agreement” on this issue within

the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention.

The question remains: is there “subsequent practice” that establishes the
agreement of the NAFTA Parties on this issue within the meaning of Article
31(3)(b)? The Tribunal concludes that there is. Although there is, to the Tribunal,
insufficient evidence on the record to demonstrate a “subsequent agreement
between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application
of its provisions,” the available evidence cited by the Respondent demonstrates to
us that there is nevertheless a “subsequent practice in the application of the
treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its

applications...”

On the record before this Tribunal, as cited by the Respondent above, there is
evidence of a sequence of facts and acts that amounts to a practice that is
concordant, common, and consistent. The Tribunal is of the view that this is
“subsequent practice” within the meaning of Article 31(3) (c). And _ this
“subsequent practice” confirms the Tribunal’s interpretation of the ordinary

meaning of Article 1101(1)(a) of the NAFTA, as set out above.

LIV. The Degree of Market Integration Is Irrelevant to the

Preliminary Question

Claimants’ counsel has vigorously pressed the position that Claimants represent
the exceptional case, due to the high degree of integration in the North American
cattle market. Claimants have made extensive written and oral submissions on
the subject of market integration. [e.g., C I, Section II.B., pp. 8-14]. These,

however, are factual issues, beyond the scope of the question put to this Tribunal

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-1ll-

in the preliminary question. Furthermore, even if this Tribunal were to assume
the accuracy and relevance of such information at this stage," it proves too

much.

191. First, such a position appears to conflate Articles 1102 and 1101, importing into
the latter the “like circumstances” requirement of Article 1102. In this Tribunal’s
view, such an importation would do far more violence to the interpretation of
Article 1101 than a reading that focuses on the express requirements of Article
1101 with respect to the territorial scope of investments and the explicit linkage

between investors and investments.

192. Second, despite Claimant’s attempts to characterize integration as the exceptional
case, if a fundamental treaty purpose is integration, it is hard to see how that
position could be correct. This Tribunal considers it much more likely that over
time, virtually every industry operating cross-border, especially between Canada
and the United States where a free trade agreement preceded the NAFTA, would
be able to demonstrate a significant degree of integration.”° Thus, there is no
escaping the conclusion that the implications of the holding urged by Claimants

for the scope of Chapter Eleven would be enormous.

© Claimants’ proffered evidence goes primarily to the existence of an integrated North American

cattle market, and to the increasing integration of that market post-NAFTA. It asserts, but does not

  

prove, investments by Claimants in reliance on the promises of market access in the NAFTA.
Respondent has vigorously disputed that there was any promise of market access in this context, so
there are legal issues raised by these submissions as well as factual issues that are outside the scope of
the preliminary question.

2° The Tribunal would also expect to find extensive and increasing instances of integration or
dependence between the other NAFTA parties, as the Claimants submitted was the case in Bayview.
Bayview Irrigation District et al v. Mexico, ICSID Case No. B(AF)/05/01, Claimants’ Supplemental
Memorial at 12-13 (Dec. 15, 2006). That Tribunal found that the Claimants’ dependence on supplies
of goods from another NAFTA state was not sufficient to make the dependent enterprise an’ investor’
in that State. Award, J 104.

LV. Conclusion

Although this Tribunal concludes that it has no jurisdiction to hear Claimants’
claims, its decision today does not leave them with no remedy under the
NAFTA. Their remedy lies not in the investor-state dispute resolution mechanism
of Chapter Eleven, but in the state-to-state dispute resolution mechanism of
Chapter 20 of the NAFTA. As such, it is for the government of Canada to pursue
against the United States.”! Nothing in this holding precludes the Canadian
government from doing so. Indeed, taking Claimants’ factual submissions at face
value, Claimants would be wholly justified in pressing their government to seek
recourse against the U.S. Government for the measures at issue. Although such a
remedy may be less attractive to Claimants than a direct claim for damages, it is,
in this Tribunal’s view, the remedy provided by the NAFTA for a trade dispute of

this nature.”

I. VI. Decisions in Other Cases as Supplementary Means of
Interpretation (Article 32 VCLT)

194. First, the Tribunal refers to its general considerations in section I.I1.4. above

regarding the relevance of decisions in other cases. In its implementation of these
general considerations, hereafter, the respective arguments by the Parties in
regard to the specific decisions are not repeated since they were summarized
above in the context of the sections dealing with the issues examined, but only

the respective references in the Parties’ submissions are listed. Thereafter, in

2! In any such dispute, the provisions of Chapter Seven would also be highly relevant.

» This Tribunal recognizes that other Chapter Eleven tribunals have held that different provisions of
the NAFTA may be cumulative, and that a measure may implicate remedies under both trade and
investment chapter of the NAFTA. See, e.g., SD Myers v. Canada, { 291-295; Pope & Talbot, p. 6-
12. That is not the issue here. These cases, unlike the present case, involved claimants that were
found by their respective Tribunals to have made foreign investments in the NAFTA Party adopting
the challenged measure.

addition to some references to other decisions the Tribunal considered
appropriate in earlier sections of this award, the Tribunal briefly considers the
relevance of the major other decisions cited to by the Parties to the issues in this

case.

41, 111, 113) and at the hearing (Tr. pp. 105, 125, 160, 265, 324, 326 et seq.).

1.3. The Tribunal

197. Although the Chairman of the present Tribunal also chaired the Tribunal in the
Ethyl case, the consideration of Ethyl for the purposes of the present case is
restricted to what is known from the published text of the Ethyl decision and

considered relevant in the present context.

198. It is true that, similar to the present case, the Ethyl case concerned trade between

the United States and Canada, and that the Tribunal accepted jurisdiction.

199. However, further qualifications have to be recognized which distinguish Ethyl

from the present case:

Factually, Ethyl did have investments, and indeed its own company, i.e., Ethyl
Canada, in the territory of the other state, i.e., Canada, and challenged acts of
Canada affecting that investment in Canada. With regard to Ethyl’s claims for
damages regarding its losses in the United States, the Tribunal made it clear that
a distinction must be made between the locus of the breach and that of the
damages suffered (Award § 71). As clarified in the Award, Ethyl claimed that an
expropriation occurred inside Canada, but the investor’s resulting losses were
suffered both inside and outside Canada (Award §72). In the present case,

Claimants only claim the latter without an investment in the other state.

But even in Ethyl, the Tribunal did not accept its jurisdiction regarding the losses
outside Canada, but left that to a later consideration of the merits (Award § 73.
The merits phase never occurred since the procedure ended earlier.). This is
further clarified by Footnote 30 to the respective section of the Ethyl Award
which expressly deals with the abstract principle disputed in the present case:
“Accordingly, the Tribunal does not decide what significance, if any, is to be
attributed to the fact that Article 1106, like Article 1110, includes the phrase “in

its territory”, whereas Article 1102 does not.”

It is therefore clear that the Ethyl Award is inconclusive for the issue of

territoriality in the present case.

References by Claimants

The Claimants referred to the Methanex arbitration in the First Memorial (C I, 1]
72 et seq., and 97 et seq.) and in the Second Memorial on the Preliminary Issue
(C II, { 50) and confirmed them at the hearing (Tr. pp. 96, 171 et seg., 243, 258,
261, and 265).

The Tribunal

There are two Awards in the Methanex case which deserve consideration in the

context of the present case :

The First Partial Award of August 7, 2002 confirms the « gateway « function of
Article 1101(1) to the effect that, in the view of the Methanex Tribunal, the
powers of the Tribunal can only come into legal existence if the requirements of
Article 1101(1) are met (Chapter I (4)(i)). As noted earlier, this supports indeed
the conclusions of the present Tribunal in the sections above dealing with the
ordinary meaning and object and purpose as well as the context of Article

1101(1)..

The second Methanex decision is the Final Award of August 3, 2005, on
Jurisdiction and the Merits confirming, with supporting authorities, that a
« subsequent agreement» in the sense of Article 31.3(a) VCLT need not be
concluded with the same formal requirements as a treaty (Award Chapter B para

20). This is also the understanding of the present Tribunal.

However, this leaves open the question whether, indeed, in the present case, such
a subsequent agreement between the NAFTA Parties regarding the interpretation
of Article1102(1) can be established. As discussed in paragraphs 184 - 189
supra, this Tribunal has doubts whether the actions of the NAFTA Parties can be
considered as such a subsequent agreement, while different considerations apply

to subsequent practice (Article 31.3.(b) VCLT).

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

The Parties have exchanged arguments at some length (particularly during the
hearing Tr. pp. 168 et seq.) as to whether the Methanex Awards can give support
to their respective arguments concerning Articles 1102 and 1101 for the
interpretation of the terms « relating to » in Article1101.1 and in view of the term
« legally significant connection » used by the Methanex Tribunal. Though the
test of a « legally significant connection » used by the Methanex Tribunal (1st
Award paragraph 147) would also in the present case lead to a denial of
jurisdiction, the present Tribunal finds, because Article 32 VCLT only permits
the recourse to supplementary means of interpretation such as decisions of other
tribunals in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of
Article 31, that the facts and the legal arguments in Methanex were not similar
enough to those in the present case to provide guidance in that context:
Methanex did have investments in the United States ( a shattered factory in
Louisiana and a company in Texas ), the dispute concerned the ban of a certain
substance not produced by Methanex to which Methanex only manufactured an
additive, the Methanex Tribunal refused jurisdiction regarding the whole of
Methanex’s claims and only joined to the merits the consideration of certain
allegations relating to « intent » underlying the US measures, and then in its
Award on the merits the Tribunal accepted the FTC’s interpretation dated July
31, 2001, as a « subsequent agreement » falling under Article 31.3(a) VCLT
(Award para 21).

References by Claimants

Reference to the Gruslin arbitration were made by the Claimants in the First
Memorial (C I, {{] 108 et seq.), in the Second Memorial on the Preliminary Issue
(CII, {ff 97 et seq.) and at the hearing (Tr. pp. 112 et seq., 144, and 324 et seq.).

The Tribunal

The Gruslin Award has been issued in an ICSID case with the consent to
arbitration stemming from the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the
Belgo-Luxemburg Economic Union and Malaysia. Thus it does not deal with the
application and interpretation of the NAFTA and can only be considered as to
whether legal considerations in that case can be helpful for those in the present

case.

A further distinction to the present case is that, in the Gruslin case, the Claimant
did not claim that it made an investment in the other country but that it invested
in a mutual fund in Luxemburg which then in turn did invest in Malaysia so that
an indirect investment in the territory of the other state was at stake. In the
present case, the Parties expressly agree and the Preliminary Issue confirms that

no indirect [?] investment by Claimants is at stake.

With regard to a territorial qualification, a further difference is that the preamble
of the IGA expressly mentions « investments ... in the territory of the other
Contracting Party » as the intended object of protection, while the preamble of
NAFTA does not which might be explained by the fact that NAFTA has a much
broader scope and only Chapter Eleven deals with investements. One thus might
compare NAFTA Chapter Eleven to the IGA which, in essence, is a bilateral
investment treaty, Article 1101 with the title « Scope and Coverage » could be
considered as comparable to the function of a preamble to Chapter Eleven. But
even than a difference remains because Article 12 of the IGA titled Application

of Agreement has an introductory function comparable to NAFTA Article 1101

215.

4.

- 118-

and does contain a much less territorial qualification « ...shall apply to
investments made in the territory of either Contracting Party ...by nationals of
the other Contracting Party ». Since Article 1101 does not have such a clear
territorial qualification, we are back to the issue that Article 1101.1 has no
territorial qualification in paragraph (a) regarding investors, but does have one in

paragraph (b) regarding investments.

To some extent comparable between Gruslin and the present case is the question,
arising in both cases, of what conclusions can be drawn if some treaty provisions
contain an express territorial requirement and some do not. Claimants in both
cases have argued, and in fact that would seem to be the primary approach, that
such a difference in wording must have some meaning and that can only be that,
where the territorial qualification is missing the provision also covers
investments not made in the territory of the other Contracting State. However, the
Sole Arbitrator in Gruslin did not accept that interpretation, but rather concluded
that, in spite of the lack of a territorial qualification in Article 10 IGA, that
provision should still be understood to cover only investments as they are the
subject matter of the rest of the IGA, i.e., only those in the territory of the other
Contractual State (Award §§ 13.8 to 13.11). Since, as seen above, the IGA in
Gruslin, by its preamble, is clearer than NAFTA in defining the protected
investments as only those in the territory of the other State, not too much
guidance can be drawn from that interpretation of the Sole Arbitrator in Gruslin
for the present case. However, on the basis of the « gateway » function of
NAFTA Article 1101, it can be seen as giving some support to the similar

interpretation this Tribunal has given above to NAFTA Article 1101.

(R II, p. 12). They were supplemented by Respondent’s oral presentation at the
hearing (Tr. pp. 19, 27, 29, 32 et seg., 37 et seq., 44, 48 et seq., 51 et seg., 54 et
seq., 170 et seq., 278, 284, 291, 293 et seq., 305 et seq., 317, and 320).

References by Claimants

The Claimants made references to the Bayview arbitration in the First Memorial
(CI, { 84), in the Second Memorial on the Preliminary Issue (C II, { 40, 60 — 75,
131) and supplemented them during their oral presentation at the hearing (Tr. pp.

99, 114 et seq., 122, 197, 240, 262, 267, 269, and 321 et seq.).

The Tribunal

The Bayview Award of June 19, 2007 is the most recent of the decisions which
may be considered as having some relevance for the issues at stake in the present
case and thus the Parties were only in a position to submit their views in this

regard in a late stage of the procedure and particularly at the hearing.

The Award’s consideration of NAFTA Article 1101 and its function the scope
and coverage of the entire Chapter Eleven (Award paragraphs 85 et seq.) are
similar to and support the above considerations of the present Tribunal on the
same subject. However, this Tribunal has some difficulty in following the order
of reasoning in the Bayview Award regarding the question whether only an
investment in the other State can trigger jurisdiction, because the Bayview
Tribunal seems to start its respective examination with the travaux préparatoires
(Award paragraph 95) while, in the view of the present Tribunal, Article 31
VCLT calls for a primary examination of the ordinary meaning of the terms of
the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose while the
travaux may only be considered at a later stage as supplementary means of

interpretation according to Article 32 VCLT.

The factual situation in Bayview, i.e., that water is supplied across the border, is
not quite the same as in the present case where the export of meat in what is
alleged to be an integrated market is at stake. And in Bayview, the Claimants
submitted the argument that they owned the water flowing through Mexico and
that was their investment in that State, an argument with no counterpart in the

present case.

It may well be argued that Bayview is different because, as Claimants in the
present case point out, the Bayview case was about the treatment owed under
NAFTA Article 1105 while the present case is not (C/II Paragraph 68).
Nevertheless, the Bayview Tribunal’s considerations regarding the relevance and
interpretation of the territorial requirement in Article 1101(b) and its conclusion
that, in order to be an « investor » under Articles 1101(a) and 1139, one must
make an investment in the territory of another NAFTA State, not only in one’s

own (Award, { 105), support the above conclusions of the present Tribunal.

So does the reliance in Bayview on the subsequent practice of all three NAFTA

States in this regard (Award {{ 106 et seq.).

Conclusion

After a review of the relevant decisions in other cases as supplementary means of
interpretation (Article 32 VCLT) it can thus be concluded that some of these
decisions provide support to the interpretation the present Tribunal has chosen in
earlier sections above of this Award, and that none of these decisions has been

found to contradict this Tribunal’s interpretation.

LVII. Considerations Regarding Costs

224.

Originally, only Respondent had submitted a Claim for Arbitration Costs. In

reply to a respective question by the Chairman at the end of the hearing,

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

-121-

Claimants announced a Cost Claim as well. The Chairman’s letter after the
hearing of October 16, 2007 recalled the respective agreement on Cost Claims as

follows:

2. By November 8, 2007, both the Claimants and the Respondent

shall submit Claims for their costs of arbitration.

3. By November 15, 2007, the Parties may submit comments

regarding the cost claim submitted by the other side.

1. Relief Sought by Respondent

225. The Respondent requests the Tribunal to issue an award as follows (R I, p.20; R
II, p. 34)

“The United States further requests that, pursuant to Article 40 of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal require Claimants to bear
all costs of the arbitration, including costs and expenses of counsel,
and issue an award making Claimants jointly and severally liable for

costs.”
226. According to the agreement recorded above, Respondent submitted a quantified

Claim for Costs by November 8, and Claimants submitted comments thereon by

November 15, 2007.

2. Relief Sought by Claimants

227. The Claimants request the Tribunal to issue an award as follows (Tr. p. 334)

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

228.

229.

230.

231.

- 122-

“MR. HAIGH: Thank you for the question, Mr. President and the
Claimants would take the position that, if it was successful on this

application, it should receive its costs.”

According to the agreement recorded above, Claimants submitted a quantified
Claim for Costs by November 8, and Respondent submitted comments thereon

by November 15, 2007.

The Tribunal

The Tribunal notes that NAFTA Article 1135.1 provides that it may award costs
in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules. Article 40 of the
UNCITRAL Rules makes a distinction between the costs of arbitration and the

costs of legal representation.

Its paragraph | provides:

Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in
principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral
tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it
determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the case.

Applying this provision, though Claimants have been unsuccessful in their
application regarding the Preliminary Issue, the Tribunal considers it reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case, that each Party bears 50% of

the costs of arbitration.

Article 40.2 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:

With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance
referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking
into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine
which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

NAFTA/UNCITRAL Canadian Cattle Claims Award on Jurisdiction

232.

- 123 -

Applying this provision, though Claimants have been unsuccessful in their
application regarding the Preliminary Issue, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, the Tribunal, using its discretion under this provision,
considers it reasonable and concludes that each Party shall bear its own costs of

legal representation.

J. ummary of Tribunal’s Conclusions

233.

234.

Taking into account all of the above considerations, therefore, this Tribunal
concludes that the question raised by what the Parties have defined as the

Preliminary Issue must be answered in the negative :

This Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider claims under
NAFTA Article 1116 for an alleged breach of NAFTA Article
1102(1) where all of the Claimants’ investments at issue are located in
the Canadian portion of the North American Free Trade Area and the
Claimants do not seek to make, are not making and have not made any
investments in the territory of the United States of America.

This conclusion of the Tribunal brings into effect the further sections of the

Parties’s text of the Preliminary Issue:

The Parties agree that a negative determination of this question will
dispose of all of claimants’ claims in their entirety.

The parties also agree that any other objections of a potentially
jurisdictional nature shall be reserved for a single merits phase
should the claims not be dismissed at the preliminary phase.”
