INTRODUCTION

1. This award is handed down in the arbitral proceedings initiated by Renée Rose
Levy de Levi (hereinafter the Claimant) against the Republic of Peru (hereinafter the
Respondent or Peru) concerning the alleged violation of the Agreement concluded on
October 6, 1993 between the Republic of Peru and the Republic of France on the
Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on May 30, 1996

(APPRI).

2. Generally speaking, the dispute arose because, according to the Claimant, Peru
arbitrarily and illegally subjected Banco Nuevo Mundo (BNM), the shareholders of
which were initially the father of the Claimant, Mr. David Levy Pesso, and then the
Claimant herself, to a process of intervention, followed by its dissolution and
liquidation. The Claimant contends that, by these actions, Peru violated several

principles of the APPRI and the rights granted to her by that Bilateral Investment Treaty.

3. In drafting this Award, the Arbitral Tribunal took into account, analyzed, and
carefully evaluated all the arguments of the parties, including their claims and defenses,
as well as the documents, witness statements, expert reports and any further evidence
produced by them. In formulating their allegations, the parties introduced and cited a
number of awards and decisions on issues relevant to the decision on jurisdiction and to
the merits of this case. The Tribunal considers it important to note that it is required to
settle the dispute initiated by the Claimant by means of an independent analysis of the
APPRI, of the ICSID Convention, of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and of the particular
circumstances of this case, which do not preclude the Tribunal from taking into

consideration the conclusions reached by other international Arbitral Tribunals.

4. In this Award, the Tribunal makes particular reference to the arguments of the
parties that it considered to be most relevant for its decision on jurisdiction and,
subsequently, for its decision on the merits of the case. Even when it does not explicitly

refer to all of the arguments put forward by the parties, the Tribunal’s decision is based

on all of them, as regards the factors considered by the Tribunal to be decisive in

reaching its decision.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

5. On June 22, 2010, ICSID or Centre received a Request for Arbitration (the
“Request”) from Claimant against Respondent. On June 24, 2010, ICSID acknowledged

34, BNM (originally known as Banco Iberoamericano SAEMA — BANIBERICO)
was incorporated in Peru on January 31, 1992 and changed its name to Banco Nuevo
Mundo on October 6, 1992. By SBS Resolution No. 1455-92 of December 30, 1992, SBS
authorized the start-up of BNM’s financial operations, which commenced on January 25,

1993.
35. According to the Claimant, BNM’s overseas investment companies are:
a. Corporacién XXI Ltd., incorporated in the Bahamas on January 27, 1997.

b. Burley Holding S.A., incorporated in Panama on April 1, 1999; its change of name to

oS

Investment (Herschkowicz Grosman family)....”° [Tribunal’s translation]

37. In 1998, the FONAFE relaxed the existing policy on deposit placement and

permitted State-owned companies to place deposits in private banks.°

38. The Minutes of the Extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting of Corporacion
XXI Ltd. held on January 28, 1999 show that its shareholders Mr. Isy Levy Calvo and
Mr. Jacques Levy Calvo assigned to their father, Mr. David Levy Pesso, their legal rights
derived from their shares of stock in that company. The assignment “was extended to (i)
any transfer of Corporacién XXI Ltd.’s shares in NMH, the controlling shareholder of
BNM, to any other overseas investment companies in the corporate structure of Grupo
Levy; and (ii) the presence of Mr. David Levy Pesso as shareholder in any future
overseas investment companies that may purchase the Corporacién XXI Ltd.’s shares of

stock in any family business.”

39. On May 28, 1999, the BNM General Shareholders’ Meeting authorized a merger
project whereby BNM would take over Banco del Pais, Nuevo Mundo Leasing Sociedad
Anonima, and Coordinadora Primavera Sociedad Anénima. On August 6, 1999, by
Resolution No. 0718-99, SBS authorized the merger.* This merger created a goodwill of
S/. 47,5 million, which “included primarily the premium paid for the purchase of Banco

del Pais in excess of the fair value of its identified assets and liabilities, which was

allowed the amount to be credited to a special reserve account within net equity, to be
amortized over a five-year period. On December 31, 1999, this goodwill amounted to S/.

43.5 million."

40. On June 18, 1999, the President of the Respondent issued Presidential Decree
No. 099-99-EF, which:

“Authorizing issue of Peruvian treasury bonds and authorizing companies with
multiple operations under the financial system to transfer part of their portfolio to
the MEF”.'! This program allowed Banks “to temporarily exchange their under-
performing loans for Treasury bonds. However, the loan portfolio exchange
program did not allow banks to transfer loans rated as losses (“pérdida’”’)—the
highest risk rating through this exchange, the banks that participated could
postpone recording loan loss provisions for their underperforming loans until they
reacquired the loans over the course of four years under the program (plus one-
year grace period). BNM benefited from this program by exchanging a portfolio
of loans for US$33.7 million in bonds . . . .”!? The Decree itself “...Authorize the
Ministry of Economy and Finance to issue Treasury Bonds up to a total amount of
US$400,000,000.00...Companies with multiple operations under the Financial
System may transfer to the Ministry of Economy and Finance a portion of their
portfolio, receiving in exchange the bonds... Neither the portfolio of credits
classified as losses nor financial leasing arrangements may be subject to transfer...
companies with multiple operations under the Financial System shall meet the
following requirements: a) ... have a Development Plan approved by the Office of
the Superintendent of Banking and Insurance, which shall contain, among other

elements, commitments for capitalizing earnings, reinforcement of internal

controls and, if applicable, a commitment to make capital contributions in cash.”'?

Al. On August 31, 1999, the BNM General Shareholders’ Meeting agreed to reduce
the Bank’s equity capital by S/. 23,591,550.00 for the purpose of increasing the
provisioning level, and to request SBS’s permission to do so. SBS gave its permission in

its Resolution No. 0894-99 of September 29, 1999.'4

42. The Inspection Visit Report No. ASIF “A” 172-VI/99 (hereinafter “the 1999
Report”), submitted by SBS to BNM concerning the visit conducted from July 9 to
August 20, 1999, stated that on September 27, 1999, there were discrepancies in the

classification of the loan portfolio:

“Discrepancies in the Loan Portfolio Ratings towards greater risk categories
regarding than that assigned by the Bank totaled 127 debtors with liabilities
amounting to S/. 206,880,000, which represented 53.3% of the number of
evaluated debtors and 34.4% of the amount of the evaluated portfolio.[...] the
General Management through unnumbered document dated September 2, 1999,

informed that it had begun to re-rate the credits reported as discrepant.”

43. The 1999 Report of SBS also indicated:

“The following has been determined resulting from the evaluation and rating of
the Loan Portfolio at June, 30, 1999.

a. CRITICIZED LOANS: Loans subject to Critics amounted to
S/.320,804,000 which represented 53% of the sample evaluated and 19% of the
Loan Portfolio. The Criticized Credits with relation to the evaluated sample are
comprised by Potential Problems S/.138,805,000 (23%), Deficient S/.152,522,000
(25%), Doubtful S/.25,866 (4%) and Loss S/.3,611,000 (1%) ... In the future, the
Bank must act pursuant to Resolution SBS No. 572-97 of August 20 of this year.

c. BAD DEBT PORTFOLIO...

d. PROVISION DEFICIT: The Loan Portfolio rating result determined a
specific provision deficit for uncollectable risk of 125 loans subject to critics for a
total of S/. 21,536,000. . . At the closing of July 1999, new provisions have been
constituted for S/.2,393,000 for observed loans, reducing the provision deficit to

S/.19,143,000,”!°
44. In that Report, SBS also stated:

“2.2.2. REFINANCED LOANS

From the review made on a sample of 218 debtors, it was determined that most of
them do not fit properly in the accounting registry and risk rating; not-complying
with what is established in the Chart of accounts for Financial Institutions,
Resolution SBS No. 572-97 and the own Bank standard named NOR-NEG-
010/98.

a. It was verified that the Bank performed refinanced transactions with 35
debtors which balances at July 31, 1999, amount to S/. 1,842,000 and
US$4,583,000, in some cases with interest capitalization, which were not
registered in accounting as refinanced transactions. Likewise, the risk rating
assigned to the mentioned debtors pertains to “Normal” category...

db. It is also worth noting that, in certain cases such transactions are created
by the unusual practice of amortizing or paying loan installments with charge to
past due current accounts, increasing the debt balance given (sic) no payments are
received, sufficient to face new charges, evidencing that the notes or loans are
reduced with the own Bank’s resources.

The mentioned status was informed to the General Management through
Memorandum No. 12-99-VII.BNM dated 99.08.11, specifying that the
observation is reiterative. On 99.08.19, the General Management reports it has
given instructions so that the active standards on the matter must be fulfilled,

indicating also, having complied with the register of refinanced transactions

'© Tbid., page 12.

observed in the years 1997 and 1998.

In this regard, we must indicate that even if the Bank complies with the
recommendations made by this Superintendency, it is necessary to indicate that
given incurred recidivism it deserves to be sanctioned pursuant to the Ruling of

Sanctions of Resolution No. 310-98.”"7

45. SBS also found current account overdrafts and made the following

recommendation in the 1999 Report:

“The Bank must reformulate the current politics about debtors which keep

overdrafts in current account for long periods and created by cancellation of their

Credit Cards or by charges to corresponding payments of their loans, to avoid, in

the first place, the practice of charging loan payments on past due current

accounts and in the second place, apply the last paragraph of Article 228 of the

General Banking Law that facilitates the executive action on past due balances in

current accounts.” '®

46. In the 1999 Report, SBS also noted the concentration of BNM’s liabilities and
recommended to “Stimulate the incentive for attracting alternative lower cost deposits,
given that one of the risks the Bank faces is liquidity, to which it is vulnerable do to the
excessive concentration of liabilities in few debtors. The Bank must continue with the
reduction process of this concentration that has begun recently.” !”

47. On October 22, 1999, SBS adopted Resolution No. 0950-99 imposing a fine on
BNM, because in the 1999 Report SBS had noted that BNM:

“... repeatedly omitted to register loan operations with evident signs of
refinanced operations as such in its accounting records... both the Inspection

Visit Report No. ASIF “A” 034-VI/97 corresponding to 1997, and the Inspection

" Thid., pages 15 and 16.

'° Thid., page 8.

Visit Reports Nos. ASIF “A” 164-V1/98 and . . . corresponding to 1998 and 1999

respectively, inspectors observed that Banco Nuevo Mundo had carried out

refinanced operations that were not registered as such in its accounting records;

Such operations are being registered as new loans, thereby avoiding increasing

the high risk portfolio and a bad rating; furthermore, interests and commissions

are being registered in the accounting records as business income thereby

infringing the Chart of Accounts for Financial Institutions, Resolution SBS No.

572-97 and the Bank’s own rule called NOR-NEG-010/98.””"

48.

On October 25, 1999, the management of BNM was informed that “the

accounting and financial records of Banco del Pais [with which BNM merged, as stated

in paragraph 39 above], and in particular its loan portfolio figures, did not clearly reveal

its economic and financial situation.

vl

On October 26, 1999, BNM sent a letter to SBS in response to the 1999 Report.

On the subject of the current accounts, it stated:

“Close monitoring of checking accounts has been implemented at various levels

in order to avoid situations such as those observed by the Inspection Team.

The letter also referred to refinanced loans and stated: “The accounting has been

brought up to speed for loans considered by the Superintendency to be refinanced

during the 1997 and 1998 annual visits. Furthermore, instructions have been

given to implement the most advisable approach for those specified by the

Superintendency during the last visit.

On November 24, 1999, BNM submitted for the consideration of SBS a plan for

participation in the amount of US$34.5 million in the Loan Portfolio Exchange Program

approved by Presidential Decree No. 099-99-EF (mentioned in paragraph 40 above).”4

On December 15, 1999, in the Official Letter No. 13214-99, SBS approved the plan and
stated that “qualifies this company as a potential beneficiary of Public Treasury Bonds
Programs...”°° The Program allowed BNM to exchange millions of dollars in loans from
the commercial portfolio and the consumer portfolio for an equivalent amount in

Treasury bonds. BNM would reacquire this transferred portfolio beginning in 2001.7°

51. On January 17, 2000, SBS started another inspection visit to BNM, which was
concluded on February 18 of that year. Following that visit, it prepared the Report No.
ASIF “A”-028-V1/2000 (hereinafter “the Report of April 2000”).7” The parties discussed
the type of visit conducted on those dates.”* In this connection, the Report stated: “In
accordance with Article 357 of Law 26702, by virtue of Memorandum No. 0529-2000 of
January 17, 2000, the Inspection Visit to Banco Nuevo Mundo took place...”””

[Tribunal’s translation] (The article in question reads: “INSPECTIONS. Without prior

notice and at least once a year and when it deems so convenient, the Superintendency

shall make general and special inspections, directly or through auditing companies it
authorizes, with the purpose of examining the situation of the companies supervised,

determining the content and scopes of such inspections”).*°

52. The Report of April 2000 indicated that the goals of the visit included assessing
and rating BNM’s consumer loan portfolio on December 31, 1999 and verifying the
provisioning and the implementation of corrective measures, in accordance with the
recommendations in the 1999 Report. The section of the executive summary entitled
“Financial Accounting Aspect” indicates that there is a deficit of S/. 3,947,000 in the
assets assigned, because BNM followed a procedure that did not comply with Circular
No. B-2017-98 on provisions.*! This section also indicates that there were no policy and

procedure manuals and that 44.7 percent of the recommendations made by SBS in the

concentration of public deposits, which on February 28, 2000 accounted for 38.9 percent
of total deposits “representing a potential liquidity risk.”*> [Tribunal’s translation] The
Report recommended that procedure manuals for the Consumer Loan Division, Nuevo
Pais, should be approved, and that BNM should establish provisions in accordance with
the above-mentioned Circular No. B-2017-98. It also recommended that BNM should
supervise implementation of the pending recommendations and prepare a deposit plan to

avoid concentration of short-term deposits.

53. On April 25, 2000, Mr. Martin Naranjo Landerer, the Superintendent of Banking
and Insurance, sent the Official Letter No. 4383-2000 to Mr. Jacques Levy Calvo,
Chairman of the Board of BNM (who received it on May 9), in which he stated:

“As a result of the Inspection performed [from January 17 to February 18, 2000],
the following aspects must be highlighted, among others:

The Administration’s failure to abide by the rulings contained in articles 206 to
209 of the General Law, given that loans have been granted for amounts that
exceed the 10% legal limit of cash equity, in Grupo Miyasato for S/. 9,626,000,
since it has not included the company Del Pilar Miraflores Hotel as part of the
group. At February 10, 2000, it exceeded the 10% legal limit of cash equity,

without having sufficient collaterals to cover the amount of loans S/. 162,000.

A reserve deficit in awarded assets for S/. 3,947,000 was determined, since the
Bank used a proceeding that is not consistent with numeral 5) of Circular No. B-
2017-98 which establishes that reserves must be provisioned for 20% of the net

book value at the time of the awarding.

The evaluation of the level of implementation of the recommendations contained

in the 1999 report issued by this Superintendency showed that 44.7% of what has

* Ibid., § 1.2.2.9.
* Ibid.,  1.2.2.10.
* Ibid. § 1.3.

20

been observed are pending and/or in correction process. Likewise, inspectors
noticed that there is no consolidated supporting information that would allow the
confirmation of the implementation of the recommendations indicated by the
Bank.

The Bank shows a high concentration of liabilities through public institutions
deposits and COFIDE lines; this situation represents a potential liquidity risk.
Likewise, inspectors observed that despite its network of branch offices, the Bank
has failed to diversify such concentration; 70% of the Bank’s deposits are

concentrated in the Headquarters.”*>
“4 Starting in July 2000, State companies began to withdraw funds from BNM.*°

55. On August 11, 2000, SBS made what the Claimant called a second inspection
visit to BNM, which lasted until October 13 that year.*” The Respondent stated that this

was the regular visit and not a second annual visit.**

56. On August 29, 2000, Corporacion XXI Ltd. transferred its shares in NMH to
Holding XXI S.A., the shareholder of which was Mr. David Levy Pesso.*”

57. Starting in August 2000, the withdrawal from BNM of privately-owned deposits

reached over US$70 million.”

58. In September 2000, BNM was rated by Class & Asociados and by Apoyo &
Asociados Internacionales $.A.C.; they gave it B+ and B ratings respectively.*' The B+
rating “is granted to financial or insurance companies with sound financial strength.

They are companies with a high business level, with good results in their key financial

“granted to companies having good payment capacity of liabilities in the terms and
conditions agreed, but it may deteriorate slightly with potential changes in the company,
the industry it belongs to, or the economy.”*? Apoyo y Asociados Internacionales S.A.C.
stated that “The development of its product portfolio during its seven-year operations and
the recent merger with Nuevo Mundo Leasing and Banco del Pais, have led BNM to rank
sixth in terms of loans granted and deposits received (seventh by the end of 1999), with a
4.5 percent and 2.8 percent market share, respectively.”4
59. On September 12, 2000, BNM’s General Shareholders’ Meeting agreed to
increase its equity capital by S/. 17.49 million, and to create an optional reserve with the

issuance of capital premiums for S/. 8.8 million.*°

60. Also on September 12, Mr. Carlos Quiroz Montalvo, the head of the SBS visiting
team, sent the Memorandum No. 21-2000/VIO/NM to Mr. Carlos Schroth Parra, BNM’s
Acting Risk Manager, consulting him about the composition of the consumer portfolio
until June 30, 2000 because “includes loans other than consumer loans..., in which 165
debtors with a balance equivalent to S/. 1,449 thousand, report arrears greater than 100
days and they have a Normal risk classification.” It also consulted him about a number of
discrepancies in the classification of borrowers with consumer loans and the provision
deficit of S/. 383 thousand.*° On September 19, 2000, Mr. Schroth replied to SBS that he
would coordinate with the Systems Unit to “adequately identify those loan facilities that
do not correspond to Consumer Banking debt. We will also manually classify those
clients that have expired loan debt according to the list you attached.” He also indicated
that the consumer loan automatic classification program would be implemented in one
month’s time and that, in the future, the requirements of SBS Resolution No. 572-97
would be met. Regarding the other discrepancies, he said that an automatic classification

program had been designed and was operational, “the discrepancies of the existing

6l. On September 19, 2000, Mr. Carlos Quiroz Montalvo sent Memorandum No. 25-
2000-VIO/NM to Mr. Edgardo Alvarez Chavez, BNM Division Manager for Business
Operations, stating: “... we have become aware that some in the Bank’s loan portfolio
have acquired participation shares from the Multirenta Fund, through loan operations
received (including leaseback)...”** On September 25, Mr. Alvarez sent a lengthy reply to
Mr. Quiroz, basically stating that the Fund was financially and administratively
independent of BNM; it included stocks registered in the Public Register of Securities
and listed on the Lima Stock Exchange and the stock transactions on the secondary

market complied with the rules of the Exchange.”

62. On September 28, 2000, Mr. Carlos Quiroz Montalvo transmitted Memorandum
No. 27-2000-VIO/NM to Mr. José Castafieda Trevejo, BNM Operations Manager,
concerning overdue lending operations recorded in the accounts as Current portfolio until
June 30, 2000.*” On October 2, 2000, Mr. Castafieda transmitted BNM’s reply, stating
that he had instructed the Systems and Quality Department to make the change; he also
stated that the due dates given in the report were not correct and that the leasings
mentioned in the SBS memorandum were reported to the Instituto Nacional de Defensa
de la Competencia y de la Proteccion de la Propiedad Intelectual (INDECOPI) (National

Institute for the Defense of Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property).*!

63. On October 4, 2000, Mr. Carlos Quiroz Montalvo transmitted Memorandum No.

2000-VIO/NM to the General Manager of BNM, Mr. José Armando Hopkins Larrea,
stating that SBS was concerned about refinanced operations that were not identified as
such but as “Current Portfolio.”°4 Mr, Eduardo Alvarez Chavez, Risks and International
Manager, and Mr. Luis Gygax, Manager, replied that BNM was making arrangements to

t . 55
record refinanced and restructured operations correctly.””

65. In November 2000, BNM obtained overnight loans from BCR; Mr. German
Suarez Chavez, the Chairman of BCR, informed Mr. Luis Cortavarria, the
Superintendent of Banking and Insurance, in the Official Letter EF-No. 225-2000-PRES
of December 5, 2000, that:

“.., the aforementioned banking company has been appealing to the Central
Reserve Bank since November 13", 2000 to cover its reserve requirement in
foreign and domestic currency. Thus, fir the aforementioned month, the amount of
granted loans has been, on average, $63.7 million US for a total of twelve days
and S/. 97.5 million for two days (Sols). On December 4", 2000 a loan to cover
its reserve requirements in foreign currency for $73.0 million US was granted to
Banco Nuevo Mundo.”*°
66. In late November 2000, SBS was monitoring BNM’s financial indicators on a

daily basis. One such indicator was the liquidity ratio (the ratio of liquid assets to short-

term liabilities, indicating whether the Bank has sufficient liquid assets to cover its
immediate payment obligations), which was calculated by BNM and reported to SBS.

Banks are required under Peruvian law to maintain liquid assets equal to 8 percent of

their short-term liabilities in local currency and to 20 percent in foreign currency.”’ SBS
also took into account the adjusted liquidity ratio, excluding from liquid assets short-term
loans such as interbank and BCR loans. In BNM’s case, in November and December
2000, this ratio fell sharply to 6.5 percent in November and 1.89 percent in December in
local currency; in foreign currency, it was 9.2 percent in November and 6.01 percent in

December.**

67. On November 22, 2000, Mr. Jorge Mogrovejo Gonzalez, Intendent, and Mr.
Carlos Quiroz Montalvo, Chief of Visit, both from SBS, issued the Inspection Visit
Report No. DESF “A”-168-VI/2000 (hereinafter “the Report of November 2000”)
relating to the visit to BNM from August 11 to October 13, 2000. According to this
Report, the purpose of the visit was “to assess and determine the Bank’s actual equity and
to check and assess the procedures used by the Bank to identify and manage its lending
risks. In addition, spot checks were made of the definition of earnings and compliance

959 [

with regulations, among other important issues. Tribunal’s translation] In section B

of the executive summary, entitled Liquidity risks, the Report of November 2000 states:

“1, The Bank has a high liquidity risk because of the large withdrawals in recent
months, mainly by State-owned companies, which forced the Bank in November
to perform rediscounting operations amounting to US$70 million over six days
and to obtain interbank loans of US$266.6 million (a daily average of US$12.6
million), in order to meet reserve requirements. According to the latest reports,
the Bank has a critically low level of available funds, which would not allow it to
pay depositors and meet other liabilities due immediately.

2. It has a high concentration of deposits by public companies, amounting to S/.
319 million (at August 31, 2000) or 25.5 percent of the Bank’s total deposits.
This creates a potential liquidity risk because of the possibility of deposit
withdrawals in significant amounts, as occurred in recent months.”® [Tribunal’s

translation]

68. In the Report of November 2000, SBS also stated:

“A large number of past-due, refinanced and restructured loans were identified as
being recorded as ‘Current Portfolio’, totaling S/. 141.7 million (US$40.6
million), thereby contravening the stipulations of the Chart of Accounts for
Financial Institutions... It is worth noting that this is a recurring observation, since
the Report on Inspection Visit... corresponding to year 1997, as well as the...
corresponding to years 1998 and 1999, respectively, included the observation that
the Bank had refinancing operations that were not recorded as such. As a
consequence of this situation, through Resolution SBS No. 0950-99 of October
22, 1999, the Bank was fined 20 Tax Units (Unidad Impositiva Tributaria-
ulT).”°!

69. The same SBS Report noted:

“The Evaluation and Classification of the Loan Portfolio found:

Criticized loans totaling S/. 728,494 thousand, representing 57 percent of the
loans examined and 35 percent of the total portfolio...

Portfolio overconcentration...

Loan portfolio classification discrepancies, requiring placement in higher-risk
categories than those assigned by the Bank for 141 debtors owing S/. 587,406
thousand, representing 46 percent of the portfolio examined and 48 percent of the
number of debtors reviewed. This was evidence of incorrect portfolio
classification by the Bank, in violation of the relevant regulations. The
discrepancies concerned 94 debtors, of which 50 were classified as having
potential problems and 44 were classified as being deficient; those two categories
accounted for 85 percent of the discrepancies... It should be noted that, of the 141
debtors affected by discrepancies, 22.3 percent (45 debtors) were two or more
levels below the correct classification, according to the regulations in force. This

is a higher percentage than was found during the 1999 Inspection Visit (12.8

°' Respondent’s Exhibit R-065, page 3.

9962

percent).”°” [Tribunal’s translation]

70. The Report also noted:

“E, EARNINGS: At June 30, 2000, income from interest on overdue lending
operations recorded in “Current portfolio” and from current accounts with
amounts overdue more than 60 days was overestimated in the amount of S/. 3,877
thousand (50 percent of net profits at that date), because of inappropriate system
procedures applied to those operations, recording income in the financial
statements that had not actually been received. . .

F. INTERNAL AUDIT:

The Internal Audit Office did not perform its control functions, in view of the
serious observations made by the Superintendency in evaluating the portfolio:
overdue, refinanced, and restructured operations all recorded in “Current
Portfolio” for a total amount of S/. 141.8 million and income of S/. 3,877
thousand relating to overdue operations recorded as being current (50 percent of

963 [

net profits). Tribunal’s translation]

71. In the conclusions of the Executive Summary of this Report, SBS indicated:

“The Superintendence has determined that the loan portfolio classification
performed by the Bank does not meet, in general terms, the criteria established in
Resolution No. 572-97 and complementary standards, giving rise to a loan loss
reserves requirement for difficult to collect loans totaling S/. 79,182,000.
However, as a consequence of loan loss reserves recorded in the following
months with respect to the loan portfolio, the deficit at September 30 for this
portfolio would be S/. 52,975,000.

When the total referred to in the preceding paragraph is added to the loan loss
reserves requirement to cover debtors now classified as loss as a consequence of

the transfer ordered buy the Supreme Decree 099-99-EF for S/. 13,038,000 and

27

for the consumer portfolio requirement of S/.454,999 the result portfolio deficit of
S./66,467,000. Once incorrectly recorded interest of S/. 3,877,000 is added, the
final result is a total loss of S/. 70,344,000, meaning that the Bank’s regulatory
capital at September 30, 2000 is reduced by 25.7%. Consequently, in the short
term, the Bank’s Board of Directors must adopt actions, within the permitted legal
limits, to bring about the reversal of this equity situation to ensure that growth of

Bank operations is not affected.”

72. In section V, entitled “Solvency risk,” this Report stated:

“The Bank’s solvency, measured through risk-weighted assets and loans against
the Bank’s effective equity on September 30 of this year provides a leverage ratio
of 8.25. Compared with previous months, this leverage decreased as a
consequence of the Bank increasing its share capital in that month.
However, when taking into account the deficit in loan (sic) loss reserves found
during the visit, the adjustment at September 30 for loan loss reserves performed
by the Bank totaling S/. 57,306,000, incorporation of the portfolio corresponding
to D.S. 099-99-EF that would result in an additional deficit of S/. 59,813,000 and
finally goodwill for S/. 45,138,000, effective equity would rise to S/. 114.4
million, meaning that the Bank would require capital of S/. 111.5 (US$32 million)
in order to be able to achieve a leverage ratio of 10 that would enable it to
perform under normal conditions.”°>
2B. On November 24, 2000, Mr. Jacques Levy Calvo, Executive Chairman of BNM,
and Mr. José Armando Hopkins Larrea, Vice-Chairman and General Manager of BNM,
transmitted Official Letter GG-169/2000 to Mr. Luis Cortavarria Checkley,

Superintendent of Banking and Insurance, which stated:

“Following up with several conversations we have had with the Superintendency
in the last few weeks, we hereby submit our proposal to perform a significant

reinforcement of Banco Nuevo Mundo.

Banco Nuevo Mundo ... along with the company “Inversiones NMB S.A.C.” ...
will purchase, as an investment, a real property of approximately 200 hectares ...
The Bank would purchase a first and preferential participation in that property for
an amount of US$37 MM, which would be paid to Gremco S.A. by the Bank by a
cashier’s check.

This investment would allow our shareholder Nuevo Mundo Holding... to
increase the capital of the Bank in US$37MM, which consists of US$20 MM in
preference shares...

After this increase of capital is performed, the capital of the Bank will be

approximately US$73MM and the reserves will be approximately US$34MM.”%

74. Because it considered that the land was not an appropriate substitute for a cash

infusion of capital, SBS rejected the proposal of BNM.”

75. On Sunday, November 26, 2000, the Minister of Economy and Finance convened
an emergency meeting with the SBS Superintendent and the CEOs of ten banks in Peru;

BNM was not invited to that meeting.“*

76. On November 27, 2000, Emergency Decree No. 108-2000 was promulgated,
creating the Financial Industry Consolidation Program (PCSF).” This program was “...
aimed at facilitating the corporate restructuring of companies operating in the multiple
sector of the national financial system, a program in which the State shall participate by
means of issuing Public Treasury Bonds and granting a line of credit in favor of the
Deposit Insurance Fund, whenever this does not imply profit to the shareholders of

companies in question.””°

should withdraw their money from the Bank.”!

2. On December 5, 2000, the CEO of BNM asked BCR for a loan of about US$10
million; in the Official Letter 225-2000-PRES of the same date, BCR agreed to lend
US$1,2 million.”

79. On December 5, 2000, in the Official Letter 226-2000 PRES, BCR informed SBS
that BNM had been excluded from the Electronic Clearinghouse because it had not
settled its multilateral liability. This Official Letter indicated that “... Banco Nuevo
Mundo had a multilateral liability position of US$9.2 million in foreign currency and S/.
4.1 million in national currency, so that its current accounts balances amounted to US$0.1
million and S/. 1.8 million, respectively. As a result, Banco Nuevo Mundo had a deficit

of US$9.1 million and S/. 2.3 million.””* [Tribunal’s translation]

80. In Resolution No. 885-2000 of December 5, 2000, SBS declared that BNM was
subject to the intervention regime and appointed Mr. Carlos Quiroz Montalvo and Ms.

Manuela Carrillo Portocarrero as intervenors.”*

81. In 1999 and 2000, SBS intervened in Banco Banex, Banco Orion, Banco
Serbanco, and NBK Bank” and announced the dissolution and liquidation of those

Banks.”°

82. In Resolution No. 900-2000 of December 11, 2000, SBS resolved to submit a
criminal complaint to the State Prosecutor against the persons responsible for the

announcement of the intervention of BNM and who suggested the withdrawal of their

83. Mr. Jorge Mogrovejo Gonzalez, Assistant Superintendent for Risks stated that:
“when the SBS team arrived on BNM’s premises around 15:00 hrs. on December 5, 2000
to notify BNM’s officers that BNM had been intervened and to close the Bank, they
discovered that BNM had voluntarily closed its doors before.””*

84. On December 27, 2000, PwC (the firm hired to conduct the audit of BNM)
submitted to the Management of that Bank a progress report on the audit of the financial
statements for the year ending December 31, 2000 (hereinafter “the Progress Report”). It
conducted “a preliminary review of the loan portfolio evaluation on September 30, 2000,
as well as accounting observations identified preliminarily during our visit made in the
second half of the month of October 2000 ... the accounting observations were identified
with reference to balances on September 30, 2000 and, therefore, this progress report
does not express a total or partial opinion on the soundness of the Bank’s financial

statements at that date.””

85. The Progress Report states:

“1.1. Discrepancies in debtor ratings-

In our preliminary evaluation of the Bank’s loan portfolio at September 30, 2000,
with a sample of 110 clients, we have determined discrepancies in the ratings of
52 debtors. This situation could create a provision deficit for loans at that date of
approximately S/. 47,816,000.”*° In this same report, PwC stated: “In December
2000, the reserve for loans has been adjusted, increasing the corresponding
provision by S/. 80.9 million, thereby addressing the observations of the

The Final Audit Report was delivered to SBS on July 11, 2001.** Concerning the

chronology of the conducted audit, Mr. Arnaldo Alvarado, a partner in PwC, stated the

following:

“Pursuant to ISA 560, PwC assessed new events and information that arose
subsequent to the end of BNM’s fiscal year. If those subsequent events or
information revealed the true condition of BNM’s assets during the fiscal year
2000, we determined that this information should have been reflected or disclosed
on BNM’s December 2000 financial statement. When our fieldwork ended on
March 5, 2001, we completed our in-depth review of BNM’s assets and also
ended our investigation into subsequent events or information. Therefore, we
included in our final audit report subsequent events or information that occurred
between January and March 2001; but after March 2001, our review was limited
to verifying that the SBS intervenors had made the adjustments that we

recommended. We were not informed by BNM’s management of the existence of

any subsequent events or information after March 5, 2001.”*°
89. According to section 15 of the Final Audit Report, entitled “Net earnings (loss)
for the year,” the net loss on December 31, 2000 was S/.328,875,000.°°

90. On April 11, 2001, Emergency Decree 044-2001 (hereinafter “the Special
Transitional Regime”) added to Article 3 of Emergency Decree No. 108-2000 a
paragraph to the effect that companies in the financial system subject to the Intervention
Regime and recommended for asset transfer by CEPRE would be placed by the SBS

under a Special Transitional Regime.*’

91. On April 18, 2001, by Resolution No. 284-2001, SBS placed BNM under the

Special Transitional Regime.**

92. On May 30, 2001, BNM, represented by the SBS, signed with Banco
Interamericano de Finanzas (BIF) an “Agreement for Final Transfer of Corporate Equity
Block as Part of the Corporate Reorganization Process”.* Under the PCSF regulations,
BIF would use funds from this program to cover losses that it had sustained as a result of
the transfer. Section 3 of this Agreement indicated that the transfer would be conditional
on the findings and the valuation by the auditors Medina, Zaldivar, y Asociados
regarding BNM. Section 8 provided that BIF could withdraw from the Agreement after
the auditors had submitted their report, if PCSF resources were insufficient to cover the

equity deficit.”

93. On June 28, 2001, SBS adopted Resolution No. 509-2001 (published in the
Official Gazette El Peruano of July 13, 2001) amending Article 5 of BNM’s bylaws to

read: “The equity of the company is S/. 0.00 (zero and 00/100 Nuevos Soles).””!

94. In an extra-judicial interim measure requested by NMH against the MEF and
SBS, the 26" Civil Court of Peru appointed Mr. Carlos Roberto Cardoza Matrtua, Mr.
Luis Esteban Sanchez Caceres, and Mr. Tomas Alejandro Moran Ortega as Receivers of
BNM from July 21 to August 6, 2001. The Receivers submitted their Report on August
29, 2001, in Resolution No. 56.”

95. The Receivers’ Report can be summarized as follows: the General Manager of
BNM and the Chairman of the Board of Directors remained in their posts during that
period and the Bank basically kept the same staff, with monthly payroll costs of
US$900,000, so the Receivers terminated the employment of some staff. The Bank kept
all its branches open, although some of them could have been closed temporarily to save
on administrative costs. The Receivers added that the description of the losses for the
fiscal year of 2000 and the adjustments made to record them as of July 17, 2001 appeared
to be contrary to accounting and auditing practice, which does not allow retroactivity.
The Report also indicated that, at the end of the Receivers’ intervention, BNM had
US$87.3 million in available funds. The Receivers criticized the policy of paying interest
to depositors at higher rates than those paid in the national financial system and noted
that, starting in March 2001, there had been a reduction in collection rates and a
deterioration of credit indicators. They also criticized the controls related to the granting,
refinancing, valuation, and rating of portfolio loans and concluded that “... inadequate
measures were applied at BNM in recent months, creating a high level of provisions.””

96. On September 17, 2001, the shareholders of BNM published a statement in the
newspaper E/ Comercio containing “... a proposal for an integral solution which implies
for us to continue working towards the country’s development which is less costly for the
States, allows for refund of deposits to our savers to be completed, avoids losing line of
credits granted to us by our foreign banker... , allows to return the investments entrusted
to us by friends and clients ... which, ultimately, is better in economic and social terms,

* Claimant’s Exhibit I1I-6.

than the intended Banco Nuevo Mundo’s equity block transfer to BIF, since it represents
saving for the State in an amount of US$ 277,3 million ... includes the ability of the State

to recoup its investment in subordinated bonds in an amount of US$63,3 million.”**. I

In
this statement, the shareholders proposed that Peru should, by various means, provide
US$192,6 million and that the shareholders would proceed through “repayment/
refinancing of debt to local and foreign banks and reinstatement of credit lines ...” The
proposal also included incorporation of an international banking company, which, in
exchange for assignment of a share in the Bank’s equity, would contribute a total of

US$342,4 million.

97. On September 23, 2001, Mr. Jacques Levy Calvo, on behalf of NMH, submitted a
proposal to the MEF “for a solution to the problem created by the intervention of Banco

Nuevo Mundo.””

[Tribunal’s translation] This proposal included “the termination of
BNM’s intervention and resuming operations, with BNM’s shareholders being
responsible for BNM’s entire debt. This would allow savers to recover their money, and
the State to recover state companies’ deposits and its investment in BNM’s subordinate
bonds... BNM’s shareholders would pay in US$342 million and would incorporate an
international banking company into the BNM’s share ownership structure... The State
would have to issue 10-year subordinate bonds—redeemable from the fifth year or
convertible in BNM preferred shares—for US$63 million, and US$126 million would be
used out of the fund established by Urgency Decree 108-2000 for the Financial Industry
Consolidation Program, which BNM’s shareholders would repay later.”°°
98. On October 18, 2001, the auditors Medina, Zaldivar, y Asociados submitted their
“Report on certain items in the general balance sheet of BNM under the Special
Transitional Regime as of April 30, 2001”.°” This Report indicated that the procedures

applied did not constitute an audit of the financial statements of BNM, a valuation of the

Bank’s assets and liabilities, or a review of the Bank’s internal controls.”®

99. On October 18, 2001, by Resolution No. 775-2001, SBS ordered the dissolution
and liquidation of BNM.” In the preambular paragraphs of that Resolution, SBS
referred to the valuation of BNM made by the auditors Medina, Zaldivar, y Asociados
and reviewed by PwC, in which it was determined that BNM had a negative balance of
US$222,517,000, which exceeded by 1.5 times the limit of its accounting equity on
November 30, 2000. That amount should have been covered by funds from the PCSF,

but it was US$5,678,000 above the maximum limit."

100. On October 19, 2001, SBS issued a communiqué announcing that “two audit
firms of international reputation have completed a valuation of Banco Nuevo Mundo as
of April 30, 2001, in order to determine the Bank’s equity and therefore to estimate the
share of the State and the Deposit Insurance Fund (FSD) in such process... The result of
the valuation prepared and reviewed by both audit firms is a negative amount of minus
US$217 million... increasing to US$222.5 million when operating losses are included . . .
consequently, as required by law, SBS has ordered the liquidation of Banco Nuevo

Mundo.” [Tribunal’s translation]

101. On October 29, 2001, SBS issued Report No. DESF “A” 105/OT-2001 entitled
“Deposits with Banco Nuevo Mundo, Liquidity Report” (hereinafter “the Deposit
Report”).

102. The Deposit Report indicated that BNM “... recorder total deposits in Dec.’ 99 in
the amount of US$287.1 million USD, which rose strongly due to the aggressive policy
of Banco Nuevo Mundo in attracting new deposits. Thus, in March-00 deposits rose to

$327.8 million USD and in July ‘00 they reached the highest figure in its history, $366.9

million USD.”!

103. This Report also notes that BNM requested a rediscount from BCR “beginning on

11/13/2000 for $70 million US in order to be able to cover its cash requirements.”'”
“During 99 and Mar ’00, the public deposits in Banco Nuevo Mundo showed a growing
trend, going from $91.7 million US in Dec. ’98 to $128.4 million US in Mar ’00.
Beginning in March ’00, the public deposits moved into a band between US$90 million
and US$125 million, but they always represented more than 30% of the Banco Nuevo

Mundo deposits, their historic average being 32%.7104

104. Regarding public-sector deposits, the Deposit Report noted: “In Oct ‘00 and Nov.
°00 they dropped by $24.7 million US and by $7.7 million US respectively.”! It also
states: “... in Aug ‘00, Banco Nuevo Mundo concentrated 8.4% of the total funds of the
public sector and in Nov. ’00 the concentration was at 8.1%, a difference of just 0.3%...
The private deposits, however, showed a growth trend from February ‘00 to July ‘00,
when it reached a peak of $257.2 million US... private deposits contracted sharply,
especially in Sept. 00 (by $25 million US). In Nov. ’00 they shrank by $60 million US
and the first three days of December saw private withdrawals of $27 million US.”'%
“Consequently, between July 31 and December 5, 2000, private deposits shrank by $109
million US and public deposits by just $13 million us."

105. The Congress of the Republic of Peru conducted an investigation of the BNM
affair. With that aim the Subcommission was created and released its final Report on

January 21, 2002.'°8

106. The conclusions of the Subcommission’s Report can be summarized as follows:

1. The information provided by the Superintendent to the Subcommission and the
SBS Visit Report of November 22, 2000 are inconsistent; 2. The Superintendent
contradicted himself when referring to Bonds DU-108-2000; 3. The
Superintendent did not explain why he used the media to avoid financial panic at
BNM; 4. SBS rushed to intervene in BNM; in addition, it could have sponsored
and coordinated the use of monetary regulation funds to help BNM or could have
encouraged BCR to support it with a rediscount of US$15 million; 5. The
Receivers reported that the intervenors in BNM were affecting the economic
value and the recovery process of BNM assets; 6. Between December 5, 2000 and
September 30, 2001, BNM recovered portfolio worth US$139.8 million; 7. The
Superintendency was not transparent with the Subcommission, it did not provide
information or did so in a partial and untimely manner; 8. “The book assessment
ordered by the Superintendent of Banks and Insurance Companies may be
objected from a technical standpoint”; 9. “Enforcing such unusual and
inappropriate accounting principles and the discretional and discriminatory
behavior of the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance Companies as regards
Banco Nuevo Mundo have resulted in a contingency for the Peruvian State
reaching several dozen million dollars and may even preclude the reimbursement
of depositors’ funds...”; 10. “The Superintendency... acted with negligence when
it failed to meet its obligation to undertake the consolidated oversight of financial

conglomerates, such as Banco Nuevo Mundo.”!”

“As recorded in the Minutes of the Extraordinary General Meeting of

[Mr. Isy and Mr. Jacques Levy Calvo] agreed to transfer their legal rights to THE
SHAREHOLDER, Mr. David Levy Pesso.

In addition, in assigning their legal rights, THE ASSIGNORS agreed that THE
SHAREHOLDER, as the head of the Grupo Levy... would retain and enjoy said
legal rights not only in Corporacion XXI Ltd. but also in any other existing and/or

regarding the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal. It will refer
first to the arguments advanced by Peru and then to Claimant’s response; it will then

rule on the positions of the two parties.

Ill. | OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION
A. Respondent’s Position

118. The Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction, setting forth the

following arguments:

a. The Claimant is not a protected “investor” under the APPRI, because she acquired
her indirect interest in BNM “too late,” almost five years after the events on which
the claim is based took place. When BNM was intervened, the Claimant had no
connection whatsoever to the Bank or to the dispute between the parties. Ms. Renée
Levy came onto the scene five years after BNM was intervened, when she received a

minority, indirect interest in that Bank for free. '?°

b. The interest acquired by the Claimant did not qualify as an “investment” under the
APPRI. On July 12, 2005, BNM had no value and it was found to be illiquid and

insolvent on the day that SBS intervened—December 5, 2000. The Claimant’s

interest in BNM “never had any value”?!

''8 Memorial on the Merits, | 469.
"9 Tid. $479.

120 Memorial on Jurisdiction, § 117.
21 Ibid. § 118.

4l

c. Nor does the Claimant’s interest in BNM qualify as an “investment” under the
ICSID Convention. In order for it to qualify as an investment, the Tribunal must find
that certain fundamental elements exist: the Claimant must have contributed
resources to the alleged investment, assumed risk, participated in a project of some

duration, and contributed to the host country’s economic development. '*

d. Peru also considers that the Claimant has committed an abuse of process. In its
view, whatever interest the Claimant did acquire had absolutely no value by 2005.
The assignment of the shares in BNM was nothing more than an attempt to
“manufacture jurisdiction over the claim.”!”*

119. Regarding the first argument mentioned in the preceding paragraph (the Claimant
is not a protected investor under the APPRI), Peru referred to the case of Phoenix Action
against the Czech Republic, in which it was found that “bilateral investment treaty claims
cannot be based on acts and omissions occurring prior to the claimant’s investment.”'*4

Peru stated that the Claimant was not a protected investor when BNM was intervened

on December 5, 2000.'7° In addition, on January 27, 1997, Mr. David Levy and his sons

incorporated Corporacién XXI in the Bahamas to serve as a holding company for BNM,
but the Claimant did not directly or indirectly own any shares in BNM at that point!”° or
in NMH, which owned 99.99 percent of BNM shares.'?’ It was on July 12, 2005 when

Mr. David Levy decided to endorse his shares for free to the Claimant.'* In addition, the

Claimant waited five more years before initiating this arbitration.'”° In conclusion, the

Claimant was attempting to seek protection under the APPRI for events that occurred

when she was not an investor in BNM and therefore not a protected investor under the

APPRI.'*°

120. Concerning the second argument (the acquired interest does not qualify as a
protected investment under the APPRI), Peru alleged that, although the APPRI does not
define the word “asset,” it is commonly understood to be something of value, and thus,
the APPRI requires the Claimant to hold something of value in order to have an
investment covered under that Agreement.'*' Peru noted that “the Bank in which the
Claimant allegedly had an indirect interest no longer had any value, either as a going
concern or in terms of its remaining assets. Likewise, the Claimant does not own a valid
operating license for a banking and finance entity, because, when BNM was intervened,
SBS ended BNM’s operations.”'*? Moreover, the fact that the Claimant received her
interest in BNM for no consideration underscored BNM’s lack of market value at the
time; according to Peru, the “Claimant and her father were well aware that BNM had no
value in 2005.”'** Thus, since the Claimant’s interest was not an asset protected by the

APPRI, the Tribunal lacks competence to hear this dispute.

121. In relation to the third argument (the interest is not an investment under the ICSID
Convention), Peru stated, based on the case of Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade
S.p.A v. Kingdom of Morocco, that an investment under Article 25 (1) of the ICSID
Convention must meet the following criteria: a substantial commitment of the investor’s
own resources; an assumption of risk; a certain duration of the activity; and a contribution
to the economic development of the host country.'** Additionally, Peru added that in the
case of Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela, the Tribunal referred to an investment
involving a certain duration, a certain regularity of profit and return, assumption of risk, a
substantial commitment and a significance for the host State’s development. '** Moreover,

when the Claimant acquired her indirect interest in BNM, the Bank was not operating,

was in liquidation, and had no hope of reviving its economic activities; consequently, the
Claimant made no contribution, took no risk, held nothing of any duration, and did not

contribute to Peru’s economic development. '*°

122. Based on the decisions in other arbitrations, Peru stated that, in order for an
investment to exist, there had to be investment of the investor’s own resources and a real
intention to engage in economic operations.'*” In this case, “[tJhere is also absolutely no
sign of a real intention on Claimant’s part to develop BNM’s economic activities . . .
would have been impossible... since the liquidator was in charge of the liquidation
process. The Claimant knew all of this before she received her indirect interest and

could have had no expectation that she could develop economic activity in Peru.” **

123. With regard to the fourth argument (abuse of process), Peru stated that the
principle of good faith had long been recognized in public international law and that
several ICSID tribunals had concluded that there was no jurisdiction when a claimant
had not acted in good faith or had in some way abused the process under the ICSID

Convention.’

124. Peru further stated that the conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal in the Phoenix
Action case is applicable to this case. The Tribunal in that case stated that the transfer of
shares had been not an economic investment but “a rearrangement of assets within a
family to gain access to ICSID jurisdiction.” Peru emphasized that, when the
Claimant received her indirect interest, she had no plans and no possibility of any plans
to revive BNM as a going concern. According to Peru that “[t]he only logical

explanation for the endorsement of Holding XXI shares from her father is that it was a

transaction designed to manufacture ICSID jurisdiction for this dispute by keeping the

125. Peru also claimed that the Tribunal could not rule in the present case, because in
essence the Claimant was asking the Tribunal to second-guess Peru’s reasons for the
regulations that it issued and for the actions taken in line with those regulations.
“Claimant is asking the Tribunal to step into the shoes of Peru’s prudential regulator and
second-guess its legally-mandated actions to stabilize the banking system during an

. «os 99142
economic crisis.

Peru stated that SBS had acted reasonably to protect BNM’s
depositors, the public and the banking system, had taken the necessary measures to
prevent the kind panic with respect to other banks and followed the explicit mandate of

the law.'#

126. Peru further stated that, if the Tribunal decided that it did have jurisdiction and
analyzed the merits of the case, it would be setting a serious precedent and opening up
the possibility of hundreds of claims by failed banks, thus effectively expanding ICSID

jurisdiction beyond investment disputes. '*
127. Peru concluded:

“The Tribunal has before it a case in which it is being asked to substitute its own
judgment for the technical decisions made by Peru’s regulator to manage a
widespread liquidity and solvency crisis that was affecting several banks at the
time. The Tribunal cannot hear this case without impermissibly encroaching on
the discretion of Peru’s banking regulator to take necessary action to prevent a

full-blown collapse of Peru’s banking system.” '*°

“The banking regulator in this case was acting in strict compliance with Peruvian

45

law—indeed, its actions were mandated by law. Therefore, if this case were
found to be admissible, in addition to judging whether the regulator acted in
accordance with Peru’s laws, the Tribunal would, in essence, have to examine

whether Peru’s banking laws and regulations constituted a de jure treaty

violation.” 4°
B. Claimant’s Position
128. The Claimant stated that the share transfer was a legitimate act performed in

good faith, owing to the progressive deterioration of Mr. David Levy’s health;'*” it was

done not with the aim of obtaining access to ICSID but in order to ensure continuity of

the foreign nationality protected by the APPRI.'**

129. The Claimant considered that the analysis of the status of a protected investor
focuses on verifying whether the Jus Standi requirements are met in terms of: analyzing
whether a protected investor existed when the investment was affected; analyzing the
existence of a legitimate assignment of the right already held (power to file a claim
before ICSID by virtue of the APPRI) to a third party and verifying whether there has
been abuse of process.'*? In her post-hearing submission of January 22, 2013, the
Claimant also stated that the APPRI established no requirement or limitation
whatsoever to the effect that the initial investor necessarily had to be the claimant before
ICSID, that rights to an investment can be validly assigned—including the power to
submit a request for arbitration for injury suffered by the initial investor and assignor—

since Jus Standi may be assigned. '*°

130. The Claimant also noted that “in those cases where no abuse of process has been
found, the Arbitral Tribunals are competent to settle disputes arising out of State’s

measures that took place before the assignment, as well as those that took place after the

transfer of the investment.”!*!

131. The Claimant denied that her investment had no value: on the date when the
investment was affected, it had considerable economic value and her claim was based on
its impairment, since it was the Respondent’s actions themselves that substantially

affected the value of the investment. >

132. Concerning the value of the assignment of BNM’s shares, the Claimant
mentioned the need to take into account the fact that the transaction was of an intra-
family nature and the fact that the transfer was free of charge did not imply that the
investment was valueless, “as it is only natural that no price was paid for such shares of

stock.”!3

133. The Claimant stated that the jurisdictional requirements of Salini Costruttori v.

'S4 are fully met in the present case, as the existence and operation

Kingdom of Morocco
of a banking institution such as BNM for about eight years confirms the provision of
funds,'* risk taking, the existence of a project of a certain duration, and the contribution

to the economic development of Peru.'*°

134, On the subject of the statements made by Peru concerning good faith, the
Claimant affirmed that “it is not possible to create access to international jurisdiction in
bad faith when such an access had already existed, both for the assignor of rights, David
Levy, a French national, and for BNM itself, which has always been and continues being
a juridical person of French nationality.”'*’ In addition, in this case there is continuity in
French nationality of the investment; pre-existence of the right to ICSID arbitration
before the transfer of shares of stock and assignment of rights to the Claimant; and pre-

existence of the claims against the State’s measures in the court lawsuits filed by NMH

since 2001. Therefore, according to Claimant it is not possible in this arbitration to

allege abuse of process based on a bad faith action.'**

135, The Claimant further rejected Peru’s objection that the Tribunal cannot rule on
the present claim; the Claimant did not ask the Tribunal to step in the shoes of the
regulatory agency but requested that it determine whether the actions and omissions by
agencies of the Peruvian State infringed principles and standards of international law and
of the APPRI; the Claimant was not objecting to Peru’s banking and financial
regulations and was not disputing the worthiness and validity of domestic banking laws
and regulations.'®? In addition, when considering the merits of this dispute, the Tribunal
should consider whether the Respondent’s institutions acted in accordance with Peruvian
law or whether, on the contrary, by intervening, dissolving, and liquidating BNM they
abused their powers and infringed international principles or standards. '°° The Claimant
also stated that Peru’s arguments meant that “... specific State’s actions... should remain
untouched and unrevised, taking sovereignty to the extreme of not being able even to

assess its legitimacy.”'*!

136. The Claimant also stated that neither the APPRI nor the ICSID Convention
established rules relating to objections to the admissibility of a claim and that a number

of arbitral precedents and doctrine considered it inadequate to analyze objections to the

admissibility.’

137. In the following section, the Tribunal will analyze the objections submitted by
Peru and the arguments put forward by the Claimant concerning ICSID’s jurisdiction

and and the admissibility of the Claimant’s claims.

THE TRIBUNAL ANALYSIS ON JURISDICTION

Convention and of the APPRI, upon which the Tribunal’s competence is contingent:

“Article 25

(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly
out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision
or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in
writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no
party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

(2) “National of another Contracting State” means:

(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than
the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit
such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the
request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of
Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the
nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and

(b) any juridical person that had the nationality of a Contracting State other than
the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit
such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person that had the
nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which,
because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national
of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.

(3) Consent by a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State shall
require the approval of that State, unless that State notifies the Centre that no such
approval is required.

(4) Any Contracting State may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, or approval
of this Convention or at any time thereafter, notify the Centre of the class or
classes of disputes that it would or would not consider submitting to the

jurisdiction of the Centre. The Secretary-General shall forthwith transmit such

140.

notification to all Contracting States. Such notification shall not constitute the

consent required by paragraph (1).”

Article 8 of the APPRI states:

“(1) Any dispute arising with regards to an investment between one party and a
national or company of the other Contracting Party shall be amicably resolved
between the parties to the dispute.

(2) If such dispute has not been resolved within a period of six months from the
time in which any of the parties to the dispute asserted it, it shall be submitted, at
the request of any of the parties, to arbitration at the International Center for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), created under the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States,
done in Washington on 18 March, 1965.

(3) A legal person constituted in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and
that before the emergence of the dispute was controlled by nationals or companies
of the other Contracting Party shall be considered, for the effects of Article 25 (2)
(b) of the convention mentioned in paragraph (2) above, as a company of that
contracting party.

(4) Each contracting party grants its unconditional consent to submit disputes to
international arbitration, pursuant to the provisions of this article.

(5) The arbitral award shall be definitive and binding.”

arbitration; this point will therefore not be analyzed in this award. Nor was there any

discussion between the parties on the direct negotiations they had undertaken prior to the

submission of the request for arbitration.

The Tribunal first notes that Peru did not deny having consented to ICSID

With regard to Article 25, paragraph 2(b), of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal

states that, as will be explained below, while the Claimant affirmed in various ways that

her claim was made on behalf of BNM and that BNM is a party to the proceedings, she

did not provide any evidence of her alleged representation and thus, BNM has not been

50

considered a claimant in these arbitral proceedings.

141. The Claimant asserted that her own and her father’s French nationality had been
indisputably proved; she also stated that she had never had the Peruvian nationality. Her
French nationality has been substantiated on three separate occasions: on June 14, 2010,
when the 6-month period of amicable negotiations lapsed, on 20 July, 2010, when the
Claimant’s request for arbitration was registered, and before December 5, 2000, the day
of SBS’s intervention in BNM, which gave rise to the present dispute.'® In addition,
pursuant to Article 8(3) of the APPRI, for those companies incorporated in Peru, which
were under the control of French nationals before the events related to the dispute took
place, the French control should have remained until the date of consent to ICSID

arbitration, which is the case here.

142. The Claimant also noted that none of the provisions of the ICSID Convention or
of the APPRI required that the investor who made the initial investment be the only one
able to invoke the protection of the APPRI to defend the investment. Claiming otherwise
would mean that the title of the investment should have remained unchanged throughout
the investment life and this would not be consistent with the very aim of the APPRI,

which is to foster and encourage the normal flow of investments. '

143. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the Claimant substantiated her French

166 167

nationality °° and, contrary to the allegation of the Respondent,’ the fact that she has

other nationalities does not prevent her from claiming protection under the APPRI.

144. The Respondent alleged that what the Claimant received was an indirect and
minority interest (paragraph 118(a) above). Several Arbitral Tribunals have repeatedly
stated that investors with an indirect interest, including a minority interest, may on the

basis of the ICSID Convention request protection of the rights accorded to them by an

investment treaty.'°* In addition, the Tribunal points out that Article 1 of the APPRI is

very clear in defining the concept of investment and stating that it includes shares

“,.whether minority or indirect, in the corporations constituted in the territory of one of

the contracting parties.”'®

145. The Respondent also affirmed that the Claimant received her indirect interest
too late, that is, five years after BNM had been intervened (paragraph 118(a) above). The
Tribunal considers that shares may be assigned at any time with no effect on the rights of
the assignee. The transmission of legal rights and endorsement of the shares could occur
without affecting protection of the investment under the APPRI, provided that the other

requirements of that treaty were met.

146. The Respondent also argued that the Claimant acquired her rights to the
investment without charge (paragraph 118(c) above), since they were assigned to her by
her father, Mr. Levy, in 2005. This Tribunal considers that the monetary value of
assignments of rights and endorsements of shares does not affect the status of the initial
investment. This was recognized by the Arbitral Tribunal in the case of Pey Casado v.
Republic of Chile.'” In light of the paragraphs above, the Tribunal will reject the first

argument on jurisdiction advanced by Peru.

147. The Respondent also alleged that the interest acquired by the Claimant cannot
qualify as an investment under the the APPRI, since on July 12, 2005 it had no value
because BNM had been illiquid and insolvent since December 5, 2000, so that “the

Claimant’s indirect interest in BNM never had any value” (paragraph 118(b) above).'7!

148. It is clear that the Claimant acquired her rights and shares free of charge.

However, this does not mean that the persons from whom she acquired these shares and
rights did not previously make very considerable investments of which ownership was
transmitted to the Claimant by perfectly legitimate legal instruments. The fact that BNM
had been insolvent since December 5, 2000 did not in itself mean that the investment
made by her predecessors and validly acquired by the Claimant was valueless. This
determination is one of the issues at stake in these proceedings and resolved in this

award.
149. Article 1 of the APPRI states:

“Such assets [including shares] should be or should have been invested in

accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory or in the

sea areas in which the investment is made, before or after the entry into force of
this agreement.

Any modification to the form of the investment of assets does not affect its

definition as an investment, provided that such modification is not contrary to the

legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory in the maritime zone in which
the investment takes place.”'”

150. In the opinion of the Tribunal, BNM was an investment made in accordance with
the Peruvian legislation on banking matters, as confirmed by Resolution No. 818-91 of
December 20, 1991, through which SBS authorized the operations of BNM. In addition,
the APPRI entered into force on May 30, 1996, so that the requirements established in
the first part of its Article 1 are met. For these reasons, the Tribunal will also reject

Peru’s second argument on jurisdiction.

151. As to Peru’s third argument—that the Claimant’s interest in BNM does not
qualify as an investment under the ICSID Convention (paragraph 118(c) above) —the
Tribunal considers that the initial investment made by the Claimant’s relatives meets all

the requirements described by the Respondent: it provided resources to establish the

53

Bank and make it operational; risk was incurred in each of the operations, which were
typical bank operations; the investment was of some duration and it contributed to the
development of Peru, through the various services provided by BNM to the public and

private sectors.

152. In addition to the points made in the preceding paragraph, the question whether
BNM was an investment is clearly relevant to the merits and has no part in a discussion

on jurisdiction. Here the Tribunal agrees with Professor Schreuer that:

“These features should not necessarily be understood as jurisdictional
requirements but merely as typical characteristics of investments under the
Convention.”!?

153. Regarding Peru’s fourth argument—that there is abuse of process (paragraph
123 above) and that the assignment to the Claimant of the shares in Holding XXI does
not constitute a good-faith investment (paragraph 124 above)—the Tribunal fully agrees
with the Respondent about the importance of good faith in international law and
specifically in investment arbitration issues. However, it considers that the Respondent
did not succeed in proving the alleged bad faith of the Claimant and it is a well-known
and accepted fact that bad faith cannot be presumed. Therefore, the Tribunal will also

reject this argument on jurisdiction advanced by Peru.

154. With regard to the intention behind Mr. Levy Pesso’s assignment of his shares to
his daughter, the Claimant, the Tribunal considers that the fact that this transfer took
place without charge does not demonstrate that it was an attempt “to manufacture

jurisdiction,”!™

as the Respondent states. Firstly, because this is a transfer between very
close family members and, secondly, because the transfer occurred in July 2005 and it
was not until five years later that the Claimant decided to resort to ICSID arbitration. In

conclusion, it is impossible to determine from the precise circumstances of this case that

pages, § 122.
™ Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, { 120.

54

the assignment of shares in 2005 was an attempt to “manufacture” ICSID jurisdiction.

155. Lastly, the Respondent argued that the Tribunal is not competent to rule on the
Claimant’s claims because that would oblige the Tribunal to examine actions taken by
the authorities of Peru (paragraph 125 above). The Tribunal will refer in the subsequent

paragraphs to this argument of the Respondent.

156. As indicated in paragraph 125 above, Peru stated that SBS acted reasonably to
protect BNM’s depositors, took the necessary measures and followed the mandate of the
law. Similarly, at the hearing, the representatives of Peru emphasized that “Peru’s
regulators acted at all times in accordance with Peruvian law. Indeed, their actions were
required by Peruvian law. Given the high stakes involved during a financial crisis, the
legally sanctioned actions of a banking regulator must be given the highest possible
degree of deference.”'”°

157. The Tribunal considers it important to reproduce Article 4(1) of the International
Law Commission’s draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful

Acts, which reads:

“The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under
international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial, or
any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State,
and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial
unit of the State.”!°

158. In the Tribunal’s view the fact that SBS is a banking and insurance regulatory

body should not prevent it from analyzing and resolving the present dispute.

159. It is also important to consider the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal in the case of
LG&E Energy Corp. and others v. Argentine Republic:
"5 English Transcript, November 12, 2012, 188:7-14.

"> Reproduced in Crawford, James. The ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility. Introduction, text and
commentaries, Cambridge University Press, 2004, page 132.

55

“International law overrides domestic law when there is a contradiction, since a State

cannot justify non-compliance of its international obligations by asserting the provisions

of its domestic law.”!77

160. In the Tribunal’s opinion, Peru cannot argue that its organs—SBS, the MEF, or
any other organ—acted in compliance with Peruvian law and that the Tribunal is
therefore not competent to settle this dispute. On the contrary, it is the responsibility of
the Tribunal to analyze whether the Peruvian State, through those or other organs,

violated international norms and the APPRI.

161. The Tribunal fully agrees with Peru that it is unacceptable for an Arbitral
Tribunal to “step into the shoes” of any organ and to “second-guess” its actions. In other
words, an Arbitral Tribunal cannot substitute itself for a State organ or convert itself into
an appeals body to examine acts or decisions of the relevant authorities. The Tribunal
also notes that the Claimant did not ask the Tribunal to “step into the shoes” of SBS; the
Claimant asked the Tribunal to “determine whether or not the specific actions and
omissions by specific agencies of the Peruvian State on banking matters infringed
principles and standards of international law and the Peru-France BIT. The Claimant is
not objecting to Peru’s banking and financial regulations in general as a de jure
infringement of the Peru-France BIT. The worthiness and validity of domestic banking
laws and regulations is not being disputed.”!”

162. The Tribunal concludes that its mission is preciselythat of determining whether
the actions of Peru violated the APPRI. Logically, this is mission reserved for the merits
phase of this case; for the above reasons, the Tribunal will also reject this argument on

the admissibility advanced by the Respondent.

Vv. DECISION ON JURISDICTION

objections to jurisdiction and declares that this Tribunal has competence to analyze the

merits of the claim brought by Ms. Renée Rose Levy de Levi.
164. The Tribunal will decide later about the costs of this proceeding.

165. In the next chapter, the Tribunal will endeavor to describe the positions of the
parties on the merits of the case, in order to analyze them and settle the dispute between

them.

VI. POSITION OF THE PARTIES REGARDING THE MERITS

166. As identified in the Memorial on the Merits, the Claimant alleged that Peru
infringed the standards of fair and equitable treatment, national treatment, and full
protection and security; the Claimant also stated that in this case there was an indirect
expropriation.'” The Tribunal will now analyze the Claimant’s position regarding each
of these standards and will then summarize the Respondent’s counter-arguments in each

case.

A. Infringement of the Standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment

1. Claimant’s Allegations

167. The Claimant cites Article 3 of the APPRI concerning the principle of fair and

equitable treatment, whose paragraph | reads as follows:

“Article 3

Each of the Contracting Parties pledges to ensure, in its territory and sea areas just
and equitable treatment, pursuant to the principles of international law, to
investments of nationals and companies of the other contracting party, so that the

exercise of the right thus recognized not be obstructed either in fact or in law.”
168. The Claimant argues that, pursuant to Article 2 of the International Law

™ Memorial on the Merits, ff 483 to 918.

57

Commission’s draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful

Acts, a State’s act infringing upon the principle of fair and equitable treatment can consist

of an action or an omission.'*” The Claimant further asserts that the intention of the State

is irrelevant to determine whether this standard has been infringed or not. The Claimant

also lists the elements comprised in this principle:

a.

169.

Absence of any effect on legitimate expectations;

Guarantee of a transparent and predictable behavior;

Juridical stability and guarantees against abuse of power;

Guarantees against State acts involving bad faith, coercion, threats and harassment;

and

Guarantees against court and administrative procedures that violate due process and

the right to defense. '*!

a. Legitimate expectations

The Claimant states that legitimate expectations involve enabling the investor to

make rational decisions based on the assurances provided by the host State guaranteeing

a predictable regulatory framework and a consistent and transparent behavior; stability

means that the host State will not unduly thwart legitimate expectations.

170.

182

The Claimant alleges that her legitimate expectations and those of BNM derive

from the APPRI and from the operation start-up authorization (license) granted to BNM.
by SBS in Resolution No. 1455-92 of December 30, 1992,'*3 “an administrative action

that created legitimate expectations of stability and return of investment.” !™*

171. Relying on a quotation from Professor Schreuer, the Claimant notes that “... the
investor’s legitimate expectations [are] based on [a] clearly perceptible legal framework
and on any undertakings and representations made explicitly or implicitly by the host
State.”'*> Based on the considerations of the Arbitral Tribunal in the case of Total S.A. v.

186

Argentine Republic,” the Claimant submits that expectations may be based on

regulations that are not specifically aimed at investors, such as long-term investment

projects where regulatory certainty is required. 187

172. The Claimant lists the following acts and omissions of Peru as violations of the

standard of fair and equitable treatment, specifically with regard to legitimate

expectations:

i. Preclusion of the Banco Financiero takeover operation: SBS decided that a capital
increase was required but never formally notified BNM.'** In the Reply on the
Merits, the Claimant adds that the proposed merger was never formally evaluated by
SBS and that, if it had taken place, the merger would have allowed the creation of a
larger and more profitable bank. The refusal of SBS to approve the merger prevented

BNM from improving its solvency, profitability, and liquidity. '*°

ii. Lack of transparency to change regulations and exclusion of BNM, specifically from
the meeting on the restructuring of PCSF, during which no attention was paid to

BNM. A lack of transparency was displayed by failing to consider the interest and

economic purpose of all the players directly involved. '”°

iii. Abrupt and disproportionate withdrawal of State-owned companies’ funds, implying

a violation of the investor’s legitimate expectations and of the transparency and

predictability of government agencies. '°!

Refusal to counter financial panic: the State should have countered the rumors of an
imminent collapse of BNM; its failure to do so constituted a serious omission. !”? In
the Reply on the Merits, the Claimant also indicates that the Respondent failed to
point out that the rumors “had already been spreading since before October 2000.”'”?
In addition, BNM had never asked SBS to make specific statements about its equity
health but had asked it to make general statements about the stability and soundness
of the financial system in general.'4

The refusal by BCR to grant BNM’s request for a monetary regulation bailout loan:
the refusal was unreasonable and “affected the investor’s legitimate expectations and
the guarantee of a predictable behavior by government authorities, which caused that
very day BNM to default on its payments to the Clearinghouse, which was the

grounds [sic] for SBS intervention.”!°°

The Claimant adds in the Reply on the
Merits that the State had a constitutional mandate to protect the stability of the
financial system and that BCR’s unjustified refusal and behavior to act as a private

commercial bank departed from best international practice.'"°

Impairment of the BNM loan portfolio, following SBS’s intervention, due to
decisions taken by the intervenors, since “the investor expected from the State a
minimum standard of diligence to ensure an optimal and transparent management of
BNM?’s equity and loan portfolio.” !°”

Violation of the creditor priority to payments: the violation of the order of priority to

payments, as established in Article 117 of the Banking Law, damaged the interest of

BNM’s savers and shareholders and violated the investor’s legitimate expectations. !°*

The Claimant explains in the Reply on the Merits that the payments in question were

overseas credit facilities rather than deposits of foreign banks.'°? She adds that the

liquidators had received three SBS Resolutions ordering them to change the payment
priority of the following overseas banks: Discount Bank & Trust of Zurich; Israel

Discount Bank of New York, and Discount Bank S.A. of Luxembourg.?” That was

an open violation of the public interest and called into question the legitimacy of the

State’s actions concerning BNM’s intervention and liquidation."

173. The Claimant also alleges that the measures adopted by the State do not meet the
minimum requirements of proportionality, reasonableness, and predictability.“ As an
additional element, the Claimant mentions that, in order for the investor’s legitimate
expectations to be protected, the investor has to have acted in good faith. BNM and its
shareholders had always acted in good faith”? and their expectations had been affected in

an abrupt, unpredictable and unexpected manner.?™

b. Juridical stability

174. On the basis of doctrine, the Claimant affirms that the main elements of juridical
stability are the publication and notification of new laws, regulations, and policies; the
opportunity to comment on them; and their fair and transparent application. Additionally,
prior participation of those potentially affected by future State measures is also
necessary.”°> The Claimant stresses that she does not question the sovereign power of

175. The Claimant cites the following actions as violations of the guarantee of
juridical stability: i) regulatory approach of the State to face liquidity problems
(imposition of merger mechanisms through PCSF); ii) lack of transparency in the
substantial change of current regulations; iii) violation of the creditor priority to

payments; iv) contempt of court; and v) extra-legal actions against BNM.7"”

176. The Claimant stated that PCSF neglected the interest of and economic impact on
all the parties involved and in particular, on BNM. In this respect, she added that once the
meeting at the MEF, from which BNM had been excluded, was over and the public
found out about the regulatory changes “the flight of private deposits in BNM

p seg 092
intensified.”*"*

She reiterated that by making payments to foreign banks in the wrong
order of priority (see paragraph 172(vii) above), SBS affected the public interest
protected by banking regulations.”” In the Reply on the Merits, the Claimant also states
that nothing could justify discriminatory treatment consisting of inviting some banks to a
meeting and excluding BNM, which was financially sound and had justified expectations

of continuing to operate successfully.?"°

177. The Claimant also notes that “[t]he PCSF violated the expectations of
rehabilitation of the banking institutions intervened, since the program forced intervened
banks to transfer their assets en bloc. Entities that chose not to do it entered necessarily
into a dissolution process, no longer being entitled to rehabilitation, unlike the regular
regime.”?!!

178. The Claimant also alleges that SBS had not obeyed the judicial decisions
overturning Resolution No. 509-2001, which determined that BNM’s capital was S/. 0.00
(zero and 00/100 Nuevos Soles) (paragraphs 109 and 93 above), since “These Court

decisions, even though they were effective and in force, were not obeyed by SBS, insofar

as [it] kept on validating the reduction of capital to zero (S/. 0.00) to justify the

continuance with BNM liquidation and dissolution process, with the ensuing direct
damage to the investment.”?!

179. The Claimant also affirms “... the existence or occurrence of State’s actions with
surreptitious, extra-legal intent.”?'> She states that certain senior officials of the
Executive Power of Peru intended to force the disappearance of the so-called small banks
and that “... with a reasonable interpretation of the domestic law pre-existent to the
temporary liquidity crisis at BNM, the investor could not have predicted a change of that
nature in the regulatory framework, or the erratic behavior of senior officials of the

Republic of Peru towards the investor.”?!*

ce. Arbitrary or discriminatory State actions and abuse of power

180. The Claimant notes the following as being arbitrary and discriminatory actions:
i) Irregular accounting methods employed by the SBS intervention commissioners, who
applied international accounting standards with respect to BNM’s financial statements
retroactively, adversely affecting the Bank’s net worth.?'* In the Reply on the Merits, the
Claimant adds that: “... it has been substantiated that the auditor released his Opinion
dated as of March 5, 2001 and Respondent does not explain why the auditor did not issue
a supplementary opinion in June of that year as a result of the substantial changes made
by the SBS Intervention Committee, a situation that is of certain formalities, such as
establishing International Standards on Auditing, accounting and audit practice also is

and lack of technical and legal reports justifying the portfolio reclassifications ordered by
the intervention commissioners.”"” In her Reply on the Merits, the Claimant also notes

that the Receivers (mentioned in paragraph 94 above) corroborated these irregularities

and that the Report of Consorcio Define-Dirige, the liquidation firm appointed by SBS,
questioned the work of the intervention commissioners in the accounting treatment of
BNM.’'* iii) Rejection of BNM’s request for a loan from BCR, despite the fact that BCR
“has the function to cover temporary liquidity shortages and guarantee the stability of the

banking and financial industry.”?!°

According to the Claimant, this rejection was
arbitrary because BCR used private banking criteria and did not play its role as industry
stabilizer. iv) Arbitrary rejection of the BNM shareholders’ recapitalization proposal
designed to strengthen the Bank’s equity and to terminate the Bank’s participation in the
PCSF Transitional Regime.” In her Reply on the Merits, the Claimant adds that BNM
shareholders never received a response from the State to their proposal, in contrast to the
treatment accorded to Banco Latino and Banco Wiese.” v) Reduction of BNM’s equity
capital to zero, indirectly affecting NMH as a shareholder.”” In her Reply on the Merits,
the Claimant alleges that the sole purpose of the capital reduction to zero was to
facilitate the disposal of the shareholders’ assets by the State by declaring the dissolution
of BNM.”? vi) Declaration of dissolution of BNM, based on the report of Arthur
Andersen, which clearly stated that it was not “a valuation of the business.”?™* The report
states: “the procedures applied do not constitute (i) an audit of the financial statements of
the Bank, (ii) a valuation of the Bank’s assets and liabilities, and/or (iii) a review of the

Bank’s internal controls,”””>

vii) “. . . serious omission by SBS and BCR of their
responsibility for giving support and acting diligently to find ways to provide BNM with
temporary liquidity; this contrasts with the preferred treatment given to other banks
(Banco Wiese and Banco Latino), which . . . when faced with liquidity shortages, they

were benefited with direct bailouts by the Peruvian State,”"~” and viii) “ . . . the deliberate

who spread the groundless rumors.”?27
181. In addition, the Claimant lists, among Peru’s arbitrary and discriminatory

actions, the following abuses of power:

a. Lack of access to remedies of challenge or appeal in domestic law, in order to
“neutralize” the withdrawal of the State companies’ funds by the MEF and to
challenge the SBS intervention commissioners’ financial management, the SBS
Resolution declaring BNM’s intervention, the SBS Resolution reducing BNM’s
equity to zero and the SBS Resolution declaring the dissolution of the Bank.””* The
Claimant indicates that in Peru those actions can be challenged only by a lawsuit,
which is not an efficient solution because:™” i) court proceedings are public, which
undermines confidence in the market; ii) contentious proceedings last for years; iii)
“the judicial ruling given by the Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice was unfair,
inadequate, and ineffective, violating the full protection and security standard”?”
[Tribunal’s translation], and iv) according to the Banking Law, the rights and assets
acquired by third parties in good faith during the intervention regime may not be

subject to a court challenge.

b. Irregular accounting practice in the BNM balance sheet at year end (higher provision
requirements with retroactive effect), when the State had exclusive control of BNM

management. 231

c. Contempt of court constituting government abuse of power: the reduction of equity

capital to zero; the failure to restore BNM shareholders’ right to recover an effective

participation in the capital equity; and the failure to provide information on BNM’s

liquidation process.”

d. Bad faith, coercion, threats, and harassment

182. The Claimant also refers to the guarantee against State actions involving bad
faith, coercion, threats, and harassment against the investor or the investment and
mentions the following actions: i) coercion and aggressiveness in the lengthy inspection
visit by SBS, which triggered speculation and false rumors about BNM’s solvency and
was one of the reasons for the massive flight of private deposits from the Bank; ii)
reduction of BNM’s equity capital to zero “in order to facilitate the State’s disposal of the
property by declaring the dissolution of BNM;”** iii) coercion by encouraging the sale
of an equity block to Banco Interamericano de Finanzas; iv) bad faith in the

236

declaration of BNM’s dissolution without a valuation of the entire equity;~"° v) coercion

and harassment by criminal prosecution of BNM)’s shareholders and managers in

“numerous and irrational criminal lawsuits.”?*”

Concerning the criminal lawsuits, the
Claimant also states that “BNM’s shareholders and managers have been acquitted from
more than 25 criminal prosecutions, which shows how arbitrary and groundless the filing

of these criminal actions was by SBS.”

e. Violation of due process

183. Regarding the last aspect of the infringement of the standard of fair and equitable
treatment, the Claimant alleges that a guarantee exists against judicial and administrative
proceedings that violate due process and the right of defense. To this effect, the Claimant
cites the following acts and omissions violating this guarantee: i) lack of transparency
and violation of due administrative process by the regulatory change made in PCSF,
implying exclusion of the so-called “small” banks, which were neither consulted nor
notified; moreover, the opinion of all players in the banking and financial system was not

sought; and ii) lack of justification for SBS Resolution No. 775-2001 declaring the
dissolution of BNM, based on SBS Resolution No. 509-2001, even though the latter was

suspended by the Judiciary, resulting in a violation of due administrative process.””

2. Respondent’s Response

24° that a violation of

184. The Respondent maintains, on the basis of several awards,
the standard of fair and equitable treatment occurs when treatment rises to a level that is
unacceptable from the international perspective. The onus is on the Claimant to
demonstrate that Peru’s conduct did not meet international standards. The Respondent
adds that the Claimant has failed to do so because her accusations are factually incorrect
and because none of the Claimant’s allegations amount to a violation of the fair and
equitable treatment standard.**!

185. Peru notes that “BNM’s former shareholders expected that the Respondent would
guarantee them continued profits, growth through successful mergers, access to public
and private deposits, automatic availability of credit, as well as bailouts and other
protection if the Bank’s fortunes should sour. However, BITs ‘are not insurance policies
against bad business judgments.’ Instead, BNM’s former shareholders ‘should bear the

: 5 : : aos 242
consequences of their own actions as experienced businessmen.” **

186. Peru recognized that the fair and equitable treatment obligation encompasses an
obligation not to frustrate an investor’s legitimate, investment-backed expectations and

protects only “the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor

92!

to make the investment.””“? It added that those expectations have to be legitimate and

reasonable and measured objectively. Several awards indicated that expectations are

legitimate or reasonable if they are founded on some form of representation or

commitment by the host State.“

187. Peru argues that the Claimant has not shown “how she or BNM’s shareholders
relied on any of the specific expectations identified in her Memorial in making any

A 99245
investment.”*4*

Indeed, it was inconceivable that the Claimant had such expectations in
2005 and she could not point to any promise or commitment made by the State with

respect to her expectations.“

188. Peru stated that the Claimant asserts that BNM’s shareholders were entitled to a
return on their investment, on the basis of an operation start-up authorization granted to
BNM by SBS in 1992. It added, that is not a reasonable expectation because “The State
cannot and does not guarantee a return on investment. It is incumbent on the investor to
make sound business decisions; the BIT and its fair and equitable treatment obligation are
not a guarantee of business success.”™*”

189. As regards the merger with Banco Financiero, Peru affirms that the State never
committed itself to approving all proposals for bank mergers but only to reviewing them,
by assessing the legality of the proposal and its possible impact on the stability of the
banks involved and on the banking system as a whole. SBS informed those concerned
that a merger proposal would have to be accompanied by a plan to recapitalize BNM; in
addition, the shareholders of that Bank never even submitted a formal merger proposal to
sss.

190. Peru denies having made any statement indicating that BNM would be granted
the unusual privilege of participating in the Government’s decision-making regarding the
promulgation of PCSF.*”” It also explains in its Rejoinder on the Merits that, when the

meeting referred to by the Claimant was convened, PCSF had already been designed.

The meeting was held one day before the program was announced publicly, so that the
invited banks played no role in its formulation. In addition, the Claimant has not proved

that PCSF caused her or BNM’s shareholders any harm. 7°

191. The Respondent also notes that BNM’s shareholders could not reasonably expect
that State-owned companies would keep their deposits in BNM indefinitely. Those
deposits had set terms and no guarantee of renewal. In addition, SBS had warned BNM
against relying heavily on such deposits and on the need to diversify its deposits and to
develop contingency plans.?*!

192. Peru indicates that the public deposits were not withdrawn all at once but when
their terms expired over a twelve-month period, from January to December 2000. In
addition, it was reasonable to expect that the deposits would not be stable, since they
were placed through periodic auctions, in which State-owned companies continually

shopped around for the highest interest rates.”*?

193. Peru states that investors could not have expected that State agencies would
refute the rumors circulating about BNM’s solvency. While BNM had a right, under
Peruvian law, to request that the Public Prosecutor file criminal charges against anyone
who incited financial panic, it failed to exercise such right. Peru also notes that SBS had

no legal obligation to make public statements about specific financial institutions.°>

194. Peru also states that the Claimant has provided no evidence of her alleged
request to SBS to make statements about the stability and soundness of the financial
system and explains that the institutions concerned (SBS or MEF) were reluctant to make
specific statements about BNM, not because the Bank was insolvent but because they

knew it was in a weak financial situation.°**

195. Regarding the Claimant’s expectation that BNM would receive a loan from
BCR, the Respondent states that Peru’s laws clearly define the conditions upon which
BCR loans are granted. It added that the BCR was not allowed to make an emergency
short-term loan to BNM because BNM did not have sufficient collateral to secure the
loan; the Claimant mischaracterizes the role of BCR as lender of last resort.”>> It is not
true that BNM had sufficient collateral and the Claimant has not produced any evidence
that it did. BCR has no constitutional or legal basis for ignoring the legal requirement
regarding sufficient and eligible collateral; thus, the Claimant and her expert have

completely mischaracterized the role of BCR.”

196. Peru notes that BNM’s shareholders could not reasonably have had any
expectations of benefitting from or continuing to control the Bank’s assets after its
intervention had been ordered. The Banking Law states that, once a bank is intervened,
its assets are sold, the bank is liquidated, and the recovered assets are used first to pay

depositors, creditors and—if some residual value remains—shareholders.”*”

197. Regarding the order of priority for BNM payments during liquidation, Peru states
that the payment of foreign banks had no impact on the Claimant, because BNM’s
shareholders were last in the order of payment, so that any expectations they might have

had in that regard were irrelevant.>**

198. With regard to the allegation of violation of the guarantee of juridical stability, the
Respondent explains that the decrease in BNM’s public deposits was consistent with the
freedom of State-owned companies to invest their funds and to withdraw them at the end
of the term of the deposits instruments, particularly in cases such as that of BNM, where
there had not been any promise of renewal. The denial of the BCR loan was consistent
with the legal requirements concerning the provision of sufficient collateral. PCSF did
not change banking regulations in any way; it rather created a new benefit that banks
could voluntarily choose to access. It insisted that the BNM liquidation process followed

the laws on the order of priority for payments.’ In addition, it is not clear what the
Claimant means by stating that BCR acted as a private bank, since it has acted in
conformity with the laws governing its powers and authorities.*° It is nonsensical to
argue that BCR should have acted in accordance with the alleged international best
practices, which were used for the first time to respond to a global financial crisis that

occurred one decade after the events in this case.°*!

199. Peru notes that “States parties to a BIT do not relinquish their traditional

regulatory authority or forgo their ability to amend and adapt legislation over time”?
Additionally it notes that Peru’s legal framework did not undergo any significant changes
during the financial crisis, and SBS, the MEF, and BCR applied the laws in a consistent
manner when dealing with BNM: “the legal framework that was applied to BNM was at
all times in line with the expectations of stability that an investor in Peru’s financial

system would have had.”

200. In the opinion of Peru, the transparency obligation refers to the ability of the
investor to know “beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its

investments.”?™

It has complied with that obligation by publishing all the legal
requirements of PCSF and applying them consistently to the banks interested in
participating. It has also acted transparently by making payments to creditors according
to the priorities established by law. It rejects the Claimant’s conspiracy theory about the
elimination of small banks.”°° PCSF did not force banks to do anything; it was designed
to facilitate the reorganization of institutions in the national financial system. The
program was subsequently expanded to include intervened banks, but on the
understanding that any intervened bank would be liquidated and dissolved. For example,

NBK Bank’s assets and liabilities were sold through PCSF and the Bank was then placed

in liquidation.”

201. Regarding the rehabilitation of BNM, Peru explains that, under the General
Banking Law that option is only allowed for a bank in liquidation (not in intervention)
and can only be initiated by at least 30 percent of the bank’s creditors (not by its

shareholders or directors).?°”

202. As for the allegations of discrimination, Peru states that the Claimant has not
shown that arbitrary or discriminatory measures are in fact prohibited in the APPRI and
that, at a minimum, she must show the existence of such a prohibition (“non-impairment”
provision) in customary international law.”°* Citing doctrine, Peru states that “... not
every exercise of discretion that departs from usual practice without a justification would

9269

rise to the level of prohibited arbitrariness. It adds that “a breach would require

showing intentional arbitrariness, a failure to act in good faith, and actual harm,”?”° and

states that the Claimant has not proved any of those situations.””!

203. Peru further states that a measure described as discriminatory must have been
taken with the intention to harm the investor and must have caused actual injury.?”
Citing several arbitral awards, it states that “when a measure or a distinction reflects ‘a

reasonable relationship to rational policies,’ such conduct is not unlawfully arbitrary or

9273

discriminatory. Based on that line of reasoning, Peru states that, in light of BNM’s

financial problems, it is evident that there was nothing arbitrary, discriminatory or

abusive about the intervention of that Bank.

intervention, Peru states that the necessary adjustments had been made to the financial
statements to reflect the true condition of the Bank. The reduction in the value of BNM’s
assets during the intervention of the Bank was due to a re-evaluation of its financial state
to reflect the financial problems caused by BNM’s management before the SBS
intervention. In addition, given that the Bank was insolvent, the management of the
assets by SBS could not have caused harm to the Claimant. Concerning the loan
requested from BCR on December 5, 2000, Peru explains that BCR’s decision was not
arbitrary because the law governing emergency loans specifically required the provision
of sufficient collateral. As to the rescue plan proposed by BNM’s shareholders, the
rejection was reasonable because the plan was not legally viable; in addition, the
Claimant was not harmed by the rejection because the ownership interest of BNM’s
shareholders would have been diluted or eliminated. With regard to the reduction of
BNM’s shareholder equity to zero, Peru explains that PwC and SBS determined that

BNM was insolvent and that its equity was therefore worth nothing.”

205. Regarding the basis for the decision to liquidate BNM, Peru states that SBS did
not rely on the Arthur Andersen valuation, but on the fact that, under the Banking law,
intervention is always followed by liquidation “regardless of the Bank’s value.” As for
the rumors regarding BNM’s financial situation, the authorities were unaware of such
rumors before the intervention and had a policy of not speaking to the public about
specific institutions. In response to the Claimant’s allegation that it had given bailouts to
other banks, the Respondent states that it had not bailed out the shareholders of any
banks similarly situated to BNM. It is thus not true that there has been any discrimination
against BNM. Concerning the withdrawal of public deposits, Peru maintains that public
funds had been withdrawn not only from BNM but from all private-sector banks; in
addition, the Claimant has not shown that the Bank’s failure has been due to those
withdrawals. It was rather the withdrawal of private deposits that caused BNM’s liquidity

crisis.°”°

208.

Peruvian judicial decisions, Peru states that “While the courts acknowledged the rights of
BNM’s shareholders to judicial review, the courts found that SBS was authorized—and
indeed obligated—to dispose of BNM’s assets in the process of liquidation and to
determine if any residual value was left at the end of that process. Therefore, Peruvian
courts did not conclude that SBS abused its power; further, SBS has not been in contempt
of any court decisions.”?”° Moreover, there were no judicial orders to produce
information about BNM’s liquidation process; the one decision handed down has
subsequently been annulled.”

Peru denies having acted against BNM in bad faith, with coercion, threats and
harassment; the onus is on the Claimant to show that the alleged situations have existed.

278 that “it is the severity and ‘misuse of []

It has been concluded in the Vivendi II case
regulatory powers for illegitimate purposes’ that distinguishes a wrongful act from the
legitimate exercise of sovereign authority.”*” The Claimant has failed to establish any
act of bad faith by the authorities and has even stated in her Memorial on the Merits that
the actions of Peru “may” have been intended to affect the investment and to violate the

fair and equitable treatment standard.**°

Concerning the inspection visit of BNM conducted in August 2000, Peru states
that it had been made in accordance with the law, was not unusually long, and was not
the second visit of the year, since what had happened in January was a special

281 Moreover,

examination of the consumer loan portfolio and not a full inspection visit.
the reduction of BNM’s equity to zero was not a form of coercion, since the Bank was
already insolvent and the publication of that fact in a resolution had no effect on the value
of the Bank’s equity and merely acknowledged a reality. The efforts to transfer BNM’s
assets to another bank as a block were not acts of coercion but were expressly authorized

by the Banking Law. It was not coercive for SBS to file criminal charges against the

directors and shareholders of BNM; it was its duty to do so.7*”

209. Countering the Claimant’s allegations of violations of due process, Peru pointed

out that the APPRI cannot be construed as guaranteeing to the Claimant a right to
participate in or comment in advance on PCSF and that “[a] right to comment on an
emergency decree is not a guarantee that is generally considered indispensable to the
proper administration of justice.”** In addition, “no generally accepted standard of due
process requires that all investors have the opportunity to attend government meetings, let
alone participate in making governmental decisions.”*™* Peru concluded that PCSF had
no impact on the interests of BNM’s shareholders, as it was designed simply to benefit

those institutions that chose to participate.”**

210. Peru emphasizes that SBS has never disregarded any judicial decisions; the

courts had not invalidated any of SBS’s administrative acts and the court claims of
BNM’s shareholders have been consistently dismissed as unfounded.**° Furthermore,
there is no generally accepted norm requiring the Peruvian State to provide investors with
an administrative review of administrative actions, in addition to the already existing

judicial review.?*”

Peru denies that BNM’s shareholders did not have access to judicial review.
They brought several court cases, in which they put forward their arguments and
presented the evidence that they deemed appropriate. Based on several awards, Peru
concludes that “[t]he substance of a judicial decision can lead to finding a denial of

public deposits, to decrease BNM’s shareholders equity and to liquidate BNM and in
each case, they failed to substantiate their allegations." As for the Supreme Court’s
ruling, confirming SBS’s decision to liquidate BNM, Peru states that the Court’s

findings were well-reasoned and not influenced by the alleged political pressure.””°

212. The following section describes the Claimant’s allegations regarding the

violation of the standard of national treatment, and the response of Peru.

B. Infringement of the National Treatment Standard

1. Claimant’s Allegations

213. The Claimant reiterates that a State act violating international standards can be an
act or an omission.””' The Claimant indicates that the first paragraph of Article 4 of the
APPRI governs the principle of national treatment of investors and of the investment
itself: “[e]ach Contracting Party grants, in its territory and sea areas, to nationals or
companies of the other party in matters regarding its investments and activities related to
these investments a treatment not less favorable than that accorded to its nationals or

companies, [...].”

214. The Claimant also notes that the examination of the violation of that principle
involves three essential factors: a) identification of comparator and the concept of similar
circumstances; b) existence of unequal treatment and lack of reasonable justification; and

c) irrelevance of the State’s intention.”

215. The Claimant notes that this principle or standard protects foreign investors that
are in similar circumstances to those of a national investor or his investment and is
respected if the claimant investor is in the same industry or in direct competition with the
comparator. It is also important to consider the reasonableness of the State’s measure
granting unequal treatment. In the same line of thinking, the Claimant states that BNM

was comparable to BCP, Banco Wiese, Banco Latino, and Banco de Comercio—all

Peruvian Banks.

216. In her Reply on the Merits, the Claimant also mentions other factors for
comparing BNM with the above-mentioned banks: the benchmark banks performed the
same functions, provided the same financial services, had a similar growth rate, and took
similar risks.?°*

217. The Claimant notes that arbitral doctrine and case law have established that non-
compliance with the national treatment standard occurs regardless of whether the State
took into account the investor’s nationality; for that reason there are de jure and de facto

595
5 she states

discriminatory measures. Relying on the case of Feldman Karpa v. Mexico,
that, once unequal treatment has been proved, the State has to show the existence of
reasonable grounds for such treatment; otherwise, it would be a discriminatory measure

violating the national treatment standard.””°

218. The Claimant affirms that in January 2001, SBS and the MEF reassured the
markets and countered the effects of the rumors circulating about the Peruvian banks
BCP and Wiese Sudameris. In addition, national media published news confirming that
affirmation (Claimant’s Exhibits V-29, V-30, V-31, V-32, V-33, V-34, V-35, and V-36).
There were thus no reasonable grounds or objective public policy issues that would

justify such unequal and discriminatory treatment.?””

219. The Claimant also alleges that the State gave “disproportionate” help to Banco
Wiese and Banco Latino and that, through COFIDE, it intervened in favor of Banco
Latino by capitalizing its receivables, thus avoiding intervention. The State intervened via
bailouts and rescue programs for amounts higher than those required for BNM, which
needed only US$20 million. This amount could have been given through the mechanism

of rediscount by BCR and other viable options, which would have prevented BNM’s

intervention.””*

220. The Claimant further cites the case of Banco de Comercio, whose main
shareholder is the Peruvian State itself and which allegedly had a lower ratio than BNM
but still managed to survive the liquidity crisis in the financial industry. The Claimant
also notes that the Respondent has not provided the list of cash rediscounts given to the
banks by BCR between August 2000 and August 2001, as ordered by the Arbitral
Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 1. This list would have shown the support received

by other banks from the State, in contrast to the treatment accorded to BNM.”””

221. The Claimant adds in her Reply on the Merits that Peru’s position that the
market share of banks is a sufficiently reasonable indicator justifying unequal treatment
has no merits.*°° According to the Claimant’s expert, Mr. Nicolas Dujovne, in December
1999, BNM was Peru’s sixth largest bank and was an institution of systemic

importance.*”!

222. The Claimant also notes that Article 20 of the Banking Law prohibits
shareholders, managers, and directors of firms intervened by SBS to continue being
qualified as the firms’ “organizers.” However, that rule did not apply to national
shareholders who benefited from the bailout programs, such as Banco Latino, where the

. ae 2 eo 2
directors remained in office even after nationalization.*”

223. In her post-hearing submission, the Claimant includes a section entitled: “The

more favorable treatment given by SBS to Banco Wiese and Banco Latino during the

financial crisis” and argues: “... it has been substantiated that the bailout schemes

implemented by the State for local banks, did not preclude the possibility of rescuing

banks by way of a direct or third-party contribution, and the permanence of some

directors. The contrary happened in the case of BNM, as the Banking Act underwent
amendments through Emergency Decrees days before BNM was intervened which
established new rules for bailout processes or bank interventions that ruled out any
possibility of keeping it afloat by its shareholders, and hence the only alternatives were

either the sale of assets or the dissolution and liquidation of the bank.”*°?

2. Respondent’s Response

Peru claims that BNM was not in like circumstances with BCP, Banco Wiese
Sudameris, or Banco Latino. It also claims that a domestic investment was not in like
circumstances with a foreign investment merely because the two companies were in the
same industry or in a competitive relationship. It adds that an essential element of a
national treatment analysis is the reasonable justification of any differential treatment. To
this effect, if the differential treatment is reasonably based on a rational policy, the

foreign and domestic investment will be considered not in like circumstances.**4

Peru explains that Banco de Crédito and Banco Wiese Sudameris were the first-
and second-largest banks in Peru and that, until November 2000, they had accounted for
44 percent of loans and 51 percent of deposits.*°° Banco Latino had a very large network
of individual depositors, making its survival very important for the safety of Peru’s
banking system. In contrast, as of November 2000, BNM accounted for 4 percent of all
loans in the financial system and 2 percent of deposits.*°° In addition, BNM’s depositors
were not individuals but businesses, other banks and State-owned companies, so that its

failure would not (and did not) destabilize the financial system.**”

226. Considering the bank that was most similar to BNM at the time, Peru compares

BNM with NBK Bank, which held 3.3 percent of loans and 1.9 percent of deposits in that

country and which, on December 11, 2000, failed to pay its obligations and was excluded

from Peru’s check-clearing process and intervened by SBS. NBK Bank came under the
Special Transitional Regime and Banco Financiero acquired it under PCSF, so that its

shareholders lost their ownership interest and investment.

227. Peru also affirms that the Superintendent did not, as the Claimant alleges, make
any statements refuting rumors about the above-mentioned three banks; he made only

general statements about the overall health of the banking system.*”

Regarding the
Claimant’s allegations about the way Banco Latino and Banco Wiese were bailed out by
Peru, Peru states that “For Banco Latino, the Government committed funds and
effectively nationalized the Bank; the shareholders’ ownership stake was severely diluted
and eventually eliminated. For Banco Wiese, the Government did not end up paying out
any public funds, and in the process of that merger, Banco Wiese’s shareholders likewise
lost control and ownership of the Bank”.*°? Consequently, even if Peru had treated BNM
in the same manner than Banco Latino or Banco Wiese, which it could not have done,

BNM’s shareholders would have lost ownership and control of the Bank.*"°

228. Concerning the case of Banco de Comercio, Peru points out that the Claimant
did not explain the alleged similarities between that Bank and BNM. According to Peru,
the Claimant also failed to prove her assertion that Banco de Comercio was treated more
favorably than BNM by the Peruvian authorities. While SBS was required by law to
intervene BNM, when that Bank stopped paying its obligations, this was not the case for
Banco de Comercio, even if its liquidity indicators were weaker than those of BNM. The
Claimant thus has failed to demonstrate violation of the national treatment standard in

that respect.*"!

Cc. Refusal to Provide Full Protection and Security

1. Claimant’s Allegations
229. The Claimant cites Article 5(1) of the APPRI as the rule governing the principle

5° Respondent’s Exhibits R-178 to R-180.
5 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, § 384.
5! Thid. 4 385.

80

of full protection and security: “Investments made by nationals or legal persons of a
Contracting Party shall enjoy broad and full protection and security in the territory and

maritime area of the other Contracting Party.”*!

230. The Claimant states that this principle can be violated by an action or an

313

omission. The Claimant also alleges that, according to doctrine and arbitral

precedent, the full protection and security standard goes beyond physical integrity.*'
Moreover, an important element of full protection and security is the right of access to a

system of adequate administration of justice.*!°

Denial of justice can be created by the
lack of access to a fair judicial system or by the contempt of court rulings on the part of
government agencies; specifically in the case under consideration, contempt of court by

SBS has been substantiated.*"

231. The Claimant mentions the following occasions on which, in her opinion, the full

protection and security standard has been violated:

“BNM and its investors were denied the possibility to:

(i) Have access to a fair and predictable dispute settlement system;

(ii) Have access to a judicial system whose decisions were fully and timely abided
by the Peruvian government agencies; and

(iii) Have access to a judicial system impervious to public pressures exerted by

other Powers of the State.”*!”

232. The Claimant indicates that, according to doctrine and certain ICSID awards, two
requirements must be met to establish denial of justice: a) exhaustion of previous

remedies within the jurisdiction of the host State; and b) identification of the illicit

conduct attributable to the judicial system that may not be righted by local remedies.*!*
As regards exhaustion of remedies, the Claimant reiterates that SBS resolutions could
not be challenged at an administrative level. As regards illicit conduct, the Claimant
notes that the purpose of the Administrative Contentious process in Peru is to assess only
the formal aspects of the administrative action and not to discuss the merits of a case, like

the present one, related to BNM’s intervention and dissolution.*"”

The Claimant mentions the following situations of denial of justice:

Violation by SBS of the obligation to abide by court decisions concerning the
declaration of inapplicability of SBS Resolution No. 509-2001, reducing BNM’s

equity capital to zero;

Open and illegal interference by the President of Peru, the President of Congress, and
the Superintendent of Banking and Insurance, who in 2007 made statements to the
media in order to influence the outcome of the Administrative Contentious Action
filed by BNM’s shareholders against SBS Resolution No. 775-2001, ordering BNM’s

liquidation and dissolution;

Illegal authorization by Congress to the Executive Branch in relation to a law that
would suspend the wage increase of the Supreme Court “Vocales”, who would issue
the ruling on the action brought by BNM’s shareholders against SBS Resolution No.
775-2001, ordering the dissolution and liquidation of that Bank; and

Lack of analysis and motivation in the ruling issued by the Constitutional and Social
Law Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice on October 11, 2006, concerning the
Administrative Contentious Action filed by NMH against SBS Resolution No. 775-

2001. In the Claimant’s opinion, that ruling was arbitrary. °°

234. The Claimant states that the violation of the full protection and security standard
“questions the conduct of the judicial system as autonomous behavior, the illegality
whereof is directly related to the adverse effects on the investor’s economic rights.”**! In

addition, the lack of access to a fair and effective judicial system from the perspective of

international law implies that the court action filed by BNM’s shareholders challenging
its dissolution and liquidation precluded any possibility of filing any other judicial action.

The Claimant further states that the opinions given by the President of the Republic, the

President of Congress and the Superintendent (here she refers to the video file appended

to the Request for Arbitration as Exhibit 08) were openly public, coercive, and

concerted.*

235. The Claimant notes in her Reply on the Merits that there was no efficient
administrative defense available, since SBS’s decisions could be appealed only in the
courts and not at an administrative level.**? This is so because the Judiciary “may lack
the technical or professional expertise to contend the State’s ‘truth’ . . . making the Court
review option in a formal remedy but inefficient for the investor’s rights.” Moreover,
Administrative Contentious actions focus on issues of form rather than on the merits of
the case.**4

236. The Claimant also refers to international reports on the bias and corruption of the

Peruvian Judiciary, which in 2007 was placed near the bottom of the ranking.*”°
2. Respondent’s Response

237. Peru states that the Claimant has presented no evidence to support her serious
allegation that the President of Peru, the Congress, and SBS interfered and improperly
influenced the Supreme Court of Justice, which was reviewing SBS’s Resolution

declaring BNM’s liquidation and dissolution. The Claimant also offers no evidence that

the Supreme Court was influenced by the Congress’s bill suspending the wage increase
of that Court’s Justices.*° In addition, the Claimant’s arguments are contradictory
because she relies on reports issued by two congressional sub-committees regarding
SBS’s actions and omissions and at the same time alleges that the Congress influenced,

along with the Executive Branch, the Judiciary to the detriment of BNM.*””

238. Peru states that it has, at all times, provided full protection and security to BNM’s

shareholders, who have enjoyed unfettered access to the Judiciary. The Claimant is
dissatisfied with the outcome of half a dozen lawsuits but did not offer any evidence that
efficiency or expertise had been lacking in those processes or explain how the judicial
review process was insufficient to provide due process and access to justice.*?*
Regarding the Supreme Court’s decision, to which the Claimant objected, Peru
reiterates that it is, in fact, quite straightforward and well reasoned.*”? The Claimant’s
unsubstantiated allegations of political pressure and the fact that Peru’s courts have been
critiqued by international reports on judicial reform can have no bearing over the

Supreme Court’s decision.**°

D. Indirect Expropriation

1. Claimant’s Allegations

239. The Claimant alleges that in this case there has been indirect expropriation and

that the value of the investment, and its legal and contractual rights protected by the
APPRI have been gradually and systematically impaired.**! Article 5(2) of the APPRI
provides that: “[nJeither Contracting Party shall nationalize or expropriate or take any
measure depriving, directly or indirectly, nationals or legal persons of the other
Contracting Party, from their investments made in its territory or in its maritime area,
unless such measures are in the public interest, provided that these measures are not

discriminatory, or against a particular commitment of one of the Contracting Parties with

nationals or legal persons of the other Contracting Party. Expropriation measures that
may be adopted shall cause prompt and adequate compensation, the value of which, shall
be equivalent to the real value of the affected investments, and shall be determined based

on a normal economic situation and prior to any threat of expropriation [...].”

240. According to the Claimant, Peru’s expropriatory measures were concentrated in
the following actions: the lengthy second visit of SBS to BNM; the failure to neutralize
the rumors about BNM’s financial situation; the impairment of the BNM loan portfolio
during SBS’s intervention; the reduction by SBS of BNM’s equity capital to zero; the
lack of an overall valuation of BNM’s equity before declaring its liquidation and
dissolution; the lack of legal and technical reports on the intervenors’ management that
reclassified BNM’s portfolio and rendered its equity negative, which also led to the final

expropriatory measures and to the declaration of the Bank’s dissolution.”

241. The Claimant considers “that the objective mission of BCR and SBS of
safekeeping the right of savers and overall stability of the banking and financial industry .
. . seemingly constituted a sovereign regulatory measure by the State to try to justify a
measure highly restrictive of the Claimant’s right to property.”** The Claimant also
notes that, in order to determine the degree of expropriation of a State’s measure, its

effects on the protected investment should be considered.**

242. In the Claimant’s view, the deprivation of the investment in this case meets the

requirements mentioned in the arbitral precedents on substantial*** and absolute***
deprivation. In effect, the BNM intervenors assumed the powers of BNM’s management
and limited the powers of the Shareholders’ Meeting; SBS reduced the Bank’s equity
capital to zero, taking away the shareholders’ legal and economic rights, and ordered the

Bank’s dissolution, preventing it from being creditworthy and precluding the

shareholders from pursuing the purpose of the company.**”

243. The Claimant states that “BNM was not having losses in its accounts or negative
cash flows before the measure; accordingly, there has been substantial deprivation and
the condition of having suffered a real, rather than theoretical, loss of the economic
enjoyment of the investment on the part of Claimant [is met].”*°*

244. The Claimant adds that, as a result of the intervention, the investor lost effective
control of the economic decision making and business of BNM. With the declaration of
its dissolution and liquidation, the loss of control was complete and irreversible.*” The
Claimant quotes Articles 106 and 114 of the Banking Law governing the consequences
of intervention, dissolution, and liquidation of a bank, which led to the loss of control on

the investment and the extinction of BNM’s corporate purpose. *“°

245. The Claimant alleges that the economic damage “... was not ephemeral nor was
it minor” and that “it was impossible for BNM to mitigate it.’**' In that connection, the
Claimant lists the following “serious” events, explained “in terms of the economic
impact:” a) BCR’s refusal to play the role of ultimate lender to provide liquidity to the
financial system; b) the failure of SBS to counter the speculation and rumors, which
created financial panic and a massive flight of funds; c) the abrupt withdrawal of State
funds that led to the flight of privately-owned deposits; d) the intervention resolution of
SBS, which resulted in the cessation of all BNM’s operations; ¢) the irregular accounting
practice of the SBS intervention commissioners, which affected BNM’s economic
results; f) the reduction of BNM’s equity capital to zero; g) the dissolution ordered by
SBS on the grounds of a deficit of US$217 million, mostly the result of the impairment
that occurred during the management of the SBS intervention commissioners; and h) the

SBS Resolution ordering the dissolution and liquidation of BNM, rendering the Bank no

longer creditworthy.*”

246. The Claimant further notes that the effects of those measures could not be
mitigated by BNM’s shareholders, despite the following actions, which they had taken or
tried to take: capital increases; sale of portfolio; application for rediscounts at BCR;
requests to SBS and the MEF to counter the financial panic; bailout plan; and proposal to

take over Banco Financiero.*?

247. The Claimant alleges that the arbitrariness of the measures was conspicuous and
lists the following specific actions considered to be arbitrary: a) a second inspection visit
by SBS in the same year showing that the discretionary power to make visits was not
exercised prudently and reflecting abuse of authority, which created distrust in the
market; b) the failure by BCR and SBS to neutralize speculation and rumors; c) the
dramatic impairment of BNM’s loan portfolio during SBS’s intervention; d) the
reduction of BNM’s equity capital to zero, which was illegal and was declared to be
inapplicable in a Constitutional Action of Protective Measure (Amparo); d) the lack of a
complete valuation of BNM’s equity at the time when the dissolution decision was taken
by SBS; and e) the irregular accounting practices followed by the SBS intervention

commissioners.*“

248. The Claimant reiterates that “[t]he effects of the measures denounced on the
Claimant’s investment had a destructive impact from the very day they were imposed,
since they affected the ¢rust of the market, and their permanence, as it still lasts to date,

were enough to thwart irreversibly any possibility of resuming the banking business.”**

249, The Claimant emphasizes that, in the context of the expropriation measures, the
concept of legitimate expectations was relevant and that the operating license granted to
BNM by SBS “reflects an explicit obligation by the State of providing the required
guarantees for the investor to carry out an investment, which, due to the nature of the
* Ibid., § 737.
*8 Tbid., § 741.
“4 Tbid., § 746.
5 Thid., 750.
87

banking business, is of long term.”**° The investor had legitimate expectations to plan

the growth of her investment, as substantiated by the takeover of Banco del Pais, the plan

to purchase Banco Financiero, and the capital increases that took place until the year

2000, when BNM was intervened by SBS.**” In addition, BNM ranked sixth among all

Peruvian Banks in terms of equity and market share and had managed to consolidate

important business relationships with overseas banks.*“*

250. The Claimant points out that, according to the “sole effects doctrine,” if the
expropriation exceeds the limits of arbitrary interference, then the investor should be
compensated, regardless of the purpose or objectives of an alleged public interest of the
government measure.*“” The intent of the expropriation does not constitute a necessary
requirement for the State to be held internationally responsible.**°

251. The Claimant refers to the existence of two positions regarding police powers:
the first one, the “Radical Police Powers Doctrine” and the second one, the “Moderate
Police Powers Doctrine.” According to the Claimant, under neither of those doctrines
can it be argued that, in this case, the actions of the State were based on public interest.
The first theory establishes certain requirements for a measure to be arbitrary: that it
should be clearly discriminatory and should have been imposed in bad faith and in
violation of due process. The second theory takes into account the effects of State
interference and the purpose of the measure, considering whether there exists a real
public interest and legitimate expectations on the part of the investor; and there has to be
proportionality between those elements. The proportionality test determines whether

there was a balance between the public interest and the adverse effects of the measure.**!

252. In the Claimant’s view, no public interest can be identified to justify the
measures imposed by SBS. In addition, there is no certainty whatsoever that BNM has

failed to comply with any law, since none of the SBS inspection visit reports had found

serious irregularities; there had been only certain findings typical of the industry, in the
midst of a liquidity shortage caused by the State itself. If BCR had wanted to protect the
public’s savings and the stability of the financial industry, it should have been the
ultimate lender and SBS should have countered the rumors about the liquidation of BNM.
Consequently, it was impossible to defend the reasonableness and proportionality of the
measures based on any public interest justifying the substantial damage to the investor’s

rights and legitimate expectations.**?

253. Citing Article 5 of the APPRI, the Claimant refers to the illegality of the
expropriation measure and states that “... since the Peruvian State did not comply with
the international commitment not to expropriate [that] it had assumed, this leads us to
characterise the expropriatory act as wrongful and illegal.”*°? Moreover, the wording of
Article 5 of the APPRI provides that “any expropriation resulting from a measure,
whether regulatory or not, infringing the requirements established by said article or by
international law, is punishable and therefore entails the international responsibility of the
host State.”**

254. The Claimant then analyzes various aspects of Article 5 of the APPRI. The first
element to be considered is the public utility, which would oblige the State to enact a law
to authorize expropriation of the investment on the basis of that concept. In the case of
BNM, according to the Claimant, the procedure established by law to execute an
expropriation was not followed.*** The Claimant then analyses two additional conditions
that are not expressly provided for in the APPRI but may be considered part of the
defense of Public Interest or Public Necessity. The Claimant cites Article 87 of the
Political Constitution of Peru and Article 2 of the Banking Law regulating savings and
the operation of the financial industry and notes that, in the Amparo action filed by
NMH, SBS had stated that the purpose of the intervention was to protect the stability of
the financial sector and the rights of BNM’s investors and creditors. According to the

Claimant, Peru has not substantiated the purported public interest or utility of the

irreversible and destructive measure of intervention, dissolution, and liquidation of
BNM.**° BCR’s conduct did not comply with its ultimate lender role in order to protect
the public’s savings. In addition, during the intervention, higher payment priority was
given to foreign banks to the disadvantage of savers, proving the lack of public utility of

the State’s measure.**”

255. The Claimant also states that this is a case of a bank with a sound equity position
that was wound up and liquidated, in response to a temporary liquidity shortage caused
by the State, by the political instability and by the public disclosure of widespread
corruption in the Government, strengthening larger banks and restricting market

competition.***

256. The Claimant also lists the following actions by the Peruvian authorities that
were taken in bad faith and were discriminatory: i) BCR’s refusal to allow a rediscount;
ii) enactment of PCSF without the participation of small banks; iii) PCSF favored the
purchase of smaller banks and biased the merger negotiation processes; iv) lack of
technical and legal justification for submitting BNM to the Transitional Regime; v)
SBS’s contradictory conduct, since its second inspection visit Report did not state that
BNM needed to increase its capital but it then claimed that an insufficiency of capital
precluded the takeover of Banco Financiero; vi) the reduction of BNM’s equity capital to
zero; vii) the lack of grounds for SBS Resolution No. 775-2001, ordering BNM’s
dissolution; viii) the intervenor’s use of an inconsistent method to manage BNM; and ix)

the retroactive accounting of negative balances during the intervention.*”

257. The Claimant also refers to a test of proportionality between the effects of the

measure, the public interest, and the investor’s legitimate expectations. If there is no
balance between those factors, there has been a wrongful expropriatory act.*

Additionally, the State’s measures should be as non-invasive as possible and the use of

discretionary powers should observe the principle of minimal interference.**!

258. The Claimant further states that the implementation of a regime parallel to the
one established by the Banking Law implied a change in the rules of the game in terms of
the procedures for intervention and dissolution of banking companies, which clearly
favored the transfer of small banks to large banks, affected shareholders’ expectations
and rights, and was not intended to maintain banks with a strong equity position in the

2
market.*

259. The Claimant affirmed that it is possible to determine the severity of SBS’s
intervention, which ended BNM’s operations; that the investor’s legitimate expectations
were severely affected and, consequently that the intervention and the dissolution are
null. In addition, she mentioned that, pursuant to international law, reducing the
shareholders to equity to zero is a disproportionate measure. The Claimant additionally
argued that even if the actions taken by SBS were legal under domestic law, they were
illegal and arbitrary under international law. According to Claimant, Peru violated the
principles of predictability, proportionality, good faith and legal security, infringed the
principles of protection of investments and international law, and, therefore, should

compensate the damages caused.**>

260. In accordance with Article 5 of the APPRI, one requirement for an expropriation
to be legal is that it should observe domestic law and due process. Compliance with due
process requires: basic legal mechanisms of challenge; reviewing or appeal organs
independent from the government agency that imposed or implemented the expropriation;
reviewing organs with powers to revoke the measure and order payment of
compensation; and the existence of clear and transparent procedural rules for appealing

the measure. ***

261. In the Claimant’s view, the measures for intervention and dissolution of BNM

did not comply with the formal or material requirements established in the Peruvian

General Expropriations Law.**

According to the Claimant, “[t]he Peruvian legal
system lacks an available, immediate, adequate and effective remedy,” as SBS’s
decisions were subject to appeal only through the courts and not through the
administrative channels; SBS ordered the dissolution of BNM despite the existence of
an interim injunction suspending the effects of SBS Resolution No. 509-2001 that had

367 furthermore, the dissolution of BNM was

reduced the Bank’s equity capital to zero;
based on a report that was not a complete valuation of equity; the Claimant reiterates
that there was no efficient remedy to challenge SBS’s decision to liquidate and dissolve
the Bank.*** Likewise, due process was violated when the MEF excluded BNM from the
meeting on the PCSF program and when the authorities interfered in the legal
proceedings before the Supreme Court of Justice requesting the nullity of SBS’s
resolution that declared BNM’s liquidation and dissolution.*” All those facts lead to the
conclusion that the expropriation has not complied with the due process requirement,

provided for in Article 5 of the APPRI, and is therefore illegal.*””

262. The Claimant also indicates that all the discriminatory measures that she had
described violated the principles of non-discrimination and equal treatment and that
Article 5 of the APPRI and international customary law provided that, in order for an
expropriation measure to be considered lawful, it must not be performed on a

discriminatory basis.°7!

263. The Claimant further notes that the Peruvian State has not fulfilled the obligation
established in Article 5 of the APPRI to compensate for damage caused and that, in this

case, “the damage caused entailed the complete destruction of the economic viability and

profitability of the Claimant’s investment.”>””

264. The Claimant refers to the theory of mitigation of damage and lists the following
actions taken by BNM to overcome the effects of the liquidity crisis created by the
State’s political crisis: a) increase in BNM’s capital agreed to on February 29, 2000; b)
first issue of BNM’s mortgage bonds for up to US$20 million; c) increase in capital by
public deed on September 12, 2000; d) creation of an optional reserve by issuing equity
securities for S/.8.8 million; e) in October 2000, BNM informed SBS of the completion
of the merger operation involving the takeover of Banco Financiero; f) the agreement of
November 22, 2000 of the Board of Directors authorizing the sale of part of the portfolio
for a maximum of US$50 million; g) on November 24, 2000, BNM concluded an
Assignment of Loan and Leasing Operations Agreement with COFIDE, whereby BNM
assigned its rights under a number of loan and leasing contracts for about US$105
million; h) the application to BCR for a loan of US$12 million; i) the bailout proposal
made to the MEF on September 25, 2001; and j) Minutes No. 121 of the Board of

Directors of BNM listing the measures taken to deal with the temporary illiquidity.°”*

265. The Claimant states that her conduct was proactive but that the responses were
slow or inconsistent and sometimes non-existent; SBS Resolution No. 775-2001
declaring BNM’s dissolution and liquidation precluded any possibility of finding

alternatives.°*”

266. With regard to the valuation of BNM, the Claimant notes that the Accounting
Audit Expert Report established that there was no accounting basis for concluding that
the Bank was insolvent. In addition, Peru has ignored previous relevant documentation
about BNM’s solvency, such as the reports of risk rating agencies and the authorization

given to BNM to be listed on the Stock Exchange.°”°

2. Respondent’s Response

267. Peru states that not every regulatory measure that might adversely affect the
value of an investment can be considered an expropriation.*”° As the Claimant has
recognized in her Memorial on the Merits: “a non-compensable regulation is
distinguished from an expropriation by, inter alia, the extent to which the investor was
deprived of the investment and the character of the governmental measure.”*”” In this
case, BNM’s shareholders have not been deprived of any economic value or rights
because Peru’s actions were exercises of its legitimate sovereign regulatory powers.*”*

268. According to Peru, there has not been any considerable deprivation of BNM’s
shareholders’ ownership rights. Before the SBS Resolution on the dissolution and
liquidation of BNM, the investment had already lost its value, because the Bank had been
insolvent since June 2000. On December 5, 2000, it could no longer pay its obligations

and the BNM managers decided that day to close it, hours before SBS’s intervention.*””

269. All banks in Peru were subject to the same legal framework and BNM’s
shareholders would have been well aware of that framework. The inability of BNM to
meet its obligations triggered mandatory intervention. The loss of the shareholders’
control over the Bank derived from the financial failure of the Bank, rather than from the
discretionary acts of the authorities. In addition, the shareholders “did retain their rights
to the residual value of BNM (if any) once all of BNM’s liabilities had been paid, as well
as a right to judicial review of SBS’s actions provided by Peruvian law, and no
deprivation of those rights ever occurred.”**°

270. Peru adds that the expectations that the Respondent would guarantee long-term
growth and return on investment were not reasonable or legitimate. The APPRI is not a

guarantee of economic success, especially when the investment’s growth depends on the

have confirmed that “a state cannot be liable for expropriation as a result of the legitimate

exercise of its inherent power to regulate for the protection of, inter alia, public welfare
and order.”>*?

271. Peru stated that once BNM failed to meet its payment obligations, the
intervention, liquidation, and dissolution of the Bank were mandated by, and undertaken
in conformity with, the legislation in force.*** In addition, the right to operate and control
a bank is always contingent upon satisfying the regulator that the bank is sufficiently

sound to receive deposits from the public.***

272. In the next section, the Tribunal will summarize the claims of the parties

regarding damages and moral damages.

VII. CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES
A. Claimant’s Position

273. According to the Claimant, “... any reference to the damage valuation method
within the context of the expropriation clause of Article 5 of the Peru-France BIT shall be
considered applicable to the valuation of the damages caused by the breach of the other

international guarantee and protection standards.”>*°

274. The Claimant further states that paragraphs | and 2 of Article 5 of the APPRI
are not applicable to establish the amount of damages because they refer to cases of legal
and not illegal, as in this case, expropriation; thus the Claimant states that she will
consider the standard recognized in customary international law, “... consisting of

comprehensive rules intended to restore all the damage caused and to redress all the

consequences of the unlawful act to the pre-existent situation, from the date of the act in

question, projected until the payment date by the host State.”**°

275. The Claimant indicates that she would use the concept of “prompt, full and
adequate compensation,” but as in this case restitution of the assets is not possible,
integral compensation will be sought.**’ The Claimant explains that Article 42(1) of the
ICSID Convention provides for the coexistence of domestic law and generally recognized
principles of international law to assess the value of the damages to be paid by the host

State.***

Based on this approach, the Claimant indicates that the Political Constitution of
Peru recognizes the obligation to compensate, including for any potential damage. The
Claimant also notes that damnum emergens, lucrum cessans, personal damages, and

moral damages are recognized by the Peruvian Civil Code.**”

5° the Claimant refers to the

276. Based on the quotations from various awards,
principle of restitutio in integrum and explains that her Expert, Mr. Neil Beaton, assessed
the requested damages by projecting them until the date of the Award, thus adopting an

ex post calculation formula;*?!

furthermore, the Claimant’s Expert, has estimated the
corresponding interest from the date of issue of the Award until payment of the amount

due; and used the valuation methodology to obtain the fair market value.**”

277. According to the Claimant “... an item is put forward related to personal damage
and moral damage that the Claimant’s name and reputation has suffered, as a result of
the media exposure of all acts that breached the obligations . . . the innumerable criminal
prosecutions against Directors and senior officers of BNM, before the Jewish community
and the impact on religious freedom, and finally, the severe impact before the business

community, which taken together exceeds what legal doctrine understands as exceptional

278. The Claimant states that BNM had consolidated commercial relations, as it had

growing sales and profits every year, with a steady upward growth;** and that
investment value losses are determined as of the day of the expropriatory act, and as well,
the losses generated between the date of the expropriation and the estimated date of the
Award.*?> The Claimant concludes that Peru should pay damages amounting to
US$4,036 million.*°° The Claimant considers an interest rate of 11.11 percent as
opportunity cost and that post-award interest, capitalized semi-annually, should be

applied until the actual full payment.*°”
As regards moral damage, the Claimant states:

“., the moral damages put forward is proposed before the Tribunal under two
assumptions, one subordinated to the other . . . puts forward moral damage to the
image and/or reputation caused by the State’s conduct, first to the image of Grupo
Levy, under control of Claimant, and if that is not accepted by the Tribunal,

consider the objective damage to the reputation of BNM.”°°°

The Claimant asks the Tribunal to “consider the redress for moral damages

insofar as we are dealing with an exception situation.
she suffered a severe damage to her reputation caused by the unlawful intervention in

BNM and by the damage caused to senior officers and Directors of that Bank.*”

non-property damages, which are further divided into personal damages and moral
damages. In relation to personal damages, the Claimant indicates that it is considered to
be an injury to the physical integrity, honor and good standing of a person.*”! The
Claimant notes that, according to Article 1984, moral damages should be calculated not
only in relation to an affected person but also to that person’s family or closest ones and
that the amount of such compensation depends completely on the judge’s assessment of
the circumstances.*” In the field of international law, the Claimant indicates that moral
damage includes coverage that affects the investor, the company’s prestige, reputation,
and credit, and the psychological damage produced by harassment, persecution, and

coercion against the officers of the company.*°>

282. Based on the Lemire v. Ukraine case,”

the Claimant identifies the following
exceptional circumstances that harmed BNM and its shareholders: “public statements by
Peruvian authorities against BNM’s management to the degree that we are labeled
‘swindlers’ and ‘white collar thieves;’”*°> legal prosecution against BNM’s senior
managers before civil and criminal courts; the imposition on Mr. David Levy Pesso of the
obligation to sign in at court offices every month with the ensuing humiliation before the
business community and the Jewish community in Peru; preventing Mr. David Levy
Pesso from leaving the country for five years, save with prior authorization of a judge;
exposing the dispute in the press; the legal impediment to undertake a banking project in
Peru again; excommunication from the Jewish community because they had been labeled
by the State as swindlers; prohibition by the Jewish community of Peru from burying Mr.
Levy Pesso in the Lima Jewish cemetery; adversely affecting the health of the Levy
family; excommunication of the Levy family and removal of minors of that family from

schools; and suspension of real estate developments by the Peruvian authorities.*°°

involves her family name, and the business prestige and reputation of the Levy name.*””
The Claimant argues that “to the extent that the Peruvian State ... has recognized Grupo
Levy as a family group that controlled a Financial Conglomerate..., a legal connotation is
attributed in its own right, and therefore is entitled to claim damages to its good standing
caused by the State’s conduct, as a result of the destruction of the investment in

BNM.”4°8

284. According to the Claimant, the amount for moral damage should take into
account: the loss of revenue streams by the Claimant and the Directors of BNM, as they
were exposed to and condemned by public opinion as a result of the State’s arbitrary
conduct.” The Claimant argues that having substantiated French control of Grupo
Levy, the family group as such is also entitled to the rights recognized in the APPRI.*'°

Article 1(3) of the APPRI refers to family companies and capital, and BNM is a family

company. The Claimant states that the damage to her image and reputation is not limited

to herself, but is “consubstantial to ‘Grupo Levy.””""!

285. The Claimant states that, in the event the above argument is not accepted, she is
also invoking Article 4 of the APPRI in relation to the Most Favored Nation Clause and
requests the application of the “Agreement between the Government of the Republic of
Peru and the Government of the Republic of Italy for the Promotion and Protection of
Investments . . . and/or in a supplementary manner, the Agreement between the Republic
of Peru and the Federal Republic of Germany for the Promotion and Reciprocal
Protection of Investments . . . concerning a broader concept and favorable of the

compensation for the damage to her reputation, as representative and controlling party of

Grupo Levy, she requests that the compensation “be applied as damage to the reputation

of BNM.”*3 The Claimant’s Expert, Mr. Neil Beaton, estimated the Claimant’s moral

damages, through BNM’s “brand value”, at US$2,953 million.*"*

B. Respondent’s Position

287. The Respondent objects to the payment sought by the Claimant and insists that
Ms. Levy did not acquire any shares in BNM or any of its holding companies before July
12, 2005, which is an insurmountable obstacle for the recovery of damages arising from
the alleged acts and omissions of the State that occurred in the years of 2000-2001, and
adds that, in 2005, the shares purchased by the Claimant had no value and, therefore, she

had nothing to lose.*'°

288. According to the Respondent, the Claimant and her damages expert modeled the
hypothetical development of BNM beginning in December 2000, under the assumption it
was not intervened, even though the Claimant did not acquire her interest in the Bank
until July 2005 and, therefore, never had anything at stake at the time when the
intervention occurred.*!° Moreover, the Respondent asserts that “[i]t defies logic that a
person can simply receive shares in a defunct company for nothing and then claim US$ 7

billion for alleged losses she never suffered.”*"”

289. The Respondent also claims, based on the Report issued by its Expert, Mr. Brent
Kaczmarek, that BNM’s capital had a negative value in June 2000, even before the first
of the actions of the Peruvian authorities. That fact would make the amount of damages
zero. It notes that the premise on which the Claimant’s calculations are based (that BNM.
was a healthy bank and that it would prosper if the actions of the Respondent had not
taken place) is false. It also points out that Mr. Beaton, the Claimant’s expert, used

BNM’s misleading and unaudited financial statements of November 30, 2000 and

ignored the 1999 and 2000 SBS Inspection Reports and the reports produced by PwC.*'

290. According to Peru, the APPRI and principles of international law require
valuation of loss at the time of the alleged treaty breach (ex ante approach), but the
Claimant’s expert’s valuation is calculated on an ex post basis, as of 2010.4!

291. Based on the opinion of its expert, Mr. Brent Kaczmarek, Peru points out several

flaws in the Claimant’s damages model.*”

292. The Respondent also requests that the Tribunal award it moral damages suffered
as compensation, separate and apart from and additional to any award of costs it incurred
as a result of this proceeding in an amount to be determined at the Tribunal’s

. . 42
discretion.“!

293. Peru states that BNM?’s shareholders (and now, the Claimant) abused the

administrative and judicial processes available to them and inflicted serious harm on the

Respondent’s reputation and the legitimacy of its response to Peru’s financial crisis.*?”

 

The shareholders brought six lawsuits in 10 years against the Respondent and thus
interfered with the authorities’ efforts to wind up the Bank’s affairs efficiently. They also
“induced their political allies to initiate two Congressional investigations;” filed a lawsuit
against the Superintendent of SBS in the U.S. federal district court of the Southern

District of New York, which was dismissed.*”°

BNM’s shareholders have also engaged in
a media campaign to undermine the Respondent’s credibility. The Claimant even
lobbied to damage Peru’s international reputation by identifying herself as an American
shareholder and tried to block the approval of the U.S.—Peru Free Trade Agreement in the

US. Congress.**

In relation to the Claimant’s argument that she can claim damages for continuity
of the investment, the Respondent argues that Ms. Levy “has not demonstrated how
there was any continuity of investment, aside from the fact that Mr. Levy was her father,
which is irrelevant for the purposes of proving that she is an investor protected by the
BIT. [The] Claimant has not indicated any provision in the BIT that extends its
protections to the relatives of covered investors.”*?°

Peru concludes that neither the Claimant nor any of her experts challenged the
findings of SBS contained in its Inspection Visit Reports, and simply conducted analyses
of the bank’s financial performance as if these reports never existed. Thus, the
Claimant’s Expert’s damages calculation, which is based on BNM’s flawed self-

reported data, should be dismissed.*”°

THE PARTIES’ CONCLUSIONS

The Tribunal will summarize below the principal arguments of the parties
submitted in the post-hearing briefs dated January 22, 2013. First, it shall summarize the

position of the Claimant and then that of the Respondent.

A. Claimant’s Conclusions

The Claimant states that it is established that she is an investor protected by the
APPRI; that she is of French nationality; that her dual citizenship is no impediment to
having recourse to the ICSID; that BNM was the result of investments of Mr. David
Levy; and that the very existence of the bank since 1992 is evidence of the investment
made. The Claimant also states that there is no requirement that the initial investor be the
person to make a claim before the ICSID and that there was no bad faith in the transfer of
shares to her.*?” Moreover, the fact that the assignment of shares was free of payment can
have no bearing on the legitimacy and validity of the transaction.*”* As the Respondent

has not questioned the Claimant’s shareholding control on BNM, she has a legitimate

right to advance the present claims on her’s and BNM’s behalf.”

298. The Claimant states that she did not question Peru’s sovereign right to issue
regulations regarding banking and financial matters. She states, however, that in
accordance with a number of ICSID cases, even in a crisis in this sector, arbitral tribunals
have jurisdiction to rule on any measures affecting investment.**° She adds that neither
the APPRI nor the ICSID Convention contemplate rules on objections to
admissibility.**!

299. The Claimant confirms that the content of the SBS 2000 Inspection Visit Report
on “goodwill” and treasury bonds are conservative estimates. With the evidence
presented, it has been demonstrated that BNM was above the levels of liquidity of other
banks; that its accounting and financial information was truthful; that Peru questioned
neither the method of the expert, Mr. Leyva, in terms of determining the “ratios” in
December 2000, nor the methodology and conclusions of the reports made by the

. 2
Peruvian Congress.*? *

300. The Claimant concludes that Peru confused terms like “capital” and “losses”
with “provisions” and confirms that there were no mismanagement or misleading
accounting practices at BNM, which was also confirmed by Mr. Alvarado of PwC at the

. 433
hearing.

The Claimant notes that Peru’s submissions on BNM’s policy of
mobilization of loans are erroneous, since they included the Banco del Pais’ portfolio.
The Claimant affirms that the acquisition of that bank was made based on “accounting
and legal due diligence procedures” and, in any case, the merger plan was approved by
SBS. The Claimant states that, as regards the potential merger with Banco Financiero,

this merger was also based on “due diligence,” and that it included the participation of the

Bank of America.***

301. The Claimant states that the capital increase of BNM was not listed as a legal
requirement in the SBS Inspection Visit Report of 2000, but as a suggestion to be
implemented in the business plan within the next two years. In relation to the valuations
of customers’ assets as collateral for their loans, these were made by companies
authorized by SBS. As regards operations carried out by the Multirenta Investment Fund,
the Claimant states that they were made in accordance with the regulations and that
Messrs. Levy did not interfere in the decisions of the Fund; the Claimant adds that the
pertinent authorities never objected to officer Meza, who worked for both BNM and the
Fund. The Claimant also states that the removal of the liens, days before BNM’s
intervention, on GREMCO’s properties was partial because liens were maintained on
assets with a value of approximately US$35 million. The Claimant further argues that
the valuations of those assets, i.e. of the lands offered as collateral, were made by
companies registered with SBS.** As for the responsibility of BNM’s Management
Staff, the Claimant contends that BNM engaged “in good management practices and that
each of Respondent's imputations lacks any factual grounds whatoever and bears no
relationship to the specific functions of BNM officials”.**°

302. The Claimant rejects Peru’s arguments in support of its position that it did not
violate the international standards contained in the APPRI. BNM was not insolvent
before the intervention and the Tribunal should not judge the conduct of the Respondent
based on the domestic legal framework, but in light of the APPRI and international law;
in addition, the discretion of a State ought not to be absolute and unlimited.*”

303. Regarding the violation of fair and equitable treatment because it hindered the
merger of BNM with Banco Financiero, the Claimant states that the Bank of America
actively participated in that plan; there was “due diligence” and contracts were signed,
but the operation was hindered when it met with unlawful hurdles in its path from

SBS.** The Claimant adds that SBS’s refusal to counter the rumors about BNM’s

financial situation violated the principle of fair and equitable treatment, as well as the

national treatment standard. SBS not only was aware of these rumors but also countered
them with respect to Banco Wiese and BCP.*”

304. The Claimant states that BCR rejected BNM’s emergency loan application
without stating any reasons. Its refusal is inconsistent with the role of lender of last resort,
regulated by the Peruvian legal system, as noted by the Claimant’s expert, Mr. Forsyth,
and indirectly by the Respondent’s witness, Mr. Monteagudo, at the hearing. In addition,
Peru affirms that BCR can act arbitrarily, based on its domestic law requirements
regarding emergency loans and without giving reasons for its decisions. The Claimant
concludes that for that very reason, BCR itself violated the standard of fair and equitable

treatment regulated by the APPRI.“”°

305. The Claimant states that the Banking Law was modified by the Emergency
Decrees, which established new rules on bailout and bank intervention processes, “... that
ruled out any possibility of keeping it afloat by its shareholders, and hence the only
alternatives were either the sale of assets or the dissolution and liquidation of the
bank.”**! Claimant adds that this treatment was different from the one the Respondent
afforded to Banco Wiese and Banco Latino, which allowed for the rescue of these banks
through a direct or third-party contribution and that all this was against the national

treatment standard, as provided for in Article 4 of the APPRI.*”

306. The Claimant also argues that the feasibility of the damages valuation model has
been demonstrated and she states that the ex post method presented by her expert, Mr.
Beaton, was supported by decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, while the
Respondent’s argument is based on direct expropriation cases and not on a proceeding

such as this one, in which damages are being claimed for the time before and after the

intervention.“

307. The Claimant also notes that the Montecarlo model used by the expert, Mr.
Beaton—which analyzes all probabilities for all possible scenario combinations, thus
providing a result quite adjusted to reality—is the most advanced methodology used. The
Claimant also underlines that the application of that model has not been objected by the

Respondent.**

308. The Claimant concludes that the moral damage approach has legal support in
Peruvian law and ICSID case law and the exceptional circumstances of this case were

considered when adopting this approach.*°

B. Respondent’s Conclusions

309. The Respondent expressed the following conclusions: BNM was insolvent since
at least as early as June 2000, that is, before the Government intervened and was a failed
institution. BNM did not reveal in a proper manner the impact that its growing portfolio
of risky loans had on its income and capital. It exaggerated its income by improperly
classifying its consumer loans and recording the interest on those loans. SBS had
determined in the Inspection Visit Report of 2000 that BNM’s capital was 25.7 percent
lower than that reported by BNM and concluded that BNM needed US$32 million to
meet the capital requirement demanded by the Peruvian banking regulations. “* BNM’s
officials were aware of the situation, as Mr. Jacques Levy acknowledged at the hearing
that he agreed with everything SBS had identified in its inspection visits to BNM. “*”
According to the documentary evidence, the owners and managers of BNM were aware

448

since 1997 of the violations of Peru’s banking laws and regulations;""" Mr. Kaczmarek

presented an analysis of the SBS Inspection Visit Reports from 1997 to 2000 and showed

that the percentage of incorrectly classified loans increased every year.” At the hearing,
BNM’s officials and Mr. Levy “...attempted to distance themselves form the memos and
the problems they identified” and said they were not aware of the content of the memos,
either demonstrating management negligence on their part or that their testimonies were

not credible.*?

310. The Respondent argued at the hearing that none of the Claimant’s witnesses
denied that BNM’s officials used the bank’s resources to benefit affiliated companies.**!
In fact, Mr. Jacques Levy admitted at the hearing that BNM released, just a couple of
days before its intervention, mortgages used as collateral for loans extended to the
affiliated company Gremco.**” The Claimant’s witness, Mr. Meza, admitted that the
participation of BNM in the Investment Fund had exceeded the level of support allowed
by law and that BNM had found another mechanism, through sham transactions with the
Bank’s customers, to reduce its stake in the Fund.*** The Respondent further noted that
Mr. Kaczmarek proved that if the “goodwill credit” of the merger with Banco del Pais
were removed, BNM’s equity would fall below the minimum level required by law. He
also indicated that if the deficit in the provisions was taken into account, the equity would
also be below the legal minimum and, applying to BNM’s financial statements as at June
30, 2000 the provisions for risky loans that PwC determined in its 2000 audit, he
concluded that the capital adequacy ratio of BNM would be negative.*** Peru also stated
that BNM is wrong in asserting that loan loss provisions are not accounted for as losses
or do not affect a bank’s capital; it has been established that BNM was required to
register the provisions each month as losses and consequently, its financial information

was completely flawed.**

311. The Respondent also states that BNM did not use the government assistance to

improve the situation of the bank but rather to take more risks. It notes that, during the

hearing, the Claimant’s experts failed to support the contention that the authorities
violated any legal obligation of Peru or international best practices in the banking
sector.**° Mr. Jacques Levy at the hearing did not indicate how BNM allegedly informed
SBS of the existing rumors against that bank.**” Peru also indicates that the withdrawals
of public deposits were not made only at BNM and that those that were made were
insignificant compared to withdrawals of private funds. It reiterates that the Claimant
failed to prove the causal link between the reduction of public deposits and the failure of
BNM.*** As regards the merger with Banco Financiero, Peru notes that, according to the
statement of Mr. Jacques Levy, it was finalized and the only thing missing was the
authorization of SBS, but there is no evidence to support those claims. Peru also states
that Mr. Levy admitted at the hearing that he could not remember if any letter of intent
had been signed, nor was it demonstrated that BNM had made a formal request to SBS on
this merger.*”° It argues that there is no evidence that BCR unreasonably rejected BNM’s
request for an emergency liquidity loan and that the legislation clearly regulates the type
of collateral required for these loans.*® It also notes that the Claimant did not challenge
the legality or suitability of the triggering event leading to BNM’s intervention on

December 5, 2000.*°!

312. The Respondent highlights that the Claimant had initially resorted to far-
reaching accusations of government corruption and conspiracy. These accusations,
whether expressed in the Claimant’s Second Request for Provisional Measures, or in Mr.
Jacques Levy’s book about BNM, remain entirely unsupported.* The Claimant
thereafter accused Peru of acting in bad faith in handling BNM’s financial statements.
According to Peru, the Claimant did not present any evidence to support these claims
and it therefore rejects them in view of the fact that the losses in BNM’s audited financial

statements for the year 2000 were uncovered by PwC, a firm that had served as BNM’s

The Claimant did not explain how the government
could have manipulated BNM’s books after the intervention without PwC having been
part of that conspiracy. It notes that there is no proof of these serious allegations, nor did
the Claimant explain how and why the Government would devise a conspiracy of such

broad scope against BNM and the Levy family.**

313. The Respondent also indicates that Peru’s regulatory authorities were not
obliged to rescue any bank, much less BNM, whose financial situation was deteriorated

465 Tt notes that Mr. Dujovne himself, the Claimant’s

expert, acknowledged that central banks have absolute discretion in their actions,
provided they do not violate the law.**° The Respondent indicates that BCR had the
option to determine when to adjust the standards for the required collateral and to that
end it had to take into consideration the overall financial system, not the needs of one
specific bank; to require adjustment for a particular bank would undermine monetary
policy regulation.*”” Peru reiterates that the shareholders of Banco Wiese and Banco

Latino were not benefited, as they lost their entire investment.**

314. In relation to the claim for damages, the Respondent states that several problems
are evident: the calculation does not reflect the damage suffered by the Claimant; it did
not consider BNM’s previous track record of growth and was based on erroneous
information; also the amount claimed has constantly changed.*® It notes that Mr. Beaton,

the Claimant’s expert, agreed that “no one got any money in 2005 . . . there was no value

to distribute”,*”” that he reviewed almost every document and knew that SBS and PwC

had serious questions about the reliability of information that BNM had given SBS

between August and October 2000. He also said that the amount of damages changed

from the time of the Request for Arbitration up to the hearing.“”! Peru claims that Mr.
Beaton admitted at the hearing that the damage to reputation could not be attributed to
any specific person or entity.*” According to the Respondent, the Claimant's only goal
in this proceeding is to manufacture jurisdiction, as she admitted that she had no

connection with BNM at the time the events at issue in this dispute took place;*”

the fact
that she did not pay any money for the shares is significant because it shows that they had

no value.*

315. Peru concludes that the Claimant submitted a new argument in closing, that
BNM should be considered a company in France, under Article 8(3) of the APPRI,
which argument in the opinion of the Respondent is out-of-time and without merit, since

BNM has never been a claimant in this proceeding.*”>

IX. THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

316. The Claimant requested that the Tribunal:
a. Admit her claim;

b. Declare that the Peruvian State violated the standards of fair and equitable treatment,
non-discrimination, national treatment, full protection and security, and prohibition of

indirect expropriation;

c. Declare “...the international responsibility of the Peruvian State and order that the
Peruvian State pay the Claimant a compensation for damages of US$4,036 million . .

. and a reparation for moral damage of US$2,953 million;”

d. Declare in both cases the recognition of an opportunity cost interest rate of 11.11

percent from the date of the Award up to the effective payment; and

Order “that the Republic of Peru pay for all the expenses and costs incurred in the

arbitral proceeding . . . plus any accrued interests and any other reparation that the

Tribunal may deem pertinent.”*”°

The Respondent requested that the Tribunal:

Dismiss the Claimant’s claims for lack of jurisdiction, or in the event the Tribunal

finds jurisdiction;

Dismiss the Claimant’s claims for lack of merit;

Award moral damages to the Republic of Peru in the amount the Tribunal deems

appropriate; and

. Award Peru its costs, including counsel fees.*””

In order to resolve the dispute between the parties, the Tribunal will examine

below the arguments put forward by them. Although the analysis may seem repetitive,

the Tribunal was forced to proceed in this manner in order to ensure that all of the

arguments of the parties will be addressed. This approach was unavoidable because the

Claimant used virtually the same facts (the alleged wrongful actions of the Respondent)

to support her extensive claims about the way in which these actions violated the various

standards that she invokes (fair and equitable treatment, national treatment, full

protection and security, and indirect expropriation).

A.

319.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS OF THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES

Violation of the Standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment

The Tribunal agrees with the statement made by the Claimant that the legitimate

expectations of an investor are linked to the standard of fair and equitable treatment. It

476 Memorial on the Merits, §{ 1077 to 1079.
477 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, | 441; Rejoinder on the Merits, 371.

111

also agrees that, for an investor to make a decision on an investment, an important
element usually considered is the stability of the country’s legal system. Now, in the
opinion of the Tribunal, that stability does not mean a freezing of the legal system or
making it impossible for the State to reform laws and other regulations in force at the

time the investor made the investment.

320. As noted by Professor Schreuer: “[t]he standard of fair and equitable treatment is
relatively imprecise. Its meaning will often depend on the specific circumstances of the

478

case at issue. For this reason, the Tribunal will examine each allegation of the

Claimant to decide whether Peru actually violated the said standard.

321. In relation to the Claimant’s argument that SBS Resolution No. 1455-92, which
gave BNM permission to start operations, is “an administrative action that created
legitimate expectations of stability and return of investment,” the Tribunal considers that
it is wrong to state that an authorization to begin operating in a commercial activity,
whatever it may be, alone generates the expectation of a return on investment. The
investor may indeed have that expectation, but based on the knowledge of the investor’s

own capabilities and internal and external factors.

322. With respect to the expectation of “a legal framework clearly perceptible,” the

Tribunal examined in this case the following aspects:
a. The Banking Law was in force in 2000 and continues to be in force today;
b. Emergency Decree 108-2000 was published in the Official Gazette, E/ Peruano;

c. SBS, in its Inspection Visit Reports, pointed out to BNM the problems it had detected
and the rules that were violated in each case (as an example, see paragraphs 42-45,

47, 52, and 53 above); and

478 Schreuer, Christoph. “Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice.” Journal of International Arbitration,
July-December 2006, 5: 29.

112

d. The Claimant did not complain that SBS had imposed a fine on BNM.

In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the legal framework was clear and

known by BNM’s managers and shareholders.

323. In the opinion of the Tribunal, it is also important to note that shareholders and
officials of BNM knew of the existing crisis before the BNM intervention; the Claimant
herself notes the existence of a political and economic crisis in Peru.*” Therefore, it was
logical to assume that State authorities would take measures to maintain the stability of
the financial system, as mandated by Peruvian law and, to that end, promulgate

Emergency Decrees.
1. Legitimate expectations

324. As regards the acts and omissions alleged by the Claimant to be violations of
legitimate expectations (paragraph 172 above), the Tribunal will analyze each situation

separately:

a. Purchase and Takeover of Banco Financiero

325. The first claim of the Claimant in this matter relates to the frustrated Banco
Financiero purchase and takeover operation; the Claimant states that SBS never
notified that an increase in capital would be required for that entity to authorize the
merger of BNM with Banco Financiero. At the hearing, Mr. Jacques Levy said, “At that
point, we had a conversation. We were waiting for them to give us that in writing. And
we would have complied with it.’**° The Tribunal does not understand the logic of the
argument of violation of legitimate expectations put forward by the Claimant, as Mr.
Levy was the President of the Board of BNM, a man very experienced in the banking
world, as confirmed at the hearing, where he said that he had been in the banking

business since the 1980s and had served as BNM’s CEO since it started in 1992.**! The

327.

Tribunal therefore cannot understand how a person with as much experience in banking
as Mr. Levy, and with knowledge of the crisis affecting Peru, could submit a preliminary
proposal to SBS in October 2000** regarding the merger with the Banco Financiero and
expect that SBS would indicate whether there should be an injection of capital. The
Claimant herself affirms that, since July 2000, there were withdrawals of public sector

° and the private sector withdrew more than $70 million in August.** It is

deposits**
obvious, therefore, that the President of BNM knew that BNM required an injection of

capital, with or without the requested merger.

It was also discussed at the hearing whether BNM in fact submitted a formal
request to SBS regarding the merger of the bank with Banco Financiero. Concerning this
matter, Mr. Jacques Levy, after the persistent questions of Mr. Alexandrov, attorney for

Peru, answered as follows:

“We did it the same way we had done in Banco del Pais. We had done it the first
time. First you go to the superintendents and you talk to them and then they tell
you ‘Let’s wait a while.’ And they do not push the issue and say you will—you
will do it otherwise. So we went to them, and we did it the same way we had done
Banco del Pais. And this time he said exactly what he declares in the super in the
commission. (Through Interpreter) In the economic commission, he has stated
that we had the operation ready and that he was just waiting, or something to that

effect.”**5

Obviously, that answer cannot be the basis for demonstrating the existence of a formal

request regarding the merger.

b. Lack of transparency

The second claim of the Claimant is the lack of transparency concerning the

Memorial on the Merits, 505.

483 Thid., § 297.
44 Tbid., § 296.
485 English Transcript, November 13, 2012, J. Levy at 297:9-22.

114

regulations on the PCSF and the failure to notify BNM of a meeting on the matter; the

Claimant alleges that the meeting convened by the MEF regarding the PCSF (paragraph

75 above) did not take BNM into account, “had not even tried to find out what its

position was with regard to the substantial legal changes planned, thus violating the

investor’s legitimate expectations.”**°

328. The Claimant does not explain the “substantial legal changes” that were made
because of the PCSF, and moreover the Tribunal considers credible Peru’s response that
the banks that were invited to attend that meeting did not have a role in formulating the
PCSF."*’ If one considers the chronology of the events, the above becomes clear: the
meeting was held on Sunday, November 26, 2000; the regulation was promulgated on the
27" and published on the 28" of that same month. It does not seem plausible that the
invited banks that attended the meeting would have contributed to the drafting of
standards that were approved the next day and published immediately. The Respondent
admits that it did not invite BNM to that meeting, but it is not logical to believe that, at
that meeting, the “ten largest banks in Peru”*** decided with the Superintendent and the
Minister of the MEF on how to proceed. The Tribunal concludes that the meeting was
called to explain the scope of the Emergency Decree and that the lack of notice to BNM
could not have had the consequences the Claimant contends it had. In addition, the
Emergency Decree was published in the Official Gazette, so it cannot be said that there

has been lack of transparency.

c. Withdrawal of funds

329. The third claim of the Claimant refers to the abrupt withdrawal of the funds of
State enterprises; the Claimant alleges that these “funds were legitimately considered
by the Investor as an important variable of return on the investment.“ The Claimant

also notes that the withdrawals were sudden and disproportionate and without any

486 Memorial on the Merits, § 508.

115

contingency plan*” and, therefore, directly affected BNM’s viability and liquidity.

330. The Tribunal finds that the Respondent had no obligation to prepare “a
contingency plan” for the withdrawal of the State-owned funds. Like any public or
private entity, the MEF could remove deposits when deemed expedient, especially
because they had no maturity date after the date of their withdrawal. The fact that, from
April 25, 2000, SBS indicated to BNM that it had a high concentration of public deposits
and that there was a potential liquidity risk (paragraph 53 above) is extremely revealing.
BNM had three months in 2000 to develop a contingency plan because withdrawals
began in July of that year (paragraph 54 above, paragraphs 28 and 278 of the Reply on
the Merits), so there was no factor of suddenness of which the Claimant complains. It is
also important to note that, even in the 1999 Inspection Visit Report, SBS pointed out to
BNM that it had a concentration of deposits and should “Stimulate the incentive for
attracting alternative lower cost deposits,... given that one of the risks the Bank faces is
liquidity, to which it is vulnerable do to the excessive concentration of liabilities in few

creditors” (paragraph 46 above).

331. In paragraph 302 of her Memorial on the Merits, the Claimant includes some
charts in order to assert that “the relative impact of such withdrawals was quite
significant on BNM.” Then, in paragraph 304, the Claimant points out that in October
2000, the impact of the withdrawal of public funds was critical. The Claimant stresses
that the withdrawals did not follow an orderly schedule and the experts and the media
criticized the withdrawal of funds and points out that the State was well aware of the
illiquidity risk that its policy posed to BNM, which SBS also mentioned in the November
2000 report.*?!

332. The Claimant adds that “the withdrawal of funds was abrupt and systematic, and
its relative impact was greater on BNM compared with all other banks in the Peruvian

banking system.”*”? The Claimant states in paragraph 303 of the Claimant’s Memorial

4° Reply on the Merits, | 358.
*' Claimant’s Exhibit [V-6.
4°? Memorial on the Merits, § 310.

116

on the Merits that the withdrawals of public funds from BNM between July and October
2000 amounted to US$24 million. The Tribunal found no reliable information on
withdrawals from other banks, or any demonstration whatsoever of the disproportion and
the alleged “relative impact”. So as regards the withdrawal of public funds deposited in
BNM, a discriminatory and disproportionate attitude by Peru against the Claimant has

not been demonstrated.

d. Financial Panic

333. The fourth claim of the Claimant refers to the State’s alleged inaction in
directly fighting against the financial panic. The Claimant alleges that SBS failed to
play its role as a stabilizer to counter the financial panic. The Claimant states that there
was a legitimate expectation of the investor to expect quick, clear, firm, and diligent
actions from SBS to stabilize the financial system. The Tribunal notes that the evidence
presented at the hearing about the rumors transmitted by e-mail demonstrates that several
persons warned about the intervention in BNM*® and that bank officials reported that the
spread of these emails is categorized under Peruvian law as the offense of Financial
Panic.’ As regards the emails of December 4, 2000 (referred to in paragraph 77 of this
Award), which warned about the intervention in that bank, on December 11, SBS
authorized the filing of a criminal complaint with the Public Ministry. Mr. Jacques Levy
said in his first witness statement that, in the third week of October, he had a meeting
with the Superintendent of Banks in which he requested that SBS perform its duty to
stabilize the local banking industry and release an official statement assuring the stability
thereof.°> The Tribunal fails to find any documentation regarding this meeting or the
request allegedly made by Mr. Levy. Copies of emails brought to the proceedings
commenting on the BNM intervention are dated as of November 2000. The Tribunal also
cannot understand how Mr. Levy or any other shareholder or senior officer of BNM with
banking experience and knowledge of the possible effects of the rumors left no written

record of the alleged request they made to SBS.

334, Article 345 of the Banking Law states that SBS is a constitutionally autonomous
institution, the purpose of which is to protect the interests of the public in the fields of the
financial and insurance systems. Article 346 states that the said entity has functional,

economic, and administrative autonomy. Article 347 states:

“the Superintendency is responsible for the defense of the public interest;
guaranteeing the economic and financial soundness of the individuals and
corporations under its control; enforcing the legal, regulatory and statutory
regulations governing their activities; practicing to that end the broadest control
over all of their transactions and businesses; filing criminal claims against
unauthorized individuals and corporations practicing the activities set forth in this
law and closing their offices; and, as applicable, requesting the dissolution and

liquidation of the violator.”

335. In light of the aforementioned provisions, the Tribunal considers that SBS should
contribute to the stability of the financial system, for which purpose it has discretionary
powers, and that no bank has the power to require SBS to act in a certain way in order to

disprove rumors.

336. In the opinion of the Tribunal, experience shows that, when there is a run on a
bank, it is very difficult to control its impact and the actions that can be taken are very
few, as they run the risk of producing the opposite effect to that intended. This is
confirmed by the Respondent’s experts, Messrs. Powell and Clarke.“”° For these reasons,
the Tribunal cannot hold that there was a negligent attitude on the part of SBS in failing

to rebut the rumors that had been circulating against BNM.

e. BCR Loan

337. The fifth claim of the Claimant was BCR’s dismissal of an emergency loan for

monetary regulation. The Claimant alleges that BCR’s decision in dismissing BNM’s

4°6 Expert Opinion of Mr. Robert L. Clarke, January 25, 2012, § 54; Expert Opinion of Mr. Donald Powell, January
23, 2012, 4 28.

118

application for a loan of US$12 million was unjustified, although it was entitled to a
certain number of rediscount operations, and that this dismissal affected the legitimate

expectations of BNM and the guarantee of predictable behavior by State agencies.

338. In the opinion of the Tribunal, in the circumstances prevailing in Peru in 2000, it
was not reasonable for BNM to expect approval, with absolute certainty, of the loan it
requested. Although BCR is the “lender of last resort” in Peru, it is also obliged to
demand sufficient collateral before granting a loan; BNM did not offer such collateral

and for that basic reason its request was denied.“””

To bolster the argument that BCR
acted arbitrarily and discriminatorily, the Claimant indicated in her Post-Hearing Brief
that Peru’s expert, Mr. Monteagudo, stated that BCR did not have to give reasons for its
decisions on requests for loans.** The issue does not seem to have any greater
importance in view of the evident lack of adequate collateral on the part of BNM, which
was a key factor in the rejection of its request, and the undeniable fact that BCR was not

obliged to accede to the request of BNM.

Sf Impairment of the loan portfolio

339, The Claimant’s sixth claim is related to the impairment of BNM’s loan
portfolio under the intervention. The Claimant argues that the actions of the
intervenors severely affected BNM’s equity.*” The Claimant’s claim is primarily on the
report of the Receivers, which was studied carefully by the Tribunal. While it is true that
the report includes several critiques of administrative and accounting issues, financial and
credit management, and related to BNM’s financial statements (paragraph 95 above), it
also refers to a very short period of time from July 21 to August 8, 2001 (13 working
days). In addition, the Tribunal does not find therein what the Claimant affirms: that the
Receivers stated that the inappropriate policies applied during the intervention led to the

arbitrary reclassification of the portfolio, which caused higher, substantial losses.°” The

Tribunal also notes that, however important the input of officials of the Judiciary, it
seems difficult to base a solid criteria on their input based on the work of SBS’s
intervenors bringing about the consequences that the Claimant alleges. The Claimant
also states that the investor expected an optimal and transparent management of BNM’s
equity and loan portfolio by the intervenors, which, in her opinion, did not happen.*”' It is
noteworthy that the Claimant does not refer in any of her pleadings to the SBS final
report dated February 28, 2003 and presented by the Respondent as Exhibit R-199 on the
management of the intervenors. Nor does the Claimant refute in any of her pleadings
Peru’s assertion that the intervenors were able to recover S/. 559 million (US$160.7
million) for the benefit of BNM’s depositors and creditors.° The Tribunal therefore
concludes that, based on the report of the Receivers, the alleged impairment of the credit

portfolio of BNM during the intervention cannot be regarded as proved.

g. Priority of payments

340. The Claimant’s seventh claim relates to the violation of the priority of
payments to creditors of BNM. The Claimant alleges that the violation relates to
payment to foreign banks that were creditors and not depositors and that these payments
were made in accordance with the orders given by SBS to the company that served as
BNM’s liquidator, Consortium Define-Dirige. The Claimant argues that this action
constitutes a violation of a fundamental rule of due process in bank intervention, the goal
of which is to protect depositors. The Claimant argues that the Peruvian State violated
the public interest and called into question the legitimacy of its actions concerning the
intervention in and liquidation of BNM.°°

341. The Tribunal reviewed the documents cited by the Claimant in her Memorial on
the Merits and Reply on the Merits, and notes that in the SBS final report dated February
28, 2003 there is a section called “Liability for Working Capital.”°™ [Tribunal’s

translation] As the Respondent stated in its Rejoinder on the Merits,
report is clear in its explanation of why SBS changed several foreign banks from category
D to B in payment order and why other creditors, such as the EFG Private Bank, did not
change category. The Tribunal considers that the explanation contained in that SBS
report is clear and does not violate the expectations that the Claimant may have had on
the amount that would have been applicable to her according to the legal order of
payments. In any case, the Claimant’s expectations in that respect have not been
substantiated, as the Respondent clarifies that unpaid liabilities in the amount of US$
87.076 million still exist.°°°
342. The Claimant concludes that, in general, the measures taken by the relevant
authorities of the Peruvian State do not meet the minimum requirements of

507

proportionality, reasonability, and predictability.””’ However, the Claimant has failed to

prove those claims.
2. Legal stability

343. In relation to legal stability, the Claimant alleges that, at the time that the events
giving rise to this proceeding occurred, there was in Peru a regulatory vision imposed,
whereby the PCSF imposed bank mergers of smaller banks.*”* The Claimant argues that
publication and notification of the regulations is essential, as is the right to comment on
them and as is the right of any affected stakeholders to participate in their process of
development. The Claimant further argues that changes in the regulations must be
reasonable, non-discriminatory, made in good faith, and produce clear and predictable
rules. The Tribunal notes that the amendments to the regulations to which the Claimant
refers (the PCSF and the Special Transitional Regime) were published in accordance
with the regulations in force. As noted above (paragraph 75) in this Award, although it is
true that when some banks were invited on Sunday November 26, 2000 to a meeting in
relation to the PCSF, BNM was excluded, that invitation was not so that those banks

could develop the regulations, which were promulgated and published immediately after
the meeting. Nor does the Tribunal find satisfactory proof that the authorities forced the
so-called “smaller banks” to merge with the large banks when the PCSF was
promulgated. This latter program was approved by an Emergency Decree, which
indicates that it is designed to facilitate corporate restructuring in the financial system.
The Tribunal finds credible Peru’s argument that it was created to benefit institutions

that voluntarily chose to participate and thus facilitate mergers.*”

344, The Claimant states that, after the meeting convened by the MEF to comment on
the PCSF, “the flight of private deposits [...] intensified.”*'° The Tribunal finds that this
claim has no basis in provided evidence. The meeting took place on November 26, 2000,
and the decree was published two days later. According to the Claimant, “the flight of
private funds” at BNM started in August 2000°"' and, as shown in a chart the Claimant
provided on page 93 (Spanish version) and page 85 (English version) of the Memorial on
the Merits, although withdrawals continued in November, they did not increase nor did
they “intensify” after the meeting about the PCSF. That chart contains the following
data: August 2000: US$272,337; September 2000: US$250,364; October 2000:
US$256,037 and November 2000: US$201,899.

345. The Claimant argues that, with the PCSF, expectations for rehabilitation of the
intervened institutions were violated, but the Claimant did not prove that BNM was a
banking institution that could have requested rehabilitation under Peruvian law. The
rehabilitation regulation states that “[c]reditors of a company which combined represent
at least thirty percent of the company’s liabilities may submit to the Superintendency a
plan for the rehabilitation of the company.”*!? The Claimant did not show that the said
percentage of creditors (or any other) would have carried out that rehabilitation plan, or

that BNM would have complied with the other requirements.

346. The Claimant states that the violation in the priority of payments to creditors was
a breach of the guarantee of legal stability. The Claimant also alleges that these
payments were made in an illegal, non-transparent manner, infringing the public
interest.°'> The Tribunal examined this issue in paragraph 340 above and felt satisfied
with the explanation given in the SBS Final Report of February 28, 2003 as to why some
foreign banks were paid first. The Tribunal finds no illegality or lack of transparency in
the way in which the payments were made. The information on the payments was
obtained by the Claimant from the SBS report. Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider
that the actions of SBS with respect to these payments violated legal stability or had the

harmful effects that the Claimant attributes to them.

347. The Claimant states that SBS violated legal stability when it did not abide by
several court rulings. In it’s Memorial on the Merits (281 in the English version), the
Claimant affirms the following: “the 63rd Civil Court of Lima, on 23 October 2002,
ruled in favor of BNM, which sentence was affirmed by Third Civil Courtroom of the
Superior Court of Justice of Lima by the Decision issued on 11 August 2003...
declaring inapplicable to BNM such administrative measure, because it was illegal and
unconstitutional, and recognized BNM’s shareholders’ rights. However, despite these
Court Decisions, SBS issued SBS Resolution No. 775-2001... whereby it ordered the
liquidation and dissolution of BNM, a clearly arbitrary measure against the Rule of Law,
as it was based on Resolution No. 509-2001, even though this latter Resolution had no
legal effects for BNM, as it was so declared by a Court decision, and therefore it was res
judicata.”*'* Having examined the timing of the rulings referred to, the Tribunal
concludes that this argument is unsound. Resolution 509-2001 was issued on June 28,
2001, and the second one (775-2001)}—which, in the opinion of the Claimant, is the one
that did not abide by the court rulings, was issued on October 18, 2001. The two
Decisions that, according to the Claimant, declared Resolution 509-2001 inapplicable
are the 2002 and 2003 Decisions.*'* How could the SBS be held in contempt of court for
those Decisions by issuing Resolution 775-2001 in 2001?

348. The Claimant alleges that, in this case, there were State actions with

“surreptitious, extra-legal” intent*!®

and spoke about the video of Mr. Carlos Bolofia
Behr, then Minister of Economy and Finance, which the Claimant had sent to ICSID
along with her Request for Registration. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant added
three videos to her Request for Arbitration, but the one relating to Mr. Bolofia is
unintelligible. It is noteworthy that the Claimant did not refer to him during the final

hearing or in her post-hearing brief.
3. Acts that are arbitrary, discriminatory, and an abuse of power

349, The Claimant alleges that the standard of fair and equitable treatment was
violated because of the following “arbitrary and/or discriminatory actions”:*'’ a)
irregular accounting practices by SBS’s intervenors in BNM; b) deliberate impairment of
the loan portfolio during the BNM intervention; c) rejection of BNM’s application to
BCR for an emergency loan; d) arbitrary dismissal of BNM’s proposal to strengthen its
equity and leave the Special Transitional Regime; e) reduction of BNM’s equity capital
to zero; f) dissolution of BNM based on a report that did not carry out a complete
valuation of the business; and g) serious omissions of BCR and SBS in failing to

cooperate to find ways to provide BNM with liquidity.

a. Accounting practices

350. In relation to the accounting practices of SBS’s intervenors, the Claimant bases
her arguments on the testimony of witness Pablo Seminario and on two documents: the
report®!® of the Congress Economy Sub-Commission investigating the involvement of
SBS in two banks—the BNM’s and another—as well as the report*'” of the BNM’s

Court Appointed Administrators.*”°

BNM loan portfolio to deteriorate, re-classified the risk level of loans granted, ordered
that the resulting provisions be recognized in the Financial Statements as of December
2000, and other negative equity adjustments were deliberately accounted for

retroactively. *”!

352. The Claimant cites from the report of the Sub-Commission, its conclusion
holding that SBS altered BNM’s equity position as it turned a net equity of US$72.3
million as of 30 November2000 into a negative equity of US$23.3 million as of 31
December 2000. The Claimant further states that the adjustment made by SBS’s
intervenor’s in the “goodwill amortization” account, related to the merger with Banco del
Pais, for over US$10 million was arbitrary and illegal. The Claimant also refers to the
statement of Mr. Pablo Seminario, BNM’s Loan Assessment Head Officer, who said that
he was instructed by the SBS Intervention Committee to calculate retroactive provisions

for portfolio risk, which agrees with the findings of the BNM Receivers.*”

353. In relation to the adjustments to BNM’s Financial Statements of 2000, the
Respondent and Mr. Arnaldo Alvarado of PwC state that SBS made these adjustments in

line with PwC’s recommendations.°*

354. It is important for the Tribunal to point out that, in the report of the Sub-
Commission, there is no indication that any report of the firm PwC had been requested
in order to assess the alleged retroactivity; the same applies to the Court Appointed
Administrators, whose mission in BNM was, as noted before, very limited in time (from
July 21 to August 6, 2001). In the opinion of the Tribunal, it is noteworthy that neither
the Sub-Commission nor the Receivers are entities specialized in banking matters; the
first is essentially a political body and the latter is not necessarily aware of these issues.
No matter how respectable both groups may be, the Tribunal will evaluate their opinions

bearing these factors in mind.

355. The Tribunal is also of the opinion that it is relevant to indicate that in Mr.
Seminario’s testimony at the hearing, he doubted as to whether an email in which he
indicated that he had made adjustments on the instruction of the auditors (PwC) had been
properly worded.°*4 That statement appears evasive and contradictory to the Tribunal. It
is obvious that several years have elapsed between the date of this e-mail and the
statement of Mr. Seminario, but to state that the wording of the message was not correct,
that the interpretation of that message was not right, and that he had not imagined that in

2012 he would be discussing these issues, hardly seems credible.

356. During the testimony of Mr. Arnaldo Alvarado of PwC, counsel for the Claimant

asked him about the adjustments:

“Q. And the Intervention Committee agreed with the findings and the
methodology that you used to carry out these recommendations, particularly to
carry out the adjustments.

A. That is correct. They agreed; they consulted with their respective operational
centers, let us say, with the risks department, the accounting department, the loans
department, and they incorporated the adjustments so that we could finally give

99525
[

an opinion on the financial statements. Tribunal’s translation]

357. During the rest of the cross-examination of Mr. Alvarado by the Claimant’s
counsel, there was no success in rebutting the substance of Mr. Alvarado’s witness
statement on regarding alleged retroactive adjustments to BNM’s financial statements in

line with PwC’s recommendations.

358. It is also important to consider that Mr. Edgar Choque de la Cruz, General
Accountant of BNM, said in his written statement that the financial statements of the
bank were “still open” on June 14, 2001 and that in April and June 2001 adjustments

were made in the provisions for the year 2000.*”° The Tribunal finds that these statements

confirm what was said by Mr. Alvarado in that PwC from March 5, 2001 until July 11,
2001, the date that PwC submitted its final audit position to SBS, kept pointing out the
adjustments that were needed in consultation with SBS’s intervenors, who at the same

time were making those adjustments.*””

359. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal cannot confirm that the alleged accounting

irregularities committed by SBS in BNM’s Financial Statements have been proven.

b. Loans portfolio

360. As regards the alleged deliberate impairment of BNM’s loan portfolio during the
intervention, the Claimant again bases her arguments on the report of the Receivers,
which it has been repeatedly stated (paragraphs 339 and 354 above) that it was of a very
short duration and did not consider, in relation to this argument, the final SBS report of
February 28, 2003 regarding the intervention process. The other basis for the position of
the Claimant on this issue was a report from April 1 to June 30, 2003, prepared by the
Consortium “Define-Dirige-Soluciones en Procesamiento”, in which, according to the
Claimant, it was reported that this Consortium had “difficulties to get information from
BNM” because of organizational problems that occurred during the intervention.°** In
other words, the “SUNAT”*”? copies of documents providing documentary support for
the related purchase records were not properly arranged and there was disorder in
Accounting. The Claimant also indicates that it is difficult to estimate how much of the
S/. 155 million of higher provisions required by SBS relate to the portfolio impaired
because of the poor management of the SBS Intervention Committee, and she claims that,

of that amount, S/. 103 million are attributed exclusively to the intervention.>”

361. The Tribunal does not find in the report of the Consortium any basis for the
Claimant’s assertion that there was a deliberate impairment of BNM’s loan portfolio. It

also fails to find in this report or in any of the evidence provided by the Claimant any

127

basis for the assertion that this S/. 103 million in provisions is attributable to the
intervention in BNM. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the Claimant’s argument is not
clear, nor are her assertions proven. In her Reply on the Merits, the Claimant referred to
the same subject as follows: “much of the ‘loss’ (of S/. 328 million appearing in BNM’s
Financial Statements as of 12/31/2000) is attributable exclusively to the State’s
intervention in BNM,”**! and consisted of the elimination of “goodwill,” increased

provision requirements, and the natural impairment of the loan portfolio during the
532

intervention.”°~ This assertion also does not make the Claimant’s argument more
understandable.
362. As for the “goodwill,” arising out of BNM’s merger with Banco del Pais, the

Claimant does not explain why there was “arbitrariness and/or discrimination,” on SBS’s
intervenors for accounting that amount as a loss. The Claimant simply indicated that the
loan had been previously approved by SBS itself. As regards the requirement for higher
provisions, the Claimant states that “...the portfolio that had been temporarily exchanged
for treasury bonds pursuant to a Bond-for-Portfolio Exchange Program had been
reallocated in the Balance Sheet of BNM and recognized as a loss. This rearrangement
was accompanied by higher provision requirements . . . in the amount of S/. 65

ape 99533
million.

In relation to the alleged impairment of the portfolio during the intervention,
the Claimant affirms that, as long as those in charge of the intervention do not explain
the situation, borrowers often fail to repay their loans to a bank under intervention, and
she alleges that the SBS Intervention Committee did little to reduce that problem.*** The
Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to show how the events described affected the

standard of fair and equitable treatment because they were arbitrary or discriminatory.

363. In a separate section, in her Reply on the Merits, the Claimant refers to the
“requirement of higher provisions that zeroed BNM’s equity.” The Claimant speaks of
SBS’s arbitrariness when BNM was assigned losses of S/. 328 million and states that this

assignment was inconsistent with previous findings by SBS itself and due to SBS’s

officials following an improper accounting practice and an ad hoc illegitimate

methodology.**> The Claimant states that, in the SBS report of the results of its 2000

Annual Inspection Visit, that entity identified a deficit of S/. 70 million in the provisions,

compared to S/. 220 million found under the intervention. The Claimant also states that

several adjustments in the accounts of BNM were technically incorrect and were made by
the intervenors after the external auditors had completed auditing the bank.** In terms of
methodology, the Claimant states that the intervenors assumed the roles of managers of
the bank and for that reason it was unclear who made the risk assessment and loan
portfolio classification and who performed the reclassification of BNM’s portfolio.**”

The Claimant concludes that “there are reasonable indications that SBS arbitrarily

applied an arbitrary methodology to reclassify borrowers and calculate of higher

provisions, in order to punish the BNM’s equity and attempt the argument of its
insolvency. However, there is no evidence indicating that BNM had tried to conceal
illegal accounting practices.”***

364. The Tribunal cannot rely on the words of the Claimant to confirm that SBS
intended to write down BNM’s equity and “attempt the argument of [sic] its insolvency”
and, on the contrary, it repeatedly finds that in SBS’s Inspection Visit Reports for several
years, from 1997 to 2000, that agency pointed out several BNM’s irregularities. In some
cases they were addressed by officials of BNM but not in others: in 1999 there were
discrepancies in the classification of the loans portfolio of at least 127 borrowers
(paragraph 42 above); that same year, problems were detected with the BNM provisions
(paragraph 43(d) above); during 1999, BNM breached the regulations on refinanced
loans (paragraph 44 above); and during the same year, SBS instructed BNM to
reformulate the overdraft policies (paragraph 45 above). During the years 1997, 1998,
and 1999, BNM carried out refinancing operations that were not recorded in the accounts
as such and was fined by SBS for that (paragraph 47 above); in those same years and in

2000, SBS informed BNM about overdue, refinanced, and restructured loans that were

366.

entered in the accounts as Current loan portfolio, contravening banking regulations
(paragraph 68), SBS also informed BNM, that there were breaches by the Bank of the
regulations related to loan limits (paragraph 53 above). In 2000, there were breaches of
SBS’s resolutions concerning the classification of the loans portfolio (paragraph 71
above), which in many cases were tacitly approved by BNM’s officials. These are

described in paragraphs 60, 62, 63, and 64 above.

In relation to the allegation of the Claimant concerning the adjustments to
BNM’s accounting made by the intervenors after the external auditors completed their
work, the Respondent explains that these adjustments were made according to the
recommendations of PwC, and insists that the allocation of losses was never made
retroactively. In paragraph 202 of its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, Peru indicates
that the adjustments were recommended by PwC, which was confirmed in the statement
of Mr. Arnaldo Alvarado, a partner at the company that is a member of PwC, who
performed the audit.*° Mr. Alvarado explains that on March 5, 2001, the field audit work
was finished but because of the recommendations made by the auditors to the intervenors,
they completed the report on July 11 of that year and correctly dated it, according to ISA
700 standard,™° with the date on which the fieldwork was finished, that is March 5.**!
These explanations appear reasonable to the Tribunal. The Tribunal does not believe that
the Claimant has demonstrated that the retroactive adjustments were made in order to
“attempt the argument of its insolvency” as alleged, or that such acts were arbitrary and

discriminatory.

The Tribunal deems it important to point out—not only for this matter, but for
others related to BNM’s accounting and audit work performed by PwC—that it was
BNM that retained that company from 1997 to 2000 to audit its Financial Statements.*””

Mr. Arnaldo Alvarado said in his statement that he has 20 years of experience as auditor

of financial institutions and insurance companies.**

PwC also is a company of well-
known international prestige. These facts enable the Tribunal to conclude that the audit
work performed when BNM was intervened was done in compliance with accounting

best practices.

c. BCR loan

367. In relation to the alleged arbitrariness in BCR rejecting BNM’s application for an
emergency loan, the Claimant insists that BCR has the function to cover temporary
liquidity shortages and guarantee the stability of the banking system and also, in this case,
BNM had not used up the number of requests to which it was entitled by law. Thus the
Claimant states that the said rejection was arbitrary and based on private-banking
criteria.““* The Claimant states that BCR had the legal authority to grant the loan and
acted arbitrarily in denying it. However, that argument is contrary to what was stated by
her expert witness at the hearing, Mr. Dujovne, who explained that “the Banco Centro de
Reserva del Peru had the authority, according to the charter, to provide loans, due to
liquidity, to Banco Nuevo Mundo... Legally it was authorized and it was at the discretion
of the Banco Central del Peru to use that authority or not.”*“° Even if the statement that
BCR should have acted as lender of last resort is considered valid, the Claimant herself
cites the same legal requirements that BCR was obliged to demand in order to grant the
emergency loan to BNM: paragraph b) of Article 59 of the BCR Charter Act, which
refers to the need for “first-rate trading securities,” and paragraph b) of Article 78 of the
Statute, which refers “any other adequate collateral at BCR’s discretion”.*“° For the
Tribunal, the citing of this legislation by the Claimant and the statement of Mr. Dujovne
confirm that BCR was obliged by law to ask BNM for sufficient guarantees in order to
grant the requested loan, and therefore its rejection—because BNM had not granted these

guarantees—was not arbitrary.

d. BNM proposal

368. On September 23, 2001, NMH sent a proposal*’ to the MEF that, according to
the Claimant, the MEF arbitrarily rejected. According to the Claimant, the proposal
included terminating BNM’s intervention and restarting its operations, with BNM’s
shareholders being responsible for BNM’s entire debt. According to the Claimant, BNM.
received no response.*“* In her Reply on the Merits, the Claimant expands on this claim
and confirms that BNM never received a response to its proposal, in contrast to the
treatment accorded to the bailout programs of Banco Latino and Banco Wiese, which
were offered a rescue program.’ Peru explained the reasons why MEF’s officials felt
that the plan proposed by the shareholders of BNM was neither feasible nor possible
from a legal standpoint.*° Peru insisted on the fact that, under the Banking Law, the
rehabilitation of a bank requires the participation of at least 30% of the bank’s creditors
and that BNM’s shareholders had not actually proposed contributing their own funds.
The Tribunal finds there are no counter-arguments of the Claimant (except her assertion

551

that the plan was feasible because the bank was solvent)””’ that would invalidate the

explanations of the Respondent.

369. Regarding the difference in treatment that, according to the Claimant, was given
to BNM, compared to the treatment accorded to Banco Latino and Banco Wiese, the
Tribunal notes that this allegation was presented in a single paragraph of the Reply on the
Merits,*°? without more explanation other than a footnote referring to two documents”?

in none of which does the Tribunal find a basis for the arguments of the Claimant. The

first document is a “PowerPoint” presentation on an Economic and Financial Crimes

Commission of Inquiry for the years 1990 to 2001. This document refers to Banco Latino

but gives no explanation or even remotely demonstrates the Claimant’s allegations with

respect to BNM. The second document is the “Report of the Investigation Committee

responsible for complying with the findings and recommendations arrived at by the five
Commissions of Inquiry for the 2001-2002 legislative session,” [Tribunal’s translation]
prepared in July 2003. This report sharply criticized SBS’s attitude to Banco Latino,
Banco Wiese, and Interbank. Much of this criticism was to the effect that SBS did not act
firmly enough on visits made to these banks, according to the Inspection Visits Reports,
and that the bailout programs involved a lot of money. In no way does this report prove
the Claimant’s allegations discussed in this paragraph. Moreover, the Claimant did not

refer to those two documents neither at the hearing nor in her post-hearing submission.

e. Reduction of capital

370. The Claimant stated that the “arbitrary, illegal, and unconstitutional reduction of
BNM’s capital to zero” indirectly affected the investor, as it deprived NMH of its
standing as shareholder of BNM; affected its right to property and right to participate in
BNM’s remaining assets that could result from the liquidation. The Claimant draws
the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that, pursuant to Article 107 (1) of the Banking

Law:

“{w]hen a bank is intervened, SBS is entitled to determine the real capital equity
thereof and offset any losses against legal reserves and, if necessary, against

equity capital.”°°>

371. In paragraph 125 of her Reply on the Merits, the Claimant states that she does
not question the authority of SBS to exercise such power (to determine the real equity
capital of a bank), but rather the fact that it arbitrarily imputed losses in the amount of S/.
328 million to BNM. In the opinion of the Tribunal, it is obvious that the Claimant
contradicts herself when she claims that the capital reduction made by SBS was arbitrary
and illegal and then argues that SBS is empowered to determine the real capital of BNM.
The Tribunal confirmed this contradiction in examining the text of Article 107 of the

Banking Law, which states that SBS has the power during the intervention to determine

554 Memorial on the Merits, {| 422-427 and 596.
*55 Reply on the Merits, {] 124.

133

the effective equity and offset of losses by charging legal reserves and voluntary reserves,

and if applicable, the capital stock.

372. On a related topic, it is necessary to analyze the Claimant’s argument that if SBS
had not issued Resolution 509-2001, the liquidation of BNM would have been

prevented.**°

According to Article 114(1) of the Banking Law, companies comprising the
financial system shall be dissolved after an intervention declared under Articles 104 and
105. Article 105 regulates the intervention period and indicates that once this period has
expired “the corresponding resolution shall be issued, ordering the dissolution of the
company and the commencement of the relevant liquidation process.” On the basis of
these provisions, the Tribunal concludes that if a bank is not rehabilitated it must be
liquidated. For this reason, it is of the opinion that Peru’s response that “the General
Banking Law, requires that a// intervened entities must be liquidated, regardless of their

solvency position,”**’ is enough to justify SBS’s actions.

Sf Dissolution

373. The Claimant states that SBS’s arbitrary conduct is evidenced by its Resolution
No. 775-2001 declaring BNM’s dissolution based on an accounting report prepared by
the company Arthur Andersen, which did not carry out a complete valuation of BNM’s
equity.°* The Claimant considers that such conduct violated the fair and equitable
treatment standard established in the APPRI.* Peru alleges that the valuation carried
out by the company was not the basis for placing BNM in liquidation, as SBS was
required by law to liquidate BNM, regardless of the value of the bank at the time.*° In
her Reply on the Merits, the Claimant states that regardless of whether or not SBS relied
on this report when it referred to it in the Resolution No. 775-2001, “SBS gave a wrong
message to the market regarding the soundness of BNM’s equity, which, as it has been

substantiated, was a solvent bank before the intervention, which in itself is an arbitrary

act.”**! The Tribunal has carefully studied Resolution 775-2001 and notes that, indeed,
among the fourteen recitals it contains, SBS makes reference to the fact that the Arthur
Andersen company made a valuation of BNM, which PwC reviewed and that on April
30, 2001 there was a negative amount of US$217,062,000, which, by adding BNM’s
existing operating losses of US$5,455,000 was increased to US$222,517,000.° In the
opinion of the Tribunal, the reference to the study by Arthur Andersen was not the basis
for the resolution that decreed the dissolution. In the recitals to that resolution it is stated
that, according to the financial statements of BNM audited by PwC, BNM’s losses
amounted to S/. 328.875.366,91. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the resolution that
decreed the dissolution of BNM cannot be described as arbitrary simply because in its

recitals also referred to the study prepared by Arthur Andersen.

g. Omissions of SBS and BCR

374. The Claimant also alleges that there was a serious omission by SBS and BCR in
their responsibility to give support and act diligently to find ways to provide BNM with
temporary liquidity, which contrasts with the preferential treatment those entities gave to
Banco Wiese and Banco Latino, which benefited from bailouts, thereby providing
evidence of discriminatory treatment. The Claimant also notes that the withdrawal of
funds of State companies from banks had a significantly stronger and disproportionate
impact on BNM than on other banks with the same business activity level.°®

375. In relation to the alleged failure to search for alternatives for BNM, which
according to the Claimant was a treatment different compared to the other two
mentioned Peruvian banks, the Tribunal will analyze this situation later when referring

to the national treatment claim raised by the Claimant.

376. As for the second argument put forward, on the withdrawal of deposits of state
companies, the Tribunal did not find any proof to substantiate the Claimant’s repeated
allegation that these withdrawals had a greater impact on BNM than on other banks. The

56! Reply on the Merits, {| 440.
°° Respondent’s Exhibit R-090.
58 Memorial on the Merits, §] 600 and 601.

135

Claimant admitted that “... the withdrawal of State deposits was widespread,” but she
has not proved her claim that it affected BNM more than other banks, nor has she proved

that this alleged greater impact was to be blamed on the State companies.

377. With respect to SBS’s alleged deliberate failure to reassure BNM’s savers, the
Claimant states that “the deliberate refusal ... no (sic) only to face the market and
reassure BNM savers, as well as to counter those who spread the groundless rumors of a
possible intervention, are arbitrary omissions committed by SBS.”*° As stated in
paragraph 333 above there is no evidence that BNM informed SBS of the electronic
messages provided in Exhibit JL-14, which started with the one dated November 30,
2000. The Tribunal did not find evidence that any BNM officer sent copies of those
messages to SBS or sent any communication to that entity informing it of the rumors.
Moreover, as the Tribunal stated in paragraph 336, the scope of action of public entities
in the face of a run on a bank is very limited and any action may not only be ineffective

but also counterproductive.

378. In the case of BNM, it was established that SBS filed a criminal complaint against
the person who sent the December 4 electronic message prompting the withdrawal of
money from BNM (paragraph 77 above). In relation to the alleged failure to “face the

99566
market and reassure BNM savers,

the Claimant seems to suggest that SBS must refer
specifically to that bank, but in the subsequent Reply on the Merits she claims that she
never requested that SBS make particular statements about the soundness of BNM’s
equity, but that SBS should have made general statements about the stability and
soundness of the financial system in general.*°’ The Tribunal concludes that the
Claimant’s position on the alleged failure of the authorities to prevent the run on the
bank is not clear; it also finds that SBS and BCR did not have a legal obligation to act in
the manner suggested by the Claimant; and that the effects of the suggested action—had

it been taken—would not necessarily have benefited BNM.

379. The Claimant further alleges that the following are actions demonstrating abuse
of Government power and constitute arbitrary or discriminatory acts and abuses of

power:

a. Lack of access to remedies to challenge or appeal in domestic law: the Claimant
argues that Peruvian law does not provide an efficient and immediate remedy at the
administrative and judicial level to directly challenge the withdrawal of the State’s
funds, the intervenor’s actions, the declaration of intervention of a bank, or the
resolution ordering the reduction of its capital and its dissolution. The Claimant
argues that the recourse to court action is not efficient for the following reasons:
because the proceedings are public and that affects the trust placed in the investor’s
management and credibility; the administrative contentious action filed by NMH
lasted around six years; the decision of the Supreme Court Chamber was unfair,
inadequate and inefficient because according to the Banking Law, the rights and
assets acquired by third parties in good faith during the intervention regime may not
be subject to a court challenge so there was no way to challenge actions of disposal of

the bank’s equity.**

b. Irregular accounting practices: the Claimant insists that the recognition of higher
provision requirements with retroactive effect infringed international accounting
standards and that action adversely affected BNM’s equity, which is an act contrary

to the Rule of Law.*”

c. Contempt of final court orders: the Claimant alleges that the following acts constitute
abuse of power: reduction of BNM’s equity capital to zero; “the restitution of BNM’s
shareholders’ right to recover an effective participation in the capital equity” and “the

production of information related to BNM’s liquidation process.”*”°

380. The Tribunal will discuss below, together with the Claimant’s argument

568 Memorial on the Merits, {| 606 to 609.
5 Thid, 44 610 to 611.
5” Thid., | 613.

137

concerning the “refusal to provide full protection and security” (paragraph 406 below),
the Claimant’s allegation set forth under sub-paragraph a) above, on the alleged lack of
access to direct and efficient remedies. Regarding her allegations about the alleged
irregularities committed by SBS’s officers in BNM’s accounting when it was intervened,
the Tribunal analyzed this issue in paragraphs 339, 350 et seq., and 360. As for the
alleged disobedience to court rulings, the Tribunal addressed the issue of the resolution

ordering the reduction of BNM’s equity capital in paragraphs 370, 371, and 372 above.
4. Bad faith, coercion, threats and harassment

381. In paragraphs 614 to 623 of the Memorial on the Merits entitled “Guarantee
against State’s acts involving bad faith, coercion, threats and harassment against the
investor or the investment,” the Claimant refers to the following facts: a) “the effects of
the second visit of SBS to BNM;” b) “reduction of BNM’s equity capital to zero (S/.
0.00);” c) “encouragement and attempt to sell an equity block;” d) “declaration of BNM
dissolution without a valuation of the entire equity;” and e) “criminal prosecution against
BNM’s shareholders and managers.” The Tribunal will consider each of these events in

turn.

a. SBS? visit

382. As regards the visit of SBS from August to October 2000, the Claimant
contended that it was a State action of coercion and aggressiveness that affected the trust
of savers in BNM, because it lasted so long, and it triggered speculation and false rumors
that eventually led to the massive withdrawal of private deposits from the Bank.*”! The
Respondent replied that the visit to BNM in August 2000 took 60 days and provided a

s to other banks.*” In this table the Tribunal notes,

 

table with the average length of vis
for example, that the visit to Scotiabank lasted from September 26 to November 29, 2011
(64 days); SBS visited Banco Financiero from March 23 to June 3, 1999 (72 days); and it
visited Citibank from July 24 to October 24, 2000 (92 days). According to this table, the

5 Thid., | 618.
5” Respondent’s Exhibit R-226.

138

average length of visits during 1999 and 2000 was 74 days. The Tribunal also notes that
Article 357 of the Banking Law provides the authority to conduct inspections “at least
once a year,” which means that the entity can perform more than one visit if deemed
necessary. The Respondent’s evidence further shows that it was not only BNM that had
two visits from SBS in a year: in 1999, Banex had had two and in 2000 Banco Financiero
had also had two.*” Thus, the Tribunal cannot conclude that SBS’s second visit to BNM
was more prolonged or frequent than usual or made in bad faith, under coercion, threats
or harassment against the investor or her investment. Nor has the Claimant proved, in the

opinion of the Tribunal, that the said visit triggered speculation and rumors about BNM.

b. Reduction of equity capital

383. As regards the resolution ordering the reduction of BNM’s equity capital to zero,
the Claimant states that it was an arbitrary procedure to facilitate the State’s disposal of
the property of the bank, by declaring the dissolution of BNM.°*” The Tribunal cannot
find any explanation of the Claimant to support the conclusion that the act was done in
bad faith, or under coercion, threats or harassment against the investor or the investment.
Moreover, Claimant herself accepted in paragraph 124 of her Reply on the Merits (cited
in paragraph 370 above) that, once a bank is intervened, SBS has the power to determine
the amount of real capital of the intervened entity; the Claimant has also stated that she
does not question the authority of SBS to exercise this power; what she objects to is that a
certain amount for losses was arbitrarily assigned to BNM.*” This argument has been

dealt with by the Tribunal in paragraph 373 of the present award.

c. Sale of equity block

384. As regards the “encouragement and attempt to sell an equity block,” the
Claimant alleges that it “...constitutes a State’s action of coercion; such equity block
was made up of its most liquid assets, i.e. a customer portfolio that does not belong to the

State, using the CEPRE of BNM in favor of Banco Interamericano de Finanzas (BIF) and

139

exert pressure on the investor with the threat of BNM’s dissolution and liquidation.”°”°

The Respondent states that even if SBS were to sell the assets and liabilities of an
intervened bank as a block to another bank, SBS would still liquidate the unsold remnants
of the intervened bank, as was done with the NBK Bank, which was acquired by Banco
Financiero, and was placed thereafter in liquidation.*”” The Tribunal does not believe that
SBS pressured the investor with the “the threat of BNM’s dissolution and liquidation,°”*
it is of the opinion that it was not a threat, but the compliance of SBS with a legal
obligation ordering the dissolution and liquidation of an intervened bank. As Peru
notes,*”” the Special Transitory Regime functioned as a continuation of the intervention

580

regime and SBS had to fulfill the same legal mandate,” even when the bank’s assets

were sold, as it was the case of NBK Bank.

d. Dissolution

385. Regarding the “declaration of BNM dissolution without a valuation of the entire
equity,” the Claimant alleges bad faith on the part of the State in using the report of the
Arthur Andersen company, which refers specifically to an equity block as the basis for
the alleged integral valuation of BNM’s equity, even though the report states that the
company did not audit the financial statements of BNM, nor did it conduct a valuation of
its assets and liabilities.**' Peru states that SBS did not rely on the Arthur Andersen
valuation when it placed BNM in liquidation, since the decision to liquidate BNM had
nothing to do with BNM’s value, but with the legal provision requiring all intervened
banks to be liquidated so that any remaining assets can be disposed of.°* Article 105 of
the Banking Law effectively orders the dissolution of intervened banks after the legal
period of intervention has ended. Therefore, the Tribunal has no doubt that Peru was
required by law to dissolve and liquidate BNM and therefore bad faith cannot be

attributed to it because it obeyed a rule. The fact that SBS also took into account the

140

Arthur Andersen study at the time of ordering the dissolution and liquidation of BNM
does not alter the fact that it was obliged to act as it did and thus, SBS’s actions were not

taken in bad faith.

e. Criminal Prosecution

386. Regarding bad faith, coercion, threats, and harassment alleged by the Claimant
and demonstrated, according to her, by the “criminal prosecution against BNM’s

shareholders and managers,”***

the Tribunal notes the following: Article 358 of the
Banking Law imposes a clear obligation on the Superintendent. This obligation requires
that the Superintendent inform the prosecutors of “the criminal offences that have been
detected in the course of the inspections practiced on the institutions subject to its
control.” As the Superintendent is not a specialist in criminal law, the facts that seem
suspicious must be notified to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, where they will be
analyzed and a decision will be made as to whether they will be submitted to the judicial
authorities, which ultimately will determine whether these facts are criminal or not.
Again, the performance of a legal obligation by the Superintendent cannot be considered

an “action of coercion and harassment” of persons linked to BNM.
5. Due Process

387. As a final complaint regarding the standard of fair and equitable treatment, the
Claimant alleges that SBS violated the guarantee of due process and the right of defense.
The Claimant states that due process can be violated by both the administrative and the
judicial authorities and refers to the two following situations:*™ a) “lack of transparency
and violation of administrative due process in the regulatory variation,” and b) “grounds
of SBS Resolution No. 775-2001 that declared the dissolution of BNM based on a

resolution declared illegal and unconstitutional.”

a. Change in the regulations

58 Memorial on the Merits, | 622.
54 Thid., 44] 627 to 631.

141

388. In relation to the first allegation concerning the change in regulations, the
Claimant states that the enactment of the PCSF “involved the exclusion of the so-called
smaller banks” and was decided with an “absolute lack of transparency and violating the
due process as not all the parties involved in the banking and financial industry were
notified, nor were their opinions heard, as was the case of BNM, especially when it was
one the banks directly affected in its property, due to the State’s intention of transferring
the equity of the small banks in favor of the larger banks in Peru.”**° The Respondent’s
response is that BNM’s rights were not at issue in the enactment of the PCSF program,
which did not impose any requirements at all on any financial institutions. The PCSF
program simply aimed at benefitting those institutions that chose to participate in order to
facilitate voluntary mergers. “Thus, the PCSF decree had no impact on the vested
property interests of BNM’s shareholders, and they had no entitlement to participate in or
comment in advance upon it.”**°

389. Although the Claimant’s claim is made in an allegation of violation of due
process, in the Claimant’s Reply on the Merits she states in addition that “nothing could
justify a discriminatory treatment” in relation to PCSF. It is the opinion of the Tribunal
that the MEF’s notice of the meeting concerning the PCSF was only for information
purposes and was not intended to develop that program with the collaboration of the
invited banks. If the Peruvian Government had not published these regulations in the
Official Gazette, E/ Peruano, the Claimant could have alleged a violation of due process
because the regulatory changes would have been implemented without their prior
publication. Although one might have been convenient that the Peruvian authorities had
extended the invitation to all banks, the fact that they did not do so does not violate due
process; if BNM’s shareholders thought that they were affected by the published
regulations, they could have asked the authorities to enact the clarifications deemed
necessary or tried to challenge it by taking the appropriate legal action. Furthermore, it is
the opinion of the Tribunal that the Peruvian State may issue the regulations it deems

appropriate, without being obliged to consult possible stakeholders on the content

*85 Memorial on the Merits, §f] 628 and 629.
*8° Counter-Memorial on the Merits, § 361.

142

thereof.

b. Dissolution

390. The second argument of the Claimant in this matter was that the reduction of
BNM’s equity capital to zero was the basis for the dissolution of the bank, even though
the Judiciary had suspended the effectiveness of the administrative action in Resolution
No. 509-2001, which ordered that reduction, and therefore SBS violated administrative
due process.**” The Tribunal already issued its ruling on this matter in paragraph 347

above.

391. After reviewing all of the Claimant’s allegations concerning her claim of
violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Tribunal concludes that Peru
did not violate that principle by any of the actions of which the Claimant complains;

consequently the Claimant’s arguments in that respect will be dismissed.

392. The Tribunal shall now consider the arguments of the Claimant related to the

violation of the national treatment standard.

B. Violation of the National Treatment Standard

393. The parties appear to have reached some level of agreement on certain of the
elements that must be examined in order to determine whether there is a violation of the

national treatment standard as the Claimant alleges, namely:

a. Identification of the “comparator” and the concept of similar circumstances
(according to the Claimant); identification of one or more national entities that were

in circumstances similar to BNM (according to the Respondent);

b. Existence of unequal treatment and the lack of reasonable justification (according to
the Claimant); need for the Claimant to prove that BNM received less favorable

treatment than its national peers (according to the Respondent); and

*87 Memorial on the Merits, 630.

143

c. The irrelevance of the State’s intention (according to the Claimant); proof that the

State acted without reasonable justification (according to the Respondent).***

The Claimant compares BNM with BCP and Banco Wiese and refers to the Peruvian
Government’s reaction to rumors that were reported about the alleged insolvency of these
banks;**? the Claimant also compares BNM with Banco Wiese and Banco Latino, in
relation to the bailout measures.*”’ While the Claimant also compares the liquidity ratio
of Banco de Commercio with the one of BNM,*”! she does not substantiate what acts of
the State involved a more favorable treatment towards Banco de Comercio. The
Respondent disagrees with the Claimant with respect to the banks that the Claimant
used for comparison with BNM and points out the differences between them. The
Respondent also states that, in the end, the outcome for all these banks was the same,
that is, dissolution and liquidation; it further contends that the bank most comparable with

BNM is NBK Bank, the owners of which also lost their equity holding.*”

394, On the national treatment standard, the Tribunal considers necessary to review

Article 4 of the APPRI. The first paragraph of that Article states:

“Each Contracting Party grants, in its territory and sea areas, to nationals or
companies of the other party in matters regarding its investments and activities
related to these investments a treatment not less favorable than that accorded to its
nationals or companies, or the treatment accorded to nationals or companies of the
most favored nation if this latter is more favorable. In this regard, the nationals
authorized to work in the territory and sea area of one of the contracting parties
shall enjoy the material facilities appropriate for the exercise of their professional

activities.”
395. The Tribunal will first examine whether, indeed, there were similarities between

398.

the banks referred to by the Claimant, and will then determine if there was a more
favorable treatment granted to them than to BNM, in violation of the above-mentioned

Article 4.

396. In light of the parties’ agreement on the need to first identify the domestic entities

that were in similar circumstances with BNM, the Arbitral Tribunal considers, as noted

by other arbitral tribunals,*”

that discrimination only exists between groups or categories
of persons who are in a similar situation, after having assessed, on case-by-case basis, the
relevant circumstances. The banks cited by the Claimant are in the same sector (banking)
and are regulated by a common entity, the SBS. Notwithstanding this common
denominator, the Tribunal considers that, as the banking sector is a sensitive area for any
country, there are marked differences between the various banks operating in it. For
example, there are banks primarily engaged in asset management and investment, others
in corporate and consumer banking, such as BNM.°** The market segment in which a
bank is primarily engaged shows how different it is from other banks and determines

whether or not they are competitors.

In order to consider the consequences of a bank’s failure, one has to consider the
segment and the number of individuals affected, its market share, and other similar

factors.

Peru introduced into this proceeding several facts that in the Tribunal’s opinion
proof that BNM was not in like circumstances with Banco Wiese, BCP, and Banco
Latino. BCP was the first- and Banco Wiese the second-largest bank in Peru up to
November 2000 and together they accounted for 44 percent of the loans in this country
and 51 percent of deposits. In contrast, BNM had 4 percent of loans and 2 percent of
deposits up to November 2000.*”° These facts were not challenged by the Claimant and

are quite close to the figures she has presented about BNM: it was in sixth position in

terms of loans granted and deposits received (seventh by the end of 1999), with a market
share as of June 2000 of 4.5 percent (loans) and 2.8 percent (deposits).°”° Peru has also
stated that Banco Latino did not differ so much from BNM in terms of size but in terms
of its far-reaching network of individual depositors, which was not the case of BNM,
whose clientele mainly comprised companies, other banks, and State-owned
enterprises.*”’ These elements of comparison between these four banks are convincing in

the opinion of the Tribunal.

399. The criteria used by the Claimant were that BNM, BCP, and Banco Wiese were
companies in the same financial sector that developed their activities in mutual
competition.°*°* The Claimant's expert, Mr. Beaton, pointed out that BNM performed the
same functions as the other identified banks, that is, they provided similar financial
services, had a similar growth rate, and took similar risks. In addition, they also had the

same corporate clients as well as individual customers.°”

400. The Tribunal considers that the benchmarks criteria used by the Claimant are
very general. The Tribunal further notes that the Claimant has presented throughout the
proceedings different versions of BNM’s position in the Peruvian banking system:
sometimes BNM was part of the so-called “smaller banks,” at other times it was not in
that category and was a bank with systemic importance. To illustrate, the Tribunal will

refer to some of the Claimant’s statements:

a. The PCSF put in place merger mechanisms forcing smaller banks, including BNM,

to merge and despite the latter’s developing equity strength;%°

b. The enactment of the PCSF was designed jointly with the main largest banks of the

country, without the participation of the smaller banks, including BNM;°"!

c. The MEF ordered the withdrawal of public funds held as deposits in small banks,
such as BNM;°°2

d. “Set [sic] in December 1999, BNM was the sixth-largest bank by size in Peru. With a
market share of deposits of 2.3 percent and with assets making 3.4 percent of all
commercial banks in Peru. To contextualize this size, the size equivalent to BNM in
the United States would be an entity of a similar size to that of U.S. Bancorp, and

Citibank. Thus, the BNM was an institution with systemic importance;”°" and

e. “BNM indicators demonstrate objectively that the impairment of equity soundness
would implicitly entail a systemic risk, and in addition to that, it was not a small
bank, given the size it had achieved as of 1999 in terms of market share.”°*

401. Given the above, the Tribunal finds it impossible to determine the position of
BNM in the Peruvian banking system. Furthermore, the Tribunal cannot determine
whether BNM was comparable to other banks mentioned by the Claimant.
Consequently, it cannot analyze whether the treatment that the Peruvian Government
gave to these banks was different from that received by BNM. In the absence of
sufficient evidence, the Tribunal can only surmise that when there was a different

treatment, this was due to the existence of justifiable circumstances.

402. To complete the analysis of this issue, the Tribunal will transcribe what was said

by the Claimant in her post-hearing submission:

“it has been substantiated that the bailout schemes implemented by the State for
local banks, did not preclude the possibility of rescuing banks by way of a direct

or third-party contribution, and the permanence of some directors. The contrary

147

happened in the case of BNM, as the Banking Act underwent amendments

through Emergency Decrees days before BNM was intervened which established

new rules for bailout processes or bank interventions that ruled out any possibility
of keeping it afloat by its shareholders, and hence the only alternatives were either
the sale of assets or the dissolution and liquidation of the bank.”

403. The Tribunal fails to understand the Claimant’s argument, which suggests that
Peru amended the Banking Law through Emergency Decrees promulgated just before the
BNM intervention, in order to include new rules to rescue or intervene a bank. In
particular, the Tribunal could not determine if the Claimant’s argument is that the
legislation was amended only to harm BNM while for other banks such reforms were not

implemented.

404. In the light of foregoing, the Tribunal will reject the allegation of violation by

Peru of the national treatment standard in relation to BNM.

405. In the next section the Tribunal will consider the Claimant’s argument that Peru

did not provide full protection and security for her investment.

Cc. Refusal to Provide Full Protection and Security

406. The Tribunal fully agrees with the description made by the Claimant that the
standard of full protection and security has gone from referring to mere physical security

and has evolved to include, more generally, the rights of investors.°°°

407. The APPRI regulates the guarantee of full protection and security in paragraph 1
of Article 5, which states: “The investments made by nationals or companies of one
contracting party shall enjoy broad and full protection and security in the territory and in

the sea area of the other contracting party.”

408. The Claimant states that, in her case, the denial of justice originated in the lack of

95 Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, § 138.

96 Memorial on the Merits, § 675 to 676.

148

a fair judicial system and failure to comply with the Peruvian courts’ judgments.

409. In relation to the alleged failure by SBS to comply with judicial decisions, the

Claimant states that “... these Court Decisions ordered the restitution of BNM’s

shareholders’ right to recover an effective participation in the capital equity of BNM.

Despite the declaration of inapplicability of SBS Resolution 509-2001 by the Judiciary,

SBS used such resolution as the grounds to illegally and unconstitutionally declare

BNM’s liquidation and dissolution.”°””

410. The Tribunal studied carefully the judgments dated October 23, 2002 and August
11, 2003 in which it was determined that Resolution SBS 509-2001 was inapplicable and
that SBS could not issue another resolution. Both judgments recognized SBS’s power to
determine the capital of the intervened company, the shareholders’ right to challenge the
decisions of SBS, and the right to rule on any surplus that may belong to them. The
Tribunal finds, therefore, that Resolution 509-2001 was declared inapplicable by the
judgments and that the shareholders of BNM, once the process of liquidation had come to
an end, could participate in the surplus. The Tribunal therefore concludes that there has
been no failure to comply with those judgments at this time. The Tribunal also addressed

this issue in paragraph 347 above.

411. The Claimant cites the following from the “Harvard Draft Convention on the
International Responsibility of States for Damage done in their Territory to the Person or
Property of Foreigners”: “Denial of justice exists when there is a denial, unwarranted
delay, or obstruction of access to courts, gross deficiency in the administration of judicial
or remedial process, failure to provide those guarantees that are generally considered
indispensable to the proper administration of justice, or a manifestly unjust judgment.”°*

412. In connection with the above quotation, the Tribunal considers it useful to point

out the following:

7 Thid., § 693.
68 Tbid., § 683.

149

a. The Claimant did not allege that she was prevented from submitting her claims in
Peru;
b. Nor did she demonstrate that there was any undue delay in judicial proceedings

brought by her;

c. Nor did she allege or demonstrate that she was prevented from accessing the courts,

which clearly dealt with her requests;

d. She did not prove any serious deficiency in the administration of justice, such as, for
example, lack of notice of decisions, refusal to hold hearings, or denial of the right to

be heard;

e. She did not indicate which of her fundamental guarantees were breached during the

legal proceedings she filed in Peru; and

f. While she has stated that some judgments of the Judiciary were unfair, she did not
explain in what sense they were, nor did she present evidence to support her

statement.

413. In paragraph 380, the Tribunal left open the examination of the Claimant’s other
arguments because they are closely linked to the claims discussed in this section. These

shall be examined now.

414. The Claimant alleges that Peruvian law does not provide efficient remedies
against decisions of some organs. She states that there are no efficient and immediate
administrative or judicial remedies against the withdrawal of funds by the State; the
intervenor’s actions; the resolution declaring BNM’s intervention; or the resolution
ordering the reduction of BNM’s equity capital and declaring BNM’s dissolution. The
Claimant also argues that there are no administrative remedies to directly challenge these
actions. The only choice is to have recourse to court action (except against the

withdrawal of the funds, which may not be challenged even in court), but this is not an

150

efficient, adequate, and immediate solution. The Claimant insists that the courts are not
efficient because the proceedings are public and thus affect the customer’s trust in the
investor. In addition, they take very long. The administrative contentious action brought
by the NMH lasted around six years; the decision of the Supreme Court Chamber was
unfair, inadequate, and ineffective. According to the Banking Law, the assets acquired by
third parties in good faith during the intervention regime may not be subject to a court

challenge, so there is no means to challenge actions of disposal of equity.°”

415. Peru does not deny that in law there is no administrative procedure to challenge
certain of SBS’s acts, such as those indicated by the Claimant. It adds that “there is no
generally accepted norm requiring a State to provide administrative review of
administrative actions, nor is such administrative review considered indispensable to the
administration of justice.”°"°

416. The Tribunal agrees with Peru in that there is no obligation for States to provide
for administrative review of decisions of their organs or entities. Possibly because of this
lack of remedies for administrative review, BNM’s shareholders had, since 2000, brought
various civil and constitutional proceedings against several decisions issued by SBS, in
each of which their claims received due process. The Tribunal is aware that in at least one
of those legal proceedings, NMH requested provisional measures in order to replace the
BNM intervenors with judicially appointed administrators and that request was initially
resolved in its favor.°'' The Tribunal concludes that the Peruvian judicial system does

provide remedies to protect the rights of persons subject to its jurisdiction in this area.

417. As stated in paragraph 231 above, the Claimant considers that the standard
analyzed in this section has been violated in that BNM and its investors did not have
access “to a fair and predictable dispute settlement system.” The Tribunal finds that the
Claimant did not prove this assertion nor explained why, in her opinion, the decisions

issued by the courts in civil and constitutional litigation were unfair and unpredictable.

151

418. The Claimant also alleges that she had no access to a judicial system where
decisions were enforced fully and in a timely manner by the Peruvian Government’s
agencies. This argument is discussed in paragraphs 429 et seq. of this Award, along with

others that the Claimant raised in paragraph 693 of her Memorial on the Merits.

419. The Claimant also states that there was “wrongful conduct attributable to the
judicial system and to the State,” and that in Peru the only purpose of the administrative
contentious action is to challenge the formal aspects of the administrative action at issue
not the merits of a case. She states that the Judiciary must be truly effective and therefore
she “denounces and proves that the conduct of the Peruvian State and its Judiciary

violated the Peru-France BIT, in particular the ‘full protection and security’ standard.”°?

420. The Claimant further argues that the Judiciary “... may lack the technical or
professional expertise to contend the State’s ‘truth’... making the Court review option

in[to] a formal remedy but inefficient for the investor’s rights,”°>

adding that an
administrative contentious action only focuses on issues of form rather than on the merits

of the case.°'*

421. The Claimant stated that in the Peruvian Administrative Contentious via it is not
possible to examine the merits of the matters. The Tribunal considers that, even if truae—
which it considers unnecessary to determine—that feature of the Peruvian judicial system
is not per se a violation of the APPRI, nor of any international legal standard. Besides,
the Claimant failed to prove that the fact that the Peruvian judicial system is formal and
not really effective nor in which way the Peruvian State and that system violated the

APPRI, and particularly the standard of full protection and security.

422. In support of its argument that the Peruvian judicial system is not effective, the

61S

Claimant cites Article 10 of the Administrative Proceedings Act,”’° which enlists the

grounds for annulment of administrative acts. The grounds are focused on the formal

152

aspects of the administrative acts and as a result, the Claimant argues that the Peruvian
courts were not in a position to review the merits of the Resolutions issued by SBS

declaring BNM’s intervention and dissolution.

423. The Claimant also cites an article by Mr. Alexis Mourre entitled “Some
comments on the denial of justice in public and private international law after Loewen

and Saipen”®'®

[Algunos comentarios sobre la denegacion de justicia en el derecho
internacional piblico y privado después de Loewen y Saipen] which must be considered
in context and not in isolation. This author states: “... international law imposes on States
the obligation of having a judicial system whereto any person may have effective, not
only technical, access to justice... As a matter of principle, by not exercising the remedies
available under the local judicial system, the victim loses the right to claim that such a
system does not comply with the international obligations of the State to which she

9617
[

belongs. Tribunal’s translation]

424. The quotations in the previous paragraph refer to a situation in which an error or a
failure of a judicial system can generate a denial of justice, because it is not capable of
being rectified by existing remedies, that is, an error by a court that the judicial system
does not allow a higher court to correct. As explained below, in the opinion of the
Arbitral Tribunal, there is no similarity between the allegations of the Claimant and the
situation to which the cited author refers. The Claimant provides the following evidence
regarding the Peruvian court proceedings: i) the judgment of the Superior Court of Lima
issued in Case number 3787-2001 of the Sixty-Third Civil Court of Lima, constitutional
judgment of October 23, 2002 (Exhibit III-7); ii) the judgment of the Superior Court of
Lima delivered in Case number 1794-2002 of the Third Civil Chamber, Judgment of
August 11, 2003 (Exhibit III-8); iii) the judgment of the Constitutional Court issued in
Case number 1219-2003-HD/TC, constitutional ruling of January 21, 2004, (Exhibit III-
9); iv) the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Republic issued in Case number 473-
2001/LIMA by the Permanent Civil Chamber, judgment of November 11, 2005 (Exhibit
III-10); and v) the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Republic issued in Case number

°'6 Claimant’s Exhibit VII-20.
°'7 Thid., page 51.

153

509-2006/LIMA of the Constitutional and Social Permanent Courtroom, judgment of
October 11, 2006 (Exhibit III-12). In relation to such evidence, the Tribunal notes that the
last judgment was issued in an administrative contentious dispute on appeal, in which
NMH appealed the lower court ruling. The first recital of this judgment states: “the
administrative contentious action under Article 148 of the Constitution is aimed at legal
control by the Judiciary of the actions of the public administration subject to
administrative law and the effective protection of the rights and interests of any person
subject thereto.” [Tribunal’s translation] It is clear that in the proceeding in which these
judgments were issued there was no such gross denial of justice, as referred to by Mr.
Mourre. This Tribunal also notes that NMH requested that SBS Resolution number 775-
2001 (on BNM’s dissolution) be declared invalid, and that all administrative actions
contained in that resolution be declared invalid. This also contradicts the argument of the
Claimant that BNM and its representatives did not enjoy legal protection. Additionally,

the Tribunal finds that these court rulings demonstrate access to justice in Peru.

425. In short, in the opinion of the Tribunal, neither the Claimant’s arguments nor the
evidence provided by her support her assertions about the inability of the Peruvian legal
system to correct its errors or the alleged inadequacy of the administrative contentious

courts.

426. The Claimant did not prove that the Peruvian courts “lack the technical or

professional expertise to contend the State’s ‘truth.’”°'*

427. The Claimant also bases her argument regarding the alleged lack of defense on

her inability to obtain the evidence she needed. She states:

“The same may be said with regard to SBS’s repeated contempt of court, reflected
on a number of resolutions, for as long as they were effective, that ordered

BNM’s shareholders furnish information related to BNM’s liquidation and

“8 Reply on the Merits, 488.

154

dissolution process (JLevy [8,...).”"°"”

428. Paragraph 8 of the Witness Statement of Mr. Levy, to which the Claimant refers,

does not prove the alleged failure of SBS to provide her with the information;® it is a
simple statement that the Levy family made efforts to access some documentation on

BNM in which it was interested.

429. In relation to the allegation that BNM and its investors were unable to access a

judicial system impervious to public pressures exerted by the main Branches of

621

Government,” the Tribunal understands that this is the same allegation the Claimant

made in the Request for Arbitration, in which she states:

“political power interfered with the neutrality and impartiality of the Supreme
Court, forced to declare unfounded the lawsuit instituted by the vehicle company
Nuevo Mundo Holding S.A. ... as is seen from the Decision of the Constitutional
and Social Courtroom, of the Supreme Court on 11.10.2006. In other words, the
Judiciary upheld the SBS resolution ordering the illegal liquidation of BNM.”°

[Tribunal’s translation]

430. Moreover, in the Memorial on the Merits the Claimant refers to an “open and

illegal interference by the President of the Republic of Peru and the President of
Congress, as well as by SBS Superintendent (see video appended to the Request for
Registration), which, acting together, in 2007 offered on one same day public
declarations to the media, with the single and clear goal of influencing the final result of
the Administrative Contentious Action in Court, which had been filed by BNM’s
shareholders against SBS Resolution 775-2001 that ordered BNM liquidation and

dissolution.”

431. The Claimant argues that the above-mentioned Decision of October 11, 2006
“*.. was not a simple legal error exempting the State from responsibility, but the Supreme
Court favored SBS’s position overlooking all the analysis, sufficient motivation [sic] and
reference to BNM’s shareholders’ arguments.”°*

432. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the Claimant’s assertion that the alleged
interference of public officials referred to in paragraph 429 above, which, according to
her, occurred in 2007 may have influenced a Decision issued in 2006, does not make any

chronological sense.

433. The Arbitral Tribunal is not, nor can it be, a form of appeal against the judgments
of the courts of Peru. However, the Tribunal will refer to some aspects of the Decision
issued on October 11, 2006 by the Constitutional and Social Permanent Court of the
Supreme Court of Justice of Peru. The Arbitral Tribunal is mindful not to review that
Decision, but will evaluate the arguments of the Claimant that said Decision overlooks
all the analysis, and lacks sufficient motivation and reference to BNM’s shareholders’
arguments (paragraph 431 above), and that this proves the influence of and interference

from the other Branches of the Peruvian Government.

434. The Decision sets out the facts as requested by NMH; it quotes the rules
applicable to the case; discusses the four allegations of NMH; gives reasons and explains
why, on each occasion, the Supreme Court considered that the wrongs raised by the
claimant were unfounded; notes that the remaining wrongs did not impact on the
rendered Decision because they are repetitions, and mentions the rules on which the
Courtroom decided to “record in its Decision only the essential principles on which it is
based.” [Tribunal’s translation] It also indicates which facts were not proven by NMH; it
analyzes the approaches of the Chief Prosecutor of Administrative Contentious Actions

and, in its dispositive paragraphs, declares unfounded the claim brought by NMH.

435. For these reasons, the Tribunal considers unfounded the Claimant’s allegations

4 Tid., | 693 (iv).
156

that this judgment overlooks “all the analysis, sufficient motivation [sic] and reference to

BNM’s shareholders’ arguments.”

436. On the same subject, the Claimant alleges another type of pressure on the
Judiciary. She notes that the dates on which the statements referred to in paragraph 429
above were issued, the Congress of the Republic of Peru empowered the Executive
Branch by law to suspend pay increases for the Justices of the Supreme Court where the
request of NMH was being examined. The Claimant explains that, on September 27,
2006 the full Congress passed a bill that would reduce the remuneration of Supreme
Court “Vocales”. Following the approval of that bill it would be submitted to the
“President of the Republic, who has constitutional powers to veto the bill.”°° The
Claimant states that the press referred to these pressures and she submits a number of

newspaper articles that were issued at that time.

437. The Claimant also states that, on October 3, 2006, the Peruvian Congress passed
a bill that would reduce the monthly remuneration of the Supreme Court “Vocales”. On
October 11, the Constitutional and Social Courtroom of the Supreme Court of Justice of
Peru delivered the judgment cited above, and on October 24 the President of Peru vetoed
the bill “as a reward to the docile behavior of the Supreme Court to his earlier
warnings.”””°

438. The Claimant states that “[t]he Supreme Court, misusing its powers and violating
the right to effective judicial protection, interpreted in a restrictive manner a judgment
affirmed by an appellate court, issued in a court proceeding different from the case it was
trying. The excess committed by the Tribunal illegally distorted the meaning of the
rulings that favored NMH in the process it filed against the illegal reduction of BNM’s

capital to zero.”°”

439. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the Claimant made serious claims without

5 Tid., 9§ 473 and 474.
6 Tbid., J 481.
7 Tbid., § 480.

157

explaining or substantiating them; besides, she did not indicate how the Court exceeded
its powers or illegally modified what had been decided, “in a court proceeding different

from the case it was trying.”

440. In relation to the bill that was discussed in 2006 by which the wages of the
Justices of the Court would be reduced, the Tribunal reviewed the newspaper articles that

the Claimant provided, and observed the following:

a. It was the President of the Supreme Court who asked the President of the Republic to

“comply with” the law in question.

b. The President of the Court told the media that “we are not averse to austerity... .
The head of the Judiciary also said he agreed with judicial reform but that Congress
cannot do it unilaterally, given that it must respect the autonomy of the Judiciary. We
hope that the Congress will invite us to participate in discussions that are taking place
because, if it is going to legislate for us, obviously it should invite us to

participate.”°*

[Tribunal’s translation]

441. It follows from these newspaper articles that judicial reform was being carried out
in Peru at the time that included the budget issue, as stated by the President of the
Supreme Court, referring to austerity and judicial reforms. For these reasons, and because
of the lack of proper evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the
reform referred to by the Claimant was intended to pressure the Judiciary to decide

against BNM’s shareholders.

442. BNM had been operating in Peru since 1993. Mr. Jacques Levy, Executive
President of BNM, is an experienced banker who not only knew the banking business but
also the institutional reality of that country. When investors created BNM they counted
not only on his experience and knowledge of the Peruvian reality but—as always in these
cases—on the advices from various professionals, including lawyers, who knew the

legislative structure of the country and, especially, the Judicial Branch. So these investors

8 Claimant’s Exhibit V-53.

158

knew that, as happens in other countries, this system had its own peculiarities, strengths
and weaknesses. For these reasons, this Tribunal cannot endorse the Claimant’s
statements that sometimes denigrate the Judiciary of the Republic of Peru, calling it
corrupt, subject to influences from other Branches of Government, incompetent,
inefficient and slow, and at other times refer repeatedly to the failure to comply with the
decisions rendered by the courts of that Judiciary that decided in her favor. The investors
that founded BNM were familiar with the organization of the Judiciary in Peru, which,
as in other countries, has its virtues and faults. The Claimant cannot claim now that this
Arbitral Tribunal, under the pretext of the alleged violations of the APPRI, should

examine the decisions of the Judicial Branch and its very organizational structure.

443. This Tribunal cannot rule therefore, based on the evidence submitted, that the
actions of the Legislative and Executive Branches affected the impartiality of the Judges
who delivered the judgment of October 11, 2006, or the alleged violations of the APPRI
of which the Claimant accused the Judiciary of the Republic of Peru.

D. Indirect Expropriation

444. The Claimant cites paragraph 2 of Article 5 of the APPRI, which provides that
“{njeither Contracting Party shall nationalize or expropriate or take any measure
depriving, directly or indirectly, nationals or legal persons of the other Contracting Party,
from their investments made in its territory or in its maritime area, unless such measures
are in the public interest, provided that these measures are not discriminatory, or against a
particular commitment of one of the Contracting Parties towards the nationals or legal
persons of the other Contracting Party. Expropriation measures that may be adopted shall
cause prompt and adequate compensation [...]”°°

445. The Claimant alleges the existence of a “creeping expropriation” from SBS’s
extended visit in August 2000 until the declaration of BNM’s dissolution. SBS’s visit in
August 2000 was discussed in paragraph 382 above, where the Tribunal concluded that

the said visit was not long, it was not made in bad faith, under coercion, threats or

°° Memorial on the Merits, 4] 702.

159

harassment against the investor or the investment, and the Claimant did not prove that it

was the cause of the speculation or rumors about BNM’s precarious financial situation.

446. The Claimant also alleges that the effects of the indirect expropriation were
increased by the following actions: SBS’s second Inspection Visit; SBS’s failure to
neutralize the rumors; the impairment of the loan portfolio under the intervention;
reduction of BNM’s equity capital; lack of an overall valuation of BNM’s equity when
the decision to dissolve BNM was being made; and the lack of legal and technical reports
during the period BNM was under intervention that would support the reclassification of
the portfolio and the need for higher provisions.°° The Tribunal determined that there is
no proof that the SBS was aware, before December 4, 2000, of the rumors about BNM
(paragraph 333 above). In paragraph 339 of this Award, the Tribunal stated that it was
not possible to determine if indeed there was an impairment of the loan portfolio during
the intervention; regarding Resolution SBS 509-2001 ordering the reduction of BNM’s
equity capital to zero, the Tribunal made its observations with respect to the fact that the
Resolution was declared inapplicable by the Peruvian courts (paragraphs 349 and 412
above). In paragraph 373 above, the Tribunal noted that the Arthur Andersen study was
not the basis for the dissolution of BNM. In relation to the reclassification of BNM’s
portfolio, the Tribunal analyzed the matters relating to accounting practices in paragraphs
350 to 359 of this Award. Below is an analysis of the circumstances that occurred during

the last days of BNM.

447. The Claimant alleges that, with the administrative declaration of liquidation and

631

dissolution of BNM, the loss of investment was total and irreversible. It is therefore

essential to analyze why BNM reached the stage of dissolution and liquidation.

448. On December 5, 2000, BNM came under the intervention regime; on April 18,
2001, BNM was subjected to the Special Transitional Regime; on October 18 of that year

that Regime was terminated, for that bank and its dissolution and liquidation was ordered.

60 Thid., 710.
! Thid., | 726.

160

449. According to Article 104 of the Banking Law, the grounds for intervention in a

bank are:

“1, Suspension of payment of their obligations;

2. Non-compliance during the surveillance procedure, with the commitments
assumed in the agreed recovery plan or with the regulations of the
Superintendency in accordance with the provisions of Title V of this section;

3. In the case of companies of the financial system, whenever positions subject to
credit risk or market risk represent twenty-five (25) times more than the total
effective equity;

4. Loss or reduction by more than 50% of the effective equity; and

5.2.2".

450. Article 106 of the same law determines the consequences of the intervention:

“The following are unavoidable effects of the intervention procedure, and they
shall prevail for as long as it lasts:

1. The competence of the shareholders' meeting shall be limited exclusively to the
issues dealt with in this chapter;

2. The suspension of the company’s business;

3. The application of the necessary portion of the company's subordinate debt, if
applicable, to absorb the losses, after having complied with the provisions of
Point 1 of Article 107;

4. The application of the prohibitions contained in Article 116, as from the
publication of the resolution determining the submission to the intervention
procedure; and

5. Other steps which the Superintendency may deem relevant to ensure

compliance with the provisions of this chapter.”

451. Article 114 of the Banking Law provides:

“Companies comprising the financial system and the insurance system shall be

161

dissolved by substantiated resolution of the Superintendency due to the following
reasons: 1. The case referred to in Article 105 of the Law...” In the same article,
the consequences are indicated: “... the company shall cease to be subject of
credit, shall be exempted from any future taxes and shall not be subject to the
obligations prescribed by the Law for active companies, including the payment of

fees to the Superintendency.”

452. In this case, the declaration of intervention was based on paragraph | of Article
104, as BNM was excluded from the Electronic Clearinghouse in Peru, as it had not
settled its multilateral liability. “Banco Nuevo Mundo was a multilateral debtor of
US$9.2 million in foreign currency and S/. 4.1 billion in local currency, while the
balances in its current accounts at the Bank amounted to US$0.1 million and S/. 1.8
million, respectively. As a result, Banco Nuevo Mundo had a deficit of US$9.1 million
and S/. 2.3 million.”° [Tribunal’s translation] This was not denied by the Claimant in
this arbitration. What the Claimant alleged repeatedly is that the Bank had a temporary
liquidity problem that was caused by the Respondent and that the latter did not help to
solve it. Therefore, the Tribunal will review what happened to BNM before the

intervention.

453. The Claimant states that “[t]he arbitrariness of the measure is conspicuous
because it is an instance, as it is known in international law, of a measure that exceeds the
regulatory framework of Peru.”®* She notes that “the concept of arbitrariness suggests a
decision that is not based on justice, law, or reason, but on personal preference or,
essentially, caprice or the unlimited use of power.”° She identifies the following
arbitrary actions: a second inspection visit carried out by SBS; SBS’s omission to counter
the rumors; impairment of the portfolio during the intervention; the reduction of BNM’s
equity capital to zero; the lack of valuation of BNM?’s equity when the decision to
dissolve BNM was being made; and the irregular accounting practice applied by

intervenors in order to justify the negative equity of the bank. Each of these events was

°° Claimant’s Exhibit [V-9; Respondent’s Exhibit R-072.
° Memorial on the Merits, | 743.
 Tbid., 745.

162

discussed earlier in this Award and nowhere did the Tribunal find arbitrariness, bad faith,
coercion, abuse of power, injustice, absence of law, personal preference, or unlimited

exercise of power by the Peruvian authorities.

454. Peru claims that the shareholders’s investment in BNM had lost its value before
the Bank was intervened and that the Bank was already insolvent in June 2000. By the
time of the intervention, BNM was not solvent and had such a liquidity crisis that it could
no longer cover the checks it had issued or fulfill its obligations to its customers.
Therefore, on December 5, 2000 BNM’s managers closed the bank hours before SBS
intervened in BNM. According to Peru, because the investment was worth nothing, it
had no economic value of which BNM’s shareholders could have been deprived.**° Peru
adds that investors’ vested rights are not absolute and unconditional, but are subject to
limitations, and in the present case, all banks were subject to the same legal framework

with which the shareholders of BNM should have been familiar.°°°

455. Mr. Arnaldo Alvarado, who oversaw the PwC audit of the annual financial
statements of BNM from 1997 to 2000, made the following clear in his January 30, 2012
written statement on the audit procedure: audits begin in August or September with a
discussion with the management of the company to plan the audit, and with a review of
the company’s internal financial controls and a review of the company’s preliminary
financial statements. In December, the auditors review the updated financial statements
and this process is usually complete by the second quarter of the following year. The
procedure follows the standards set in SBS regulations, otherwise the “International
Accounting Standards” (IAS), as approved by the Accounting Standards Board [Consejo
Normativo de Contabilidad], and, lastly, the “United States Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles” (USA GAAP).7

456. During the preliminary review of BNM’s financial statements of 2000, PwC
identified several problems showing that there were losses that BNM had not reported in

its financial statements. Among the problems identified were the following: discrepancies
in classifying the risk of borrowers; lack of documentation for consumer loans and
mortgage loans; refinanced loans recorded as current (“vigentes”); failure to properly
value deteriorating investment assets; no inventory of fixed assets; deficit of loss
provisions for recovered, but not yet sold, collateral assets; expenses that should be fully
realized; inconsistency in accounting for debts owed to other banking entities; and need
to reevaluate the “goodwill” from BNM’s merger with Banco del Pais. In total PwC

identified unrecorded losses of $/. 121.5 million.©*

Mr. Alvarado also explained that the
audit uncovered losses in addition to those identified during the preliminary analysis and

the SBS Inspection Visit Report of August-October 2000.°°
457. Mr. Alvarado specifically indicated in his first Witness Statement that:

“PwC’s audit identified extensive losses and recommended to BNM ‘In
Intervention’ (that is, to the SBS intervenors) that those losses should be reflected
in BNM’s financial statements as of December 31, 2000. The SBS intervenors
agreed with and implemented PwC’s recommendations. In total, based on PwC’s
recommendations and the intervenors’ implementation of those recommendations,
the final financial statements showed that BNM had S/. -329 million in losses as

of 31 December 2000.”™°

458. The Respondent explains that BNM could not continue to participate in the loan
portfolio exchange program after it was intervened (paragraph 40 above) because it
would no longer be able to reacquire the loans in the future (Article 4 of Supreme Decree
099-99-EF, which created the Loan Portfolio and Treasury Bond Exchange Program).""!

Therefore BNM?’s contract with the Government was terminated the day after the

intervention and the loans were placed back onto BNM’s balance sheet, along with the

requirement to increase its loan loss provisions. The result of this was that S/. 65 million

was required to cover the risk of those loans.”

459. The Respondent further explains that, during its inspection visit of August-
October 2000 to BNM, SBS only examined 58 percent of that Bank’s loan portfolio,
while PwC examined hereafter in the final audit of BNM’s financial statements of 2000,

nearly all of BNM’s documentation.“

460. The Tribunal notes that, in accordance with paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 on page 14
and 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 on page 15 of the Applicable SBS Regulations in the Financial
System for the Assessment and Classification of Debtors and Requirement of Loan Loss
Reserves, restructured and refinanced loans are recorded in a higher-risk category.“
Thus, additional loan loss provisions should be allocated to account for the risk of non-

645

payment.””° This is also in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 132 of the Banking

Law, a provision that enumerates several mechanisms to reduce the depositors’ risks.

461. The Respondent’s expert witness, Mr. Kaczmarek, exhibits in his report™® the
following tables showing the data from the SBS Inspection Reports that were issued from

1997 to 2000:

The Respondent indicates that, to hide the impairment of its loan portfolio and

loans and recorded them as “current” loans.“” The Tribunal confirmed in paragraphs 43,

44, 52, 60, 71, and 72 above that during the years 1999 and 2000 SBS had informed
BNM of the existence of situations involving non-compliance with the applicable
regulations (Circular B-2017-98 and Resolution SBS No. 572-97). In addition, in 1999
BNM was fined because in the 1997 and 1998 reports SBS found that BNM refinanced

transactions not recorded as such in the accounts, but rather as new loans (paragraph 47

of this Award).

464.

The Respondent states in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits that BNM used

“7” Counter-Memorial on the Merits, 4 38.

166

 

 

other tactics to hide the overdue loans in its loans portfolio. The first tactic was related to
the “overdraft,” through which a borrower of the Bank could charge repayment of its
loan, even though the bank account had an insufficient balance. Thus, the overdue loans
appeared as paid on time and the borrower’s bank account had a negative balance equal
to the amount of the unpaid loan.°“* The second tactic had to do with the leaseback
operations, where BNM would purchase an asset from a delinquent borrower to cancel an
overdue loan and then lease the asset back to the same borrower at terms that were
similar to the original loan. This way, BNM was recording the overdue loans as closed
and paid and the leasing operations as new and normal loans, thus removing risky
overdue loans from its books.°”

465. On October 12, 2000, SBS expressed to BNM its concerns as regards the
refinanced operations classified as current loans and requested information on the
corrective measures that would be taken; BNM’s Risk and International Manager
responded to that communication and accepted SBS’s findings (paragraph 64 of this
Award).

466. The Claimant indicates in her Reply on the Merits that her expert witness, Mr.
Dujovne, stated that “Banco Nuevo Mundo was an institution with adequate levels of
liquidity and solvency... showed a better performance than the industry average. Neither
BNM indicators nor the performance of the SBS, nor its risk rating, nor the perception
that sophisticated bank depositors held of the bank, support the hypothesis that this entity
showed the problems that Mr. Powell (Peru’s expert) suggested in his report.”°° The
Claimant challenges the US$22.43 million loan loss provisions required by SBS at the
end of October 2000, which amount is radically different from the US$220 million deficit
in BNM’s loan loss provisions according to SBS at the end of the 2000 accounting
year.°°' She criticizes the method used by SBS during its visits, since that institution
makes a 100 percent projection, but despite that method, in this case, SBS said it needed

to intervene in BNM to appraise the portfolio based on 100 percent of BNM’s

portfolio.** She states that there was no technical basis for arguing that, with a trend
based on the findings during SBS’s visit, it could not determine whether a bank was
insolvent.°* She also indicates, based on the words of her expert witnesses, Mr. Zapata
and Mr. Leyva,°™ that “the 1998 and 1999 reports issued by SBS at no time warn[ed]
about an impairment of BNM’s equity placing it in a state of insolvency, let alone show

any evidence that SBS adopted any measures on this regard.”° s

467. The Claimant also refers to the reports from the SBS visits of 1998, 1999, and
2000. Regarding the first report, the Claimant concludes that the provisions deficit was
seven percent of BNM’s equity, which did not affect BNM’s financial strength.°° With
regard to the 1999 report, the Claimant further states that the reclassification of accounts
made by SBS showed that the credit risk of customers with the largest debt owed to
BNM was minimal and states that the effect on assets was covered by BNM and did not
affect its operational capacity in the market.’ As regards the April 2000 report, the
Claimant contends that SBS did not detect discrepancies or increased provision
requirements that could cause a deficit that would affect equity.°* As regards the
November 2000 report, she states that the provisions deficit identified by SBS had been
“fully covered by BNM.”°® She claims that the deficit “did not entail in any manner
whatsoever a situation of insolvency for BNM.”°° The Claimant concludes that these
reports showed no evidence whatsoever that BNM was financially unviable or insolvent
and that, according to the Accounting Audit Report prepared by her witnesses, Messrs.
Jaime Vizcarra and Justo Manrique, BNM’s “stock capital had grown at higher rates than

the gross national product of Peru.”°!

468. In connection with the November 2000 SBS report, the Tribunal considers it
necessary to reiterate that Mr. Jacques Levy, at the hearing on November 13, 2012, stated
that he agreed with all the findings of SBS in that report. In his statement he said:
“When it was my administration, I agreed with the information and all the findings of the
Superintendents, everything.”°

469. Peru states that the Claimant’s arguments set forth in her Reply on the Merits
were based on financial data deliberately distorted to hide the true condition of BNM.°™*
It notes that, although SBS examined only part of BNM’s loan portfolio, it estimated that
57% of the loans of that bank were risky. According to the information provided by

° Peru affirms that:

BNM to SBS only 25% of its portfolio was in such condition.”
“[bJecause BNM failed to record the appropriate amount of risky loans, BNM also failed
to record the appropriate amount of loan loss provisions... As a result, BNM had been
overstating its income. Not only do loan loss provisions have an immediate impact on a
bank’s income, they also impact a bank’s capital. This is because a bank’s capital can be

increased by the amount of profit that the bank earns and retains as capital.”°°°

470. Peru claims that “as a result of BNM’s underestimating the riskiness of its
borrowers and not registering the appropriate amount of loan loss provisions, BNM’s
self-reported income was inflated, and ... its self-reported capital was much higher than it
should have been.”*” These findings, according to Peru, undermine the assertions of the
Claimant and her experts, Mr. Leyva and Mr. Zapata. According to the information
reported by BNM (and on which Mr. Leyva and Mr. Zapata relied in his report), that
Bank “had a loan loss provision coverage of 100.7 percent as of June 30, 2000... thus Mr.
Leyva concludes that BNM had loan loss provisions worth more than the value of its
overdue loans and more than similarly sized banks.”°* However, SBS determined in its

2000 inspection that BNM’s loan loss provision coverage was 62.4 percent, while the

average of similar sized banks was 88.4 percent coverage.
471. In addition to Peru’s arguments in the preceding paragraphs, the Tribunal
considers it important to point out what PwC said on December 27, 2000, when it

delivered its progress report on the audit performed:

“In our preliminary evaluation of the Bank’s portfolio at September 30, 2000,

with a sample of 110 clients, we have determined discrepancies in the ratings of

52 debtors. This situation could create a provision deficit for loans at that date of

approximately S/. 47,8 16,000.”°7°

472. In this Progress Report, PwC also referred to several heads of loss, the total of
which was fully detailed in Mr. Arnaldo Alvarado’s first written witness statement of
January 30, 2012, in which he pointed out BNM’s total losses as of September 30, 2000

were S/. 121.5 million.°7!

473. The Tribunal concludes, in relation to the content of the preceding paragraphs,
that BNM did not fully comply with the banking regulations of Peru concerning loan loss
provision requirements, and that it is true that during the inspection visits by SBS officers
from 1997 to 2000 the problems already indicated were detected. However, it was in the
audit conducted by PwC (which began its relationship with BNM when the latter was
operating under normal operating conditions and ended when the bank was intervened) in

2000 that the real value of the provisions and BNM’s losses were able to be determined.

474. In view of the facts stated in the preceding paragraphs, the Tribunal concludes
that the intervention was necessary because, ultimately, BNM breached its obligations
and often violated the regulations contained in the Banking Law and other related legal
provisions. While it is true that the Tribunal cannot state with certainty that BNM was

bankrupt since June 2000, it is of the opinion that it is clear that, at that time, the bank

170

was burdened with serious problems that SBS had been pointing out in its reports, which
PwC substantiated and even confirmed the existence of other, bigger problems. Based
on this evidence, the Tribunal concludes that in December 2000, BNM was not a solvent
bank and that, in accordance with the Banking Law, SBS had to intervene in the bank.
Subsequently, SBS, by way of PwC’s audit, determined that BNM had losses of S/.
328,875,366.91 and it was therefore not possible for it to continue in the Special
Transitional Regime. Given that the circumstances for rehabilitation were not present,
SBS proceeded, also in compliance with the Banking Law, to the dissolution and

liquidation of BNM.

475. In relation to the Claimant’s claim that BNM was indirectly expropriated, this
Tribunal agrees with the conclusion reached by another Arbitral Tribunal: “... in
evaluating a claim of expropriation it is important to recognize a State’s legitimate right
to regulate and to exercise its police power in the interests of public welfare and not to
confuse measures of that nature with expropriation.”°”

476. The Tribunal is of the opinion that SBS intervened in BNM pursuant to the laws
in force. Later, when it received the PwC audit report it ordered—also in accordance with
the applicable law—the dissolution and liquidation of the bank. These were legitimate
acts of “police power” characteristic of bank officials because, according to Article 2 of
the Banking Law, the main purpose of the Law is “... to provide for the competitive,
solid and reliable operation of the financial and insurance systems, so as to contribute to

national development.”

477. Relying on Article 5 of the APPRI, the Claimant argues that to carry out the
expropriation legally, the Peruvian State should have enacted a law authorizing the
expropriation of the investment, stating the public interest or necessity.°”? The Tribunal
has carefully examined this argument and has concluded as stated in the following
paragraph.

6 Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic (ICSID

Case ARB/03/19), Decision on Liability, July 30, 2010, § 139.
3 Memorial on the Merits, § 809.

171

478. In the opinion of the Tribunal, it is not true that there was an expropriation in the
case of BNM, as affirmed by the Claimant. What happened was a repeated non-
compliance with the banking regulations by BNM, which moreover took risks in times of
a considerable liquidity crisis that affected it, causing it to fail to perform its obligations
and to close its offices. These acts made its intervention and subsequent dissolution and
liquidation inevitable. As several Arbitral Tribunals have repeatedly pointed out, no
investment treaty is an insurance or guarantee of investment success, especially when the

. . soc O74
investor makes bad business decisions.

479. In view of the content of the preceding paragraphs, the Tribunal also considers
unfounded the Claimant’s arguments concerning “the permanent effects of the measure;”
the “investor’s legitimate expectations affected;” “the intent of the government measure;”

and “the proportionality test of the measure.”°”°

480. The Claimant has further stated that the actions of the Executive Branch, of
BCR, and of SBS are not non-compensable regulatory acts under international law.°”°

For the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal also considers that this argument is without

merit.

481. The Claimant also questioned “...the effects on the investment caused by
substantial change in baking [sic] regulations decided by the Republic of Peru.”*”” She
notes that the Banking Law is an avant-garde legislation, a modern legal framework but
with the implementation thereof by the PCSF, “the Peruvian State inclined a level floor
in order for larger banks to take over smaller banks, with the ensuing change of
conditions that severely affected the equity of the investment.”°”* She further stated, in

relation to the PCSF “that this legislation intended to rearrange market competition in

favorable conditions for larger banks to the detriment of smaller banks, regardless of
efficiency and competition considerations, we are before a violation of protection
standards under international law.”°” The Claimant did not explain nor demonstrate the
“substantial change in baking regulations” that she alleges. Nor did she prove that “the
legislation intended” to favor large banks, regardless of market efficiency or how

standards of protection were violated.

482. The Claimant argues that the type of relationship that must exist between
international law and domestic law is important because the former has a role to play in
controlling the legality of the State’s actions under the criteria of proportionality and lack
of arbitrariness. She also indicates that, in case of conflict, international law should
prevail and that a State may not invoke the provisions of its internal law in order to evade

its international responsibility.”

483. The Tribunal generally agrees with the ideas expressed by the Claimant
summarized in the preceding paragraph but, in light of the particular facts of this case,
concludes that there was no such conflict between the two legal systems, nor should any
international liability for the facts presented by the Claimant be attributed to Peru.
BNM’s own breaches of the banking regulations led to SBS’s intervention in the Bank.
Once SBS had confirmed the improper accounting practices, it determined the total losses
incurred by the bank and, according to the Banking Law requirements, its dissolution and

liquidation were inevitable.

484. The Claimant’s arguments are mainly based on her contention that there was a
conspiracy on the part of the Peruvian authorities, which generally wanted the “smaller
banks” of that country to disappear and, specifically, to harm BNM and its shareholders.
Neither the oral or written arguments of the Claimant nor the evidence adduced by her
have convinced the Tribunal of the existence of such a conspiracy. Besides, the Tribunal
is of the opinion that it is illogical that the Government of Peru (or any government)
would decide to take action to trigger or aggravate a financial crisis. The Tribunal simply

© Tbid., § 844.
8 Thid., $f] 835 to 839.
173

cannot be convinced that the actions taken by the Respondent intended to harm the
stability of the financial system or the public’s confidence in it. These alleged intentions
by the Peruvian Government are even more unlikely in times of a financial crisis such as

the one that existed in Peru when BNM faced its most severe problems.

In the preceding paragraphs, the Tribunal has examined in detail the Claimant’s

allegations of violations of the APPRI committed by Peruvian officials to her detriment.
The Tribunal has found in all cases that the Claimant did not conclusively prove any of
these accusations. In the following paragraphs, the Tribunal will refer to situations in

which the Peruvian authorities, rather than harmed BNM, tried to help it.

Some of the actions of the Peruvian regulatory authorities, which were helpful to

BNM, were:

On August 4, 1999, SBS authorized BNM to account for the “goodwill,” arising out
of the Bank’s merger with Banco del Pais as an intangible asset to be amortized over
a five-year term.°*!

On August 6, 1999, by Resolution 0715-99, based on Article 62 of the Banking Law
that grants it discretion in the matter, SBS approved the capital increase of BNM

through capitalization of the surplus from the revaluation of BNM’s headquarters.”

SBS authorized BNM to make provisions for doubtful debts, charged on its capital,

for approximately S/. 28 million.*?

On September 29, 1999, SBS authorized BNM (based on Articles 64 and 349 of the
Banking Law that grants it discretion to do so) to reduce its capital by S/. 23,591,550,

so that its level of provisions would be increased.*™*

e. On December 15, 1999, SBS authorized BNM to participate in the Treasury Bonds
Program, created by Supreme Decree No. 099-99/EF and Ministerial Resolution
number 134-99-EF/77, up to an amount of US$34.5 million.°*°

f. As of November 13, 2000, BNM received from BCR to cover its reserve in foreign
and national currency the average sum of US$67.3 million in twelve days and S/. 97.5
million in two days; moreover on December 4, 2000 (one day before the closing of
BNM) the Bank was granted a loan of US$73 million to cover its reserve

. : . 686
requirements in foreign currency.

487. The above-mentioned actions disprove the Claimant’s argument that the

Peruvian authorities intended to harm BNM, its shareholders, and directors.

E. Conclusions Concerning the Problems of BNM

488. The Arbitral Tribunal has carefully assessed the oral and written submissions of
the parties and the documentary and other evidence provided by them and came to the
conclusions set out below. The bottom line is that, although there were several causes
that led to the failure of BNM (including, and to a significant degree, the economic crisis
in Peru during 1999 and 2000), it was ultimately the actions of its shareholders and

employees that brought it to ruin.

489. In the following paragraphs, the Tribunal details some of the specific facts that, in

its opinion, caused the collapse of BNM.

490. First, the fact that several restructured and refinanced loans were recorded in the
current loan portfolio, which enabled BNM to record as income interest that had not yet

been charged. This accounting mismanagement had been detected repeatedly since 1997

85 Respondent’s Exhibit R-046.
686 Respondent’s Exhibit R-123.

175

and caused SBS to impose a fine on that Bank.°*”
491. Moreover, the excessive concentration of public deposits put BNM in a

vulnerable situation. SBS repeatedly warned the Bank’s officials of this situation.***

492. On September 6, 2000, the directors of BNM partially removed various liens on
properties of GREMCO (a construction company, the owners of which were shareholders
of BNM) valued at US$20.4 million, which were collateral for a loan from BNM.°?

This fact was also acknowledged by Mr. Jacques Levy at the hearing.©”

493. On December 1, 2000, just a few days before BNM was intervened, the
Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of BNM agreed
to remove some additional collateral involving other properties pledged by GREMCO for
a loan from BNM.! This fact was also acknowledged by Mr. Jacques Levy at the

hearing.”

494. BNM improperly included as income the interest not received from current
accounts receivable frozen for periods longer than 60 days, in clear contravention of SBS
Resolution Number 572-97. According to Memorandum 28-2000-VIO/NM of October 4,
2000 issued by Mr. Carlos Quiroz, Head of the SBS Inspection Visit, that inadequate
accounting represented S/. -459,884,343 and US$-900,629.35.°

495. BNM favored companies associated with the shareholders of the Bank and fell
into bad banking practices. According to Report No. 05-2002-VE/DESF “A” called

Montalvo, Head of the Inspection Visit, Norma Talavera Arana, Analyst, and Alfonso

Villanueva Velit, Analyst, dated July 12, 2002, BNM was the main source of funding for
the group of companies and as of December 5, 2000, the debt amounted to
US$27,594,000. That report states, inter alia, that GREMCO’s assets under financial
lease BNM did not require “technical reports of independent appraisers... for the assets ...
granted under leaseback operations; hence it has not been possible to actually know the
real value of those assets.” Another similar irregularity was confirmed at the hearing
by Mr. Carlos Quiréz Montalvo, Head of the SBS Inspection Visit, who indicated that the
GREMCO lands had been overvalued for purposes of using them as loan guarantees

given by BNM. °°

496. BNM also favored companies associated with its shareholders through a real
estate fund: in late August 2000, BNM had 944 bonds with a nominal value of
US$944,000.00 in the Real Estate Multi-Income Investment Fund, dedicated to real estate
investment in Peru. The management company was Multifundos SAFI S.A. In October
2000, BNM purchased 20,426 participation shares for the value of US$2,829,000 from
NHM.° All real estate purchased by the Fund belonged to GREMCO S.A., except for

Bembos Commercial Premises.”

497. Mr. Roberto Meza Cuenca, General Manager of Multifondos SAFI, was also
serving as Manager of Leasing (a department of BNM) in October 2000, but did not
indicate this fact in his written statement of May 17, 2012.°* This double position of Mr.
Meza contradicts the response that Mr. Edgardo Alvarez, Business Manager of BNM,
gave on September 25, 2000, when he sent a communication to Mr. Carlos Quiroz from
the SBS, telling him that the Fund was independent, financially and administratively,
from BNM. Besides, it casts doubts, in the Tribunal's opinion, about the transparency of

the Funds administration with respect to BNM.

498. BNM increased its lending during the crisis in Peru. The produced evidence
shows that in 1999 BNM’s lending rate was much greater than that of the other banks in
Peru.”

499. The merger of BNM with Banco del Pais caused BNM problems; the minutes of
BNM’s Board Meeting, number 105 of October 25, 1999 state:

“the accounting and financial records of Banco del Pais, and in particular its loan

portfolio figures did not clearlry reveal economic and financial situation.

Furthermore... it had been established that should a loss arise from false or
incorrect information, each party must assume its respective loss or, failing that,
reduce its share of stock.”””!

As a result of the decision, BNM requested that SBS authorize a reduction in its share

capital and the authorization states:

“Since it is necessary to strengthen the level of reserves of Banco Nuevo Mundo,
the General Assembly of Shareholders, held on August 31, 1999, agreed to reduce
its share capital by the amount of S/. 23,591,550..."

500. Apart from the above-mentioned facts the Arbitral Tribunal considers that some
of the leading officials of BNM acted negligently or took improper actions in managing
that bank and its relations with the Peruvian authorities. The Tribunal previously
adverted to the lack of seriousness with which they treated the recommendations given to
them by SBS. One other fact that confirmed the Tribunal’s opinion was the statement of
Mr. Edgar Choque de la Cruz, who held the post of BNM’s General Accountant (a key
officer in any bank). When asked about the relevant documents issued by SBS, he said

repeatedly (six times) that he was not aware of them because they were confidential or

7 Respondent’s Exhibit R-038.

178

were addressed to the Directors of BNM.”” It is clear to this Tribunal that Mr. Choque
acted with great negligence and that the organizational structure of BNM was very poor,

which undoubtedly contributed greatly to its collapse.

501. The handlings described were clearly contrary to the best banking practices and
violated Peruvian regulations in this matter. In the opinion of the Tribunal, these

improper actions were the root cause of the collapse of BNM.

502. The Tribunal finds it necessary to refer to the following: In her closing
arguments, the Claimant challenged the testimony of Mr. Luis Cortavarria, SBS
Superintendent, for his relationship with Mr. Carlos Bolofia Behr, who was penalized
under the criminal law in Peru. At the hearing, counsel for the Claimant said: “Mr.
Carlos Bolofia Behr, the Minister of Economy, is closely linked to Mr. Cortavarria...
when Mr. Carlos Bolofia was appointed Minister of Economy, Mr. Cortavarria was
appointed superintendent...in our view, there is a link of confidence between these two
individuals.””™*

503. Conversely, the Claimant’s counsel also stated at the hearing: “Mr. President,
here we are not questioning the personal appropriateness of the other officers in the
hierarchical structure of the SBS. What we are questioning is their professional aptness or

skill.”

504. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the matter and concluded that there is no
reason to doubt the adequacy and integrity of officials of SBS, since no evidence was

presented in the arbitral proceedings that would lead to the opposite conclusion.

F. Claims for Damages and Moral Damages

505. The Claimant sought payment of damages allegedly suffered by her and further

requested that Peru compensate her for moral damages. The Respondent requested that

75 Thid., Paitan at 1594: 9-13.

179

Claimant compensate Peru for moral damage, which, in its words, it suffered.

506. Given that the Tribunal will reject the Claimant’s arguments about violation of
the standards of fair and equitable treatment and national treatment, as well as those
concerning the obligation of full protection and security and indirect expropriation, the

Tribunal will inevitably deny the Claimant’s claims for damages and for moral damages.

507. Peru requested that the Tribunal “award it moral damages for the injury inflicted
on Respondent by Claimant in the course of this dispute.””°° According to Peru “[nJot
only have BNM’s former shareholders (and now, Claimant) abused the administrative
and judicial processes available to them, but they have attempted to inflict serious harm
on the Respondent’s reputation and the legitimacy of its response to Peru’s financial
crisis.”""”

508. The Respondent explained that the shareholders of BNM _ abused the
administrative and judicial processes available to them by bringing six claims against
Peru over ten years, prompting two investigations by the Peruvian Congress, and
initiating a lawsuit against the Superintendent in the State of New York. It also argued
that they conducted a media campaign aimed at undermining the credibility of the
Respondent and tried to block the adoption of the Free Trade Agreement between Peru
and the United States of America. With all these actions the sharedolders of BNM

caused an enormous moral damage to Peru.”°*

509. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the fact that shareholders of BNM submitted six or
more complaints before various courts or took other actions in Peru does not constitute
per se an abuse of the administrative or judicial processes. As for the media campaign,
the Respondent refers to the publication of articles and interviews given to various
media by shareholders of BNM, and to Mr. Jacques Levy’s book.” The Tribunal notes
that neither Mr. Levy, nor BNM, nor its shareholders are part of this arbitration

proceeding. In relation to the last argument of the Respondent on the alleged attempt to
block the adoption of a treaty with the United States of America, the Respondent has not
demonstrated what concrete actions of the Claimant it is complaining about, what
damage this alleged action caused to Peru, and how it is linked to the issue discussed in

these proceedings.

510. In view of above analysis, the Tribunal will also reject the Respondent’s request

to order the Claimant to pay for the moral damage it allegedly suffered.

XI. COSTS

S11. Each party requested that the Tribunal order the other one to pay its costs and

expenses in relation to this case, and to compensate it for moral damages.
512. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“Tn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise
agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and
shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such

decision shall form part of the award.”

513. At the first session between the parties and the Tribunal held on March 21, 2011,
the following was established:”'° “The parties shall defray the direct costs of the
proceedings in equal parts, without prejudice to the final decision of the Tribunal as to the

allocation of costs.”

514. On February 21, 2013, both parties filed their submissions on costs. Claimant’s
costs amount to a total of US$2,229,829.61, including legal and expert fees, and ICSID

advances. Respondent’s costs amount to a total of US$5,238,568.81 including legal and

7! English Transcript, March 21, 2011, at 12:4-17.

181

expert fees and ICSID advances. ”"!

515. Neither the ICSID Convention nor its Rules or Regulations provide guidance as to
the criteria to be used by the Tribunal when allocating costs between the parties. There is
no uniform practice of Tribunals when allocating costs.’!? Some tribunals have followed
the “loser pays all” approach whereby the costs follow the event.’'> Others have awarded

costs to one party on the basis of the other party’s conduct during the proceeding;’!*

while other tribunals have divided the costs and expenses equally among the parties.”'°

516. For the reasons discussed extensively above, the Arbitral Tribunal shall deny both

parties’ requests for moral damages.

517. In regards to the parties’ requests on costs, both sides have repeatedly indicated
that, from 1999 to 2000 Peru was hit with a financial crisis. The Tribunal considers that,
although the bankruptcy of BNM was caused by its own administration, it was also
influenced by the economic context in Peru. The Tribunal also found in paragraph 500 of
this Award, that some of the leading officials of BNM acted with negligence or took

improper actions in managing that bank and its relations with the Peruvian authorities.

7!" At the time of the parties’ submissions on costs, ICSID had requested three advances. On June 24, 2013, ICSID
requested a fourth advance of US$150,000 from each party. Thus the amounts have been adjusted by the Tribunal to
reflect this final call for funds.

Robert Azinian and others v. United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2), Award, November 1, 1999,
the Tribunal considered the possibility of awarding costs as “[t]he list of demonstrably unreliable representations
made [by the Claimants] before the Arbitral Tribunal is unfortunately long” and “[t]he credibility gap lies squarely
at the feet of Mr Goldenstein, who without the slightest inhibition appeared to embrace the view that what one is
allowed to say is only limited by what one can get away with.” However, ultimatley, the Tribunal decided to divide
the costs equally, mainly acknowledging the fact that the investor-State dispute settlement mechanism was a novel
system, §§ 125-126. This is no longer the case here.

  

182

XII.

Furthermore, the Tribunal denied both parties’ request for moral damages. For these

reasons, the Tribunal finds that it is fair and appropriate that Claimant should pay its cost

associated with this arbitral proceeding, the costs of ICSID and the fees and expenses of

the arbitrators. Respondent shall bear its own costs and expenses. So will be ordered in

the operative part of this Award.
