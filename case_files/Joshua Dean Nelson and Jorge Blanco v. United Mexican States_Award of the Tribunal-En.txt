I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

1. This case concerns a dispute submitted pursuant to Articles 1116(1), 1117(1) and
1120(1)(c) of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and the Arbitration
Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly on 15 December 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”). By
agreement of the Parties, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes

(“ICSID”) serves as the administering authority for this proceeding.

2. The claims in this arbitration were initially brought by Mr. Joshua Dean Nelson
(“Mr. Nelson” or “Claimant”), and Mr. Jorge Blanco (“Mr. Blanco”), both natural
persons having the nationality of the United States of America. Mr. Blanco later withdrew

from this arbitration as claimant.!

3. Mr. Nelson brings his claims on his own behalf and on behalf of Tele Facil México, S.A.
de C.V. (“Tele Facil”), a corporation organized under the laws of the United Mexican

States, which Mr. Nelson alleges is majority owned and controlled by him.

4. The respondent is the United Mexican States (“Mexico” or “Respondent”).
5. Claimant and Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.”
6. This dispute arises from an investment that Claimant alleges to have made in Mexico’s

telecommunications sector. Claimant alleges that a series of measures by Mexico’s
telecommunications regulator, the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (“IFT” for its
acronym in Spanish), have destroyed Claimant’s investment and all prospects of entering
the Mexican telecommunications market, in violation of the protections afforded to U.S.

investors under Chapter Eleven of NAFTA.

7. According to Claimant, the IFT measures that breached Chapter Eleven of NAFTA are

three: (i) the confirmation of criteria proceedings initiated by the Compliance Unit of the

See {| 66 below.

IL.

IFT; (ii) Decree 77 issued by the IFT on 8 April 2015 (“Decree 77”) and; (iii) Resolution
127 issued by the IFT as well, on 7 October 2015 (“Resolution 127”).

Claimant further alleges that two decisions from the Mexican courts breached Chapter
Eleven of NAFTA. Particularly, Claimant alleges that the Specialized Telecommunications
Court that decided Tele Facil’s amparo action against Decree 77 acted with gross

incompetence and that the Appellate Court unjustifiably denied Tele Facil access to justice.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 21 April 2016, Claimant delivered a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration
(“Notice of Intent”) to Respondent. On 26 April 2016, Respondent acknowledged receipt

of the Notice of Intent via email.

On 26 September 2016, Claimant commenced this arbitration by filing a Notice of
Arbitration (“NoA’”), pursuant to Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Rules and NAFTA Articles
1116(1), 1117(1), and 1120(1)(c).

CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS

As envisaged in NAFTA Article 1123, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be
composed of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party and the third, presiding

arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the Parties.

On 31 October 2016, Claimant appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder QC, a national of the United
Kingdom, as arbitrator. On 23 December 2016, Respondent appointed Mr. Mariano

Gomezperalta Casali, a Mexican national, as arbitrator.

On 9 January 2017, Claimant requested that the ICSID Secretary-General appoint the third,
presiding arbitrator pursuant to NAFTA Article 1124.

By letter dated 17 January 2017, the Secretary-General accepted Claimant’s request and
proposed a ballot process to assist the Parties in selecting a mutually agreeable presiding

arbitrator. On 24 January 2017, the Parties accepted the Secretary-General’s proposal.

20.

On 27 February 2017, in accordance with the Parties’ agreed procedure, the Secretary-
General provided the Parties with a list of seven candidates. Each Party submitted its

completed ballot on 13 March 2017.

By letter on 14 March 2017, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the ballot
process did not result in the selection of a mutually agreeable candidate and that,
accordingly, the Secretary-General would proceed to appoint the presiding arbitrator
following the list-procedure established under Article 6.3 of the UNCITRAL Rules,
selecting all candidates from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, pursuant to NAFTA Article
1124(3).

On 27 March 2017, the Secretary-General provided the Parties with a list of three

candidates. Both Parties submitted their completed lists on 11 April 2017.

On 12 April 2017, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the list-procedure had
not been successful in the selection of a mutually agreeable candidate, and that as a result,
and pursuant to the Parties’ agreement, the Secretary-General would exercise her discretion

in appointing the Presiding Arbitrator among the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.

On 1 May 2017, the Secretary-General appointed Mr. Eduardo Zuleta as the third and
presiding arbitrator, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1123 and Article 6.3 of the UNCITRAL
Rules.

By letter to the Secretary-General of ICSID of 20 June 2017, the Parties requested that
ICSID provide full administrative services in this arbitration. On 21 June 2017, the
Secretary-General confirmed that ICSID would provide such services and sent the terms
thereof. On 26 June 2017, the Parties confirmed their agreement with the terms of the

administration services of ICSID.

THE FIRST PROCEDURAL HEARING AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY ORDER

On 7 July 2017, the Tribunal held a first procedural hearing with the Parties via conference-

call.

Following this first procedural hearing, on 18 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 1 (“PO1”), embodying the agreements of the Parties and the decisions of the
Tribunal on disputed procedural matters. PO1 provided, inter alia, that the applicable
arbitration rules would be the UNCITRAL Rules, except to the extent that they are
modified by Section B, Chapter 11 of NAFTA, that the procedural languages would be
English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceedings would be Toronto, Canada. POL
also established rules on the confidentiality and publication of documents (which would be
developed in a subsequent procedural order), the procedural calendar and a document
production schedule. The Parties also confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly
constituted and that neither party had an objection to the appointment of any of its

members.

As envisaged in PO1, on 11 August 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a joint
proposal on the Confidentiality Order. On 30 August 2017, the Parties submitted a joint
proposal on the Confidentiality Order reflecting the agreements and disagreements
between the Parties. On 7 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2
(“Confidentiality Order’), indicating the procedures governing the designation of
confidential information and the preparation of redacted copies of documents for

publication.

THE PARTIES’ FIRST ROUND OF WRITTEN PLEADINGS AND DOCUMENT PRODUCTION

REQUESTS

In accordance with the document production schedule included in POI, and following
exchanges between the Parties, on 12 September 2017, Claimant filed a request for the
Tribunal to decide on production of documents (“Claimant’s First Request for

Documents”).

31.

On 28 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO3”), deciding on
Claimant’s outstanding document production requests. In PO3, the Tribunal accepted a
number of Claimant’s requests and asked Respondent to confirm that it had undertaken and
would undertake a good faith effort to search for the documents responsive to certain

others.

On 25 October 2017, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the IFT had completed a new
search diligently and in good faith without finding other responsive documents.

Respondent made additional observations regarding PO3.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s invitation, on 1 November 2017, Claimant sent his
comments on Respondent’s communication of 25 October 2017, stating that Respondent
had failed to comply with PO3. Claimant also indicated that Respondent’s officials had
intimidated one of Claimant’s witness and requested a procedural hearing to evaluate
Respondent’s conduct. In light of these allegations and Claimant’s request for a procedural

hearing, the Tribunal invited Respondent to provide comments.

On 7 November 2017, pursuant to the procedural calendar established in PO1, Claimant

filed his Statement of Claim (“Statement of Claim’).

On 15 November 2017, Respondent denied having failed to comply with PO3. Respondent
also stated that it was not aware of any witness interference and offered to conduct a more

thorough investigation should the Tribunal request it.

On 23 November 2017, the Tribunal asked Respondent to provide answers to a list of issues
that were still unclear for the Tribunal. On 30 November 2017, Respondent provided such

answers.

On 6 December 2017, at the Tribunal’s request, Claimant submitted his comments on
Respondent’s answers of 30 November 2017, explaining that Respondent had provided
incomplete answers because it did not comment on relevant IFT internal regulations. The
Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on these internal regulations and Claimant to

submit a brief comment afterwards.

37.

In the aforementioned communication of 6 December 2017, Claimant reiterated his request
to hold a procedural hearing and stated that he could share more information on the
allegations of witness interference through an in-camera process. The Tribunal invited
Claimant to provide more details and Respondent to comment on Claimant’s requests

afterwards.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s invitation, the Parties submitted their final comments on the

above referred issues on 18 and 22 December 2017.

On 2 January 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“PO4”) where, inter alia,
the Tribunal: (i) asked Respondent for additional information regarding the search
conducted to find the documents requested by Claimant; (ii) deemed unnecessary to
schedule a separate hearing to discuss document production as well as an ex parte hearing
in camera regarding the alleged interference with a witness; and, (iii) directed Respondent

to produce a draft of Decree 77, or explain why it could not be produced.

On 16 January 2018, Respondent filed its response to the Tribunal’s request in PO4. On 22
January 2018, the Tribunal invited Respondent to provide additional information on
whether it conducted a search or requested responsive documents within the IFT Plenary,
the IFT Commissioners and their offices and what was the result of such search or request.
Respondent filed its response on 26 January 2018 and on | February 2018, the Tribunal
ordered Respondent to produce all responsive documents found in the IFT Commissioner’ s

offices.

In accordance with the document production schedule, and following exchanges between
the Parties, on 5 January 2018, Respondent filed its first request for the Tribunal to decide

on production of documents (“Respondent’s First Request for Documents”).

Claimant objected to a number of documents requested by Respondent on the basis of
Article 9(2)(b) of the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
Arbitration (“IBA Rules”), and invoked both provisions of U.S. and Mexican law on

privilege.

On 12 January 2018, the Tribunal invited Claimant to submit by 17 January 2018 a brief
with his comments on (i) the criteria to select the applicable law to the issue of privilege
(Mexican or U.S. law); and (ii) Respondent’s interpretation of Mexican and U.S. law on
privilege. The Tribunal also invited Respondent to submit its comments on Claimant’s brief
by 23 January 2018. The Tribunal also directed Claimant to prepare a privilege log for each
document in respect of which he claimed privilege and to share it with Respondent.

Respondent was granted an opportunity to respond to the privilege log.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions, on 17 January 2018, Claimant submitted
his views on applicable law on issues of privilege, and his comments on Mexico’s
responses on interpretation of Mexican and US law on privileges. On 23 January 2018,
Respondent submitted its comments in response. A second round of written comments was
submitted by the Parties on 29 January 2018 and 1 February 2018, respectively.
Additionally, on 2 February 2018, Respondent submitted to the Tribunal Claimant’s

Privilege Log with Respondent’s comments.

On 13 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, on Respondent’s First

Request for Documents.

On 21 February 2018, Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal asking for a one-month
extension for the filing of its Statement of Defense. By email of 23 February 2018,
Claimant agreed to a two-week extension which was confirmed by the Tribunal on 6 March

2018.

On 14 March 2018, and in accordance with the agreed two-week extension, Respondent

filed its Statement of Defense (“Statement of Defense’).

THE PARTIES’ SECOND ROUND OF WRITTEN PLEADINGS AND DOCUMENT PRODUCTION

REQUESTS

Following exchanges between the Parties, on 1 May 2018, Claimant submitted to the
Tribunal his second request for production of documents (“Claimant’s Second Request

for Documents”).

On 9 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on Claimant’s Second Request

for Documents.

On 24 May 2018, the Tribunal approved the Parties’ agreement to extend the deadline for

the submission of Claimant’s Reply to Respondent’s Statement of Defense (“Reply”).
On 5 June 2018, Claimant filed his Reply.

On 8 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 clarifying the deadline for the
submission of the Redfern Schedules to the Tribunal and amending Section 18.11 of POL

accordingly.

Following exchanges between the Parties, on 17 July 2018, Respondent submitted to the
Tribunal its second request for production of documents (“Respondent’s Second Request

for Documents”).

On 9 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 (“PO8”) on Respondent’s

Second Request for Documents.

On 14 August 2018, with a view to maintain an orderly conduct of the proceedings, the
Tribunal proposed to amend the procedural calendar in order to (i) include a deadline for
the submissions of non-disputing NAFTA Parties; (ii) set the new deadline for the
submission of Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits (“Rejoinder”); and (iii) fix the dates

for the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits (the “Hearing”).

On 16 August 2018, Respondent requested a three-week extension for the filing of its
Rejoinder based on different grounds, including the fact that Claimant had yet to produce

the Call Detail Records (“CDRs”) in accordance with the terms set forth in PO8.

On 17 August 2018, the United States of America requested an extension of the deadline

for the filing of non-disputing Party submissions pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128.

On 22 August 2018, Claimant objected to Respondent’s request for an extension to file the
Rejoinder and explained, among other things, that the Parties had not reached an agreement

regarding the production of the CDRs.

54.

55.

56.

57.

58.

59.

On 27 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, suspending the deadline
for filing the Rejoinder, inviting the Parties to reach an agreement on the applicable
procedure to produce the CDRs, and informing the Parties that in the absence of an

agreement, the Tribunal would make the corresponding decisions.

On 29 August 2018, the Parties reported to the Tribunal that they had reached an agreement
on the terms of production of the CDRs and on the deadline for the submission of the
Rejoinder. They also requested the Tribunal to formalize the Parties’ agreement in a
procedural order and confirmed that on that same date the CDRs had been transferred to

Respondent.

On 4 September 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, which: (i) formalized
the Parties’ agreement on the terms of production of the CDRs and the deadline for the
submission of the Rejoinder; (ii) lifted the suspension for filing the Rejoinder; (iii) granted
the deadline extension requested by the United States of America and set the date for filing
non-disputing Party submissions pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128; and (iv) amended the

procedural calendar accordingly.

On 10 September 2018, pursuant to the amended procedural calendar, Respondent
submitted its Rejoinder, accompanied, inter alia, by an expert report of Dr. Paolo

Buccirossi (the “Buccirossi Report”).

On 28 September 2018, Claimant requested the Tribunal to reject the Buccirossi Report on
the grounds that it (i) violated POI and (ii) contravened Claimant’s rights to equal
treatment and a full opportunity to present his case. Pursuant to the Tribunal’s invitation,

Respondent submitted its comments to Claimant’s request on 5 October 2018.

On 22 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 (“PO11”), granting
Claimant an opportunity to reply to the Buccirossi Report and to submit evidence, but
solely to rebut the new material contained in the Buccirossi Report and referring to earlier

reports submitted by Claimant with his Statement of Claim.

On 8 November 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Secretariat had not
received non-disputing party applications or non-disputing NAFTA Party submissions in

connection with this arbitration.

On 27 November 2018, in accordance with PO11, Claimant submitted the expert reports
of Dr. Christian Dippon from NERA Economic Consulting, and Dr. Elisa Mariscal from

Global Economic Group in response to the Buccirossi Report.

THE ORGANIZATION OF THE HEARING AND MR. BLANCO’S WITHDRAWAL AS CLAIMANT

On 9 January 2019, pursuant to the procedural calendar as amended by agreement of the
Parties, both Parties submitted their respective lists of the witnesses and experts they

intended to call for cross-examination at the Hearing.

In accordance with Section 21.3 of POI, on 30 January 2019, the Tribunal informed the
Parties that it wished to question Dr. Pablo Buccirossi, expert for Respondent, during the
Hearing. On this same day, Respondent informed the Tribunal of its decision not to cross-

examine certain witnesses.

Pursuant to Section 22 of PO1, on 1 February 2019, the Tribunal notified the Parties of its
availability to conduct a pre-hearing conference call and circulated a draft agenda, inviting
the Parties to submit a joint proposal advising the Tribunal of any agreements they were
able to reach. On 5 February 2019, the Tribunal also invited the Parties to submit the lists

of witnesses or experts they intended to call for direct examination at the Hearing.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s invitation, on 12 February 2019 the Parties submitted the lists
of witnesses and experts that each one intended to call for direct examination, and on 20
March 2019, the Parties submitted their joint proposal on the draft agenda for the pre-
hearing conference call, which included their agreement to submit a joint chronology of
events (“Joint Chronology of Events”) before the Hearing. As the Parties had reached an
agreement on almost all relevant issues, on 25 March 2019, the Tribunal informed the
Parties that the pre-hearing conference call foreseen in PO] was deemed unnecessary and

was therefore cancelled.

On 26 March 2019, Claimant’s counsel notified Respondent and the Tribunal of a finding
that Mr. Jorge Luis Blanco filed for bankruptcy in 2011 under Chapter 7 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, and that Mr. Blanco inadvertently failed to disclose his interests at the
time in Tele Facil. Claimant’s counsel further informed that, as a result of such filing and
the circumstances surrounding it, Mr. Blanco was not, as of the date of Claimant’s counsel
letter, the owner of his original shareholdings in Tele Facil and that the steps required to
remedy the situation created by the filing for bankruptcy could not be completed during
the time available before the Hearing. Claimant’s counsel stated that Mr. Blanco did not
want to unnecessarily delay or complicate the arbitration and, consequently had instructed
counsel to withdraw Mr. Blanco as a claimant in these proceedings. However, Mr. Blanco

would continue to participate as a fact witness in support of Mr. Nelson and Tele Facil.

By letter dated 27 March 2019, Respondent posed various questions to Claimant regarding
Mr. Blanco’s bankruptcy filing. Claimant responded to such questions by letter dated 29
March 2019.

On 29 March 2019, the Centre transmitted to the Parties a communication on behalf of the
U.S. Government requesting to attend the Hearing, together with the affirmative response

sent on behalf of the Tribunal.

By letter of 3 April 2019, Respondent indicated that it was likely that it would have to
change its defense on jurisdiction based on the new facts regarding the bankruptcy of
Mr. Blanco that was only informed to the Tribunal and Respondent in Claimant’ s letter of
29 March 2019. Respondent also indicated that it may have to initiate judicial proceedings
seeking the annulment of the transfer of shares of Tele Facil to Mr. Nelson made on 26
March 2016, unless Claimant was willing to accept that on the date of the NoA Mr.

Nelson’s participation as shareholder in the capital of Tele Facil was 40%.

By letter dated 5 April 2019, Claimant’s counsel alleged, inter alia, that Mr. Blanco’s
withdrawal as claimant in this arbitration would not affect the status of Mr. Nelson’s 60%
shareholding because his share increase occurred through a transaction that did not involve
Mr. Blanco and that was done in accordance with Tele Facil’s by-laws. Claimant’s counsel

further indicated that Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal as claimant has no impact whatsoever on

11

71.

72.

723.

74.

75.

76.

Mr. Nelson’s standing to claim in this arbitration and on Respondent’s position in the

arbitration.

Respondent replied on 8 April 2019 requesting authorization to amend its defense to
include new jurisdictional objections based on the new facts regarding the bankruptcy and
requested that the Tribunal either postpone submissions on jurisdiction until after the

Hearing or postpone the Hearing.

On the same date, the Parties submitted the Joint Chronology of Events.

By letter of 9 April 2019, Claimant’ counsel reiterated that Mr. Blanco’s current status has
no bearing on Mr. Nelson’s standing to claim on his own behalf or on behalf of Tele Facil
and that the issue of whether or not additional briefings on the matter were required should
be decided at the close of the Hearing. Finally, Claimant’ counsel indicated that Mr. Blanco
withdrew as claimant to minimize any potential disruption to the Hearing and that, to the
extent that the Tribunal permits Respondent to present a new defense, Mr. Blanco reserved
his right to be reinstated as a claimant if and when the bankruptcy court abandons Mr.

Blanco’s shares back to him.

On 10 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 concerning the organization

of the Hearing.

On 11 April 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to issue an order for
the termination of the proceedings with respect to Mr. Blanco, pursuant to Article 34.2 of
the UNCITRAL Rules. On the same date, Claimant’s counsel replied referring to the
reservation of rights made in their letter of 9 April 2019 and requested that the Tribunal’s
order terminating the proceedings with respect to Mr. Blanco be made either conditionally
or be delayed until the course of action with respect to the treatment of Mr. Blanco’s

bankruptcy is determined at the end of the Hearing.

On 16 April 2019, Respondent reiterated the need to file additional jurisdictional objections
and opposed to Claimant’s proposal that the Tribunal’s order terminating the proceedings
with respect to Mr. Blanco be made conditionally or be delayed until Mr. Blanco’s

bankruptcy is resolved. Respondent added that the withdrawal of Mr. Blanco as a claimant

12

was unconditional and must be treated as such. According to Respondent, if Mr. Blanco
was no longer being withdrawn as a claimant, or was conditionally withdrawn or if the
election to withdraw him as a claimant was deferred to the end of the Hearing, this would
cause serious prejudice to Respondent. A fundamental right of Respondent is to know who
is or are the claimant parties before the Hearing. If Claimant’s requests were granted, then
Respondent would be denied procedural fairness. Respondent concluded that if the issue
of Mr. Blanco’s status as a claimant was not defined before the Hearing, Respondent would
not agree to proceed to the Hearing on the merits prior to the determination of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Respondent stressed that it categorically opposed allowing Mr.
Blanco’s status as a claimant to continue as an outstanding issue to the detriment of

Respondent’s defense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

77. On 17 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, accepting Mr. Blanco’s
withdrawal as co-claimant in this arbitration, and notifying the Parties that the
consequences of Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal would be addressed by the Tribunal with the
Parties at the Hearing. Consequently, Mr. Blanco was removed from the list of claimants.

79. On 26 April 2019, the last day of the Hearing, the Parties were invited by the Tribunal to

discuss and seek an agreement on (a) the sequence and timing of the post-hearing briefs;

and (b) whether additional submissions on the consequences of the withdrawal of

Mr. Blanco were required and, if so, the sequence and timing thereof.

On the same date, at the Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties to prepare a joint schedule
of the basic facts regarding the amparos (a “Joint Chronology of Amparos”) and invited

the Parties to reach an agreement on the submission deadline.

The Parties agreed to one round of simultaneous post-hearing briefs and one round of
consecutive submissions regarding Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal. However, the Parties did not
agree on the scope of the submission regarding the withdrawal. Respondent intended to
address: (a) whether the transfer of the shares to Mr. Nelson dated 29 March 2016 is valid
in light of the circumstances that resulted in Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal and the implications
of the foregoing for this arbitration (the “Share Transfer Issue”); and (2) whether de facto
control suffices as a matter of law for purposes of NAFTA Article 1117 and whether Mr.
Nelson has de facto control of Tele Facil (the “De Facto Issue”). Claimant in turn
considered that Respondent only needed to address the Share Transfer Issue because the

De Facto Issue had already been thoroughly briefed in this process.

On 17 May 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 (“PO14”) where it decided:
(i) to approve the agreement of the Parties on one round of simultaneous post-hearing briefs
and one round of consecutive submissions on Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal; and (ii) to allow
the Parties to address the Share Transfer Issue as well as the De Facto Issue in their

submissions regarding Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal.

In accordance with PO14, on 13 June 2019 Respondent filed its submission on
Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal. This submission was Respondent’s Objection to the Jurisdiction

of the Tribunal (“Jurisdictional Objection’).

On the same date, and within the agreed deadline, the Parties submitted the Joint

Chronology of Amparos requested by the Tribunal at the Hearing.

On 1 July 2019, Claimant informed the Tribunal about a disagreement between the Parties
regarding the procedure and timing of the post-hearing submissions related to

Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal. On 3 July 2019, Respondent replied to Claimant’s request.

On 9 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 (“PO15”) which, inter alia,

provided that (a) if Claimant intended to present arguments and evidence on Mr. Blanco’s

16

87.

88.

89.

withdrawal not in the evidentiary record at the time of issuance of PO14, the Parties had to
confer and agree on a new procedural calendar by 22 July 2019; and (b) if Claimant did
not intend to submit new arguments and evidence on Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal, the

procedural calendar determined by the Tribunal in PO14 would be maintained.

On 15 July 2019, Claimant informed the Tribunal and Respondent about his intention to
submit arguments and evidence on Mr. Blanco’s withdrawal not in the evidentiary record

at the time of issuance of PO14.

On 16 July 2019, Claimant reported areas of agreement and disagreement between the
Parties on the new procedural calendar and requested the Tribunal’s intervention to resolve
the disagreements. On 19 July 2019, Respondent submitted its comments on Claimant’s

report.

On 24 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16 (“PO16”) deciding on the

disagreement between the Parties, in the following terms:
a) Claimant could, no later than 15 August 2019:

i. Submit new arguments and evidence regarding the bankruptcy order of 29 May
2019 issued by the Judge for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Florida in relation to Mr. Blanco (the “Bankruptcy

Order’).

ii. Submit, in connection with the De Facto and the Share Transfer Issues, factual
documents that were previously produced in this arbitration, though not
submitted as exhibits into the record of this arbitration, and expert reports as
well as legal authorities on the matter, provided that they are based on the

evidentiary record existing at the time PO14 was issued.
b) Respondent could, no later than 19 October 2019:

i. Submit new arguments and evidence regarding the Bankruptcy Order in

response to Claimant’s submission of August 15, 2019.

90.

91.

92.

93.

94.

ii. Amend its jurisdictional objections to (i) include the Bankruptcy Order and
submit new arguments and evidence regarding the Bankruptcy Order; and (ii)
address the De Facto and the Share Transfer Issues and introduce in connection
therewith factual documents that were previously produced in this arbitration,
though not submitted into the record of this arbitration, and expert reports as
well as legal authorities, provided that they are based on the evidentiary record

existing at the time PO14 was issued.

c

Claimant could submit his response to the amended objections on jurisdiction no later

than 8 December 2019.

d

No new arguments or evidence not related to the above issues could be submitted

without previous authorization from the Tribunal.

In accordance with PO1S, on 15 August 2019 both Parties submitted their post-hearing
briefs (“Post-Hearing Briefs’) and, in accordance with PO16, Claimant filed his Response

to Respondent’s Objection to Jurisdiction (“Response to the Jurisdictional Objection”).

In accordance with PO16, on 19 October 2019, the Respondent submitted its Supplemented
Jurisdictional Objection (“Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection”) and, on 27
November 2019, the Claimant submitted his response to Respondent’s Amended

Jurisdictional Objections (“R to the Suppl d Jurisdictional Objection’).

 

On 15 January 2020, the Parties submitted their respective statements of costs

(“Statements of Costs”).

By letter of 9 March 2020, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties of the passing
of Mr. Veeder on 8 March 2020. The remaining arbitrators, Dr. Zuleta and
Mr. Gomezperalta, invited the Parties to hold a conference call to discuss the next steps in

the proceeding, which was held on 20 March 2020.

During the conference call of 20 March 2020, Dr. Zuleta and Mr. Gomezperalta explained
that: (a) after the Hearing on jurisdiction and the merits held on 22 — 26 April 2019, the

Tribunal deliberated in person and by email and reached a unanimous decision; (b) a draft

18

95.

96.

97.

award was circulated on 21 February 2020; (c) Mr. V.V. Veeder approved the circulated
award as drafted on 3 March 2020; (d) after the passing of arbitrator Mr. V.V. Veeder on
8 March 2020, one of the remaining arbitrators considered that some adjustments should
be made to the draft award to clarify specific sections of the text; and (e) such adjustments
do not change the unanimous decision taken in the deliberations or the main rationale and

the decision contained in the draft award approved by Mr. V.V. Veeder.

During the conference call, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the following alternatives

to continue this arbitration and issue the corresponding award:

(1) The two remaining arbitrators would introduce the adjustments proposed by one of
them to clarify specific sections of the draft award and thereafter the remaining
arbitrators, Dr. Zuleta and Mr. Gomezperalta, would sign the award. Pursuant to
Article 32(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the award will indicate that Mr.

V.V. Veeder approved the decision but passed away before signing the award; or

(2) The Tribunal would be reconstituted, a new arbitrator would be appointed by the
Claimant, and the Tribunal so reconstituted would decide, in consultation with the
Parties, the stage at which the new Tribunal would resume proceedings and

conclude the arbitration.

The discussions held during the conference call were recorded in a letter sent to the Parties
on 24 March 2020, in which the remaining arbitrators reiterated their invitation for the
Parties to agree on one of the alternatives and proposed a second conference call in which

the Parties would inform as to whether an agreement was reached.

Further to the aforesaid letter, the Parties and the Arbitral Tribunal held a second
conference call on 26 March 2020. During this second conference call the Parties informed
the Arbitral Tribunal that they had agreed with Option 1 of the letter of 24 March 2020.
The terms of the Parties’ agreement were summarized in a letter to the Parties dated 31

March 2020 as follows:

1. The two remaining arbitrators, Messrs. Eduardo Zuleta and
Mariano Gomezperalta, will introduce in the award the adjustments

19

proposed by one of them after the passing of arbitrator V.V. Veeder
to clarify specific sections of the draft award.

2. The adjustments will be introduced in footnotes that will identify
each one of them. Correction of typographical errors will be made
directly in the text of the award.

3. After completing the adjustments and the Spanish version of the
award, ining the same adj s in fe the intl
arbitrators, Messrs. Eduardo Zuleta and Mariano Gomezperalta,
will sign the award.

4. Pursuant to Article 32(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the
award will indicate that Mr. V.V. Veeder approved the decision but
passed away before signing the award.

5. The Tribunal confirms that it is agreeable, upon request by either
Party, to sharing a copy of Mr. V.V. Veeder’s email to the President
of the Tribunal of March 3, 2020 confirming his approval to the
draft award.

98. By emails of 4 and 7 April 2020, the Parties confirmed that the 31 March 2020 letter

reflected the agreement reached by the Parties on the treatment of the award after

Mr. Veeder’s passing.

Il. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

99. Mr. Joshua Dean Nelson and Mr. Jorge Luis Blanco, nationals of the United States of
America, together with Mr. Miguel Sacasa, a national of Mexico, wanted to enter and
participate in the telecommunications market of Mexico.” For such purposes, on 7 January

2010, they incorporated Tele Facil under the laws of, and domiciled in, Mexico.?

2009) (“Memorandum of Understanding”); NoA, {ff 14, 18; Amended NoA, {ff 18, 19, 23; Statement of Claim (7
November 2017), { 50; Joint Chronology of Events, p. 1.

3 C-014, Public Deed No. 16,778 containing Tele Facil’s incorporation (7 January 2010).

20

100. By 2010, the Mexican Federal Telecommunications Law (“FTL”) restricted foreign
ownership of telecommunication concessions to 49%. Therefore Mr. Nelson, Mr. Blanco

and Mr. Sacasa agreed on the following:

a

Mr. Nelson and Mr. Blanco would own respectively, 40% and 9% of Tele Facil and

Mr. Sacasa would own 51%.°

b

Mr. Nelson would be the primary financial investor in the company and in exchange

for his investment he would receive 60% of the profits.°

c

Mr. Nelson would assume majority control of Tele Facil once Mexican law permitted

him to do so.’

101. On 25 August 2011, Mr. Blanco filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida without
identifying his shares in Tele Facil as an asset of the bankruptcy estate.’ On 2 December

2011, Mr. Blanco was discharged of the bankruptcy proceeding.?

102. Under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, once Mr. Blanco filed for bankruptcy, an
estate was created and all of Mr. Blanco’s legal and equitable interests, whether disclosed

or not, became property of that estate.'? Mr. Blanco’s shares in Tele Facil became part of

4 CL-001, FTL (7 June 1995), Article 12 (stating that “[...] concessions referred to in this Law shall only be granted
to individuals and entities of Mexican nationality. The participation of foreign investment, in no case will exceed the
49 percent, except for mobile telephony. For this case, a favorable resolution by the National Commission of Foreign
Investment will be required, so that the foreign investment may participate in a larger percentage.”’).

the bankruptcy estate, but because they were not disclosed in the bankruptcy proceedings,
they could not be administered by the appointed trustee and abandoned back to
Mr. Blanco once discharged of the proceedings. As such, they remained the property of the

estate even after the case closed, on 2 December 2011.!!

On 21 February 2012, Mr. Blanco’s bankruptcy proceeding was closed and Ms. Marcia T.

Dunn (Mr. Blanco’s trustee) was discharged.'*

On 27 May 2011, Tele Facil applied to the Ministry of Communications and Transportation

for a concession to install, operate and exploit a public telecommunications network. '?

On 17 May 2013, the Mexican Secretariat of Communications and Transport granted Tele
Facil a concession to operate a public communications network for a period of 30 years.
The concession authorized Tele Facil to offer “[a]ny telecommunication service which can
technically be provided by its infrastructure, except broadcasting services” in Mexico City

(DF), Guadalajara (Jalisco), La Soledad (Jalisco) and Monterrey (Nuevo Le6n).!°

In order to provide its services, Tele Facil had to interconnect with a Mexican carrier,
otherwise Tele Facil’s customers would only be able to communicate with other customers
in the same network. Under Mexican law, interconnection of telecom networks,
interconnection rates and interconnection’s terms and conditions are of public interest

(“orden piiblico e interés social”).'®

Tele Facil decided to interconnect with Teléfonos de México and Teléfonos del Noroeste
(jointly, “Telmex”), the largest telecommunications carrier in Mexico, on an indirect

interconnection basis so that Tele Facil could route its traffic through a larger carrier, which

had already established sufficient capacity with Telmex and was able to lease excess
capacity to Tele Facil to indirectly deliver traffic to Telmex. Tele Facil selected Nextel to

indirectly interconnect to Telmex’s network through Nextel. '7

108. Tele Facil therefore prearranged an indirect interconnection scheme.!* This scheme
required “one direct interconnection with one of the concessionaires [...] to use its network
and circuits in order to reach the rest of the concessionaires ‘indirectly.””!? Tele Facil
commenced negotiations with Nextel and simultaneously requested interconnection with

Telmex.”

109. On 11 June 2013, Mexico enacted several amendments to the Mexican Constitution on

telecommunication matters. These amendments included:

a) The creation of the IFT. The IFT was granted the power to oversee matters concerning
economic competition in the telecommunications sector, including the power to declare
the existence of preponderant economic agents and to impose on them asymmetrical

regulations.

b) The creation of specialized courts and tribunals to handle matters concerning

telecommunications, radio broadcasting and economic competition in those sectors;

c

The creation of a new type of concession called “Sole Concession” (“Concesién
Unica”) to simplify the provision of additional services to those established in the
concession title, and to permit concessionaries to render more services through their

respective networks as long as they comply with certain obligations;

110. On 26 August 2013, Telmex offered Tele Facil a draft standard interconnection agreement
for a period expiring on 31 December 2017.” This draft: (i) included a reciprocal
interconnection rate of USD 0.00975 per minute;”* (ii) did not expressly allow indirect

interconnection” and; (iii) incorporated portability charges.”

111. On6 March 2014, the IFT declared América Mévil, S.A.B. de C.V. and its subsidiaries,
which included Telmex, as a preponderant economic agent in the telecommunications
sector.”° Twenty days later, on 26 March 2014, the IFT issued specific asymmetrical
regulations, including the obligation of Telmex to provide indirect interconnection and a

special interconnection rate of MXN 0.2015, approx. USD 0.00172.7’

112. On 8 July 2014, Tele Facil sent to Telmex its comments on the draft standard
interconnection agreement that Telmex had sent on 26 August 2013.7* Tele Facil requested

Telmex to include provisions allowing indirect interconnection and to revise the provisions

the comments and amend the agreement accordingly so that Tele Facil could proceed to

sign it?

113. Three days thereafter, on 11 July 2014, Tele Facil initiated disagreement proceedings under
Article 42 of the FTL before the IFT to resolve the divergences between Tele Facil and

Telmex over: (i) indirect interconnection and; (ii) portability charges.*!

114. On 14 July 2014, Mexico enacted the new Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting
Law (the “FTBL”).? This law, which became effective on 13 August 2014,>3 introduced
measures applicable to preponderant and dominant carriers, such as the “zero
interconnection fee” forbidding the preponderant agent — therefore, Telmex — to charge

interconnection fees to other carriers for calls ending in its network.**

115. On 26 August 2014, Telmex submitted to the IFT a reply within the disagreement
proceedings initiated by Tele Facil.** With its reply, Telmex submitted a different draft
agreement than the one presented to Tele Facil on 26 August 2013. This draft did not

include portability charges and allowed indirect interconnection.*° Telmex argued that the

rates.*”

On 26 November 2014, the IFT, by unanimous decision, issued Resolution 381.33 In

Resolution 381, the IFT, inter alia:

a) Concluded that Telmex, in the course of the interconnection disagreement proceeding,

b

c

had accepted to include the provision of indirect interconnection service and eliminate

the portability clause.*”

Dismissed Telmex’s argument in connection with an alleged disagreement on
interconnection rates and concluded that these rates “were defined in the draft
agreement for the provision of fixed local interconnection services and its exhibits, sent
by Telmex [...] to Tele Facil [on 26 August 2013], and which are part of the

evidence”.”°

Ordered the parties to “interconnect their telecommunications networks and initiate the
provision of the corresponding interconnection services” and “execute the
interconnection agreement of their telecommunications networks pursuant to the terms
and conditions determined in the FIFTH Consideration section of this Resolution”

within 10 business days following the notification of the resolution.*!

participate in these proceedings as an “interested third party”.*

122. On 9 January 2015, Telmex sent a communication to Tele Facil through which it sought to
initiate negotiations to determine interconnection rates.** Telmex explained that it could
not offer the same terms and conditions offered in 2013 because they were contrary to the
Constitutional Reform and the FLTB and proposed using the regulated rate that the IFT
published on 29 December 2014 (MXN 0.004179).*4

123. On 10 February 2015, invoking the difference of positions between Tele Facil and Telmex
the IFT’s Compliance Unit requested a confirmation of criteria from the Legal Affairs Unit
to confirm whether, in addition to compelling interconnection, the IFT had the power to

55

compel the execution of an interconnection agreement.’ Under Mexican law, a

confirmation of criteria is a legal mechanism to confirm a proposed legal interpretation by
an individual or government entity of a legal or administrative provision issued by the

IFT.*%°

124. On 18 February 2015, Telmex sought a confirmation of criteria from the IFT to determine

whether the terms in the draft agreement proposed on 26 August 2013 by Telmex to Tele

Facil were consistent with the new telecommunications regime.*”

125. On 8 April 2015, the IFT, by a majority vote, approved and issued Decree 77 in response
to the confirmation of criteria sought by Telmex and the IFT’s Compliance Unit.** Decree
77 determined that the IFT’s powers were restricted to resolving the conditions not agreed
upon by the parties which were in the case of Tele Facil and Telmex, indirect
interconnection and portability charges.*? Decree 77 ordered the parties to interconnect
their systems physically within ten business days counted from the date in which both
Telmex and Tele Facil were notified of the resolution and obligated the parties to execute
the corresponding interconnection agreement without specifying any deadline for doing

so.

126. On 16 April 2015, Telmex informed Tele Facil of its intention to interconnect its network
and that it had requested Nextel the traffic service to set up the indirect interconnection and
carry out interconnection tests.°! The same day, Nextel sent the information requested and
confirmed its readiness to bring about the interconnection testing. Tests were performed

between 17 and 21 April 2015 without Tele Facil’s participation.”

127. On 23 April 2015, Telmex informed Tele Facil of the tests’ results; confirmed it was ready
to process calls between Telmex and Tele Facil’s networks in Area Codes 58, 118 and 223
and reiterated its willingness to continue with the negotiation of the interconnection

agreement.

128. On7 May 2015, Tele Facil filed an amparo suit (Amparo proceedings 1381/2015).° This
amparo aimed at challenging the IFT’s failure to enforce Resolution 381, the request for
confirmation of criteria presented by the Compliance Unit before the Legal Affairs Unit,

and the IFT’s proposal on the interpretation of Resolution 381 and Decree 77.

129. On9 and 10 June 2015 and 20, 21 and 27 October 2015, the IFT made physical inspections
in Tele Facil.*” When the IFT notified Tele Facil of these inspections, it stated that they
were made for the purposes of verifying, inter alia, that Telmex and Tele Facil’s networks
were interconnected in accordance with Decree 77.°° Nextel was also subject to a similar

inspection on 20 and 27 October 2015.

130. On 16 June 2015, Telmex submitted a new interconnection disagreement to the IFT,
claiming that there was a disagreement on different terms, including the applicable
interconnection rates for 2015.” Three days later, on 19 June 2015, the IFT accepted

Telmex’s application.”!

133. On 7 October 2015, the IFT issued Resolution 127 deciding Telmex’s interconnection
disagreement of 16 June 2015 in Telmex’s favor.” According to the IFT, the original
interconnection agreement between Telmex and Tele Facil was null and void” because it
was never signed by Telmex. The IFT also found that the applicable interconnection rate
until 31 December 2015 was MXN 0.004179 (USD 0.000253).’° Two IFT Commissioners,

Ms. Adriana Soffa Labardini Inzunza and Mr. Adolfo Cuevas Teja dissented.””

ground that it had illegally left without effect Resolution 381 (Amparo proceedings
1694/2015).”8

THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF ON THE MATTER OF JURISDICTION
(dd) Respondent’s objection on jurisdiction and request for relief

Respondent objects the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide Claimant’s claim filed on behalf
of Tele Facil. According to Respondent, under NAFTA Article 1117, Claimant had to
control Tele Facil, direct or indirectly, when he submitted the claim to arbitration, but that

was not the case.
On this basis, Respondent requested that the Tribunal:

a) “Determine that Mr. Nelson has no procedural legitimacy to file a claim on behalf of

Tele Facil and, reject the claim submitted under Article 1117 in its entirety;

b) Order the Claimant to indemnify the Respondent for the costs incurred at this

jurisdictional stage.”°”

(2) Claimant’s response on jurisdiction and request for relief

149. On the matter of jurisdiction, Claimant alleges that he has standing to claim under Article
1117 because he had legal control of Tele Facil by the time he submitted the claim to

arbitration and in any case, he also had de facto control of the company.
150. On this basis, Claimant requests the following relief, as regards jurisdiction:

a) a decision that Respondent’s original and amended objection to jurisdiction is

dismissed on all counts; and

b) an award of costs in favor of Claimant in connection with its response to Respondent’s

original and amended objection to jurisdiction.**

B. PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF ON THE MERITS
qd) Claimant’s claims on the merits and request for relief

151. On the merits, Claimant alleges that Respondent expropriated his investments in breach of
NAFTA Article 1110. Claimant groups his investments in two different types, namely (i)
corporate rights, defined as the right to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues
based on the interconnection rate of USD 0.00975; and (ii) shareholders rights, understood

as his rights of share ownership and to a return on Tele Facil’s profits.”

152. According to Claimant, the measures that resulted in the expropriation are three: (i) the
confirmation of criteria proceedings initiated by the Compliance Unit of the IFT that
allegedly avoided the enforcement of Resolution 381; (ii) Decree 77 through which
Resolution 381 was allegedly repudiated and; (iii) Resolution 127 that according to

Claimant imposed a new rate detrimental to Tele Facil but favorable to Telmex. These

three measures are seen by Claimant as a three-part scheme which deprived Claimant’s

investments of all economic viability.

Claimant also alleges that Respondent breached its obligation under NAFTA Article 1105
to grant investors a fair and equitable treatment. Claimant contends that both the IFT and

the Mexican courts acted in an unfair and inequitable way towards his investment.

As far as the IFT is concerned, Claimant alleges that the confirmation of criteria requested
by its Compliance Unit and the Pleno’s Decree 77 were arbitrary and lacked due process.
Claimant also adds that Decree 77 was discriminatory. Finally, Claimant refers to IFT’s
Resolution 127 as a “direct consequence of the IFT’s arbitrary, secretive and discriminatory
scheme to save Telmex from its deal with Tele Facil” and “derivatively [also in breach of]

Article 1105.”!°°

Regarding the Mexican courts, Claimant alleges that the Specialized Telecommunications
Court that decided Tele Facil’s amparo action against Decree 77 acted with gross

1

incompetence! and that the Appellate Court unjustifiably denied Tele Facil access to

justice. !°
On this basis, Claimant requests the following relief:

a) A final declaration that Respondent has breached its obligations to Claimant under

NAFTA;

b) An order that Respondent pays Claimant compensation for his losses that by the time
the Statement of Claim was filed, were quantified at USD 472,148,929;
c) An order that Respondent pays Claimant pre-award compound interest, at a

commercially reasonable rate or such other rate determined by the applicable law;

costs of the Tribunal and the legal and other costs incurred by Claimant, on a full
indemnity basis, together with interest on such costs, in an amount to be determined by

the Tribunal; and
f) Such other and further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.
(2) Respondent’s defenses on the merits and request for relief

Respondent denies a breach of NAFTA Article 1110 for several reasons. Respondent
contends that Claimant’s alleged rights are not protected under NAFTA, Claimant can only
challenge the measures taken by the IFT as a denial of justice under Article 1105 and, in

any case, Claimant did not show a radical deprivation of the economic value of his rights.

Respondent also denies a breach of NAFTA Article 1105 for various reasons. First,
Respondent’s position is that Claimant can only challenge the IFT measures under a denial
of justice claim. In any case, Respondent denies that the IFT acted in an arbitrary, secretive
and discriminatory scheme to save Telmex from its deal with Tele Facil and that its courts

incurred in denial of justice.

On this basis, Respondent requests the Arbitral Tribunal to dismiss all of Claimant’s
claims, in their entirety, and order Claimant to indemnify Respondent for the arbitration

costs, including travel expenses of its legal team, witnesses and experts.

The respective positions of the Parties in relation to the issues presented in the arbitration,
both on matters of jurisdiction and merits, will be synthesized throughout this decision and
as the issues raised are resolved by the Tribunal. The Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it
has considered all of the Parties’ arguments, both written and oral. The fact that an
argument is not expressly summarized in the synthesis of the Parties’ positions should not

be considered as an indication that the Tribunal has not considered such argument.

Vv. JURISDICTION

A. THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS
qd) Respondent’s Position

161. Respondent objects the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide the claim submitted by Claimant
on behalf of Tele Facil'°> under NAFTA Article 1117. Respondent understands the word
“owns” in NAFTA Article 1117 as “full ownership”! and the word “controls” as only
covering “legal control of the enterprise”,!°° meaning that de facto control is excluded. As
further explained below, Respondent’s position is that Claimant neither owned nor legally
controlled Tele Facil at the time the arbitration claim was filed and therefore lacked
standing to sue Mexico. Respondent also alleges that assuming the word “controls” also

covers de facto control, Claimant did not have it either. 106

162. For Respondent, “full ownership” of an enterprise means having 100% of its shares.'°”
Since Claimant did not own 100% of the shares in Tele Facil when the arbitration claim
was submitted, Respondent’s position is that under NAFTA Article 1117 Claimant did not

have “full ownership” of Tele Facil. !°

163. Further, for Respondent “legal control of the enterprise” means legal corporate control of
a company under the /ex situs (i.e., Mexican law in this case). Therefore, if Article 178 of
the Mexican General Law of Mercantile Companies (“GLMC’’) states that legal control of

an anonymous corporation — such as Tele Facil — resides in the General Shareholders

time the arbitration claim was submitted had control of the enterprise under NAFTA Article
1117. Mr. Nelson, however, did not control Tele Facil’s General Shareholders Meeting at
the time the arbitration claim was submitted because he was a minority shareholder — with

only 40% of the company’s shares —.!!°

Although in the extraordinary shareholders meeting of 29 March 2016, Messrs. Blanco,
Nelson and Sacasa intended to approve a corporate restructuring to increase Mr. Nelson’s
shareholding from 40% to 60% — what would have caused Mr. Nelson to have legal
control of the company —, Respondent states that this meeting was null and of no legal
effect.''! According to Respondent, Mr. Blanco’s bankruptcy petition of 25 August 2011
caused him to lose his shares and, as a result, since that day, he lost his right to vote in the

shareholders meetings. !!?

Respondent obtained an expert report from Mexican legal expert Mr. Rodrigo Buj to
address whether the increase of Mr. Nelson’s shares on 29 March 2016 was valid under
Mexican law. Buj’s conclusion is that it was not. First, the procedure provided for in the
Eleventh Clause of Tele Facil’s by-laws establishes that shares of restricted circulation can
only be transferred with the shareholders’ approval.'!? However, the Third Clause of the
Transfer of Shares Contract shows that the approval was granted by the Board of Directors,
not the shareholders.''* Second, GLMC Articles 186, 187 and 188 require that prior to an
ordinary shareholder meeting, a summon be published 15 days in advance. This
requirement does not apply only when all shareholders are present (i.e., a “totalitarian
meeting”). On 29 March 2016, Mr. Blanco’s bankruptcy estate was Tele Facil’s
shareholder, not Mr. Blanco himself. Therefore, the 29 March 2016 shareholders meeting

was not a meeting in which all shareholders were present and consequently, a prior

additional ground on which the transfer of shares should be deemed as null and of no legal
effect. According to Mr. Buj’s fourth report, Tele Facil’s Shareholders’ Registry Corporate
Book does not demonstrate that the notification requirements set forth in the Eleventh

Clause of Tele Facil’s by-laws were complied with.'!®

As stated above, Respondent argues that the term “controls” in NAFTA Article 1117 does
not encompass de facto control, inter alia, because the term is “highly subjective” and
“introduces uncertainty and ambiguity.”!'? However, assuming that this word does
encompass de facto control, Respondent submits that Claimant did not have such type of
control over Tele Facil at the time the arbitration claim was submitted.''® Respondent
acknowledges that the tribunal’s decision in Thunderbird v. Mexico (“Thunderbird’),!!°
in which Claimant relied, stated that a showing of de facto control was sufficient for the
purposes of NAFTA Article 1117. '?° However, according to Respondent, the facts upon
which de facto control was found in Thunderbird and the requisite evidentiary threshold
applied in that case (i.e., “beyond any reasonable doubt”) are absent in this case.!?!
According to Respondent, the record shows that Mr. Nelson did not exercise de facto
control because: (i) his responsibilities in Tele Facil were limited to providing initial

funding to the company, providing technical and engineering support and providing useful

control over the operations of Tele Facil.'*4

167. Respondent holds that the U.S. bankruptcy proceedings had automatic effects in Mexico.
Therefore, it is Respondent’s position that (i) the appointed trustee in the U.S. bankruptcy
proceedings did not take legal action to dispose of the shares in Tele Facil because
Mr. Blanco did not disclose the existence of the shares, not because the bankruptcy
proceedings did not have automatic effects in Mexico;! (ii) Article 13 of the Mexican
Federal Civil Code states that legal situations validly created in a foreign State must be

126 and

recognized in Mexico, without having to initiate judicial recognition proceedings;
(iii) in any case, Title Twelve of the Mexican Law on Commercial Bankruptcy does not
purport to recognize foreign bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico but rather to solicit a

“Mexican court [to] act in cooperation with the foreign court.”!7”

168. Respondent, based in Mr. Buj’s opinion, also stresses that the Shareholders’ Registry
Corporate Book did not determine the ownership of the shares. Accepting the contrary
“would imply granting undue protection to a person who, by their omission, prevented the
corresponding entries in the Shareholder’s Book and gave legal effect to acts performed by
such person as a shareholder of Tele Facil without having that status on the date on which

those acts were carried out”.!78

With respect to Claimant’s nunc pro tunc argument, Respondent asserts that it is
irrelevant.'? According to Respondent, “the question for this Tribunal is not who should
be considered today as the owner of the shares, but who was the owner of those shares
when the NOA was filed and when the Totalitarian Assembly took place.” '*? Respondent
also claims that the Eurogas case brought up by Claimant “differs materially” from the

present case. 3!
(2) Claimant’s Position

Claimant considers that Respondent’s objection is unfounded'*? because the word
“controls” in NAFTA Article 1117 includes both, legal and de facto control'** and under
this provision Mr. Nelson could file an arbitration claim on behalf of Tele Facil because he

had both: (i) legal; and (ii) de facto control of Tele Facil. '**

According to Claimant, under the by-laws of Tele Facil and Mexican corporate law,
Mr. Nelson had legal control of Tele Facil because once Mr. Blanco filed his bankruptcy
petition he did not cease to: (i) be a shareholder in Tele Facil and, (ii) have the authority to
approve the share transfer from Mr. Sacasa to Mr. Nelson.!*> Claimant’s position is based
on three main arguments: (i) that the forfeiture of Mr. Blanco’s shares in the U.S.
bankruptcy proceedings did not automatically translate into a denial of Mr. Blanco’s
standing as a shareholder in Tele Facil; (ii) that the 2016 share transfer was valid under

Mexican law and Tele Facil’s by-laws; and (iii) in any event, Mr. Blanco’s share ownership

was restored by way of a nunc pro tunc order of a U.S. court, thus any possible defect in

the 2016 share transfer was repaired.'*°

According to Claimant, Mr. Blanco’s U.S. bankruptcy proceedings did not have automatic
effects in Mexico.'*” Relying in his legal expert, Mr. Oscar Vasquez, Claimant explains
that transnational bankruptcy matters are governed by Article 292 of the Mexican Law of
Commercial Bankruptcy, providing for specific judicial proceedings on recognition, which
should have been carried out to cause Mr. Blanco to lose his status as a shareholder of Tele

Facil, as a matter of Mexican law. '*8

Moreover, Claimant alleges that the transfer of shares from Mr. Sacasa to Claimant was
valid under Mexican law and Tele Facil’s by-laws. Claimant explains that because the
results of Mr. Blanco’s bankruptcy proceedings were never implemented into the Mexican
legal system, the question of Mr. Blanco’s status as a shareholder in Tele Facil is governed
exclusively by Mexican law. Applying the GLMC to the facts, Claimant alleges that there
were no defects in the process by which Claimant became the majority shareholder of Tele
Facil and acquired its legal control because on 29 March 2016
(i) Mr. Blanco was registered as the owner of shares in Tele Facil’ Shareholders’ Registry
Corporate Book; (ii) Mr. Blanco possessed the corporate rights allowing him to vote in
favor of that transfer, and (iii) since all of Tele Facil’s shareholders were present the
requirement of the prior summon was unnecessary. Further, even if the Tribunal were to
accept that Mr. Blanco’s U.S. bankruptcy had an effect in Mexico, under Mexican law,
company acts are not void simply because they fail to comport with required formalities
but rather voidable; for the act to be void a court must determine that it fails to comply with
the pertinent requirements. '* In its response on jurisdiction, Claimant also addressed the

alleged fourth ground on which the transfer of shares is not valid under Mexican law (i.e.,

that the notification requirements set forth in the Eleventh Clause of Tele Facil’s by-laws
were not complied with), pointing out Tele Facil’s Notice of Restructuring and arguing that

the transfer of shares was “duly and timely” notified to the IFT.'*°

In any event, Claimant states that by order of a U.S. bankruptcy judge, Mr. Blanco now
owns his shares in Tele Facil nunc pro tunc (i.e., as of the date of his original bankruptcy
petition). This means that as a matter of U.S. law, Mr. Blanco’s ownership of Tele Facil’s
shares has existed uninterruptedly and in its entirety since their issuance on 7 January 2010.
Thus, the transfer of shares to Claimant is unassailable. '*! Based on the Eurogas v. Slovakia
decision, Claimant maintains that the legal effect of a U.S. bankruptcy order restoring

ownership to a debtor nunc pro tunc has been recognized in investor-State arbitration.

Finally, Claimant asserts that the facts in this case also demonstrate that Mr. Nelson
exercised de facto control over Tele Facil at all relevant times during his dispute with
Mexico. To justify its position, Claimant first explains why the word “controls” in NAFTA
Article 1117 can be interpreted to include de facto control. According to Claimant, under
the principles in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”), the term
“control” includes de facto control because: (i) no textual evidence in NAFTA supports a
restricted and specialized interpretation of the word “control” and therefore it should be
interpreted based on its ordinary meaning; (ii) context also confirms that it should be
broadly interpreted; (iii) tribunal practice confirms that a showing of de facto control is
sufficient (citing Thunderbird), (iv) moreover, the term “controlled” in Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention has been interpreted to mean “both actual exercise of powers or
direction and the rights arising from the ownership of shares” and; (v) NAFTA Parties have

not expressed their agreement with Respondent’s interpretation. '*7

Then, Claimant refers to Respondent’s assertion that de facto control must be proven

beyond a reasonable doubt and states that: (i) there is no provision in NAFTA indicating

178.

that this standard applies; and (ii) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules say nothing about the

strictness of that burden.

Finally, Claimant refers to the evidence to show that he exercised de facto control over

Tele Facil at all relevant times.'

Based on the definition of de facto control in
Thunderbird (i.e., “the ability to exercise significant influence on the decision-making” and
being “the consistent driving force behind [the enterprise’s] business”),'#+ Claimant
sustains that the facts in this case meet such standard because: (i) not only Claimant was
the sole financer of Tele Facil but in that role, he also provided capital on an iterative basis
which means that Tele Facil could not act before Claimant’s funds were sent; (ii) Mr.
Nelson was the exclusive provider of all critical technology for the venture, which means
that from a technical perspective, Tele Facil could not function without his equipment and
know-how. According to Claimant, the fact that the transfer of shares did not take place
in 2013, when Claimant requested it, does not mean that there was no de facto control;
during the Hearing it was demonstrated that the transfer of shares was a simple formality
that did not affect Mr. Nelson’s interests. Claimant also alleges that the fact of not being in

the day-to-day management of the company did not affect his de facto control.'45

Claimant argues that the argument of Respondent’s expert, Mr. Buj, to the effect that U.S.
bankruptcy proceedings had automatic effects in Mexico under Article 13 of the Mexican
Civil Code is disproved by Claimant’s expert, Mr. Vasquez.'4° Claimant criticizes as a
“false counterfactual” Respondent’s premise that if Mr. Blanco had disclosed his Tele Facil
shares in the bankruptcy, such shares would have been disposed of by the bankruptcy
estate’s trustee.'*7 Based on his U.S. bankruptcy expert, Ms. Cyganowski, Claimant

submits that by the time the bankruptcy petition was filed “Tele Facil was nothing more

than a paper company and Mr. Blanco’s shares in the company lacked any value”!4®

therefore, “Mr. Blanco’s trustee would not have taken the costly steps of selling off his
Tele Facil shares which had no value to the bankruptcy estate.” 4? Moreover, Claimant also
criticizes Respondent’s position on the nunc pro tunc order stating that “Respondent wants
to have it both ways” because “when the results of the U.S. bankruptcy appear to be good
for Respondent’s case [...] Respondent embraces the alleged automatic effect of the
process” but “when the results are bad [...] Respondent denies any automatic effect of the

bankruptcy in Mexico.”!*°

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The issue on jurisdiction before this Tribunal is whether under NAFTA Article 1117
Mr. Nelson could file a claim on behalf of Tele Facil. As stated above, Respondent’s
position is that under NAFTA Article 1117 Mr. Nelson does not have standing to assert a

claim on behalf of this company. On the contrary, Claimant asserts that he does.

The Tribunal will first review NAFTA Article 1117, particularly as to the meaning and
scope of the term “controls” and subsequently, based on such meaning and scope, the

Tribunal will determine whether Mr. Nelson actually exercised control over Tele Facil.
(1) = Meaning and scope of the word “controls” in Article 1117
NAFTA Article 1117(1) in its relevant part provides as follows:

Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise

J. An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party
that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly
or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim
that the other Party has breached an obligation under:

(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or

(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the
monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's
obligations under Section A, and that the enterprise has incurred
loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.

As stated above, the Parties dispute the meaning and scope of the word “controls” in

NAFTA Article 1117(1).

To determine the meaning and scope of the word “controls,” the Tribunal will rely on the
general rule of interpretation provided for in VCLT Article 31. The Parties seem to agree

with this approach and both referred to this rule.!*!

According to VCLT Article 31(1) “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context

and in the light of its object and purpose.” *?

The Tribunal views VCLT Article 31 as a set of elements for interpretation that are to be
appreciated in the context and circumstances of the particular case. This implies that Article
31 as a whole —including all of its paragraphs and not limited to the standpoint of Article
31(1) — is an integral single rule for interpretation of treaties. This is underscored by the

fact that Article 31 is entitled the “General Rule [in the singular] of Interpretation”.

This means that the interpreter shall consider the ordinary meaning of the words, in their
context, and considering the object and purpose of the treaty. Hence, the starting point of
interpretation is the elucidation of the meaning of the text. In this case, the Parties seem to
accept, and the Tribunal agrees, that dictionary meanings are of assistance in this process.
If the meaning of the text does not reveal a single meaning, the Tribunal must then consider

the context of the treaty, its object and purpose.

192.

The Parties agree that the word “controls” encompasses legal or corporate control.
However, NAFTA does not define this term. Thus, the Tribunal may resort to the

definitions found in dictionaries.
The Black’s Law Dictionary defines “corporate control” as:

1. Ownership of more than 50% of the shares in a corporation. —
Also termed effective control; working control.

2. The power to vote enough of the shares in a corporation to
determine the outcome of matters that the shareholders vote on.'>*

To determine whether in this case Claimant had legal control of Tele Facil, the Tribunal
will refer to the definition of “corporate control” in the Black’s Law Dictionary. However,

that is not enough.

Based on this definition and other definitions of “control” according to English and Spanish
language dictionaries, Respondent sustains that the meaning of corporate control must be

determined considering the /ex situs (i.e., in this case Mexican law).!*4

The Tribunal agrees with Respondent in that, in the case of a company such as Tele Facil,
the determination of whether or not Claimant has “corporate control” of the corporation is

also a matter of Mexican law.

According to Respondent, under Mexican law, “legal corporate control” of a company
refers to “the investor’s power to decide on substantive matters, such as: the appointment
and removal of the company’s directors and officers, the approval and amendment of the
company’s by-laws, the transfer of shares or admission of new partners, or the dissolution

of the company.” !>°

For the reasons explained below, the Tribunal concludes that under Mexican law
Mr. Nelson has, and had at the time of submitting the arbitration claim, corporate control

of Tele Facil and therefore had control of Tele Facil for purposes of NAFTA Article 1117.

At this stage, it is important to highlight that in addition to legal control, Claimant maintains
that the word “controls” in Article 1117 also encompasses situations of de facto control.
Claimant cites to International Thunderbird v. Mexico in support of his interpretation.
However, based on the facts and the evidence submitted by the Parties and considering the
circumstances of the instant case, the Tribunal finds that it is not necessary to enter into the
debate as to whether the term “control” is limited to corporate control or may be extended

to include de facto control.

(2) Did Mr. Nelson legally control Tele Facil for purposes of NAFTA Article
1117?

The agreement between Claimant, Mr. Sacasa and Mr. Blanco, contained in the
Memorandum of Understanding, dated 20 July 2009, outlined the parties’ “understanding
of the structure of ownership of the proposed Mexican Telecom Project [which turned to
be Tele Facil] and the scope of responsibilities by each of the individuals/groups which are
party to the Project.”!°° Acknowledging that Mexican law in force at that time did not allow
Claimant a majority shareholding of the project, the parties in any case agreed that
Claimant “will have a majority interest as well as majority control equal to [...] 60%” and
that Mr. Sacasa and Mr. Blanco could not “sell their shares without offering [Claimant] the

Right of First Refusal.” !*7

Under Mexican law, the Memorandum of Understanding is a shareholder’s agreement

binding for the signatory parties. '°*

Based on the definitions of corporate control, both under the Black’s Law Dictionary and
the definition of corporate control provided by Respondent, Claimant had corporate control
of Tele Facil according to the Memorandum of Understanding of 20 July 2009. The
Memorandum of Understanding clearly stated that Mr. Nelson had “majority interest as
well as majority control equal to [...] 60%” of Tele Facil.'!"° This means that he had the
power to vote enough of the shares to determine the outcome of matters that the
shareholders vote on. This also means that he had power to decide on substantive matters,
such as the appointment and removal of the company’s directors and officers, or the
approval and amendment of the company’s by-laws. A clear manifestation of this is that
the Memorandum of Understanding explicitly said that the transfer of shares or admission

of new partners required Mr. Nelson’s approval since he had the Right of Refusal.!©°

Moreover, it is undisputed by the Parties that majority ownership is a manner of legal
control for purposes of NAFTA Article 1117.'°! Claimant’s position is that on 29 March
2016, as a result of Mr. Sacasa’s transfer of shares, he gained majority ownership of Tele
Facil (with 60% of the shares).'°? Respondent’s position is that Mr. Sacasa’s transfer of
shares to Mr. Nelson is invalid and of no legal effect, which would mean that

Mr. Nelson’s never became the majority owner of Tele Facil.!®

According to Respondent, Mr. Sacasa’s transfer of shares is invalid because the
shareholders’ meeting in which the transfer was approved does not comply with certain
legal requirements under Mexican law, mainly derived from the fact that under U.S. law,
Mr. Blanco ceased to be a shareholder of Tele Facil when he filed for bankruptcy, on 25
August 2011.

This Tribunal is not convinced that the transfer of shares is invalid. First, Respondent failed

to prove that Mr. Blanco’s bankruptcy petition in the U.S. had automatic legal effects in

Mexico. Respondent referred to Article 13 of the Mexican Federal Civil Code to argue that
“legal situations validly created in a foreign State must be recognized in Mexico”!
without providing further analysis or interpretation. As shown by Claimant, Article 8 of
the Mexican Law of Commercial Bankruptcy preempts the application of Article 13
because the Mexican Law of Commercial Bankruptcy specifically regulates the recognition
of foreign bankruptcy proceedings. '® Second, even if the approval of the transfer of shares
lacked certain legal requirements under Mexican law, such approval would be at most
voidable, not invalid per se.'® This means that the nullity of the transfer would have to be
declared by a court and therefore, that shareholders’ approval would be “effective until a
judge declares the corresponding nullity.”!°’ Third, even on Respondent's case, if the initial
order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court had automatic effects in Mexico, then the nunc pro
tunc order from the same court had also automatic effects, which would mean that Mr.
Blanco owns his shares in Tele Facil uninterruptedly and in its entirety since their issuance,

on 7 January 2010.'

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the share transfer is null and
void. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Nelson acquired majority ownership of
Tele Facil on 29 March 2016 and since that date, had legal control for purposes of NAFTA
Article 1117.

The evidence on the record as to corporate control resulting from the ownership of the
majority and the decisive vote of the shareholders of Tele Facil is more than sufficient to
conclude that Mr. Nelson had legal control of Tele Facil. But, the Tribunal notes that, in
addition, Mr. Nelson was the sole financer of Tele Facil during the critical start-up period,

allowing the company, inter alia, to hire staff, lawyers and accountants, to obtain a

which could permit
Mr. Nelson to control the money spending and correlatively the company’s actions.
Moreover, Mr. Nelson was the sole provider of crucial technology for Tele Facil’s

Cambium Network wireless broadband Point-to-Multipoint radios and related equipment,

Ethernet cabling, IP network equipment, servers, equipment racks, and various other tools

and wiring).'7!

203. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, under any standard, Mr. Nelson exercised legal
(corporate) and de facto control over Tele Facil at all relevant times. Consequently,
Mr. Nelson had standing to file a claim on behalf of Tele Facil.

been expropriated — which in turn requires applying the substantial deprivation test based
on the severity of the economic impact and its duration'7* — and; (iii) whether the
conditions set forth in Article 1110(1)(b)-(d) have been satisfied. For Claimant, the test is

satisfied in this case.

First, Claimant contends that he had investments capable of being expropriated.'”> The
investments were: (i) the right to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on
the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017), which were
established through Tele Facil’s contract with Telmex, and administratively confirmed by

the IFT;'’° and (ii) his rights of share ownership and to a return on Tele Facil’s profits.'7”

Second, Claimant alleges that by repudiating Tele Facil’s interconnection rights with
Telmex, the IFT destroyed Tele Facil’s ability to operate in Mexico and Claimant's ability
to earn a commercial return on his investment.'7® According to Claimant, Respondent’s
expropriation was implemented in a three-plot scheme: (i) the IFT’s refusal to enforce
Resolution 381;'” (ii) the repudiation of Resolution 381;'*° and (iii) IFT’s Resolution 127
which established a new interconnection rate between Telmex and Tele Facil.'*! In
Claimant’s words, “[w]ithout enforcement of Resolution 381 and, hence without an
interconnection agreement with Telmex, Tele Facil was, as a matter of fact, simply
incapable of earning any revenue in Mexico.”!'*? Moreover according to Claimant, the
economic impact was permanent because Tele Facil’s window of opportunity to earn

meaningful profits was time-limited (until the end of 2017) by the terms of the

interconnection, and therefore, each day that the IFT refused to enforce Resolution 381 was

“a day of high revenues for Tele Facil that was forever lost.”!*>

Third, Claimant states that the IFT’s expropriation was unlawful because it failed to pay
compensation to Claimant, discriminatorily targeted Tele Facil, proceeded without due
process, and contradicted the public interest.'*+ Claimant also adds that in this case there is
no regulation of general application in play, which means that there should not be any
questioning “about where the line falls between unlawful expropriation and legitimate

regulation.”!®>

In his Reply, Claimant addressed Respondent’s argument denying the existence of an
expropriation. First, Claimant explained that Tele Facil’s rights under the interconnection
agreement clearly constitute an investment under NAFTA Article 1139. According to

Claimant, these rights qualify either as “intangible property” !*°

or as “interests arising from
the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity
in such territory.”'*’ Moreover, Claimant's position is that the definition of investment in
NAFTA Article 1139 does not exclude rights running between an investor and a third
party.'88 Nothing in this provision can be reasonably interpreted as excluding agreements
that create rights or interests between private parties'*? and other investments tribunals
have already rejected the premise that contracts between private parties are not

investments. !°° Also, based on the text of NAFTA Article 1110 and other international

courts and tribunals’ decisions, Claimant alleges that rights between private parties can

also be expropriated. !*!

Second, Claimant disputes Respondent’s argument that Claimant cannot allege an unlawful
expropriation of Tele Facil’s assets. Claimant cites to NAFTA Article 1117, which entitles
an investor to claim on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that the investor owns or
controls directly or indirectly, and claims that this provision’s requirements are met in this
case.'? Claimant also refers to NAFTA Article 1116 and investment-arbitration cases to
maintain that under this provision, investors may claim in relation to losses of their

investment, which is what precisely happened in this case.'**

Finally, with respect to Respondent’s argument that Claimant may only assert a denial of
justice claim, Claimant asserts that he is entitled to claim separately for separate wrongful

194

acts committed by the IFT and by the telecommunication courts’ and that he is not

alleging that Mexico’s specialized courts expropriated his investment. !*°

In the Reply, Claimant also insisted on the substantial deprivation in the value of his
investment.!%° For Claimant, because neither the IFT nor the specialized courts found the
rate to be inconsistent with the new telecommunications law, the argument that Tele Facil
would never have been able to benefit from the high rate because it was invalid is
unavailing. !°” Moreover, even if Tele Facil’s bulk of profits were time-limited, Claimant
alleges that a large part of those profits could have been reinvested in order to sustain the

company’s growth.'®* Finally, Claimant asserts that Tele Facil “dire situation” following

Resolution 381 prevented the company from continuing to offer its services'?? and adds
that there was no legal obligation on Tele Facil to condone Respondent’s actions to accept

a fraction of what it was legally entitled to.?°

Claimant also re-examines the argument that Respondent did not act for a public purpose
and insists on the fact that by reversing Resolution 381, the IFT acted firmly against the

public interest.?°!

b. — Respondent’s Position

Respondent denies that there is an expropriation and therefore a breach of NAFTA Article
1110. Respondent’s defense lies mainly in three arguments: (i) that besides the shares in
Tele Facil, Claimant did not own assets protected under Article 11 10702, (ii) that the
measures at issue do not amount to an unlawful expropriation??? and; (iii) that, in any case,

these measures could be justified as bona fide regulation in the public interest.?”

Respondent's first argument rests on the premise that NAFTA “covers only the assets and
economic interests enumerated in Article 1139s definition of investment” which is “a
closed list.”2°> According to Respondent, only Claimant’s shares in Tele Facil qualify as
an investment under Article 1139.2 With respect to this investment, Respondent alleges
that “[t]he only conceivable expropriation claim [...] would have to be based on an
allegation that unlawful interference by the Mexican State was so invasive and devastating
that Tele Facil was rendered incapable of carrying on business and became effectively

worthless,” which Claimant failed to establish.’ Moreover, Respondent alleges that

because “Article 1110 does not protect the investments of an investment of an investor of a
Party”, Claimant cannot allege unlawful expropriation over Tele Facil’s assets.7°*
However, even if it could, Respondent’s position is that the interconnection rights do not
fall under the definition of “investment” under Article 1139.7

Respondent’s second argument is that the measures in question cannot amount to an
unlawful expropriation because they “can only be addressed in terms of denial of justice at
customary international law.”?!° That is because Resolution 381, Decree 77 and Resolution
127 aimed at resolving a dispute between Tele Facil and a third party (Telmex) which went

on to Mexico’s specialized tribunals.?!!

Finally, Respondent’s third argument is that the measures at issue can be justified as bona
fide regulation in the public interest due to Mexico’s long history of regulation in the public

212

interest in the field of telecommunications.~'~ These regulations have sought the reduction

of interconnection fees in the interest of promoting competition.?!*

In its Rejoinder, Respondent maintains that “there isn’t an example of a Tribunal that have
[sic] agreed that a claim can be filed for the alleged expropriation of an asset that is
‘investment of an investment’ of an investor, unless the effects of the measure in question
have been so drastic that they eliminated the value of the investor’s investment.”?!*
Therefore, according to Respondent, the only claim Claimant can file under Article 1110
is an indirect expropriation which requires him to prove: “(i) that the rights in question
existed [...]; (ii) that the State interfered with these rights [...]; and (iii) that the effects of

this interference were equivalent to an expropriation of Tele Facil.”?!> Respondent denies

in the original).

Claimant’s contention that the IFT destroyed Tele Facil’s business contending that “Tele
Facil’s right to provide any of the [telecommunication] services [...] has not suffered any

changes, and the rate regime based on costs [...] did not interfere with the business.”?!°

In its Rejoinder, Respondent also insisted that Claimant’s alleged interconnection rights
are not an investment under NAFTA Article 1139.7!” Respondent asserts that Claimant
relies on “non-NAFTA jurisprudence” for the contention that contractual rights can be the
subject of expropriation.7!* Based on the terms of Article 1139, Respondent contends that
the interconnection rights are not “intangible property” because they cannot be bought,
sold or pledged?" nor they can be “interests arising from the commitment of capital or
other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory” because
they “have no relation whatsoever with capital contribution in any form, and least of all
with the participation that results from the contribution of other ‘resources’ according to

the circumstances described in Article 1139(h)(i) or (ii).”?2°

Finally, Respondent argues that an expropriation claim cannot be filed against the IFT’s

29221

measures because the IFT acted in this case “as a quasi-judicial entity”~~' and “judicial and

quasi-judicial decisions [...] taken in the course of resolving a dispute between private

parties cannot be held to amount to expropriation under Article 1110.”?22

measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation of such an
investment (“expropriation”), except:

(a) for a public purpose;
(b) on a non-discriminatory basis;
(c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1); and

(d) on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2
through 6.

To determine the existence of an unlawful expropriation in breach of NAFTA Article
1110(1), the Tribunal will follow a three-prong test that consists in asking: “(i) whether
there is an investment capable of being expropriated, (ii) whether that investment has in
fact been expropriated, and (iii) whether the conditions set [forth] in Article 1110(1)(a)-(d)
have been satisfied.”??> Claimant asked the Tribunal to follow this test.?*+ Respondent did
not oppose to this approach and the Tribunal agrees that it is the proper approach in this

case.
a. Is there an investment capable of being expropriated?

The Parties do not dispute, and for the Tribunal is clear, that for purposes of NAFTA Article
1139 there is an enterprise (Tele Facil) that constitutes an investment, there are shares held
by Claimant in such enterprise that also constitute an investment and a concession
agreement of Tele Facil that is likewise an investment. However, the Parties heavily
debated as to whether other investments, as alleged by Claimant, constituted an investment

capable of being expropriated.

In the Statement of Claim, Claimant alleged that two type of assets were expropriated: (i)

the “rights [...] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the

23 CL-027, Chemtura Corporation v. Government of Canada, UNCITRAL (Award, 2 August 2010) (Kaufmann-
Kohler, Brower, Crawford), 242.

interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017) and

ii) the rights of share ownership together with the rights to a return on Tele Facil’s
(ii) the rights of sh: hi hi ith the right Tele Facil’
profits.77°

225. During the course of the arbitration, Claimant varied this description, to an extent that the
Tribunal in the Hearing had to ask the specific question of what was the investment that
according to Claimant was subject to expropriation or to unfair and unequitable

treatment.?””
226. Inhis response, Claimant indicated that:

First, Claimants’ [sic] claims on the basis of Tele Facil’s rights
under the Interconnection Agreement as determined by the IFT in
Resolution 381. [T]hese rights constitute intangible property and
interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources
in the territory of a party to economic activity in such territory.

Second, because the IFT’s destruction of Tele Facil’s
interconnection rights under Resolution 381 caused the destruction
of the entire business venture, Claimant also claims for the loss of
Tele Facil, which meets the definition of “enterprise” under the [sic]
NAFTA.

Claimant also has standing to claim in relation to other assets
owned by the enterprise that were neutralized by the IFT’s conduct,
including the company’s Concession and the company’s lost
business income.”8

227. Therefore, according to Claimant, Tele Facil, Claimant’s shares in Tele Facil, the
Concession, Tele Facil’s business income and other assets were destroyed as a result of the

destruction of “Tele Facil’s rights under the Interconnection Agreement as determined by

the IFT in Resolution 381”? or, in the words of the Statement of Claim, Claimant alleges
that Mexico expropriated the “rights [...] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues

based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017).”?°

b. Did Claimant have rights under the interconnection agreement as

determined by Resolution 381?

Before determining whether the interconnection rights alleged by Claimant and described
in the preceding paragraph constitute an investment under NAFTA, the Tribunal must
determine (i) whether Tele Facil had such rights; (ii) if so, what type of rights were they.
This is an inquiry that must begin with an analysis of Mexican law.”*! The alleged rights
under the interconnection agreement as determined by Resolution 381 derive from
Mexican law. Both the alleged interconnection agreement between Tele Facil and Telmex
and any alleged rights under Resolution 381 are governed and derive from Mexican law.
Therefore, Claimant has the burden to prove that, under Mexican law, Tele Facil had the

rights that Claimant considers were expropriated. The Parties do not dispute this approach.

According to the Claimant, these rights derive from the combination of: (i) the alleged
agreement between Telmex and Tele Facil on certain terms of a standard interconnection
agreement proposed by Telmex (and among these terms the term related to the applicable

rates is of particular relevance) and; (ii) the IFT’s Resolution 381.

(i) The alleged interconnection agreement

Under Mexican law, as in most civil law jurisdictions, a contract is formed if there is object
and consent.2** In the case of an offer to execute a contract, consent arises from an offer

and the acceptance thereof.”*?

Article 42 of the FTL adds to this general rule of contracts an additional edge in the case
of interconnection agreements. If an interconnection contract between telecommunication
network carriers cannot be formed within 60 calendar days after one of the carrier requests
interconnection to the other, the IFT shall resolve the terms on which the parties could not
agree, at the request of one of the carriers.?*4 In other words, if within 60 calendar days
after an interconnection request is made, the telecommunication carriers cannot execute an
interconnection contract, the IFT can intervene to decide the disputed terms and mandate
the parties to execute it.2** Once the IFT resolves the disputed terms, the parties are obliged
to execute the interconnection contract”*® which is composed of the terms and conditions
agreed upon by the parties to the interconnection agreement and the disputed terms as

decided by IFT.2*7

On 7 August 2013, Tele Facil requested interconnection with Telmex.** Telmex
responded on 26 August 2013, by delivering a standard agreement for interconnection,

which included a reciprocal interconnection rate expiring on 31 December 2017.7*? The

interconnection rate proposed by Telmex was of USD 0.00975 per minute of use.*“? Tele
Facil only replied almost eleven months later, on 8 July 2014, with comments to the

interconnection agreement.”*!

Two relevant events occurred between the date of delivery of the draft by Telmex (26
August 2013) and the reply by Tele Facil (8 July 2014): (a) on 6 March 2014, the IFT
declared América Mévil, S.A.B. de C.V. and its subsidiaries, which included Telmex, as a
preponderant economic agent in the telecommunications sector”; and (b) on 26 March
2014, the IFT issued specific asymmetrical regulations, including the obligation of Telmex
to provide indirect interconnection and a special mandatory interconnection rate of MXN

0.2015, approximately USD 0.00172.743

The Parties dispute whether, under Mexican law, Tele Facil’s reply letter of July 2014
constitutes an acceptance of Telmex’s offer. The issue is relevant because if the letter
constitutes an acceptance, it would mean that there was consent on all of the terms and
conditions of the interconnection agreement between Telmex and Tele Facil, including the
rates but excluding indirect interconnection and portability, as of the date of the acceptance.
Tf the letter does not constitute an acceptance, it would mean that there was no consent on

the terms and conditions of interconnection and therefore no agreement on the rates.

The reference included in Tele Facil’s letter of July 2014 to Telmex is “Comments on the

draft local interconnection agreement” and it reads as follows:

interconnection services between Telmex and Tele Facil that you
kindly sent us on August 26, 2013 and that we have already been
reviewing with you.

Likewise, we ask that you sign the same agreement with the
company, Teléfonos del Noreste, S.A. de C.V., to whom we also call
upon to initiate negotiation of the interconnection agreement of
August 7, 2013.

We appreciate you taking into consideration our comments and
modify the version we have received so that Tele Facil may be ina
position to sign the draft agreement.>** (Emphasis added)

The second page of the letter contains the comments of Tele Facil to the draft
interconnection agreement, which are preceded by the following text: “[a]fter discussing
our concerns with you and after reviewing the draft agreement, Tele Facil has the following
comments and suggestions, which we would appreciate to be included in order to sign the
interconnection agreement.”**> Thereafter Tele Facil made several comments on the text
of the draft, particularly on indirect interconnection and portability, and suggested the

modification of certain clauses and the elimination of others.

Nothing in the text of the letter suggests that Tele Facil is accepting the draft
interconnection agreement, either conditionally or unconditionally. On the contrary, the
letter clearly indicates that Tele Facil is requesting modifications, that the agreement needs
to be signed, and that for Tele Facil to be in a position to sign the interconnection agreement

the modifications would have to be included in the agreement.

The Parties dispute if under Mexican law this letter constitutes a counteroffer. They also
dispute whether there was a legal term to accept the offer and if so, whether Tele Facil gave
its acceptance after the expiration of such term. The Tribunal does not consider necessary
to enter into these debates because the plain and clear text of the July 2014 letter indicates

that it does not constitute a letter of acceptance, but a letter with comments to the draft

provided by Telmex, acknowledging that the agreement must be signed and that Tele Facil
will sign the agreement if the changes are made. It is clear, and no contemporaneous
evidence on the record suggests otherwise, that Tele Facil would only accept an agreement
containing the modifications requested and that the signature of the agreement was required

to conclude the agreement.

239. But Tele Facil did not wait for Telmex’s comments or signature. On 11 July 2014, three
days after having sent the letter to Telmex requesting modifications to the draft for it to be
signed, Tele Facil initiated disagreement proceedings under FTL Article 42 before the IFT
to resolve the divergences between Tele Facil and Telmex over: (i) indirect interconnection

and; (ii) portability charges.”

It is undisputed that Telmex never signed the draft
interconnection agreement that it sent to Tele Facil on August 2013. It is also undisputed
that Tele Facil later submitted to the IFT that same unsigned draft with the request to initiate

disagreement proceedings only as regards the aforementioned two divergences.?*”

240. Based on the above, the Tribunal considers that Claimant has not proven, for purposes of
its claim in this arbitration, that under Mexican civil and commercial law there was an
agreement on the rates between Tele Facil and Telmex resulting from the draft submitted

by Telmex on August 2013.

241. It is undisputed that after Telmex’s draft agreement of August 2013 containing a
USD 0.00975 rate, a new rate regime applicable to Telmex, as the economic preponderant
agent, entered into force.”#* Under this new regime, Telmex could not charge a rate of USD
0.00975.*° This new legal and regulatory framework would have required Telmex and

Tele Facil to agree on a new rate. Claimant alleged, but was not able to prove, that under

See | 111 above. This paragraph originally started with the following line: “Even assuming, arguendo, that there
was an interconnection agreement, including an agreement on rates, between the Telmex and Tele Facil,”. This line
was removed because the remaining arbitrators consider that the evaluation of such assumption was unnecessary and
added nothing to the conclusion.

this new legal framework Telmex renewed its USD 0.00975 rate offer of August 2013.
There is no contemporaneous document evidencing the purported renewal of the offer and
Claimant’s witnesses were unconvincing and contradictory in this regard. The Tribunal
finds it difficult to believe that an alleged agreement to renew the offer of what Claimant
considers the key business of Tele Facil was never documented by a letter or email. Given
that Telmex and Tele Facil did not reach an agreement within the terms of FTL Article 42,
Telmex could then request the IFT’s intervention to decide on the rates. The IFT decided

on the applicable rate through Resolution 127.7”

In the absence of convincing evidence as to the existence of an interconnection agreement
between Telmex and Tele Facil, the inevitable conclusion is that Tele Facil had no “rights

under the Interconnection Agreement” that could have been determined by Resolution 381.

But even if Tele Facil had a valid and binding interconnection agreement with Telmex
under Mexican law resulting from the draft of August 2013 in combination with the letter
of July 2014, or from any alleged renewal of the offer resulting from such draft, the
question remains as to whether Resolution 381 granted interconnection rate rights to Tele
Facil that were later on expropriated or subjected to treatment that amounts to the violation

of NAFTA.

Resolution 381 “by which the plenary of the [IFT] determine[d] the disputed
interconnection terms between Tele Facil México, S.A. de C.V. and the companies
Teléfonos de México, S.A.B. de C.V. and Teléfonos del Noroeste, S.A. de C.V.” was

well as articles 1, 7, 8 and 12 of the Organic Statute of the Federal Telecommunications

Institute, through Resolution P/IFT/261114/381 722

The Parties do not dispute that the IFT is an organ of the Mexican State, created through
an amendment of the Mexican Constitution?>? and that under Article 42 of the FTL, the
IFT had authority to “resolve the [interconnection] conditions that could not be agreed [by

the public telecommunications network carriers] within [...] 60 calendar days,” counted

from “the moment one of the parties request so.”?°+

Under the new FTBL, the IFT retained the powers and authorities related to the resolution
of divergences in the interconnection conditions not agreed upon by the carriers.?> Article

7 of the FTBL provides as follows as regards the IFT:

The Institute is an autonomous public agency, independent
regarding its decisions and functioning, with legal status and own
resources, and has the purpose of regulating and promoting
competition and efficient development of telecommunications and
broadcasting in the scope of the powers conferred by the
Constitution and in the terms specified in this Law and other
applicable legal provisions.

The Institute is responsible for the regulation, promotion and
supervision of the use, enjoyment and exploitation of radio
spectrum, orbital — resources, satellite services, public
telecommunication networks and broadcasting and
telecommunication services provision, as well as access to active
and passive infrastructure and other essential goods, without
prejudice to the powers corresponding to other authorities in
accordance with the corresponding laws.

The Second Title of the FTBL refers to the functioning of the IFT and its Chapter I, Section
I, deals with the powers and composition of the IFT. Article 15 provides that the IFT, for
the exercise of its powers, shall: “[r]esolve and establish the interconnection terms and
conditions that the concessionaires may not have agreed upon regarding their public

telecommunication networks, in accordance with the provisions of this law.”257

When Tele Facil initiated disagreement proceedings under Article 42 of the FTL before the
IFT, it submitted that there were only two disagreements between Tele Facil and Telmex:
(i) indirect interconnection and; (ii) portability charges.* Tele Facil did not submit a

disagreement on the rates.

In its response to Tele Facil’s submission,”** Telmex filed a different draft agreement than

the one presented to Tele Facil on 26 August 2013. The draft submitted by Telmex to the

IFT did not include portability charges and allowed indirect interconnection.”© However,
Telmex argued that the parties had a disagreement on the applicable rates and requested

the IFT to determine the rates.?°!

The Parties do not dispute that the IFT decided on the divergences submitted by Tele Facil
(indirect interconnection and portability charges). The issue is whether Resolution 381
upheld the rates contained in the draft presented by Telmex to Tele Facil on 26 August
2013 and if so, whether as a result thereof, Resolution 381 granted Tele Facil the right to a

particular rate and to earn revenues based on such rate.

Claimant considers that Resolution 381 granted Tele Facil the “rights [...] to interconnect
with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per
minute of use through 2017).”?© This rate granted Tele Facil, according to Claimant, a
competitive advantage. Without such advantage, says Claimant, Tele Facil could simply

not survive.

Claimant considers further that the operative part of Resolution 381, properly interpreted
in conjunction with section Fifth thereof, clearly granted Tele Facil a right to charge and
being charged specific interconnection rates: on the one hand, to charge the interconnection
rate of USD 0.00975 allegedly agreed by Telmex, and on the other hand, being charged the
lower rate determined for Telmex as a preponderant agent. Respondent, in turn, considers
that Resolution 381 did not decide on the applicable interconnection rates but simply
dismissed Telmex’s request to decide on the rates because Telmex did not prove that a

dispute on the rates existed.
The operative part of Resolution 381 provides as follows:

S.A. de C.V., and the companies Teléfonos de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V.
and Teléfonos del Noroeste, S.A. de C.V. must interconnect their
telecommunications networks and initiate the provision of the
corresponding interconnection services. In that same term, such
companies must execute the interconnection agreement of their
telecommunications networks pursuant to the terms and conditions
determined in the FIFTH Consideration section of this Resolution.
Once the corresponding agreement has been executed, they must
submit jointly or individually an original or certified copy of the
agreement to the Federal Telecommunications Institute, within the
30 (thirty) business days following its execution, in order to register
it in the Public Telecommunications Registry.°°

255. The relevant portion of the Fifth Consideration referred to in the operative part of

Resolution 381 and invoked by Claimant reads as follows:

[T]he Institute considers Telmex and Telnor’s arguments to be
inadmissible, given the fact that the interconnection rates were
completely determined by Telmex and Telnor in the draft
interconnection agreement sent to Tele Facil on August 26, 2013,
and which Tele Facil had full knowledge of and consented to the
same.

Consequently, Telmex and Telnor’s argument in connection with an
alleged disagreement on interconnection rates is dismissed, since
the aforementioned rates were defined in the draft agreement for the
provision of fixed local interconnection services and its exhibits,
sent by Telmex and Telnor to Tele Facil, and which are part of the
evidence in this record, particularly the ones indicated in
Background IX of this Resolution.

Therefore, the only interconnection conditions not agreed upon by
the parties in the process of negotiating to execute the
corresponding interconnection agreement are those which are
expressly cited in the Fifth Consideration section of this resolution.

Furthermore, there is no document in the record that proves that
Telmex and Telnor claimed to be in disagreement with the
interconnection rates during the time the parties held negotiations
to execute the corresponding interconnection agreement.

257.

This is, Telmex and Telnor’s request for the Institute to determine
interconnection rates that were not agreed with Tele Facil, does not
meet the legal premise established in article 42 of the FTL, since
from reviewing the evidence in the record of this proceeding, there
is no evidence that Telmex and Telnor expressed their disagreement
with the interconnection rates, nor that a formal request to begin
negotiations regarding the aforementioned interconnection rates
was performed and that in fact, the 60 (sixty) day period established
in article 42 of the FTL has elapsed without the aforementioned
concessionaires reaching an agreement on the rates, therefore
Telmex and Telnor’s request is dismissed.

In the following paragraphs, the Institute, under the terms
established in article 42 of the FTL, strives to resolve the points of
disagreement in interconnection matters that were submitted for its
consideration, and which according to its judgment result
admissible from Tele Facil, Telmex and Telnor. 264

At the outset the Tribunal notes that the text of the relevant part of Resolution 381 on which
Claimant bases his claim is poorly drafted and may result in confusions and differences of

interpretation. As mentioned in the Hearing, the drafting is at least “unfortunate.”°°

However, Resolution 381 cannot be interpreted by taking in isolation the literality of
certain sections. First, an interpretation of Resolution 381 requires the analysis of
Resolution 381 in context, that is to say, considering the entire text of the Resolution and
not isolated sections thereof. Second, the interpretation requires a consideration of the
provisions of Mexican law applicable to Resolution 381 and particularly those that define
the powers of the regulator (the IFT). Resolution 381 was issued in furtherance to the
powers granted to the IFT by the Mexican Constitution and the legal provisions of Mexican
law, particularly the FTL and the FTBL. Those provisions define the scope and limits of
the powers and authorities of the IFT and therefore, the IFT’s decisions could not exceed

such limits and powers. Third, as several tribunals have indicated, this Tribunal must grant

some deference to the regulator in technical matters such as the ones subject matter of the

FTL and Resolution 381. 7°

258. It is correct, as submitted by Claimant, that Resolution 381 provided that Tele Facil and
Telmex “must interconnect their telecommunications networks and [...] execute the
interconnection agreement of their telecommunications networks pursuant to the terms and
conditions determined in the FIFTH Consideration section of this Resolution.” It is also
correct that the Fifth Consideration provides that “the interconnection rates were
completely determined by Telmex and Telnor in the draft interconnection agreement sent
to Tele Facil on August 26, 2013, and which Tele Facil had full knowledge of and

268 and that the same Fifth Consideration adds that “Telmex and

consented to the same
Telnor’s argument in connection with an alleged disagreement on interconnection rates is
dismissed, since the aforementioned rates were defined in the draft agreement for the
provision of fixed local interconnection services and its exhibits, sent by Telmex and
Telnor to Tele Facil, and which are part of the evidence in this record, particularly the ones
indicated in Background IX of this Resolution.”?
259. But is the aforementioned language, as read and interpreted by Claimant, sufficient and
clear enough to grant Tele Facil the right to charge a specific rate? The answer, in the view

of the Tribunal, is clearly in the negative for the reasons explained below.

260. In Resolution 381 the IFT makes a clear distinction between “the points of disagreement

in interconnection matters that were submitted for its consideration, and which according

99270

to its judgment result admissible’ and those points submitted to the IFT that are not

admissible. In the words of the IFT:

266 See i.e., CL-061, S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada, UNCITRAL (Partial Award, 13 November 2000)
(Hunter, Schwartz, Chiasson), | 263; CL-043, GAMI Investments, Inc. v. The Government of the United Mexican

[T]here is no document in the record that proves that Telmex and
Telnor claimed to be in disagreement with the interconnection rates
during the time the parties held negotiations to execute the
corresponding interconnection agreement.

This is, Telmex and Telnor’s request for the Institute to determine
interconnection rates that were not agreed with Tele Facil, does not
meet the legal premise established in article 42 of the FTL, since
from reviewing the evidence in the record of this proceeding, there
is no evidence that Telmex and Telnor expressed their disagreement
with the interconnection rates, nor that a formal request to begin
negotiations regarding the aforementioned interconnection rates
was performed and that in fact, the 60 (sixty) day period established
in article 42 of the FTL has elapsed without the aforementioned
concessionaires reaching an agreement on the rates, therefore
Telmex and Telnor’s request is dismissed.”"

The reason for considering inadmissible the submission by Telmex on the alleged dispute
on the rates was that, according to the IFT, there was no evidence of a dispute on the rates.
The IFT assumed that such dispute did not exist because the rates were defined in the
August 2013 draft agreement for the provision of fixed local interconnection services and

its exhibits, sent by Telmex to Tele Facil.

In Resolution 381 the IFT clearly expressed that under the terms established in Article 42
of the FTL, the IFT “strives to resolve the points of disagreement in interconnection matters
that were submitted for its consideration, and which according to its judgment result

admissible from Tele Facil, Telmex and Telnor.”?’?

Therefore, Resolution 381
undoubtedly decided only on the issues that were submitted for consideration of the IFT
and which the IFT considered admissible. Those issues are exclusively the indirect
interconnection and portability. The alleged dispute on the rates submitted by Telmex was

not decided because it was considered inadmissible.

Considering that Telmex had submitted a new draft in which it accepted the issues of

indirect interconnection and portability, the IFT did not have to decide on those issues and

211 C.029, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), pp. 13-14.
2? C.029, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), p. 14.

73

therefore ordered Tele Facil and Telmex to interconnect. The text of the reasoning of

Resolution 381 leaves no doubt on the point:

From reviewing the parties’ positions, it is concluded that Tele Facil
as well as Telmex and Telnor expressed their will to execute the
local interconnection agreement including the provision of
indirect interconnection service and the modifications required to
the corresponding definitions. Likewise, Telmex and Telnor
accepted to eliminate from the agreement the portability clause as
requested by Tele Facil. The previous modifications were reflected
in the interconnection agreement draft which was presented as
evidence in Telmex and Telnor’s Reply, which has evidentiary value
in terms of articles 197 and 200 of the Federal Code of Civil
Proceedings (hereinafter, the “CFPC”), of supplemental
application pursuant to article 8 section V of the FTL.

By virtue of the parties being in agreement with the interconnection
terms and conditions, the corresponding draft agreement would
allow compliance with the FTL, pursuant to articles 1792, 1794,
1803 and 1807 of the Federal Civil Code that is supplemental to the
FTL pursuant to article 8, section IV of the FTL.

Consequently, having dismissed Telmex’s arguments, and there
existing an agreement between Tele Facil, Telmex and Telnor to
formalize the Agreement for the Provision of Local
Interconnection Services offered by Telmex and Telnor as
evidence in Telmex and Telnor’s Reply, such concessionaires are
obligated to grant the interconnection requested by Tele Facil.*”
(Emphasis added)

264. In sum, the Tribunal considers that a reading of Resolution 381 in context leads to the

following conclusions:

a) Tele Facil submitted for resolution only the issues on indirect interconnection and

portability.

b) In its response, Telmex accepted to grant indirect interconnection and to eliminate

portability charges, but Telmex submitted that there was a dispute on the rates.

c

The IFT considered that the dispute on the rates was inadmissible and in doing so, it
justified the inadmissibility by indicating that there was no evidence of a dispute on the
rates and assumed that the rates had been agreed upon by the parties according to the

draft submitted by Tele Facil.

d) The IFT considered that since there was an agreement on the pending issues (indirect
connection and portability) and the alleged dispute on the rates was inadmissible

because it was already agreed upon, the parties had to proceed with the interconnection.

e

Nowhere in Resolution 381 did the IFT decide a dispute on the rates. On the contrary,
it clearly indicated that in its view there was no dispute because, according to IFT, the
rates had been agreed, and that therefore, the dispute, as submitted by Telmex, was
inadmissible. The only basis for the IFT to consider that the rates had been agreed was

the draft submitted to Tele Facil, the August 2013 draft that Telmex never signed.

The IFT dismissed Telmex’s request for the resolution of an alleged dispute on the rates
because, according to IFT, there was no dispute on the rates between Telmex and Tele
Facil. The Tribunal must then determine whether the IFT’s conclusion resulted in the

granting of rights to Tele Facil.

As mentioned before, in interpreting Resolution 381, the Tribunal must consider which are
the powers of the IFT under Mexican law. The IFT must perform its duties under the FTBL
in the scope of the powers conferred by the Constitution and in the terms specified in this

law and other applicable legal provisions.

The interpretation proposed by Claimant would mean that even though the IFT expressly
dismissed and declared inadmissible Telmex’ submission on the rates because no dispute
was proven, the reference to the purported agreement on the rates had the same effects as
if the IFT had issued a decision on a dispute on the rates. It would also result in that the
reference to Telmex’s draft of interconnection agreement in Resolution 381 would grant
such draft the effects of a full final agreement, even if the parties had not agreed on certain

terms and conditions that nevertheless were not presented to the IFT as disagreements.

214 This

 

It is undisputed that, under Mexican law, the powers of IFT as regards interconnection
disputes are limited. The FTL grants the IFT the authority to decide on interconnection
disputes submitted to it. It also has the authority to dismiss a dispute if it considers that the
applicant did not prove the existence of the dispute. But nowhere in the FTL or in other
provisions of Mexican law is the IFT authorized to decide or grant rights over terms and
conditions of an interconnection agreement if such terms and conditions have not been
submitted as disputed terms. Moreover, there is no evidence that the IFT has the legal
authority to determine whether or not the draft agreement submitted by Tele Facil was a

full and final agreement binding on Telmex.

In Resolution 381 the IFT dismissed, on grounds of inadmissibility, the dispute on the rates
submitted by Telmex. According to Resolution 381, the reason for the dismissal was that,
according to the IFT, Telmex had not proven that there was a disagreement on the rates.
The IFT considered that there was an agreement on the rates based on its assumption or
understanding that the draft submitted by Tele Facil contained a full agreement on all terms
and conditions, except for indirect interconnection and portability. But there was not such
agreement. An IFT’s declaration that there is no dispute on the rates because they had been
agreed does not decide a dispute on the rates and does not grant rights to Tele Facil.?”* The
interpretation proposed by Claimant would result in an absurdity and in the IFT acting ultra
vires. It would be an absurdity because it would mean that the dispute on the rates is at the
same time dismissed and decided (i.e., notwithstanding the dismissal of the dispute on the
rates, a decision is made on such rates). It would also mean that the IFT would be acting
ultra vires because it would be granting rights over rates that are not disputed and validating

and giving effects to an unproven contract that one of the parties (Telmex) disputed.

In sum, Resolution 381 did not decide a dispute on the rates because it considered that there
was no dispute. The IFT has no authority to decide whether or not the parties to an

interconnection agreement have agreed on certain terms and conditions, it only has the

sentence originally started with the text “And even if there was,”. The remaining arbitrators consider that

including such assumption (arguendo) was unnecessary as it added nothing to the conclusion. The introductory words
were therefore removed.

authority to decide on those terms and conditions that are disputed and submitted for its

consideration.?”>

The IFT may have erred in drafting Resolution 381 and indicating that Tele Facil and
Telmex had agreed on the rates. Clearly the IFT could have done better. But a party cannot
attempt to benefit from such errors, much less when the party’s interpretation based on
those errors would be contrary to Mexican law as it would result in the regulator clearly

exceeding its powers.

From the facts of the case and the considerations above, the Tribunal concludes that Tele
Facil opportunistically foresaw a business window and attempted to take advantage of the
same. Tele Facil received a draft interconnection agreement from Telmex and inexplicably
waited for almost eleven months with no further action on the draft. The draft
interconnection agreement contained reciprocal interconnection rates of USD 0.00975. But
when Telmex was declared a predominant agent and forced to charge a lower
interconnection rate (USD 0.00172), Tele Facil rushed to send comments to Telmex on the
draft interconnection agreement, did not wait for Telmex’s reaction to its comments, and
submitted a dispute to the IFT on the indirect interconnection and portability charges. Tele
Facil’s bet was that if the dispute on indirect interconnection and portability was decided
in its favor, as it was, then Tele Facil could claim that it had an agreement where it could
charge the interconnection rate reflected in Telmex’s draft of August 2013, but Telmex
could only charge the maximum rate allowed as from 26 March 2014, that is to say, an
interconnection rate of MXN 0.2015, approximately USD 0.00172.2”° This would have

given an important margin to Tele Facil until 31 December 2017.

Tele Facil based this business opportunity on several assumptions. It assumed, incorrectly,
that it had a valid and binding agreement with Telmex. The Tribunal has already explained
that there is no evidence of such an agreement before this Tribunal. On the contrary, the

evidence shows that there was no agreement on the rates and Telmex challenged the

275 For the sake of clarity, the remaining arbitrators wish to stress that even though the IFT also has authority to decide
whether or not there is a dispute as to a rate, that does not change the conclusion that the IFT does not have the
authority to decide whether or not an agreement on certain terms and conditions legally exists between the parties.

existence of such agreement before the IFT. Tele Facil further assumed that even though
the alleged agreement between Tele Facil and Telmex contained reciprocal rates, by
operation of the new regulations applicable to Telmex as a preponderant agent a differential
rate would be applicable. But there is no convincing?” evidence that Telmex maintained
the original terms of the draft of August 2013 after the amendments in the legislation or
that it ever agreed to such differential rates or that such differential rates would apply by
operation of law. Tele Facil also assumed that, as a result of the unfortunate drafting of
certain sections of Resolution 381, such Resolution granted Tele Facil rights over certain
rates despite the fact that, on the one hand, it is clear that under Mexican law the IFT did
not have the power or the authority to decide whether or not there was a binding agreement
on the rates between Tele Facil and Telmex and, on the other, Resolution 381 dismissed

Telmex’s submission that there was a dispute on the rates but did not solve such dispute.

In sum, the IFT was legally authorized only to decide interconnection disputes between the
parties. Tele Facil did not submit a dispute on the interconnection rates. Telmex submitted
that there was a dispute on the interconnection rates but the IFT dismissed this claim
because it assumed, incorrectly, that there was an agreement on the rates. In fact, the IFT
ordered Telmex and Tele Facil to interconnect referring to the “rates” as if there was a final
and binding agreement between Tele Facil and Telmex on all matters, including rates.
However, the IFT did not have the authority to determine whether or not there was a valid
and binding agreement between Tele Facil and Telmex on all matters, including rates. Tele
Facil attempted and now Claimant is attempting to take advantage of a text that, that even
though poorly drafted, cannot be interpreted in a sense that results in a violation of Mexican

law.

Neither Tele Facil nor Claimant may interpret an act of the IFT in a sense that would result
in the IFT acting ultra vires and pretend to derive rights from such an interpretation. The
IFT’s intervention was limited to resolving the two disputed terms Tele Facil invoked.

Therefore, Resolution 381 cannot be interpreted as providing a decision on the rates.?”*

279 C.040, Confirmation of Criteri

If the IFT did not have the authority to rule on whether or not there was an agreement
between Tele Facil and Telmex and could only decide on the disputes submitted to it, the
confirmation of criteria that resulted in Decree 77 is fully justified. Tele Facil requested the
IFT to enforce Resolution 381 interpreting that such resolution had approved the rates
contained in the August 2013 draft agreement originally submitted by Telmex. Telmex, in
turn had challenged such an agreement on the rates by requesting the IFT to decide the
dispute on the rates. The confirmation of criteria was aimed at whether, in addition to
deciding on the dispute submitted to the IFT and compelling interconnection, the IFT had
the power to compel the execution of an interconnection agreement in the forms and terms

determined in Resolution 381.2”

On 8 April 2015, the IFT issued Decree 77 which stated what, in the Tribunal’s view and
according to the evidence submitted in this arbitration, is clear: that the IFT’s powers were
restricted to resolving the conditions not agreed upon by Tele Facil and Telmex, indirect
interconnection and portability charges, and that no decision had been issued on the
rates.7°° Decree 77 simply clarified what would have resulted from an interpretation in
good faith and in context of the wording of Resolution 381. Neither Tele Facil nor
Claimant can validly claim that a clarification of Resolution 381, the effect of which is to
specify that an interpretation of Resolution 381 cannot result in the IFT exceeding its

powers, is a violation of rights that were never granted.

Finally, through Resolution 127, the IFT decided the dispute on the rates submitted by
Telmex as to the interconnection rates and determined a rate of MXN 0.004179
(USD 0.000253).”*! Again, in Resolution 381 the IFT had dismissed the dispute on the
rates submitted by Telmex. Therefore, Resolution 127 is the decision on a matter that was

pending: the dispute on the rates.

The Tribunal therefore finds that (a) Resolution 381 did not grant rights to Tele Facil;
(b) Tele Facil simply made a bet, based on incorrect assumptions and interpretations, that
Resolution 381 had upheld an interconnection rate, which it did not; (c) through Decree
77, the IFT had every right to interpret Resolution 381 in accordance with Mexican law:
— acknowledging that it had limited powers when resolving disputed terms —. This
interpretation was not only confirmed by the experts in this case, but also consistently by
Mexican courts.”*? Finally, (d) the IFT had the obligation to decide the dispute on the

interconnection rate through Resolution 127.

The analysis above leads to the inevitable conclusion that Tele Facil had no “rights under
the Interconnection Agreement as determined by the IFT in Resolution 381.” Thus,
Claimant cannot claim that a right it does not have under Mexican law is capable of being

expropriated.

As stated above, Tele Facil had, at best, a business opportunity, a bet based on its own
interpretations and speculations, that was proven wrong. The speculative nature of the
business opportunity that Claimant unsuccessfully attempts to qualify as “rights” at the
core of the business of Tele Facil is further confirmed by the overwhelming evidence on
the record. This alleged opportunity and the income related thereto were never included in
any business plan prepared by Tele Facil”**. There is no explanation for the delay in
accepting Telmex’s offer for interconnection and then Tele Facil’s rush once Telmex was
declared a preponderant agent. The main source of income of Tele Facil, according to the
evidence on the record, did not depend on the alleged “rights” purportedly granted by
Resolution 381. On the contrary, the vast majority of the income depended on different
lines of business, unrelated to these “rights”, lines of business that Tele Facil could have
pursued but it decided not to.?*4 Claimant cannot ask this Tribunal to find Respondent liable
for Tele Facil having failed on a bet supported on assumptions and speculations that were

proven incorrect.

285.

In addition to the alleged interconnection rights with Telmex defined under Resolution 381,
Claimant also claims for the expropriation of Tele Facil and of the shares held by Claimant
in Tele Facil. According to Claimant, those investments were destroyed as a result of the
actions of Mexico through the IFT and the destruction of the rights under Resolution 381,

to an extent such that both Tele Facil and Mr. Nelson’s shares in Tele Facil lack any value.

Considering that the Tribunal has already concluded that Resolution 381 did not grant
rights on interconnection rates to Tele Facil, there could have been no impact on Tele Facil
or its shares as a result of the actions following Resolution 381. Moreover, as already
mentioned in paragraph 281 above, there is no evidence whatsoever that the income of Tele
Facil or the value of its shares were depending on the existence of such alleged rights. On
the contrary, the overwhelming majority of the evidence on the record suggests that the
main lines of business of Tele Facil, as planned from the conception of the investment in
Mexico, were unrelated to a difference in the rates. Moreover, there is no evidence that
after Telmex was declared a preponderant agent and the opportunity to take advantage of
the difference in the interconnection rates arose, the business plans of Tele Facil changed.
The main lines of business of Tele Facil were completely unrelated with what Claimant
now portraits as the core business of Tele Facil (the differential in the rates) and Tele Facil
simply decided, with no reasonable business explanation, to abandon such main lines of
business. If Tele Facil or the shares lost value, such loss is the result of a business decision

of Tele Facil and its shareholders and not of actions or omissions of Respondent.

The Tribunal therefore finds that there is no violation of NAFTA Article 1110.

DID RESPONDENT BREACH ARTICLE 1105 OF NAFTA?
(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimant’s Position

According to Claimant, the IFT’s three measures purportedly aiming at repudiating

Resolution 381 also violated NAFTA Article 1105.7 Claimant contends that the IFT

285 Statement of Claim (7 November 2017), [ 436.

“arbitrarily, discriminatorily and secretly repudiated the interconnection terms established

in Resolution 381 with the effect of gutting Claimants’ investments in Mexico.”?8°

Focusing first in the text of NAFTA Article 1105 and NAFTA Free Trade Commission
Notes of Interpretation regarding this provision, Claimant concludes that the concept of
“fair and equitable treatment” in Article 1105’s first paragraph “is part of the customary
international minimum standard of treatment and, thus, its content is defined exclusively

by customary international law.”?°7

Regarding the standard of “fair and equitable treatment”, Claimant refers to the formulation
of such standard in the Waste Management v. Mexico decision. After citing the award,
Claimant explains that under this decision, different types of State misconduct may fall
below the minimum standard of treatment and they fall into three categories:

(i) arbitrariness, (ii) lack of due process; and (iii) discrimination.**

In Claimant’s view, “a State acts arbitrarily, in violation of international law, when it
conducts itself not on the basis of a system of law, but rather based on its own unrestricted
will.”8° Claimant infers this definition from the Cargill v. Mexico award, which cited the
judgment of a chamber of the International Court of Justice in the ELSI case.””° In this
sense, Claimant cites to NAFTA cases to imply that a State’s measure is not based on a

system of law when there is “an abrupt change in the treatment of a foreign investor

contrary to law or when it is “unsupported by a reasonable and established policy

rationale.”?°? Claimant also refers to CAFTA-DR cases to strengthen his interpretation.””?

289. Based on this definition of the standard, Claimant contends that the IFT’s Compliance Unit

confirmation criteria and Decree 77 were arbitrary.?”*

290. Regarding the lack of due process, Claimant associates this type of misconduct with “[a]
serious failure in the administration of justice”?’> which “is sometimes described in terms
of a ‘complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process’ or a ‘denial
of justice.’”?°° Claimant adds that “[t]he hallmarks of a denial of justice are a State’s failure
to provide foreign investors notice of, or an opportunity to be heard in, administrative and
judicial proceedings such that the process is rendered fundamentally unfair.”?°” In the
context of judicial proceedings Claimant cites the Azinian v. Mexico case to explain “if the
relevant courts refuse to entertain a suit, if they subject it to undue delay, or if they
administer justice in a seriously inadequate way” to conclude that this standard cover at

least “two types of misconduct where the State engages in unfair discrimination or commits

gross incompetence in the administration of justice.”?°*

there is no statement by Mr. Contreras denying this allegation*®® and questions
Mr. Gorra’s witness statement, intending to deny the existence of those instructions, for
not being present at the meeting in which Mr. Contreras’ instructions were delivered to Mr.

Sanchez Henkel.*”

Claimant also asserts that if it hadn’t been for Mr. Contreras instructions there would be no
explanation of why Mr. Sanchez Henkel on 12 January 2015 first assured Tele Facil’s
representatives that the IFT would enforce Resolution 381 but later changed its mind.*!°
Further, Claimant alleges that the fact that Decree 77 addressed only Mr. Sanchez Henkel
request of confirmation criteria and not Telmex’s arguments regarding the inconsistency
of the rate with the new regulatory regime, “suggest[s] that the path chosen for the
destruction of Tele Facil’s business, and protection of Telmex, was carefully orchestrated

from the inside [of the IFT].”*"!

Claimant refers to Respondent’s and Mr. Gorra’s explanation of Mr. Sanchez Henkel’s
request for confirmation criteria — that the scope of Resolution 381 needed to be
determined because both Telmex and Tele Facil had submitted complaints — and stresses
the contradiction between such an explanation and Respondent’s prior statements that
before Telmex filed its request for confirmation criteria, which happened after

Mr. Sanchez Henkel’s request, the IFT had not heard from it?

Claimant also contends that Respondent did not provide a reasonable explanation for

Decree 77’s reversal of Resolution 381 and the IFT’s interpretation of its limited authority

to resolve interconnection disputes*!? and contends that Decree 77 had “extreme

Claimant also alleges that the differences between a draft version of Decree 77 and its final
version reveals its arbitrariness because according to the draft version, the disputing parties
could themselves seek to enforce their rights in Mexico’s commercial courts but the final
version eliminated this prerogative, leaving Tele Facil with the only options of
renegotiating the agreed rates or refusing to renegotiate them.*'> Finally, Claimant
contends that he finds disturbing the erratic swing of the IFT’s decision-making between

Resolution 381 and Decree 77.3!

Regarding Decree 77, Claimant also emphasized on the reasons why he believes it was
unprecedented. In this respect, Claimant referred to Mr. Gorra’s witness statement, which
attempted to show that the Pleno regularly issues decrees like Decree 77 and explained that
the decrees brought up by Mr. Gorra are distinguishable.*!” Claimant also emphasized that

b. — Respondent’s Position

Respondent asserts that the IFT’s measures challenged by Claimant under NAFTA Article
1105 “pertain to the adjudication of a dispute between Tele Facil and Telmex with respect
to the terms of interconnection that each says should apply in the commercial relationship
between them” therefore, Claimant can only assert a claim of denial of justice “which has
a more onerous set of requirements.”** Respondent cites extensively to the United States
submission under NAFTA Article 1128 in the Eli Lilly case**4 and later concludes that
“none of the required elements of denial of justice at customary international law have been
established with respect to any of the impugned administrative resolutions or court
decisions.”**> Further, Respondent refers to the IFT’s measures and the Specialized Courts’

judgments as stated below.

Regarding Resolution 381, Respondent asserts that the IFT concluded that there was no
disagreement on rates and therefore, requirements set forth in article 42 of FTL were not
met. According to Respondent “[t]he meaning and effect of Resolution 381 became the
subject of conflicting submissions to the IFT by both Tele Facil and Telmex.”?°
Nonetheless, “there was no denial of justice to Tele Facil in the proceedings [that followed]

Resolution 381, or in IFT’s alleged failure to enforce said resolution.”>27

With respect to Decree 77, Respondent relies on Mr. Gorra’s witness statement, which
explains that in a criteria confirmation request, the parties are not asked to state their
positions, it does not generate rights or obligations and in this case, Decree 77 was only a
clarification of the scope of Resolution 381.°*7° Respondent indicates that the finding in

Decree 77 is “entirely within the realm of reason” and that “given the consistency of the

court decisions, one can only conclude that Decree 77 was legally correct.”*”? Respondent
also asserts that under the FTL, every concessionaire has a right to request a hearing with
the IFT and that in this case Tele Facil presented four written submissions and met with
the head of the IFT’s Compliance Unit and before the Pleno of the IFT,*”° therefore,
“{t]here was no denial of justice to Tele Facil.”**! Respondent notes that Tele Facil

challenged Decree 77 through an amparo proceeding.**?

As long as Resolution 127 is concerned, Respondent states that the IFT resolved the
disagreement on the rates “based on the Regulated Rates 2015 published on December
2014 in accordance with Article 137 of the FLTB through the Rate Agreement of 2015.”3
Respondent concludes that through Resolution 127 the IFT did not deny justice to Tele
Facil because the latter “had notice of the proceeding and made submissions” and “[t]he
IFT’s decision was reasoned and fully transparent.”*** Respondent also observes that Tele

Facil challenged Resolution 127 through an amparo proceeding and later withdrew from
it.335

On the Amparo proceedings 35 1/2014 filed by Telmex against Resolution 381, Respondent
indicates that Tele Facil participated in each stage of this proceeding, provided evidence,
pleadings and appealed the judgment (which was later withdrawn), as an interested
party.*°° Accordingly, Respondent contends, “Claimant cannot affirm seriously that access

to justice has been denied.”**”

On the Amparo proceedings 1381/2015 filed by Tele Facil against Decree 77, Respondent
notes that “Tele Facil sought to challenge the 1381/2015 judgment through appeal 35/2016,

which was rejected by the First Collegiate Court because its submission was untimely.”?7*

Finally, on the Amparo proceedings 1694/2015 filed by Tele Facil against Resolution 127,
Respondent recalls that the Second District Judge denied it and that Tele Facil appealed

the judgment but later withdrew from it.**?

With respect to these measures, Respondent considers that as “adjudicative bodies — the
Pleno and the specialized tribunals — considered the arguments of both parties and gave

reasons for their decisions.”*4°

Respondent refers to the Azinian decision, which held that “holding a State internationally
liable for judicial decisions does not [...] entitle a claimant to seek international review of
the national court decisions” and that a claimant “must show either a denial of justice, or a

pretence of form to achieve an internationally unlawful end.”**!

Moreover, Respondent points out to certain paragraphs of the Statement of Claim that show
that Claimant “have spun a series of allegations amounting to collusion between IFT and
Telmex to ensure that Telmex would defeat Tele Facil in their ongoing interconnection rate

dispute.”

On this regard, Respondent alleges that Claimant’s allegations “are based
solely on the illogical premise that IFT would wish to favor the interests of Telmex,
recently declared a PEA and subject of a zero rate over the interests of a new entrant in the

market”**? and that “[r]emoving this allegation of collusion or conspiracy, one is left with

specialist decision-makers arriving at decision on a 4-3 majority vote that Tele Facil simply

does not like.”*44

In its Rejoinder, Respondent emphasizes that: (i) the concept of denial of justice applies to
administratively adjudicatory proceedings as well as court proceedings; (ii) the thresholds
to establish a denial of justice is very high; (iii) it does not suffice to establish that domestic
adjudicators have erred, misapplied or misinterpreted domestic law; and; (iv) a claim of
denial of justice can only be based on adjudicative measures that are final, which means
that a claimant must exhaust its rights of appeal unless obvious futility or manifest

inefficiency.*#°
(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

As stated previously, Claimant alleges that Respondent breached its obligation of

according fair and equitable treatment. Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1105(1),

1. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another
Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair
and equitable treatment and full protection and security.

From the text of the treaty, it is clear that the obligation of fair and equitable treatment is
limited to the treatment of “investments of investors”. Therefore, before reviewing
Claimant’s allegations of unfair and inequitable treatment, the Tribunal must first clarify
what is the investment that, according to Claimant, suffered from unfair and inequitable

treatment.

As stated above, the expropriation claim assumed that Claimant had an investment

consisting of “rights [...] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the

29346

interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017) until 31 December

2017. The Tribunal, however, has found that Tele Facil did not have such rights under

Mexican law and therefore, no expropriation occurred.

However, the claim raised by Claimant under NAFTA Article 1105 is slightly different.
Claimant does not refer to “rights [...] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues
based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017)” as the
investment that suffered unfair and unequitable treatment. According to Claimant, the
investment that was not granted fair and equitable treatment is Tele Facil. The Parties do

not dispute that Tele Facil is an investment protected by NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

Despite its difference with the expropriation claim as to the specific investment affected
by the measures of Mexico, Claimant basically challenges the same measures as in the
expropriation claim. The alleged unfair and unequitable treatment of Tele Facil results from
the treatment granted in the issuance of the measures that allegedly destroyed
interconnection rights recognized by Resolution 381.*“’ Therefore, the conclusions of the
Tribunal as regards Resolution 381 in the expropriation claim analysis are also relevant to

decide Claimant’s claim under NAFTA Article 1105.

Considering, on the one hand, the Tribunal’s findings that Tele Facil had no
interconnection rights under the August 2013 draft agreement sent by Telmex to Tele Facil
and no rights were created in favor of Tele Facil by Resolution 381, and on the other, that
the claims of Claimant as regards the alleged violation of the obligation of fair and
equitable treatment refer to acts and omissions of Mexico in connection with Resolution
381, the Tribunal could dismiss, without further analysis whatsoever, the claim for

violation of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment**.

However, given the different characterizations and descriptions that Claimant gave to his

investment throughout this arbitration and the fact that the allegations related to the

7 Although Claimant questions additional measures (i.e., two decisions of the Mexican courts), these measures are
substantially related to the IFT’s measures. Through them, the Mexican courts confirmed and validated Decree 77.

8 This sentence originally contained the text “that, even if it had”, right after “the Tribunal’ s findings that Tele Facil
had no interconnection rights under the August 2013 draft agreement sent by Telmex to Tele Facil and.” The remaining
arbitrators consider that including such assumption (arguendo) was unnecessary as it added nothing to the conclusion.
The text was therefore removed.

violation of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment do not refer to “rights [...] to
interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate
(USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017)” or to the rights under the interconnection
agreement as determined by Resolution 381, but to Tele Facil as an investment of Claimant,
the Tribunal considers necessary to determine whether Tele Facil received treatment by
Mexico, other than treatment related to Resolution 381, that could amount to a violation of

NAFTA Article 1105(1).

a. The standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment under NAFTA Article
1105(1)

In this case, Claimant contends that both the IFT and the Mexican courts acted in an unfair
and inequitable manner in connection with his investment (Tele Facil). According to
Claimant, the confirmation criteria requested by the IFT’s Compliance Unit and the Pleno’s
Decree 77 were arbitrary*“? and lacked due process.**° Claimant also adds that Decree 77
was discriminatory.**! Finally, Claimant refers to IFT’s Resolution 127 as a “direct
consequence of the IFT’s arbitrary, secretive and discriminatory scheme to save Telmex

from its deal with Tele Facil” and “derivatively [also in breach of] Article 1105.”*>*

With respect to the Mexican courts, Claimant alleges that the Specialized
Telecommunications Court that decided Tele Facil’s amparo action against Decree 77
acted with gross incompetence due to the fact that it confirmed the decision taken in Decree
77 *°} and that the Appellate Court unjustifiably denied Tele Facil access to justice when

it dismissed Tele Facil’s appeal against the amparo decision regarding Decree 77.***

320. According to the notes of interpretation of NAFTA’s Free Trade Commission, adopted on

31 July 2001:

Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard
of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another
Party.

The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection
and security” do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that
which is required by the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment of aliens.

A determination that there has been a breach of another provision
of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not
establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).

321. In order to define the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law,

Claimant invokes the Waste Management v. Mexico tribunal who stated that:

 

the mini s lard of t of fair and equitable treatment
is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the
claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or
idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to
sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process
leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety—as might
be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial
proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an
administrative process.>>

322. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant in that the Waste Management standard has been widely
accepted and followed by other NAFTA tribunals that have addressed fair and equitable
treatment claims.*°° Moreover, the Tribunal also agrees with Claimant in that “different
types of State misconduct” may fall below the customary international law minimum

standard of treatment.**” Indeed, according to the formulation of the standard in Waste

Management, a claimant can show a breach of the minimum standard of treatment if it
establishes State misconduct that is (i) arbitrary, (ii) grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic;

(iii) discriminatory or; (iv) absent of due process.

The Tribunal notes that the use of language such as “gross,” “manifest,” and “complete
lack” indicates that the threshold for showing a breach of this obligation is particularly

high.
b. The request for Confirmation Criteria and Decree 77
(i) Arbitrariness

With respect to arbitrariness, the International Court of Justice, in the ELSI case, defined
this concept as “something opposed to the rule of law” rather than “something opposed to
a rule of law.”*** This definition has been accepted by at least two NAFTA Parties**? and

prior NAFTA tribunals.*

The implication of the ELS/ standard is that arbitrariness requires more than a showing of
illegality under domestic law. Besides illegality, arbitrariness also demands a showing that

7361 or seeks an “ulterior

the challenged State measure “manifest[ly] lack[s] of reasons
motive.”* Thus, the arbitrariness analysis consists in reviewing the stated purposes of a
certain measure and whether the measure effectively addresses the stated purposes. Other

NAFTA tribunals have approached the arbitrariness analysis in these terms. The Glamis

tribunal, for example, approached arbitrariness by inquiring into the motives behind the

challenged measure and the relationship between the measure and the stated motives.*®

For the arbitrariness analysis, Claimant invited the Tribunal to consider the Bilcon v.
Canada decision.* The Bilcon tribunal found that the Canadian authorities’ decision to
reject the Whites Point project was arbitrary because it “effectively created, without legal
authority or fair notice to Bilcon, a new standard of assessment rather than fully carrying
out the mandate defined by the applicable law”.*°> The Tribunal later insisted that “the
approach of the JRP departed in fundamental ways from the standard of evaluation required
by the laws of Canada”*® and that “[t]he Tribunal’s concern is actually that the rigorous
and comprehensive evaluation defined and prescribed by the laws of Canada was not in

fact carried out.”3°7

For the reasons developed below, the Tribunal concludes that even if it were to apply the
Bilcon tribunal standard, the claim of arbitrariness under NAFTA Article 1105 by Claimant
will fail as the IFT neither created a new standard of assessment, much less departed from

the standard of evaluation required under Mexican law.

Claimant alleges that the confirmation criteria was arbitrary because it was misused to

“allow Telmex to challenge and ultimately reverse critical aspects of Resolution 381, to

36 CL-044, Glamis v. United States (8 June 2009), {| 763 (holding that the M-Opinion was not arbitrary because “it

arbitrary”); {{[ 817-818 (holding that the fact that the SMGB Regulations excluded non-metallic mines from regulation

Tele Facil’s great detriment.”** In other words, Claimant alleges that helping Telmex to

reverse Resolution 381 was the ulterior motive for requesting the criteria confirmation.

Claimant further claims that Decree 77 was arbitrary because it (i) contradicted Resolution
381;°° (ii) was inconsistent with fundamental norms of Mexican telecom law and
policy;*” (iii) leads to truly absurd results wholly inconsistent with recent Mexican

telecommunications reforms;*”! and (iv) blatantly violated Mexican administrative law.*”?

The Tribunal has already found that the IFT did have authority under Mexican law to
decide Telmex’s alleged dispute on rates, that the IFT dismissed Telmex’s alleged dispute
on the rates on grounds of admissibility and that Resolution 381 could not grant rights on
specific rates to Tele Facil. The Tribunal also found that the language of Resolution 381
could not be interpreted as proposed by Tele Facil before the IFT and the Mexican courts

and by Claimant in this arbitration.

The Parties do not dispute that Mexican law allows requests for confirmation criteria and
that the IFT has the right to issue confirmation criteria. Claimant challenges, however, the
form and purpose of the confirmation criteria and the issuance of Decree 77 in response to

the request for confirmation criteria.

After the issuance of Resolution 381, Telmex and Tele Facil debated as to the
interconnection agreement that had to be executed. Tele Facil referred to the draft
agreement originally submitted by Telmex on 26 August 2013 because that was one of the
agreements referred to in Resolution 381.°*”* Telmex in turn considered that an agreement

on the rates had to be reached as a result of the change in legislation, particularly the

characterization of Telmex as a preponderant agent and the subsequent limitation on the

interconnection rates applicable by Telmex.

333. The sequence of events and submissions resulting in Decree 77 is stated in the IFT’s Legal

Unit request for Confirmation of Criteria as follows:

By letter received by this Institute on December 10, 2014,
Telmex/Telnor exhibited each of the interconnection agreements to
be executed between Telmex, Telnor and Tele Facil, with the
purpose for Tele Facil to execute the interconnection agreements
referred to in the Institute. It should be noted that these agreements
present changes with respect to the main body and exhibits of the
proposed agreements that were presented by Telmex/Telnor in the
disagreement procedure that resulted in the Resolution.

In its case, Tele Facil submitted in writing before the Plenary
session of this Institute on December 19, 2014, documentation
arguing that on December 9, 2014 Telmex/Telnor convened a
meeting to be held on the same day for the execution of the
interconnection agreements, not recognizing the terms and
conditions of the Resolution. Based on the foregoing, Tele Facil
reported that on December 16, 2014, it presented to Telmex/Telnor
a letter with the local interconnection agreement and appendices
contained in the file of the proceedings of disagreement.

By application recorded on January 28, 2015, Tele Facil presented
to this Compliance Unit and against Telmex/Telnor, a complaint for
failure to comply with the Resolution, claiming that interconnection
has not been implemented and requesting that the actions necessary
to ensure that Telmex/Telnor comply with the Resolution, and that

they proceed with the immediate execution of the respective

agreements.>”*

334. In its request for confirmation of criteria of 10 December 2014, Telmex referred to Tele
Facil’s delay in reverting on the draft agreement presented by Telmex on 26 August 2013;
to the amendments in the law after the draft was sent, to the impossibility of maintaining
the original rates considering the changes in the law; and concluded that Telmex:

[...] expressly stated that they did not agree with the rates contained
in the agreement, as had been told to Tele Facil’s personnel in the

374 €.040, Confirmation of Criteria submitted by the Compliance Unit to the Legal Unit of the IFT (10 February 2015).

97

last meeting held in Telmex and Telnor's offices, which was
dismissed with further reasoning by the IFT and without considering
the new legal framework that is widely known by the IFT, which
makes the resolution that was issued for the interconnection
disagreement initiated by Tele Facil to be contrary to law.*”°

335. Telmex requested the IFT to confirm Telmex’s criteria:

[...] in the sense that the agreement that they must execute with Tele
Facil must reflect the terms and conditions contained in the
currently effective legal framework.

The above, in the understanding that the IFT may not partially
resolve, since the terms and conditions of the draft agreement sent
by my principals in 2013 are contrary to the currently effective legal
framework because the interconnection agreement that the parties
should execute must contain the interconnection rates that Telmex
and Telnor must pay for termination of their traffic in Tele Facil, as
well as the origination and transit rate that Tele Facil must pay
Telmex and Telnor for these concepts for the term of January I to
December 31, 2015.56

336. Tele Facil, in turn, in its submission of 25 January 2015 rejected Telmex’s assertion that
there was no agreement on the rates, stressed that the parties agreed on all the terms and
conditions of the interconnection agreement, except for the indirect interconnection and

portability charges, and after quoting Resolution 381 concluded that:

[...] there was no dispute concerning the interconnection tariffs and
that such terms and conditions should be part of the interconnection
agreement that the Institute has ordered the execution of in the
Interconnection Resolution.

Consequently, considering that the above-mentioned
Interconnection Resolution was notified to Tele Facil on December
3, 2014 and to Telmex/Telnor on December 4, 2014, we can see that
the legal deadline of 10 (ten) working days has elapsed without, on

such date, the Resolution terms and conditions being complied
with.”

In the relevant part of its submission regarding the alleged agreement on the rates, Tele
Facil requested the IFT to conduct a verification visit to Telmex to confirm that
interconnection with Tele Facil’s network had not been implemented in accordance with
the indirect interconnection requested to NEXTEL and the method decided by the Pleno;
and to undertake the actions necessary for Telmex to comply with Resolution 381, that is

to say:

[to] immediately sign the agreements that my client hereby provides
once again, duly signed and the terms of which are in accordance
with the Interconnection Resolution (Annex 15) and to implement
the indirect interconnection under the terms requested by Tele Facil
(Annex 11).°78

From the evidence on the record it is clear to the Tribunal that Tele Facil and Telmex had
a dispute as to whether there was an agreement on the interconnection rates. Tele Facil held
that both parties had reached an agreement contained in the draft interconnection
agreement submitted by Telmex to Tele Facil in 2013. According to Tele Facil, the
existence of such agreement was confirmed by Resolution 381 and therefore, the IFT
should order Telmex to sign it. Telmex’s position was that no such agreement existed
because as a result of the changes in the law, the declaration of Telmex as a preponderant
agent and the new provisions on interconnection rates, it would be illegal for Telmex to

charge the rates contained in the draft agreement.

The Compliance Unit’s question before the Pleno of the IFT was whether it had the
authority to decide such dispute and particularly, whether it could order Telmex to sign the
draft agreement submitted by Tele Facil — initially in 2014 and again with the January
2015 submission — which Tele Facil claimed was the valid and binding agreement between

the parties and whether Resolution 381 could be interpreted as an order for Telmex to sign

Unit of the IFT (28 January 2015), p. 5.

Unit of the IFT (28 January 2015), p. 8.

such draft. This was not a dispute on the rates but on whether Telmex and Tele Facil had
an agreement on the rates and if so, whether the IFT had the authority to decide that there

was an agreement and order Telmex to sign such agreement.

340. The text of the criteria on which confirmation is being sought by the Compliance Unit

provides as follows:

In accordance with the provisions of articles 52 and 53, section VI
of the Organic Statute of this Institute, I submit this to see if the
Compliance Unit, based on the complaint of Tele Facil, can require
Telmex/Telnor compliance with the Resolution, in the terms
requested by the complainant, that is, to require said
concessionaires both to comply with the interconnection of their
networks and to execute the respective interconnection agreement,
within the terms contained in the Resolution.

Therefore, this Legal Unit is requested to confirm the legal criterion
consisting in the authority of the Institute's Plenary to require
concessionaires that submitted a disagreement of interconnection to
the Institute, includes not only the interconnection but also the
execution of the corresponding agreement, in the form and terms
determined in the resolution of disputes submitted for the Institute’s
consideration.>”

341. Decree 77, issued in response to the request for Confirmation Criteria, rejects both Tele
Facil’s request to order Telmex to sign the 2013 draft agreement and Telmex’s request to
declare that the rates contained in said draft were contrary to the legal provisions in effect
as regards interconnection rates. The reasoning of the IFT in Decree 77 is simple and
straightforward: the FTBL grants the IFT the authority to decide on disputes on
interconnection rates submitted to it; the only disputes submitted were indirect
interconnection and portability charges; the IFT cannot decide non-disputed terms and
therefore the IFT cannot decide which interconnection agreement the parties must sign nor

whether the parties had a valid agreement on the interconnection rates.

pp. 2-3.

100

342.

343.

344.

The IFT concludes by indicating in Decree 77 that the First operative part of Resolution
381:

[...] is an order issued by the authority that must be complied with
by Tele Facil and Telmex/Telnor, in the understanding that said
document must invariably consider the indirect interconnection and
omit any reference to portability costs, the only points over which
the Plenary of the IFT referred to and regarding which it has the
power to obligate the parties involved.

Regarding the other terms and conditions of the interconnection
agreement that the parties must execute, taking into consideration
that this collegiate body did not address the provisions contained in
the draft agreement included in the file as it was not a matter of
disagreement and therefore it was not a matter of its competence, it
is clarified that the rights of the parties regarding the aspects that
were not a subject matter of the Interconnection Resolution remain
untouched. The above, since the will of the parties is what governs
the execution of an interconnection agreement.*®°

The evidence of the record does not support Claimant’s conspiracy theory to favor Telmex
or a plot to deprive Tele Facil from the rights that it allegedly had under Resolution 381.
As already concluded by the Tribunal, Tele Facil opted for an interpretation of Resolution
381 that would result in the IFT exceeding its powers. Under this interpretation, Tele Facil
requested the IFT to enforce Resolution 381 as if it had recognized that there was a valid
agreement on the rates and that Resolution 381 had ordered Telmex to execute the 2013
draft agreement submitted by Tele Facil to the IFT within the disagreement proceedings.
Telmex in turn had a different interpretation and requested confirmation that there was no
agreement on the rates and that the rates purportedly agreed with Tele Facil were illegal.
The IFT clarified Resolution 381 thorough Decree 77 by indicating that the IFT had only
decided on the disputes submitted to it — indirect interconnection and portability — and that

the other terms with respect to which no dispute was submitted were for the parties to agree.

The Tribunal finds no arbitrariness in the request for Confirmation Criteria or in Decree

77. A legitimate doubt arose as to the interpretation of Resolution 381 given the specific

380 €.051, Decree 77 (8 April 2015), p. 12.

101

345.

346.

and limited powers and authorities of the IFT.**! The doubt arose as a result of Tele Facil’s
request for the IFT to order Telmex to sign a specific interconnection agreement that
Telmex disavowed. Decree 77 was issued within two months following the request for
confirmation criteria and confirmed what was clear in the FTBL: that the IFT could not,
without exceeding its powers, decide on disputes that were not proven and order Telmex
to sign a specific interconnection agreement. It could only order Telmex and Tele Facil to
sign an agreement providing for indirect interconnection and not providing for portability.

The other terms and conditions could not be the subject matter of a decision.

The conspiracy theories submitted by Claimant and based on allegations such as (i) the
instructions purportedly given in mid-January 2015 by the IFT’s Chairman, Mr. Gabriel
Contreras to Mr. Sanchez Henkel, head of the IFT’s Compliance Unit, not to enforce
Resolution 381, (ii) that Decree 77 only considered the Compliance Unit’s arguments, and
(iii) that Telmex contacted the IFT before filing its own confirmation criteria at the time
the Compliance Unit filed its request, are mere speculations and the evidence submitted in
no way supports the serious accusation that the IFT and Telmex colluded to avoid

enforcement of Resolution 381.

The IFT acted within its powers and authority in interpreting Resolution 381 and decided
through Decree 77 the scope and extent of Resolution 381 given the doubts raised as a

result of the different interpretations of Tele Facil and Telmex. The decision itself simply

38! The two remaining arbitrators consider that, in addition to the confusion arising because of the powers of IFT, it
was also unclear which agreement had to be signed by the parties: (i) Resolution 381 refers to the 2" version of the
agreement (which has no rate); (ii) Tele Facil alleges that it should have been comprised by the body of the 2" version
of the agreement and the rates/annexes from the 1‘ version. Mr. Canchola (who wrote the request for confirmation

criteria) provides good testimony on thi:

  

sue at page 539 of the transcript:

[...] And I should clarify here that, in an incredible act that I never had seen in my time at IFT or at
COFETEL, I'd never seen a petition such as this situation in which there was apparently a meeting
of the minds that did not exist as such. I had never seen that in all my time at the Institute, neither
when I was in litigation or in supervision, where on the one hand one says there is an agreement,
and the other says not all the conditions are there, so that for me was a problem because in order
to be able to enforce the Agreement in the interconnection, I needed to know what the Agreement
was. And given that distinct position of each of the two parties, in the use of my authority, I asked
the legal office to render an interpretation for us, which could then be submitted to the Plenary.”

stresses both the limitations of the powers of the IFT and the fact that no dispute on the

rates was ever submitted to the IFT.

Claimant alleges that the decision contained in Decree 77 will generate a “never ending

story”382

that will allow one of the parties to stretch negotiations with the intention of
preventing other carriers from entering and competing in the market. The Tribunal
disagrees. Under FTL Article 42, the IFT can only rule on disputed terms submitted to it.
This means that the IFT has no authority to alter the terms on which the parties have already
reached an agreement or to decide on terms not agreed upon, but not submitted to the
IFT.**? Terms that are not submitted to the IFT, under Article 42, are not necessarily agreed

terms.

Finally, the fact that Decree 77 was not a unanimous decision has no relevance whatsoever
for the purposes of showing arbitrariness. It is undisputed that under Mexican law, a

majority decision of the IFT’s Pleno is as valid and binding as a unanimous one.

The Tribunal concludes that Claimant’s alleged violations of the obligations of fair and
equitable treatment to Tele Facil refer to measures affecting Resolution 381, which granted
no rights to Tele Facil, that there is no evidence supporting that either the request for

confirmation criteria or Decree 77 were arbitrary.

(ii) Grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic

The IFT acted within its powers and authority under Mexican law and nothing in the record

suggests that its actions were grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic.
(iii) Discrimination

The Parties invoke the standard of the tribunal in Waste Management according to which

“the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct

For the sake of clarity, the remaining arbitrators consider useful to add that recourse to civil courts prevents the

“never-ending story” from occurring. In the opinion of such arbitrators, recourse to such courts reinforces that the IFT
is not the competent authority for determining the existence of an agreement.

and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice.”**+ Subsequent NAFTA tribunals
have found, under this standard, that discrimination exists if the State willfully targets the

investor.>%

To identify whether the State willfully targeted the investor, Tribunals have looked into
whether there is a legitimate justification for such targeting. In Cargill, for example,
respondent alleged that claimant’s targeting was based on “legitimate countermeasures

under international law.”3%°

Claimant did not even make a prima facie case that the request for confirmation criteria or
Decree 77 were discriminatory. Claimant’s simply stated that Decree 77 singled out his
investment (i.e., Tele Facil) supposedly because the IFT treated the company in an

unprecedented manner.

However, Claimant was unable to point at a case in which an investor or an investment had
been treated differently in like or comparable circumstances or that there was a precedent
in the treatment of an investment of an investor that was disregarded by the IFT. Claimant
cited a number of cases in an attempt to show a difference in treatment. However, none of
such cases evidences that the telecommunication carriers involved had been in the same

position of Tele Facil. Claimant itself admitted that this case was unique.

The uniqueness of this case lies in that, as admitted by Claimant and sustained by the IFT,
generally the parties to an interconnection agreement submit to the IFT only the disputed
terms of the interconnection agreement after having agreed on all other terms. In this case,
however, Tele Facil submitted to the IFT a dispute on indirect interconnection and

portability charges, without carrying out a real negotiation before with Telmex. As the IFT

explained, the dispute resolution proceedings under Article 42 were initiated without the

parties having agreed on all the interconnection terms.

This case was unique and therefore there was no precedent. The uniqueness of the case was
the result of Tele Facil having submitted a dispute on only two issues (indirect
interconnection and portability) when it knew or should have known either that there was
no agreement on the other terms and conditions of the interconnection agreement or that
there was a substantial risk of Telmex challenging the existence of such agreement. After
unjustifiably delaying for around 10 months a response to Telmex’s proposed draft
interconnection agreement, immediately after the amendments in the law affecting the
ability of Telmex to charge the rates contained in the draft, Tele Facil rushed to provide
comments on the draft and without waiting for a response to such comments, it submitted
the dispute to the IFT. If the IFT assumed that all the other terms and conditions had been
agreed upon, as it had been generally the case, this was the result of Tele Facil’s own acts
and assumption of the risk that it had a valid and finalized agreement with Telmex, except
for the two issues submitted to the IFT. The unprecedent situation was created by Tele

Facil’s conduct and the risks it decided to assume to bet for a business opportunity.

Claimant therefore did not prove that either the request for confirmation criteria or Decree
77 were discriminatory, much less that Tele Facil was treated unfairly or inequitably with
respect to measures other than the ones affecting a resolution — Resolution 381 — under

which he has no rights.

(iv) Due process

Lack of due process may occur in the context of judicial and administrative proceedings.**”

However, the standard is different in each scenario. The lack of due process has to lead: (i)

387 CL-071, Waste Management v. Mexico (30 April 2004), {[ 98 (stating that “the minimum standard of treatment of
fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct [...] involv[ing] a lack of due process leading to an outcome which
offends judicial propriety — as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or
complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.”). (Emphasis added).

105

359.

360.

361.

“to an outcome which offends judicial propriety [...] in judicial proceedings” or “to [...] a

complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.”?**

In the field of administrative proceedings, the standard is a “a complete lack of
transparency and candour in an administrative process.”**? On this point, few decisions
have been on the point. The Meralclad tribunal although did not expressly examine a lack
of due process claim, considered that Mexico had breached its fair and equitable treatment
obligation in accordance with NAFTA because it failed to ensure a “transparent and
predictable framework” to the investor regarding a rule applicable to the requirement or

not of a municipal construction permit.*”°

According to the Metalclad tribunal, “transparency” is “prominent” under NAFTA. Thus,
if State authorities “become aware of any scope for misunderstanding or confusion [in
connection with all legal requirements for the purposes of initiating, completing and
successfully operating an investment] it is their duty to ensure that the correct position is
promptly determined and clearly stated”.*°! In the Metalclad tribunal’s finding, it was
central the fact that for a long time the investor relied on federal government officials’
reiterative representations that a municipal construction permit was unnecessary to build a
hazardous waste landfill but later the municipality required such permit and did not grant

it on grounds unrelated to the physical construction.*””

The TECO v. Guatemala tribunal, in applying a similar minimum standard of treatment
provision in CAFTA-DR, stated that “[i]n assessing whether there has been [...] a breach
of due process, it is relevant that the Guatemalan administration entirely failed to provide

reasons for its decisions or disregarded its own rules.”**? For this Tribunal, the holding in

TECO is relevant insofar as a lack of due process can be established only if the
administration has entirely disregarded the procedural rules that it must follow within a

particular process.

Claimant alleges that the IFT Compliance Unit’s request “was conducted for months in
secrecy, without involving Tele Facil or affording the company any due process.”
Claimant further alleges that “[a]pplying the unilateral ‘confirmation of criteria’ process to
resolve a bilateral interconnection dispute is fundamentally unfair and denies the absent

party the procedural protections guaranteed under Mexican law.”*?>

As stated previously, in administrative proceedings Claimant must prove a complete lack
of transparency and candour to establish a breach of Respondent’s fair and equitable

obligation for lack of due process.

Claimant’s case draws from the basis that there was a dispute pending before the IFT and
therefore the IFT had to apply the disagreement proceedings set forth in FTL Article 42
instead of the confirmation of criteria. According to Claimant there was a “direct conflict
between two providers’ interests.”*°° That is contradictory not only with the findings of the
Tribunal in this case but also with Claimant’s own narrative. There was no dispute on the
rates. The conflict between Tele Facil and Telmex was a conflict as to whether they had
entered into a valid and binding agreement on the rates. The IFT did not have the power or
the authority to decide such conflict and therefore Resolution 381 could not be interpreted
as deciding on rates or as accepting that all the terms and conditions in the draft agreement
submitted by Tele Facil had been agreed upon. The IFT could only decide on the issues

submitted by Tele Facil: indirect interconnection and portability charges.

The disputes on the rates before the IFT were: the one initially submitted by Telmex and
dismissed by the IFT in Resolution 381 on grounds of admissibility and the one submitted

by Telmex and resolved by the IFT with Resolution 127. Consequently, Claimant cannot

validly allege a violation of due process merely because he considers that the IFT should
have followed disagreement proceedings to resolve a dispute that Claimant himself alleges
that at the time did not exist, instead of the corresponding proceedings for interpreting a
resolution (i.e., Resolution 381). The confirmation criteria proceedings were carried out
under the applicable rules. In fact, Claimant does not question that the IFT properly
followed such applicable rules and the legal experts explained that these rules do not
provide, as do the rules governing the disagreement proceedings, for a specific opportunity
to be heard. In any event, the record also evidences that Tele Facil did have the opportunity
to present its case to the IFT’s Pleno session of 5 March 2015, before Decree 77 was

issued.>°”

The Tribunal therefore finds, first, that Claimant is not claiming a violation of the fair and
equitable treatment obligation in connection with investments other than the ones allegedly
arising from Resolution 381 and second, that in the request for confirmation criteria the

IFT did not violate Tele Facil’s right to due process.

As regards Decree 77, Claimant complains that it “compounded the IFT’s complete denial
of due process to Tele Facil.”*°* Claimant alleges that through Decree 77, the IFT’s Pleno
erred in three ways: (i) condoning and perpetuating all of the process errors committed by
the Legal Unit;*” (ii) disingenuously representing that Tele Facil’s views had been taken
into consideration;*” (iv) not accounting for Tele Facil’s views.*°! None of these premises

are correct.

First, as stated previously, the confirmation criteria proceedings were conducted in
accordance with the applicable law.*°? Neither the Compliance Unit nor the Legal Unit or

the Pleno erred in applying the corresponding rules. The rules that Claimant claims as

applicable correspond to the ones that the IFT must follow to decide a dispute, which was

not the case.

Second, in Decree 77, the Pleno did not represent that Tele Facil’s views had been taken

into consideration. Claimant’s allegation is based on the following text of Decree 77:

In order to address the referred requests and confirmations of
criteria and with the purpose of effectively enforcing the
Interconnection Resolution [381], it is necessary for the IFT
Plenary to analyze said resolution in order to determine its scope
through the issuance of this Decree.*°

Nothing in this passage supports Claimant’s claim. It merely states that the Pleno reviewed
the text of Resolution 381 in order to determine its scope and extent. There is no

representation regarding Tele Facil.

Third and last, Claimant complains that Tele Facil views were not considered. The claim
is not supported by the evidence. Tele Facil requested enforcement of Resolution 381 and
explained its interpretation as to the scope and extent of the resolution starting from the
premise that there was an agreement on the rates. Telmex had a completely different
interpretation, considered that there was no such agreement and requested the IFT to decide
that the alleged agreement on the rates claimed by Tele Facil was illegal. In Decree 77, the
IFT summarizes the issues at stake, the requests from both parties and decides, correctly,
that it only has authority to decide on disputed terms and conditions that the network
carriers submit for its decision but not on disputed issues not submitted to the IFT nor on

whether the parties have agreed or not on certain terms and conditions.

The Tribunal finds that there is no allegation of the violation of due process to Tele Facil
in connection with rights other that the ones allegedly conferred by Resolution 381 and

that, in any event, due process was not violated in the issuance of Decree 77.

Moreover, Claimant contends that “Resolution 127 is a direct consequence of the IFT’s

arbitrary, secretive and discriminatory scheme to save Telmex from its deal with Tele Facil.

403 Statement of Claim (7 November 2017), | 572 (citing Decree 77).

109

376.

Therefore, derivatively, it also breaches Article 1105.”4°* However, having concluded that
neither the request for confirmation criteria nor Decree 77 breached NAFTA Article 1105,

Resolution 127 cannot “derivatively” breach NAFTA Article 1105.
c. The decisions of the Mexican courts

Under the denial of justice claim, Claimant challenges two decisions of the Mexican courts.
The first decision is the one issued by the First District Court for Administrative Matters,
specialized in Economic Competition, Broadcasting and Telecommunications on 22
January 2016, which denied Tele Facil’s amparo action challenging the constitutionality
of Decree 77.4” The second decision is the Circuit Court’s decision of 21 April 2016 that
dismissed Tele Facil’s appeal, with prejudice, and without addressing the substance of Tele

Facil’s claim*”®.

Again, both decisions allegedly affect the rights that Claimant considers were conferred by
Resolution 381 and the Tribunal has already concluded that Tele Facil had no such rights
under Mexican law. In any event, the Tribunal finds no denial of justice for the reasons

explained below.

As regards the First District Court’s Decision of 22 January 2016 that decided on the
amparo against Decree 77, the Tribunal finds that the criticisms of Claimant to this decision
are not sufficient to establish a breach of NAFTA Article 1105. Claimant disagrees with
the reasoning of the Court and with the fact that the Court dismissed Tele Facil’s arguments
and criticizes, with no evidence or support, what it perceives as a lack of preparation of the
Mexican courts to deal with telecommunications matters. But a mere disagreement with
the reasoning does not amount to a lack of reasoning nor does it allow this Tribunal to
consider that the Court administered justice in a seriously inadequate way or that it clearly

and maliciously misapplied the law.

405 Statement of Claim (7 November 2017), 615.
406 Statement of Claim (7 November 2017), { 629.

110

377. It is not for this Tribunal to second-guess the decisions made by domestic courts or to act
as a court of appeals. Claimant’s allegations do not evidence a serious flaw or malice in

the application of the law but simply a disagreement on the reasoning.

378. With respect to the Circuit Court’s decision of 21 April 2016 dismissing Tele Facil’s
appeal, the evidence before this Tribunal overwhelmingly proves that Tele Facil acted
imprudently, assumed risks and disregarded the most basic diligence in the filing of the

appeal, and now attempts to avoid the consequences of its own acts.

379. The Parties do not dispute that the ten-day term to file the appeal expired at midnight on
11 February 2016. Mr. Bello, a witness in this proceedings and counsel for Tele Facil at
the time, explained that on 11 February 2016, his colleague Diana Margarita Mayorga Rea,
“left at 11:00 pm to submit the appeal to the specialized Court of Appeals” and due to
“terrible traffic on the road [she] arrived later than expected at the courthouse, but still on
time [...] at 11:58 [pm].”4°’. The same witness subsequently indicated that “the security
officer prevented my attorney from entering and asked her to wait until they contacted the
person in charge of the Office of Correspondence” who later appeared and told her “that
he would not receive any other documents because it was already past midnight.”4°*

Claimant alleges that “[i]n an unprecedented event, the courthouse security guard denied

counsel’s access to the court’s filing office.”

380. Had Tele Facil acted with a minimum degree of diligence in the appeal of a decision related
to Decree 77 that allegedly destroyed the value of its investments, it would have not waited

until the eleventh hour to file the appeal and there would not have been a debate on the

decision of the Circuit Court’s not to admit the appeal for being extemporaneous.*!°

41© The remaining arbitrators consider useful to add that counsel for Tele Facil not only appeared at the court at 11:58
p.m. on the last date of the term for filing, that is, two minutes before the deadline, but also failed to file at 9:00 a.m.
the next day as allowed and required by Mexican jurisprudence. In other words, Tele Facil not only put itself at risk
by attempting to file at the eleventh hour, but also through its own mistakes and fault, failed to file the next day after
the term expired all of which caused the filing to be extemporaneous.

Claimant has two criticisms on the decision not to admit the appeal. First that the Chief
Justice of the Circuit Court admitted the appeal on 9 March 2016 but, despite this prior
decision, on 21 April 2016, “the Circuit Court, sitting as a panel of three judges, dismissed

yal

Tele Facil’s appeal The second criticism is that the Circuit Court’s dismissal was

“without any reasonable justification.”*!?

As to the first criticism, it is undisputed that under Mexican law, the decision of 9 March
2016 issued by one judge was not a final decision and therefore could eventually change if
the panel of three judges were to disagree with the first decision. Claimant therefore cannot

hold to the first and not final decision to claim that there was a denial of justice.

The second criticism is based on an examination by Claimant of the reasoning of the Circuit
Court to dismiss the appeal and alleges that such facts and norms could have been
interpreted differently.*!* Again, a mere disagreement with the reasoning of the court does

not amount to a denial of justice.
The Tribunal therefore finds that Tele Facil was not denied justice.
For all the above stated reasons, the Tribunal does not find that Respondent breached its

obligation of fair and equitable treatment under NAFTA Article 1105.

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS
389. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how

415 Respondent’s Statement of Costs (15 January 2020), p. 2.

391.

392.

and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

Article 40(1) and (2) of the Arbitration Rules provide that:

Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in
principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral
tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it
determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account
the circumstances of the case.

With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance
referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking
into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine
which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable.

These provisions give the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration. Article
61(2) of the ICSID Convention establishes that “the Tribunal [...] shall decide how and by
whom [the arbitration costs] shall be paid”. Article 40(1) of the Arbitration Rules states
that although “the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party
[...] the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it
determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case” and Article 40(2), which refers to the reasonable costs for legal representation and
assistance of the successful party claimed during the arbitral proceedings — as stated in
Article 38(e) — reiterates that the tribunal “taking into account the circumstances of the
case” is “free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs

between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.”

In the present case, the arbitrators’ fees and expenses and ICSID’s administrative fees and

direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses 691,058.65

ICSID’s administrative fees 116,000.00

396.

Direct expenses 141,316.38
Total 948,375.03

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.*!®

As a result, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 474,187.51.

Claimant has failed in all his claims before this Tribunal and even though it is true that
Respondent failed in its jurisdictional objection, the changes and delays in the jurisdictional
objections and the need to submit additional jurisdictional objections resulted from the late
information submitted by Mr. Blanco as to his bankruptcy, his subsequent withdrawal from

the case and the new position of Mr. Nelson as sole Claimant.

Accordingly, the Tribunal, in exercise of its discretion, has decided that Claimant should
(a) bear the arbitrators’ fees and expenses and ICSID’s administrative fees and direct
expenses, for a total amount of (USD 948,375.03); (b) bear 80% of the costs of Respondent
in the amount of USD 1,580,011.49;4!7 and (c) bear his own costs.

AWARD

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(1) Denies Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction based on NAFTA Article 1117;

(2) Denies Claimant’s claim of unlawful expropriation based on NAFTA Article 1110;

(3) Denies Claimant’s claim of unfair and inequitable treatment based on NAFTA

Article 1105;

416 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

417 Respondent’ s co:

 

s, excluding the item for costs of the proceeding (USD 550,000), amount to USD 1,975,014.36.

80% of this amout is USD 1,580,011.49.

115

(4) Determines Claimant to pay Respondent the amount of USD 2,054,1994'® for

arbitration costs.

418 This amount is the result of adding 80% of Respondent’s costs (USD 1,580,011.49) plus the costs of the arbitration
that were advanced by Respondent (USD 474,187.51).
